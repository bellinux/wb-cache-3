Upon pilot command, one of the open shackles latches to the <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> to attach the towline connected thereto, and a second command signal deploys the parachute. Suitable break-away straps secure the towlines to the aircraft surface until the parachute is deployed and the resulting force on the towline attached to the parachute overcomes the straps and permits the towline to extend to the point of attachment to exert sufficient drag on the spinning aircraft to permit the pilot to regain control of the aircraft.

In characteristic 0 we define a Fitting ideal in the more general case of a map of graded free modules over a Z/ 2 -graded skew-commutative algebra and prove corresponding theorems about the annihilator; for example, the Fitting ideal and the annihilator of the cokernel are equal in the generic case. Our results generalize the classical Fitting Lemma in the commutative case and extend a key result of Green (1999) in the exterior algebra case. They depend on the Berele-Regev theory of representations of general linear Lie superalgebras. In the purely even and purely odd cases we also offer a standard basis approach to the module coker φ when φ is a generic matrix...|$|R

40|$|We present high {{resolution}} (0. 11 "× 0. 06 ") 3 mm ALMA {{observations of the}} highly inclined transition disk around the star T Cha. Our continuum image reveals multiple dust structures: an inner disk, a spatially resolved dust gap, and an outer <b>ring.</b> When <b>fitting</b> sky-brightness models to the real component of the 3 mm visibilities, we infer that the inner emission is compact (< 1 au in radius), the gap width is between 18 - 28 au, and the emission from the outer ring peaks at ∼ 36 au. We compare our ALMA image with previously published 1. 6 μm VLT/SPHERE imagery. This comparison reveals that {{the location of the}} outer ring is wavelength dependent. More specifically, the peak emission of the 3 mm ring is at a larger radial distance than that of the 1. 6 μm ring, suggesting that millimeter-sized grains in the outer disk are located further away from the central star than micron-sized grains. We discuss different scenarios to explain our findings, including dead zones, star-driven photoevaporation, and planet-disk interactions. We find that the most likely origin of the dust gap is from an embedded planet, and estimate [...] - for a single planet scenario [...] - that T Cha's gap is carved by a 1. 2 M_jup planet.

40|$|AbstractCurcumin was {{complexed}} with β-CD using co-precipitation, freeze-drying and {{solvent evaporation}} methods. Co-precipitation enabled complex formation, {{as indicated by}} the FT-IR and FT-Raman techniques via the shifts in the peaks that were assigned to the aromatic rings of curcumin. In addition, photoacoustic spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, with the disappearance of the band related to aromatic <b>rings,</b> by Gaussian <b>fitting,</b> and modifications in the spectral lines, respectively, also suggested complex formation. The possible complexation had an efficiency of 74 % and increased the solubility of the pure colourant 31 -fold. Curcumin–β-CD complex exhibited a sunlight stability 18 % higher than the pure colourant. This material was stable to pH variations and storage at − 15 and 4 °C.

40|$|As {{introduced}} at ADASSI, a Fabry-Perot analysis package for IRAF is currently under {{development as a}} joint effort of ourselves and Frank Valdes of the IRAF group. Although additional portions of the package were also implemented, we report primarily {{on the development of}} a robust <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> task, useful for fitting the calibration rings obtained in Fabry-Perot observations. The general equation of an ellipse is fit to the shape of the rings, providing information on ring center, ellipticity, and position angle. Such parameters provide valuable information on the wavelength response of the etalon and the geometric stability of the system. Appropriate statistical weighting is applied to the pixels to account for increasing numbers with radius, the Lorentzian cross-section, and uneven illumination. The major problems of incomplete, non-uniform, and multiple rings are addressed with the final task capable of fitting rings regardless of center, cross-section, or completion. The task requires only minimal user intervention, allowing large numbers of rings to be fit in an extremely automated manner...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} 21 cm line {{observations}} of atomic hydrogen allows detailed {{insight into the}} kinematics of spiral galaxies. We use sensitive high-resolution Very Large Array data from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) to search for radial gas flows primarily in the outer parts (up to 3 × r 25) of 10 nearby spiral galaxies. Inflows are expected to replenish the gas reservoir and fuel star formation {{under the assumption that}} galaxies evolve approximately in steady state. We carry out a detailed investigation of existing tilted <b>ring</b> <b>fitting</b> schemes and discover systematics that can hamper their ability to detect signatures of radial flows. We develop a new Fourier decomposition scheme that fits for rotational and radial velocities and simultaneously determines position angle and inclination as a function of radius. Using synthetic velocity fields we show that our novel fitting scheme is less prone to such systematic errors and that it is well suited to detect radial inflows in discs. We apply our fitting scheme to 10 THINGS galaxies and find clear indications of, at least partly previously unidentified, radial gas flows, in particular for NGC 2403 and NGC 3198 and to a lesser degree for NGC 7331, NGC 2903 and NGC 6946. The mass flow rates are of the same order but usually larger than the star formation rates. At least for these galaxies a scenario in which continuous mass accretion feeds star formation seems plausible. The other galaxies show a more complicated picture with either no clear inflow, outward motions or complex kinematic signatures...|$|E
40|$|We use new deep 21 cm HI {{observations}} of NGC 4559 in the Westerbork Hydrogen Accretion in LOcal GAlaxies (HALOGAS) survey {{to investigate the}} properties of extra-planar gas associated with this moderately inclined galaxy building upon a previous study by Barbieri et al. (2005). We use the Tilted <b>Ring</b> <b>Fitting</b> Code (TiRiFiC) to construct high-resolution simulated data cubes to match the HI observations. We find that the data cannot be adequately reproduced without a thick disk component of scale height ˜ 2 kpc, characterized by a negative vertical gradient in its rotation velocity (lag), suggesting {{the presence of a}} non-trivial amount of extra-planar gas. The values of lag in the approaching and receding halves of the galaxy were fit independently and are - 13 ± 5 and - 7 ± 3 km s- 1 kpc- 1, respectively. We quantify the amount of extra-planar gas using the HI line profile in the data cube, then extract that gas from each HI line profile. We find that of the ˜ 4. 5 × 109 M⊙ total HI mass, ˜ 4. 0 × 108 M⊙ of that HI is {{not a part of the}} traditionally rotating disk, and is likely extra-planar. The spatial extent of the extra-planar gas is coincident upon the star-forming disk of the galaxy and is likely of galactic fountain mechanism origin. We use ancillary Hα imaging to estimate the star formation properties in quadrants of the galaxy, finding remarkably uniform star formation rates. An emission feature located in the kinematically 'forbidden' region of the position-velocity diagram along the major axis is found to contain ˜ 1. 4 × 106 M⊙ of HI. We explore the possible origins of this counter-rotating feature and its potential connection to a large nearby HI hole, which would require ˜ 107 M⊙ to fill...|$|E
40|$|How {{cellular}} organelles assemble is {{a fundamental}} question in biology. The centriole organelle organizes around a nine-fold symmetrical cartwheel structure typically ∼ 100 [*]nm high comprising a stack of rings that each accommodates nine homodimers of SAS- 6 proteins. Whether nine-fold symmetrical ring-like assemblies of SAS- 6 proteins harbour more peripheral cartwheel elements is unclear. Furthermore, the mechanisms governing ring stacking are not known. Here we develop a cell-free reconstitution system for core cartwheel assembly. Using cryo-electron tomography, we uncover that the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii proteins CrSAS- 6 and Bld 10 p together drive assembly of the core cartwheel. Moreover, we discover that CrSAS- 6 possesses autonomous properties that ensure self-organized <b>ring</b> stacking. Mathematical <b>fitting</b> of reconstituted cartwheel height distribution suggests a mechanism whereby preferential addition of pairs of SAS- 6 rings governs cartwheel growth. In conclusion, we have developed a cell-free reconstitution system that reveals fundamental assembly principles {{at the root of}} centriole biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the effects of changing spatial aspects of attention during oculomotor tracking. Human subjects were instructed to make a discrimination on either the small (0. 8 °) central or the large (8 °) peripheral part of a compound stimulus (two counter-rotating concentric rings) while the stimulus either translated across the screen or was stationary. During this period, a transient perturbation with either step or ramp movement profile occurred. For perturbations leading to a change in position larger than the small ring, saccades occurred more frequently and had much shorter latencies (by 135 ms) when attention was directed to the small ring than when attention was directed to the large ring. These latency differences were sufficiently great that from a single saccade one can identify the attentional instruction with 94 % accuracy. However, with target steps as small as the small ring, saccade latencies differed less. For pursuit, ramp perturbations caused larger changes in eye velocity with little change in latency when attention was directed to the small ring. Finally, when only the motion of the non-attended ring was perturbed, most subjects showed stronger saccadic responses to perturbations of the small than the large ring, and stronger pursuit responses to perturbations of the large than the small <b>ring.</b> By <b>fitting</b> the saccade latency distributions with the Reddi and Carpenter LATER model, we found that our subjects apparently employed at least two distinct strategies for changing latency when attending large vs. small. We propose that the timing of the saccade decision process depends on both the size of the attended object and the magnitude of the perturbation...|$|R
40|$|It is {{not known}} why the Angelchik {{prosthesis}} prevents gastro-oesophageal reflux. A review of 53 barium meal examinations in 39 patients with the prosthesis showed that in 43 examinations the prosthesis was below the diaphragm. In 38 of these a small knuckle of stomach had herniated through the prosthetic ring alongside the oesophagus, forming a small intra-abdominal para-oesophageal hernia. Radiological reflux occurred in only one patient with such a hernia. In the remaining five examinations where the prosthesis was correctly situated in the abdomen, there was no hernia within the prosthetic ring and reflux occurred in three. In ten examinations the prosthesis had migrated into the mediastinum. None of these showed a hernia and reflux occurred in eight. It is suggested that the Angelchik prosthesis results {{in the formation of}} a small para-oesophageal hernia within a loosely <b>fitting</b> <b>ring</b> within the abdomen and this is a requirement for the success of the Angelchik prosthesis. Radiographically the intra-abdominal para-oesophageal hernia inside the prosthesis results in buttressing of the intra-abdominal oesophagus {{in a manner similar to}} a fundoplication...|$|R
40|$|Kinematical parameterisations of disc galaxies, {{employing}} {{emission line}} observations, are indispensable tools {{for studying the}} formation and evolution of galaxies. Future large-scale HI surveys will resolve the discs of many thousands of galaxies, allowing a statistical analysis of their disc and halo kinematics, mass distribution and dark matter content. Here we present an automated procedure which fits tilted-ring models to Hi data cubes of individual, well-resolved galaxies. The method builds on the 3 D Tilted <b>Ring</b> <b>Fitting</b> Code (TiRiFiC) and is called FAT (Fully Automated TiRiFiC). To assess {{the accuracy of the}} code we apply it to a set of 52 artificial galaxies and 25 real galaxies from the Local Volume HI Survey (LVHIS). Using LVHIS data, we compare our 3 D modelling to the 2 D modelling methods DiskFit and rotcur. A conservative result is that FAT accurately models the kinematics and the morphologies of galaxies with an extent of eight beams across the major axis in the inclination range 20 ^∘- 90 ^∘ without the need for priors such as disc inclination. When comparing to 2 D methods we find that velocity fields cannot be used to determine inclinations in galaxies that are marginally resolved. We conclude that with the current code tilted-ring models can be produced in a fully automated fashion. This will be essential for future HI surveys, with the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders, which will allow us to model the gas kinematics of many thousands of well-resolved galaxies. Performance studies of FAT close to our conservative limits, as well as the introduction of more parameterised models will open up the possibility to study even less resolved galaxies.

We observed RXJ 1615 with VLT/SPHERE. We image the disk {{for the first time in}} scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of the arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full <b>rings.</b> Ellipse <b>fitting</b> for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 ± 2 degrees and find semi-major axes of 1. 50 ± 0. 01 " (278 au), 1. 06 ± 0. 01 " (196 au) and 0. 30 ± 0. 01 " (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine point sources are detected between 2. 1 " and 8. 0 " separation and considered as companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources, which we determine not to be co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. We present the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ 1615 in scattered light. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface, which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis > 2. 35 " (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most interesting scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk truncated at r 360 au. The closest companion candidate, if indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, would then be the most likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the remaining four, require follow up observations to determine if they are bound to the system...|$|R
30|$|Commutative algebra is a {{discipline}} of algebra mainly studying commutative ring [1]. It takes the algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry as its study background. In a classic sense, the research object of commutative algebra is {{the zero point}} of a polynomial equation set, which correlates with not only the number theory (such as Diophantine equation [2]) but also the manifold pattern (such as the hypersurface defined by polynomial) [3]. While, in a modern sense, the research object of commutative algebra is the topological space with rich structure (structure sheaf) that {{could be provided by}} a spectrum of a commutative ring. Commutative algebra integrated with a manifold pattern has been widely applied in machine learning in recent years, as it can solve some common machine learning problems, such as classification and clustering, from a perspective of a manifold pattern. Vanishing component analysis (VCA) [4] is a method of solving classification problem by applying the theory of commutative algebraic that has emerged in recent years. Therein, the vanishing component refers to a generator (i.e., Grobner basis [5]) for vanishing ideal of polynomial <b>ring</b> space of <b>fitting</b> a manifold pattern, which is in form of a group of polynomials employing feature as their variable.

These ALMA observations resolve the dust-depleted disk cavities and extended gaseous disks, revealing large-scale asymmetries in the dust emission of both disks. We modeled these disk structures with a ring and an azimuthal Gaussian, where the azimuthal Gaussian is motivated by the steady-state vortex solution from Lyra & Lin. Compared to recent observations of HD 142527, Oph IRS 48, and LkHα 330, these are low-contrast (≾ 2) asymmetries. Nevertheless, a ring alone {{is not a good}} fit, and the addition of a vortex prescription describes these data much better. The asymmetric component encompasses 15 % and 28 % of the total disk emission in SAO 206462 and SR 21, respectively, which corresponds to a lower limit of 2 M_(Jup) of material within the asymmetry for both disks. Although the contrast in the dust asymmetry is low, we find that the turbulent velocity inside it must be large (~ 20 % of the sound speed) in order to drive these azimuthally wide and radially narrow vortex-like structures. We obtain residuals from the <b>ring</b> and vortex <b>fitting</b> that are still significant, tracing non-axisymmetric emission in both disks. We compared these submillimeter observations with recently published H-band scattered light observations. For SR 21 the scattered light emission is distributed quite differently from the submillimeter continuum emission, while for SAO 206462 the submillimeter residuals are suggestive of spiral-like structure similar to the near-IR emission...|$|R

Aims. We aim to find signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the distribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around RXJ 1615. 3 - 3255 (RX J 1615). Methods.

The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis greater than or similar to 2. 35 `' (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow us to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most attractive scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk to be truncated at r approximate to 360 au. If the closest companion candidate is indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, then it would be the most likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the remaining four, all require follow up observations to determine if they are bound to the system...|$|R
