40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the attitudes of uni-versity-level <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> toward educational and outreach activities that aim to help the general public understand more about their scientific endeavors. Interviews, observations, and survey results from 12 university <b>research</b> <b>scientists,</b> their col-leagues, students, and the individuals they interact with were used to gather data for this study. Results indicate that although some <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> value their education and outreach activities, many encounter obstacles to such efforts. These obstacles include a lack of support or resources at their home institution, the effort required to balance their research careers and outreach activities, and needing to find ways to connect with a nonscientific audience. A generational gap was also observed, with younger, nontenured <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> tending to be mor...|$|R

5|$|James Robert Cade (September 26, 1927 – November 27, 2007) was an American physician, {{university}} professor, <b>research</b> <b>scientist</b> and inventor.

Although Cade engaged in many areas of medical research, he is most widely remembered {{as the leader of the}} research team that created the sports drink Gatorade. Gatorade would have significant medical applications for treating dehydration in patients, and has generated over $150 million in royalties for the university.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Ramsey {{returned}} to Columbia as a professor and <b>research</b> <b>scientist.</b> Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, William Nierenberg, measured various nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments.With Rabi, he helped establish the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at Harvard University, where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to NATO, and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Euler {{was asked}} to tutor Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt, the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters {{to her in the}} early 1760s, which were later {{compiled}} into a best-selling volume entitled Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess. This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the 'Letters' testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated <b>research</b> <b>scientist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rabi chaired Columbia's physics {{department}} from 1945 to 1949, {{during which}} time it was home to two Nobel laureates (Rabi and Enrico Fermi) and eleven future laureates, including seven faculty (Polykarp Kusch, Willis Lamb, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, James Rainwater, Norman Ramsey, Charles Townes and Hideki Yukawa), a <b>research</b> <b>scientist</b> (Aage Bohr), a visiting professor (Hans Bethe), a doctoral student (Leon Lederman) and an undergraduate (Leon Cooper). Martin L. Perl, a doctoral student of Rabi's, won the Nobel Prize in 1995. When Columbia created the rank of University Professor in 1964, Rabi {{was the first to}} receive such a chair. This meant that he was free to research or teach whatever he chose. He retired from teaching in 1967 but remained active in the department and held the title of University Professor Emeritus until his death. A special chair was named after him in 1985.|$|E
5|$|From the Lindley Library, Stearn (see 1950 Photograph) {{moved to}} the Botany Department at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington in 1952, {{and by the time}} he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now {{achieved}} his aim of becoming a <b>research</b> <b>scientist,</b> despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants. During this time the Museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the Museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the Dicotyledons in the Bentham & Hooker system, i.e. Monochlamydae) and floristic treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the Museum's Flora of Jamaica and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war. Seven volumes of the Flora of Jamaica had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of field work in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum. Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on Allium, Lilium and Paeonia. He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States, and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the Museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some results}} from a regional study of the proper roles of ecological <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> in natural resource decision-making. The {{study was conducted in}} the Pacific Northwest by researchers at Oregon State University and focuses on scientists involved in the Long Term Ecological Research Program (LTER). Using data from interviews and mail-out surveys, the paper describes and compares the attitudes of two groups, scientists and natural resource managers, regarding preferred scientist roles, advocacy by scientists, and factors affecting the credibility of scientists. Two models about these roles are considered: a traditional model that separates scientists from resource decision-making and an emerging model that integrates them into resource management. Survey results indicate that scientists and resource managers favor the second model: both groups strongly support <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> becoming more involved in management, though neither group prefers advocacy of particular management choices by <b>research</b> <b>scientists.</b> Moreover, while scientists and managers differ about the most important factors that affect the credibility of scientists, study results suggest that the credibility of <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> in management will depend in part on their ability to communicate with non-scientific audiences, a factor highly valued by managers but not by scientists. Finally, the authors conclude that the results support Kai Lee’s concept of civic science, in which <b>research</b> <b>scientists</b> assume a more activist, integrated role in adaptive environmental management...|$|R
