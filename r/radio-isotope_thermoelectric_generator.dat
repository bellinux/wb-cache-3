The history of the RTG in the U. S.

The RTG concept is discussed including the most recent RTG technology developed by the DOE, the General Purpose Heat Source RTG (GPHS-RTG).

To provide information on the stress failure criterion used for this calculation, some heat shield specimens were fractured under abort entry conditions in a plasma arc facility.

40|$|International audienceThe {{detectors}} of the Ultraviolet Spectrographs (UVS) on Voyager 1 / 2 are {{recording a}} background intensity that was earlier assigned mainly to disintegrations in the <b>radio-isotope</b> <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> and systematically subtracted from {{the signal to}} infer photon counting. Here, we show that it arises instead from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). We show the GCR flux measured by UVS on Voyager 1 from 1992 to August 2013, and by comparing to data from the GCR dedicated detectors, we estimate the energy range responsible for this UVS signal, which is around 300 MeV, and the response of UVS to the GCR anisotropy. After the abrupt jumps of May and August 2012, the count rate has been only slightly fluctuating around a constant value. However, comparing it to {{the data from the}} Low Energy Charge Particle Experiment (LECP) and the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) shows that those small variations are only responses to a varying anisotropy and not to a flux change. Taking advantage of the similarity in energy range to one of the products of the CRS instrument suite, we use the ratio between the two independent signals as a proxy for the temporal evolution of the GCR spectral slope around the 300 MeV range. We show that this slope remained unchanged since August 2012 and find strong evidence that it will no longer vary, implying the end of the heliospheric modulation at those energies, and that Voyager 1 at this date is near or past the heliopause. The origin of this unexpectedly narrow and stagnating inner heliosheath is still unclear, and we discuss the potential effects of low solar wind speed episodes and subsequent self-amplified charge-exchange with interstellar neutrals, as a source of deceleration and collapse. We suggest that the quasi-static region encountered by Voyager 1 may be related to such effects, triggered by the strong solar-maximum variability. This did not happen for Voyager 2 due to its trajectory at an angle further from the heliosphere axis and a later termination shock crossing. The existence on the upwind side of a mixing layer formed by charge transfer instead of a pure plasma contact discontinuity could explain various Voyager 1 observations...|$|E
40|$|SiGe based {{thermoelectric}} (TE) {{materials have}} been employed {{for the past}} four decades for power generation in <b>radio-isotope</b> <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generators</b> (RTG). Recently "nanostructuring" has resulted in significantly increasing the figure-of-merit (ZT) of both n and p-type of SiGe and thus nanostructured Si 80 Ge 20 alloys are evolving as a potential replacement for their conventional bulk counterparts in designing efficient RTGs. However, apart from Zr, their mechanical properties are equally important for the long term reliability of their TE modules. Thus, we report the mechanical properties of p-type nanostructured Si 80 Ge 20 alloys, which were synthesized employing spark plasma sintering of mechanically alloyed nanopowders of its constituent elements with 12 % boron doping. Nanostructured p-type Si 80 Ge 20 alloys exhibited a hardness of similar to 9 +/- 0. 1 GPa, an elastic modulus of similar to 135 +/- 1. 9 GPa, a compressive strength of 108 +/- 02 MPa, and fracture toughness of similar to 1. 66 +/- 0. 04 MPalm with a thermal shock resistance value of 391 +/- 21 Wm(- 1). This combination of good mechanical properties coupled with higher reported Zr of nanostructured p-type Si 80 Ge 20 alloys are rendered to be a potential material for power generation applications, compared to its bulk counterpart...|$|R

A <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> (TECI- 12706 TI 25) has been used in this experiment. The system consisted of two containers which contains water of different temperatures. <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> is placed between these containers and by using a digital voltmeter, potential difference between the poles of the generator is measured. Results showed that by applying the maximum temperature difference that can be applied with this apparatus (80 C°), <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> can only produce a potential difference approximately about 0. 47 volts. However, data showed that temperature difference that is applied and potential difference that is produced is not directly proportional. In fact, graph showed that the general tendency is an exponential one, meaning that by using temperature differences greater than those which are used in this experiment; much more potential difference can be produced. (167 C° should be applied to obtain 1. 5 volts and to power an average LED lamp, which works with approximately 1. 7 volts, 180 C° of temperature difference should be applied {{to the ends of the}} <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator.)</b> Results showed that <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>generator</b> can be effective in industrial places where greater temperature differences are available or near ovens.
