500|$|In September 2015, Ridley Scott {{revealed}} he {{was planning}} two sequels to Prometheus, which would lead into the first Alien film, adding, [...] "Maybe [...] even [...] a fourth film before we {{get back into the}} Alien franchise." [...] In November 2015, Scott confirmed that Alien: Covenant would be the first of three additional films in the Alien prequels series, before linking up with the original Alien and stated that the Prometheus sequels would reveal who created the xenomorph aliens. The screenplay for the third prequel film, called Alien: Awakening, was written during production of Alien: Covenant and was finished in 2017, with production scheduled to begin in 2018. In March 2017, Scott said, ”If you <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> franchise, i can keep cranking it for another six. I'm not going to close it down again. No way." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come up with anything fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early {{decision}} on Rouse's part was that The Suffering {{be more of}} an action game than a traditional survival horror. This had implications {{for much of the}} design work on the game, as [...] "it meant we were going to focus more on combat and avoid the long cutscenes, frail central characters, clumsy controls, fixed camera angles, and sparse ammo of many console horror games." [...] Another early decision was to keep the central character as much of a mystery as possible, implying only his strength and little else. Artist Mike Nichols says, [...] "We didn't <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> character that looked of any particular nationality or race. He really is almost Neanderthal in appearance. He's very primal. We wanted that strength to come through." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a mixed review, Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph viewed that [...] "too much of {{the record}} sounds like generic, Katy Perry-esque power-pop." [...] The Guardians Caroline Sullivan felt that [...] "this record simply takes up where 2001's Rock Steady left off", but {{ultimately}} stated, [...] "As a comeback, this is nice work." [...] The Independents Andy Gill commented that the album finds No Doubt [...] "making only the most tentative divergences from previously tried and tested strategies, which gives Push and Shove a character that {{could be described as}} either dated or timeless", while noting that [...] "the title-track offers a fun, ebullient return to their ska-punk roots". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen expressed that [...] "he songs are catchy, but Gwen Stefani doesn't have the voice, or the gravitas, for grandiose tunes. And do we <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> 'mature' No Doubt record, anyway?" [...] Maria Schurr of PopMatters panned the lyrics as [...] "abysmally bad" [...] and remarked, [...] "After 'One More Summer'—which has a gigantic chorus perfectly suited for Wet Seal's speakers—and the inconsistent but decent title song, the album becomes so filler-centric that even the tracks' titles [...] are interchangeable." [...] Joseph Viney of Sputnikmusic critiqued that [...] "he very elements that made No Doubt popular in the first place have disappeared." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{have known}} things done, in this {{or the other}} Colony, in the most {{parliamentary}} way before now, which carried written on the brow of them sad symptoms of eternal reprobation; not to be mistaken, had you painted an inch thick. In Montreal, for example, at this moment, standing amid {{the ruins of the}} [...] "Elgin Marbles" [...] (as they call the burnt walls of the Parliament House there), what rational British soul but is forced to institute the mournfulest constitutional reflection? Some years ago the Canadas, probably not without materials for discontent, and blown upon by skilful artists, blazed up into crackling of musketry, open flame of rebellion; a thing smacking of the gallows in all countries that pretend to have any [...] "Government." [...] Which flame of rebellion, had there been no loyal population to fling themselves upon it at peril of their life, might have ended we know not how. It ended speedily, in the good way; Canada got a Godfrey's-cordial Constitution; and for the moment all was varnished into some kind of feasibility again. A most poor feasibility; momentary, not lasting, nor like to be of profit to Canada! For this year, the Canadian most constitutional Parliament, such a congeries of persons as one can imagine, decides that the aforesaid flame of rebellion shall not only be forgotten as per bargain, but that--the loyal population, who flung their lives upon it and quenched it in the nick of time, shall pay the rebels their damages! Of this, I believe, on sadly conclusive evidence, there is no doubt whatever. Such, when you wash off the constitutional pigments, is the Death's-head that discloses itself. I can only say, if all the Parliaments in the world were to vote that such a thing was just, I should feel painfully constrained to answer, at my peril, [...] "No, by the Eternal, never!" [...] And I would recommend any British Governor who might come across that Business, there or here, to overhaul it again. What the meaning of a Governor, if he is not to overhaul and control such things, may be, I cannot conjecture. A Canadian Lumber-log may as well be made Governor. He might have some cast-metal hand or shoulder-crank (a thing easily contrivable in Birmingham) for signing his name to Acts of the Colonial Parliament; he would be a [...] "native of the country" [...] too, with popularity on that score if on no other;--he is your man, if you <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>a</b> Log Governor!-- ...|$|E
