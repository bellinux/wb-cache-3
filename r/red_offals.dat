The <b>red</b> <b>offals,</b> of lungs, heart and liver, are then washed by the skinners and made {{ready for the}} veterinary officers to inspect them in the post-mortem examination.

30|$|At the {{post-mortem}} examination area, the veterinary officers conduct visual examinations, palpation and incise the head, the tongue, {{the green and}} <b>red</b> <b>offals</b> {{and the rest of}} the carcass before declaring the products fit for human consumption. The examination inspects the slaughter stock for discoloration of the eyes, ears, nostrils, exposed muscles and tongue. In so doing, they screen for signs of jaundice, anemia, hemorrhages, abcesses and swellings. They also screen for liver cirrhosis, degeneration of the liver, inflammation of the capsule of the liver and any signs of parasitic cysts like liver flukes, Stilesia hepatica, abcesses and swelling of the liver. Additionally, they also look for possible conditions like pneumonia, pleurisy, parasitic cysts, Echinococcus granulosus, hemorrhages, Cysticercus bovis, and pericarditis.|$|E
30|$|A set of flayers {{take over}} the {{slaughterhouse}} operations from the veterinary officers in the ante-mortem examination. The first set of flayers is the slaughterhouse workers charged with slaughtering the livestock. They use a captive-bolt pistol to knock down the slaughter stock. This {{is considered to be}} a humane method of slaughter in line with the Islamic laws governing the consumption of Halal foods for members of the Islamic faith. The study was informed that the use of the Halal method ensures that the slaughterhouse workers pronounce the name of the Almighty God, Allah, before severing the neck of the slaughter stock, leaving it to bleed out to death and then detaching the head of the slaughter stock. Skinners are the second set of flayers, who open up the hide of the stock. The skinners also open up the carcass from the thorax to allow veterinary officers to inspect the organs and also remove the green and <b>red</b> <b>offals.</b>|$|E
40|$|Health (NIOSH) {{conducted}} a health hazard evaluation (HHE) at the Lundy Packing Company in Clinton, North Carolina. This HHE was {{in response to}} requests submitted independently by Lundy employees and the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources. The purpose of this evaluation was to investigate the occupational transmission of brucellosis among kill floor employees of this swine abattoir. The industrial hygiene investigation included observation of general work practices, personal protective equipment use, and a review of the existing and planned ventilation system in the kill floor. The medical evaluation included questionnaire administration and a serologic survey (using the standard tube agglutination [STA] and the 2 -mercaptoethanol [2 -ME] tests) of 154 (99 %) of the 156 kill floor employees. A suspected case of brucellosis was defined by: 1) STA titer $ 160, and either (a) two or more symptoms consistent with brucellosis or (b) a positive 2 -ME test (2 -ME titer $ 20). The medical evaluation revealed that 30 workers (19 %) met the case definition for brucellosis. Sixteen (53 %) of the 30 represented newly identified cases. The head (33 %) and <b>red</b> <b>offal</b> (25 %) departments within the kill division had the highest percentage of workers identified as cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} to a more westernized diets, became evident in the macronutrient intake of women in this study. The consumption of an energy-dense and diverse diet, typical of this transition, contributed to the high mean total energy and protein intakes. High mean total carbohydrate intakes, a staple diet of cereals and grains was also reported. The adequate intake of dietary fibre by the population group {{in this study was}} in contrast with international studies that reported that westernization leads to increased consumption of fibre-depleted carbohydrates. The high total fat intake observed in this study may be ascribed to the increasing preference for cheaper <b>red</b> meat, <b>offal,</b> eggs, full-cream milk, cheese, brick margarine and meat drippings used in food preparation. The inclusion of these foods in the diet could explain the high total cholesterol intake reported in this study. Although the food trends of the studied group of women tended to move towards a more westernized style, traditional foods have not been totally eliminated. It is thus clear that urbanisation in this study group has led to high consumption rates of carbonated drinks, cold drinks, coffee, tea and commercial beer. A cereal-based diet was still taken; unfortunately, many of these foods were consumed in the refined form...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that dietary habits {{play a role}} in prostate cancer (PC) occurrence. Argentinean cancer risk studies require additional attention because of the singular dietary pattern of this population. A case-control study (147 PC cases, 300 controls) was conducted in Córdoba (Argentina) throughout 2008 – 2013. A principal component factor analysis was performed to identify dietary patterns. A mixed logistic regression model was applied, taking into account family history of cancer. Possible bias was evaluated by probabilistic bias analysis. Four dietary patterns were identified: Traditional (fatty <b>red</b> meats, <b>offal,</b> processed meat, starchy vegetables, added sugars and sweets, candies, fats, and vegetable oils), Prudent (nonstarchy vegetables, whole grains), Carbohydrate (sodas/juices and bakery products), and Cheese (cheeses). High adherence to the Traditional (OR 2. 82, 95 %CI: 1. 569 – 5. 099) and Carbohydrate Patterns (OR 2. 14, 95 %CI: 1. 470 – 3. 128) showed a promoting effect for PC, whereas the Prudent and Cheese Patterns were independent factors. PC occurrence was also associated with family history of PC. Bias adjusted ORs indicate that the validity of the present study is acceptable. High adherence to characteristic Argentinean dietary patterns was associated with increased PC risk. Our results incorporate original contributions to knowledge about scenarios in South American dietary patterns and PC occurrence...|$|R

To get the full text please contact the other at karm@uofk. eduSheep, either live or slaughtered, are the most important among Sudan’s animal exports – a major source of foreign currency. Accordingly, diseases that cause rejection of live sheep at veterinary quarantines and in importing countries, as well as pathological conditions causing condemnation of sheep meat, should receive more attention by veterinarians; not only because of their economic importance, but also because of the potential hazards to human health, especially through meat consumption and handling. The present investigation reviewed the causes of sheep carcass condemnations as well as the condemnation of <b>red</b> <b>offals</b> and some green offals of sheep slaughtered for export. The study analysed records from two major abattoirs in Khartoum State of Sudan covering the period Jan – Dec 2011. Whole carcass condemnation during this period was 0. 1 % of the total sheep slaughtered for export. Main causes of carcass condemnations were jaundice, (64. 8 %) and hydatid cysts (20 %). Other causes (15. 2 %) included abscesses, emaciation, and adhesions. Total condemnation of offals (liver, kidney, heart, lung and spleen) was high (12. 8 %), with liver constituting the major condemned part (83 %) followed by the lungs (12. 4 %), the heart (4. 0 %), kidneys (0. 4 %) and the spleen (0. 2 %). Major pathological changes in the condemned livers were necrosis, calcification, hydatid cysts, adhesions, fascioliasis, abscesses, jaundice, colour changes and fatty degeneration. Although the described pathological conditions were not further investigated in relation to the diseases they can represent, they point to a high prevalence of parasitic diseases in slaughtered animals. Although the described conditions were not related to areas of animal breeding in the country, they more or less reflect the diseases of sheep {{in the western part of}} the country, especially Kurdofan region, where most of export sheep are raised. It is highly recommended that the diseases manifesting as jaundice, in addition to other liver diseases in sheep are investigated...|$|E
30|$|The {{study also}} found that {{conditional}} passing occurs when 6 to 20 parasitic cysts are found and treatment by either sterilization by heat or cold treatment is used. However, in this scenario, the inspectors release the meat to specific customers mainly colleges, childrens’ homes, hospitals or other service, training and learning institutions as contact meat but cannot be sold as retail meat to consumers. However, the veterinary officers after inspecting the meat may during the judgment stage declared the meat unfit for human consumption and thus the head, the tongue, carcass, <b>red</b> and green <b>offals</b> are condemned. Condemnation of meat is based on either the health concerns that may occur if the meat finds its way to consumers or the discomfort with which consumers of meat may have with eating meat infested with liver flukes or Stilesia hepatica and other parasitic cysts. As aesthetics is one factor driving the consumption of meat, meat infested with parasitic cysts becomes less appealing, and thus, condemnation is necessitated.|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on synthetic l-ergothioneine, marketed as Ergoneine®, as a novel food submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258 / 97 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The novel food, synthetic l-ergothioneine, is produced by a one-pot patented manufacturing process. Chemically, l-ergothioneine is a derivative of thiolhistidine, and it is naturally present {{in a number of}} foodstuffs such as mushrooms, some varieties of black and <b>red</b> beans, <b>offal</b> and cereals. The production process for the novel food is sufficiently described and does not raise concerns about the safety of the novel food. The information on the composition, specifications, batch-to-batch variability and stability of the novel food is sufficient and does not raise safety concerns. The applicant intends to use the novel food in quantities of up to 5 mg per serving in alcohol-free beverages, cereal bars, milk, fresh dairy products and chocolate. The applicant also proposes to provide the novel food as a food supplement, with a daily dose of up to 30 mg/day for adults and 20 mg/day for children. The target population is children above 3 years of age and the general adult population, except pregnant and breastfeeding women. Considering the NOAEL of 800 mg/kg bw per day, which was based on two subchronic toxicity studies in rats, and the maximum estimated intake levels for l-ergothioneine from all sources, the Panel concludes that the margins of safety of 470 for adults (except pregnant and breastfeeding women) and of 216 for children above 3 years of age are sufficient. The Panel concludes that the novel food, synthetic l-ergothioneine (marketed as Ergoneine®), is safe under the intended conditions of use as specified by the applicant...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{show the}} effects of {{statistical}} approaches of data analysis {{to be used in}} the development of Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG). Setting: Databases from dietary surveys in 6 European countries. Results: Quantile analysis based on iron intake among adult women resulted in differences among European countries regarding (macro) nutrient intake and consumption of food groups. However, in all countries women in the highest quartile had a higher intake of energy and dietary fibre and a higher intake of most food groups. In developing FBDG adjustment of energy intake is recommended. Discriminant analyses showed that among Dutch women potatoes, <b>red</b> meat, sausages, <b>offal,</b> savoury snacks, eggs and total vegetables were found to be the most predictive for differences in iron intake. Relatively high correlations were observed for iron and dietary fibre and iron and (some) B-vitamins. Examples from cluster and factor analysis showed that this type of analysis considers the complexity of the dietary pattern and could also be a helpful instrument in the development of FBDG. Conclusions: The use of a nutrient distribution can be used as a minimum approach in developing FBDG. More advanced methods can also be used in addition to set priorities for FBDG and to analyse complete dietary patterns. Chemicals/CAS: Iron, Dietar...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} the control of safe food, from {{consumers}} the world over, has revolutionized {{the manner in which}} wild game meat harvesting occurs. In developed countries, food quality, food and human safety with quality controlling systems embracing environmental carbon footprint issues are constantly improving, for international harmonization at each level of production “from stable to table”, “farm to fork”, “field to yield” as well as from “cradle to grave”. Food industries globally have adopted the in Hazard Analysis Critical control Point (HACCP) system. This is a risk assessment process using Hygiene Assessment Systems (HAS) as a mitigating strategy for risk communication through training. It is also a holistic system that is compatible with international trends designed not only for food safety and quality, but it also embraces other aspects of farming such as animal welfare, environmental management and Occupational Safety and Health. Global marketing for international trade demands quality assurance from trading partners thereby promoting economic growth for developing countries. The watch dog bodies such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) prohibit trading for non-compliance, therefore trade barriers are in place for uncertified food of animal origin, EU regulations are stringent requirements that need compliance and so too the OIE regulations for disease control, while the Codex Alimentarius Commission maintains trade harmonization. In South Africa Hygiene Assessment Systems (HAS) is a National Hygiene management strategy implemented at abattoirs, that promotes and facilitates quality and hygiene and is reflective of South African quality abroad. It is prescribed under the section, “Essential National Standards” in the Meat Safety Act, 2000, (Act 40 of 2000). This Act covers red meat and includes both domestic animals and game. The Veterinary Procedural Notices (VPN’s) are used for export of game and give far more detailed guidelines than the legislation for game meat sold and consumed locally in South Africa. The objective of the Hygiene Assessment System (HAS) is to create a national awareness of quality to better {{improve the quality of life}} of all South Africans, whilst at the same time it is used as an auditing tool for Veterinary Public Health to effectively compare essential standards within the nine provinces. Currently this programme is referred to as the National Abattoir Rating Scheme (NARS), which is only applicable to the high and low throughput Red Meat and Poultry abattoirs in South Africa and not to the Game or Rural abattoirs, thereby further compounding the duality of food standards with food safety being compromised. This study has been undertaken because there are inadequate risk control measures such as introduction of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) guidelines on primary and secondary meat inspection, specifically on game for local consumption, not only within South Africa, but in the international arena as well. A revision of the HAS document and audit will also be needed to meet with the local (not just export) criteria for wild game harvesting, to enable food safety, thus enabling food security in the remote non - agricultural areas in KwaZulu -Natal. Venison is the meat of today because of health priorities that have arisen over the last ten years. It is low in trans - fatty acids and is regarded internationally as a healthy product produced organically in a free range situation. South Africa has a large potential export market for venison to the European Union because the demand, for venison, exceeds supply in Europe. However, the European Union’s “safe food regulation” that was introduced between 2005 and 2007 with an implementation date of 2008 (Regulation 1021 / 2008) has made it imperative that the HACCP principle is applied to any food or food product of animal origin imported into the European Union or its member states. Also, HACCP specifies that a multidisciplinary team of experts is selected. This then lends itself to a participatory approach to risk assessment as wide consultation is required. This participatory approach was used, including expert opinion surveys and focus group discussions with stakeholders and role-players in the game industry such as commercial hunters, state veterinary services and game ranch owners. Such participants may have better insight into existing conditions than external experts with recognised educational qualifications, usually used in the HACCP team. From this and the relevant Veterinary Procedural Notices for game harvesting, a HACCP process flow and critical control points were derived for the primary phase of meat inspection, including slaughter, primary meat inspection and loading for transport to the abattoir. This was modified during a phase or trial harvesting and then implemented during the harvest of 1758 impala carcasses which were subsequently exported. In addition, environmental risks were considered and a risk mitigation strategy designed, to reduce any possible environmental impacts. In northern Kwazulu Natal, game ranches and conservation areas are in close proximity to the rural poor where food is scarce and comes at a premium price. These game farms harvest seasonally for either the local or export market, hence there is abundance of game offal and by-products available, yet it is at present left in the field or taken to the vulture restaurants (in line with the VPN). Participatory risk analysis was thus also used to investigate the feasibility of using edible offal from impala (Aepyceros melampus) as a source of renewable protein, to address food security issues in impoverished communities in the study area, the districts of uPongola and Jozini, in northern KwaZulu Natal. Structured interviews on the cultural acceptability of impala offal were held with 162 randomly sampled adult respondents in veterinary districts associated with dip tanks. A two stage cluster design was used where the state veterinary areas were stage one and the dip tanks (with proportional random sampling of community members) were the second stage. Offal is a popular food in South Africa in different cultures, called “ithumbu” in IsiZulu, “ boti” by the Indian group, “afval” in Afrikaans and “tripe” in English. Generally demand outstrips supply of <b>offal</b> at <b>red</b> meat abattoirs in South Africa. It was found that there was no significant difference between those who would eat impala offal and those who would eat the offal of sheep. It was concluded that it is feasible to use inspected game offal from impala as a protein source in much the same way as <b>red</b> meat <b>offal</b> is used and that the current practice of leaving the offal for predators was likely, if it continues, to cause imbalances in the predator/ prey ratio on game farms. It is recommended that the VPN for game be amended to encompass inspected offal being allowed into the formal food chain, in line with the standard operating procedure developed during this study. Also that current fragmentation of legislation and the implementation thereof is revisited for effective control for harmonisation of food safety standards for game meat within South Africa.
