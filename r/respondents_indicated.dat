The sample was recruited to closely match the overall British population on demographic variables such as age, gender, employment status and socio-economic classification. Ethnic minorities {{were less likely to}} identify as gay or lesbian than Whites (1.4% vs. 3.5%) but were more likely to prefer not to disclose their sexual orientation (7.5% vs 0.9%). More LGB than heterosexual <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> they {{would be less likely to}} disclose their true sexual orientation in a face-to-face interview than in a self-administered, online survey.|$|E

The Muslim population has increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the second-largest religious group in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the International Atomic Energy Agency {{presented}} {{the results of}} a series of public opinion surveys in the Global Public Opinion on Nuclear Issues report. Majorities of respondents in 14 of the 18 countries surveyed believe that the risk of terrorist acts involving radioactive materials at nuclear facilities is high, because of insufficient protection. While majorities of citizens generally support the continued use of existing nuclear power reactors, most people do not favour the building of new nuclear plants, and 25% of respondents feel that all nuclear power plants should be closed down. Stressing the climate change benefits of nuclear energy positively influences 10% of people to be more supportive of expanding the role of nuclear power in the world, but there is still a general reluctance to support the building of more nuclear power plants. After the Fukushima Disaster, Civil Society Institute (CSI) found out that 58 percent of the <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> less support of using nuclear power in the United States. Two-thirds of the respondents said they would protest the construction of a nuclear reactor within 50 miles of their homes.|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} direct {{discussion}} of the imaging findings between patients and radiologists when the patient asked, results showed that in under half of the participating countries the radiologist would routinely discuss the imaging findings with the patient, and in 12  % this rarely occurred. Free text comments indicated that again there may be variation between private and state-provided care. Other factors cited were the time available and variation depending on the modality, for example more discussion was likely to take place about ultrasound examinations that MRI. One <b>respondent</b> also <b>indicated</b> that radiologists did not discuss the findings because the referring doctors preferred to discuss the examination results with the patients (with which the radiologist <b>respondent</b> <b>indicated</b> {{that they did not}} agree).|$|R
30|$|The <b>respondent</b> clearly <b>indicates</b> {{that the}} {{uncertainty}} {{was so high}} {{that there could be}} very high variation in the production cost. It was hardly meaningful to make any calculations at all, which indicates one of the high-risk aspects of the product. However, as time went by, the firm gained more and more control over the product development process. Instead of using a new and unproven technology, the firm instead chose to use an already proven technology but used this technology in new ways. This reduced somewhat the risk of the product failing. The <b>respondent</b> <b>indicated</b> later that the product started to become more comprehensible, even if it was, of course, still associated with risk, yet it was lower than earlier in the process.|$|R

2500|$|The {{organization}} Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) {{testified before}} Congress that they strongly supported the bill, but {{pointed out a}} number of additional related challenges and problems that needed to be solved to improve the treatment of MST related conditions in veterans.
