6000|$|From the thallus of a sea-weed up to {{the leaf}} of a highly {{developed}} phænogam, we find, at all stages, a contrast between {{the inner and outer}} parts of these flattened masses of tissue. In the higher Algæ [...] "the outermost layers consist of smaller and firmer cells, while the inner cells are often very large, and sometimes extremely long;"[51] and in the leaves of trees the epidermal layer, besides differing in the sizes and shapes of its component cells from the parenchyma forming the inner substance of the leaf, is itself differentiated by having a continuous cuticle, and by having the outer walls of its cells unlike the inner walls.[52] Especially significant is the structure of such intermediate types as the Liverworts. Beyond the differentiation of the covering cells from the contained cells, and the contrast between upper surface and under surface, the frond of Marchantia polymorpha clearly shows us the direct effect of incident forces; and shows us, too, how it is involved with the effect of inherited proclivities. The frond grows from a flat disc-shaped gemma, the two sides of which are alike. Either side may fall uppermost; and then of the developing shoot, the side exposed to the light [...] "is under all circumstances the upper side which forms stomata, the dark side becomes the under side which produces root-hairs and leafy processes."[53] So that while we have undeniable proof that the contrasted influences of the medium on the two sides, initiate the differentiation, we have also proof that the completion of it is determined by the transmitted structure of the type; since it is impossible to ascribe the development of stomata to the direct action of air and light. On turning from foliar expansions, to stems and roots, facts of like meaning meet us. Speaking generally of epidermal tissue and inner tissue, Sachs remarks that [...] "the contrast of the two is the plainer the more the part of the plant concerned is exposed to air and light."[54] Elsewhere, in correspondence with this, it is said that in roots the cells of the epidermis, though distinguished by bearing hairs, [...] "are otherwise {{similar to those of the}} fundamental tissue" [...] which they clothe,[55] while the cuticular covering is relatively thin; whereas in stems the epidermis (often further differentiated) is composed of layers of cells which are smaller and thicker-walled: a stronger contrast of structure corresponding to a stronger contrast of conditions. By way of meeting the suggestion that these respective differences are wholly due to the natural selection of favourable variations, it will suffice if I draw attention to the unlikeness between imbedded roots and exposed roots. While in darkness, and surrounded by moist earth, the outermost protective coats, even of large roots, are comparatively thin; but when the accidents of growth entail permanent exposure to light and air, roots acquire coverings allied in character to the coverings of branches. That the action of the medium causes these and converse changes, cannot be doubted when we find, on the one hand, that [...] "roots can become directly transformed into leaf-bearing shoots," [...] and, on the other hand, that in some plants certain [...] "apparent roots are only underground shoots," [...] and that nevertheless [...] "they are similar to true roots in function and in the formation of tissue, but have no <b>root-cap,</b> and, when they come to the light above ground, continue to grow in the manner of ordinary leaf-shoots."[56] If, then, in highly developed plants inheriting pronounced structures, this differentiating influence of the medium is so marked, it must have been all-important at the outset while types were undetermined.|$|E
50|$|Individuals of {{this species}} exhibit greatly reduced {{morphological}} characteristics, with no leaf structures. It has a dark brown color, and bright pink to red on the inside when alive. The body, {{with the exception of}} the dermal and conducting tissue, is made up of tannin-containing parenchymal cells. The vascular tissue of the body mirrors that of a dicotyledonous plant. There is a root-cap-like structure on the primary growth tip. Covering the entire body is a thick corky periderm, which seems to act as protection as it grows through the soil. Along the ridges of the either pentamerous or hexamerous body, are bumps of meristematic tissue. These bundles can become corky, or differentiate into flower buds, haustoria or lateral branches. The flower buds are fleshy, triangular in shape and appear white-yellowish. The flower itself is tubular with three perianth lobes that are fused together to form a cap-like structure. There are three openings for each lobe that lead to the inside of the flower which have a fleshy appearance. The appearance of the vegetative body is similar to that of a rhizome with its subterranean body, reduced morphology and <b>root-cap</b> structure at the tip. This structure is most likely adapted to its entirely subterranean life.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background AtKinesin- 13 A is an internal-motor kinesin from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Previous immunofluorescent {{results showed}} that AtKinesin- 13 A {{localized}} to Golgi stacks in plant cells. However, its precise localization and biological function in Golgi apparatus is unclear. Results In this paper, immunofluorescent labeling and confocal microscopic observation revealed that AtKinesin- 13 A was co-localized with Golgi stacks in Arabidopsis root tip cells. Immuno-electron microscopic observations indicated that AtKinesin- 13 A is primarily localized on Golgi-associated vesicles in Arabidopsis <b>root-cap</b> cells. By T-DNA insertion, the inactivation of the AtKinesin- 13 A gene (NM- 112536) resulted in a sharp decrease of size and number of Golgi vesicles in <b>root-cap</b> peripheral cells. At the same time, these cells were vacuolated {{in comparison to the}} corresponding cells of the wild type. Conclusion These results suggest that AtKinesin- 13 A decorates Golgi-associated vesicles and may be involved in regulating the formation of Golgi vesicles in the <b>root-cap</b> peripheral cells in Arabidopsis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Graviperception by plant roots is {{believed}} to occur via the sedimentation of amyloplasts in columella cells of the root cap. This physical stimulus results in an accumulation of calcium on the lower side of the cap, which in turn induces gravicurvature. In this paper we present a model for root gravitropism integrating gravity-induced changes in electrical potential, cytochemical localization of calcium in cells of gravistimulated roots, and the interdependence of calcium and auxin movement. Key features of the model are that 1) gravity-induced redistribution of calcium is an early event in the transduction mechanism, and 2) apoplastic movement of calcium through the <b>root-cap</b> mucilage {{may be an important}} component of the pathway for calcium movement...|$|E

There have, however, been few definitive observations about the pattern of its functioning. In the outer <b>root-cap</b> cells of maize and other species, as well as in other plant cells, the Golgi apparatus forms membrane-bounded vesicles, the contents of which are secreted through the plasma membrane of the cell.

40|$|Root caps of primary, secondary, and seminal {{roots of}} Z. mays cv. Kys secrete {{large amounts of}} {{mucilage}} and are {{in close contact with}} the root all along the root apex. These roots are strongly graviresponsive. Secondary and seminal roots of Z. mays cv. Ageotropic are also strongly graviresponsive. Similarly, their caps secrete mucilage and closely appress the root all along the root apex. However, primary roots of Z. mays cv. Ageotropic are non-responsive to gravity. Their caps secrete negligible amounts of mucilage and contact the root only at the extreme apex of the root along the calyptrogen. These roots become graviresponsive when their tips are coated with mucilage or mucilage-like materials. Peripheral cells of root caps of roots of Z. mays cv. Kys contain many dictyosomes associated with vesicles that migrate to and fuse with the plasmalemma. <b>Root-cap</b> cells of secondary and seminal (i. e. graviresponsive) roots of Z. mays cv. Ageotropic {{are similar to those of}} primary roots of Z. mays cv. Kys. However, <b>root-cap</b> cells of primary (i. e. non-graviresponsive) roots of Z. mays cv. Ageotropic have distended dictyosomal cisternae filled with an electron-dense, granular material. Large vesicles full of this material populate the cells and apparently do not fuse with the plasmalemma. Taken together, these results suggest that non-graviresponsiveness of primary roots of Z. mays cv. Ageotropic results from the lack of apoplastic continuity between the root and the periphery of the root cap. This is a result of negligible secretion of mucilage by cells along the edge of the root cap which, in turn, appears to be due to the malfunctioning of dictyosomes in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Roots avoid {{depleting}} {{their immediate}} environment of essential nutrients by continuous growth. Root growth {{is directed by}} environmental cues, including gravity. Gravity sensing occurs mainly in the columella cells of the root cap. Upon reorientation within the gravity field, the <b>root-cap</b> amyloplasts sediment, generating a physiological signal that promotes {{the development of a}} curvature at the root elongation zones. Recent molecular genetic studies in Arabidopsis have allowed the identification of genes that play important roles in root gravitropism. Among them, the ARG 1 gene encodes a DnaJ-like protein involved in gravity signal transduction, whereas the AUX 1 and AGR 1 genes encode proteins involved in polar auxin transport. These studies have important implications for understanding the intra- and inter-cellular signaling processes that underlie root gravitropism...|$|E
40|$|Sedimentation of starch in geoperceptive {{cells of}} plants was {{observed}} {{more than sixty}} years ago and proposed as the mechanism whereby changes in gravitational stimulus are perceived. The idea was {{that there is an}} interaction between the sedimented starch grains and the protoplasm along the lower walls of the sensitive cells, which might lead to the synthesis or release of an enzyme. It has been suggested that the highest sensitivity resides in the cytoplasm along the outer tangential walls of the horizontal root. The lower part of a horizontally placed root would thus acquire a higher concentration of the enzyme than the upper and thereby perhaps a higher concentration of a specific growth inhibitor. Experiments have shown that the sedimentation behaviour of statolith starch under different conditions fits in well with the geotropic responses of roots under those conditions. However, the statolith starch theory of geoperception, although substantiated by much supporting evidence, still remains unproven. Since the statolith starch theory was proposed, other cell organelles have been suggested as the perceivers of gravitational stimulus. Perhaps the most acceptable are the mitochondria. Ziegler (1953) believes that the reduction of tetrazolium salts, which he observed at the lowermost side walls of horizontal shoots, was located in mitochondria which sediment under the influence of gravity. Hertz and Grahm (1958, 1962) incorporate Ziegler's observation and interpretation in a theory to explain the oxygen-dependent potential difference which develops between the lowermost and uppermost sides of roots and shoots during fifteen minutes of horizontal stimulation. They propose a mechanism whereby this can cause geotropic curvature. Electron microscope observations of <b>root-cap</b> cells do not support the contention that the mitochondria sediment rapidly under the influence of gravity. The roots which do show significant differences between lower and upper halves of the cap-cells, have more mitochondria in the upper halves, not the lower. This difference probably results from displacement by sedimented amyloplasts. Dictyosomes show the same general pattern of distribution as mitochondria and are probably also displaced by amyloplasts as they sediment. Nemec (1901) observed densely staining lamellate and granular bodies in geoperceptive cells, which moved in relation to the direction of gravitational stimulus. He suggested that the interaction of starch movement with these bodies leads to geoperception. With the electron microscope high concentrations of endoplasmic reticulum membranes have frequently been observed in <b>root-cap</b> cells in a similar position to the "lamellate bodies" of Nemec, and it is considered possible that these structures are analagous. It seems probable that the endoplasmic reticulum membranes are displaced by amyloplasts as the latter sediment. As a result of electron microscope observations of geoperceptive <b>root-cap</b> cells, it is considered that the amyloplasts are still the most likely organelles to trigger off the sequence of reactions leading to geotropic curvature. <p...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{study to}} {{identify}} potential targets of calcium action in plant cells, a 35 -kDa, annexin-like protein was purified from pea (Pisum sativum L.) plumules by a method used to purify animal annexins. This protein, called p 35, binds to a phosphatidylserine affinity column in a calcium-dependent manner and binds 45 Ca 2 + in a dot-blot assay. Preliminary sequence data confirm a relationship for p 35 with the annexin family of proteins. Polyclonal antibodies have been raised which recognize p 35 in Western and dot blots. Immunofluorescence and immunogold techniques were used to study the distribution and subcellular localization of p 35 in pea plumules and roots. The highest levels of immunostain were found in young developing vascular cells producing wall thickenings and in peripheral <b>root-cap</b> cells releasing slime. This localization in cells which are actively involved in secretion is of interest because one function suggested for the animal annexins is involvement in the mediation of exocytosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of calcium (Ca) in caps of vertically- and horizontally-oriented roots of Zea mays was monitored {{to determine its}} possible role in root graviresponsiveness. A modification of the antimonate precipitation procedure was used to localize Ca in situ. In vertically-oriented roots, the presumed graviperceptive (i. e., columella) cells were characterized by minimal and symmetric staining of the plasmalemma and mitochondria. No precipitate was present in plasmodesmata or cell walls. Within 5 min after horizontal reorientation, staining {{was associated with the}} portion of the cell wall adjacent to the distal end of the cell. This asymmetric staining persisted throughout the onset of gravicurvature. No staining of lateral cell walls of columella cells was observed at any stage of gravicurvature, suggesting that a lateral flow of Ca through the columella tissue of horizontally-oriented roots does not occur. The outermost peripheral cells of roots oriented horizontally and vertically secrete Ca through plasmodesmata-like structures in their cell walls. These results are discussed relative to proposed roles of <b>root-cap</b> Ca in root gravicurvature...|$|E
40|$|A tomato {{gene that}} is induced early after {{infection}} of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) with root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne javanica) encodes a protein with 54 % amino acid identity to miraculin, a flavorless protein that causes sour substances {{to be perceived}} as sweet. This gene was therefore named LeMir (L. esculentum miraculin). Sequence similarity places the encoded protein in the soybean trypsin-inhibitor family (Kunitz). LeMir mRNA is found in root, hypocotyl, and flower tissues, with the highest expression in the root. Rapid induction of expression upon nematode infection is localized to root tips. In situ hybridization shows that LeMir is expressed constitutively in the <b>root-cap</b> and root-tip epidermis. The LeMir protein product (LeMir) was produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris for generation of antibodies. Western-blot analysis showed that LeMir expression is up-regulated by nematode infection and by wounding. LeMir is also expressed in tomato callus tissue. Immunoprint analysis revealed that LeMir is expressed throughout the seedling root, but that levels are highest at the root/shoot junction. Analysis of seedling root exudates revealed that LeMir is secreted from the root into the surrounding environment, suggesting that it may interact with soil-borne microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{root cap}} {{functions}} {{in the perception of}} gravity, the protection of the root apical meristem, and facilitation of the passage of roots through the soil, but the genes involved in these functions are poorly understood. Here we report the isolation of a root-specific gene from the cap of maize (Zea mays L.) primary root by cDNA subtraction and differential screening. The gene zmGRP 4 (Z. mays glycine rich protein 4) encodes a member of the glycine-rich proteins with a putative signal peptide at the amino terminus. The deduced molecular mass of mature zmGRP 4 is 14. 4 kD. In situ-hybridization analysis has shown zmGRP 4 to be strongly expressed in the lateral root cap and weakly expressed in the root epidermis. A polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant zmGRP 4 detected a protein of 36 kD in the insoluble protein fraction extracted from the root tip and the root proper, indicating posttranslational modification(s) of zmGRP 4. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the accumulation of zmGRP 4 in the mucilage that covers the root tip. These results indicate that lateral <b>root-cap</b> cells secrete modified zmGRP 4 into the mucilage to which the protein may contribute to its characteristic physical properties...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{the lack}} of a method for {{inducing}} plant cells and their Golgi stacks to differentiate in a synchronous manner has made it difficult to characterize {{the nature and extent of}} Golgi retailoring in biochemical terms. Here we report that auxin deprivation can be used to induce a uniform population of suspension-cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv BY- 2) cells to differentiate synchronously during a 4 -d period. Upon removal of auxin, the cells stop dividing, undergo elongation, and differentiate in a manner that mimics the formation of slime-secreting epidermal and peripheral <b>root-cap</b> cells. The morphological changes to the Golgi apparatus include a proportional increase in the number of trans-Golgi cisternae, a switch to larger-sized secretory vesicles that bud from the trans-Golgi cisternae, and an increase in osmium staining of the secretory products. Biochemical alterations include an increase in large, fucosylated, mucin-type glycoproteins, changes in the types of secreted arabinogalactan proteins, and an increase in the amounts and types of molecules containing the peripheral root-cap-cell-specific epitope JIM 13. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that auxin deprivation can be used to induce tobacco BY- 2 cells to differentiate synchronously into mucilage-secreting cells...|$|E

Decapped roots grown on Earth completely regenerated their caps within 4. 8 days after decapping, while those grown in microgravity did not regenerate caps. In Earth-grown seedlings, the ER was localized primarily along the periphery of columella cells, and amyloplasts sedimented in response to gravity to the lower sides of the cells. Seeds germinated on Earth and subsequently launched into outer space had a distribution of ER in columella cells similar to that of Earth-grown controls, but amyloplasts were distributed throughout the cells. Seeds germinated in outer space were characterized by the presence of spherical and ellipsoidal masses of ER and randomly distributed amyloplasts in their columella cells. These results indicate that 1) gravity is necessary for regeneration of the root cap, 2) columella cells can maintain their characteristic distribution of ER in microgravity only if they are exposed previously to gravity, and 3) gravity is necessary to distribute the ER in columella cells of this cultivar of Z. mays...|$|E
40|$|The {{plant cell}} {{wall is a}} dynamic {{structure}} that plays important roles in growth and development and in the interactions of plants with their environment and other organisms. We have used monoclonal antibodies that recognize different carbohydrate epitopes present in plant cell-wall polysaccharides to locate these epitopes in roots of developing Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. An epitope in the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I is observed in the walls of epidermal and cortical cells in mature parts of the root. This epitope is inserted into the walls in a developmentally regulated manner. Initially, the epitope is observed in atrichoblasts and later appears in trichoblasts and simultaneously in cortical cells. A terminal [alpha]-fucosyl-containing epitope is present in {{almost all of the}} cell walls in the root. An arabinosylated (1 -> 6) -[beta]-galactan epitope is also found in all of the cell walls of the root with the exception of lateral <b>root-cap</b> cell walls. It is striking that these three polysaccharide epitopes are not uniformly distributed (or accessible) within the walls of a given cell, nor are these epitopes distributed equally across the two walls laid down by adjacent cells.

40|$|A Ca 2 + channel from root-tip endomembranes {{of garden}} cress (Lepidium sativum L.) (LCC 1) was {{characterized}} using the planar lipid-bilayer technique. Investigation of single-channel recordings revealed that LCC 1 is voltage gated and strongly rectifying. In symmetrical 50 mm CaCl 2 solutions, the single-channel conductance was 24 picosiemens. LCC 1 showed a moderate selectivity for Ca 2 + over K+ (9. 4 : 1) and was permeable {{for a range}} of divalent cations (Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, and Sr 2 +). In contrast to Bryonia dioica Ca 2 + channel 1, a Ca 2 +-selective channel from the endoplasmic reticulum of touch-sensitive tendrils, LCC 1 showed no bursting channel activity and had a low open probability and mean open time (2. 83 ms at 50 mV). Inhibitor studies demonstrated that LCC 1 is blocked by micromolar concentrations of erythrosin B (inhibitor concentration for 50 % inhibition [IC 50] = 1. 8 μm) and the trivalent cations La 3 + (IC 50 = 5 μm) and Gd 3 + (IC 50 = 10 μm), whereas verapamil showed no blocking effect.

40|$|The {{development}} of the post-embryonic root epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana is described. Clonal analysis has identified three sets of initials {{that give rise to}} the columella root cap cells, epidermis and lateral <b>root-cap</b> cells, and the cells of the cortex and endodermis respectively. The mature epidermis is composed of two cell types, root hair cells (derived from trichoblasts) and non-hair cells (derived from atrichoblasts). These cells are arranged in sixteen or more discrete files. Each hair cell file overlies the anticlinal (radial) wall of the underlying cortical cells and is separated from the next by one or two non-hair files. The root hair forms as a tip-growing projection from the basal end of the trichoblast i. e. the end nearest the root meristem. The non-hair epidermal cells are significantly longer than the hair forming cells and are located over the outer periclinal (tangential) wall of the underlying cortical cells. The size difference between the two cell types is apparent in the cell division zone before hairs form. This suggests that the signals required for the differentiation of the root epidermis function in the meristem itself. Ectopic hairs are present in the ctr 1 root epidermis suggesting that a Raf protein kinase {{may play a role in}} pattern formation/differentiation in the root epidermis and that ethylene may be a diffusible signal involved in specifying pattern in the root epidermis...|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the {{developing}} root of Arabidopsis is described using conventional histological techniques, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The root meristem is derived from cells of the hypophysis and adjacent cells of the embryo proper. The postembryonic organization of the root is apparent in the mature embryo and is maintained in the growing primary root after germination. Cell number and location is relatively invariant in the primary root, with 8 cortical and endodermal cell files but more variable numbers of pericycle and epidermal cells. The organisation of cells in lateral roots {{is similar to that}} of the primary root but with more variability in the numbers of cell files in each layer. [3 H]thymidine labeling of actively growing roots indicates that a quiescent centre of four central cells (derived from the hypophysis) is located between the root cap columella and the stele. This plate of four cells is surrounded by three groups of cells in, proximal, distal and lateral positions. The labeling patterns of these cells suggest that they are the initials for the files of cells that comprise the root. They give rise to four sets of cell files: the stele, the cortex and endodermis, the epidermis and lateral <b>root-cap</b> and the columella. A model of meristem activity is proposed based on these data. This description of Arabidopsis root structure underpins future work on the developmental genetics of root morphogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The O 2 {{budget of}} {{seagrasses}} {{is a complex}} interaction between several sources and sinks, which is strongly regulated by light availability and mass transfer over the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) surrounding the plant. Epiphyte growth on leaves may thus strongly affect the O 2 availability of the seagrass plant and its capability to aerate its rhizosphere as a defence against plant toxins. We used electrochemical and fiber-optic microsensors to quantify the O 2 flux, DBL and light microclimate around leaves with and without filamentous algal epiphytes. We also quantified the below-ground radial O 2 loss from roots (~ 1 mm from the root-apex) to elucidate how this below-ground oxic microzone was affected {{by the presence of}} epiphytes. Epiphyte-cover on seagrass leaves (~ 21 % areal cover) resulted in reduced light quality and quantity for photosynthesis, thus leading to reduced plant fitness. A ~ 4 times thicker diffusive boundary layer around leaves with epiphyte-cover impeded gas (and nutrient) exchange with the surrounding water-column and thus the amount of O 2 passively diffusing into the leaves in darkness. During light exposure of the leaves, radial oxygen loss from the below-ground tissue was ~ 2 times higher from plants without epiphyte-cover. In contrast, no O 2 was detectable at the surface of the <b>root-cap</b> tissue of plants with epiphyte-cover during darkness, leaving the plants more susceptible to sulphide intrusion. Epiphyte growth on seagrass leaves thus negatively affects the light climate and O 2 uptake in darkness, hampering the plants performance and thereby reducing the oxidation capability of its below-ground tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} plant organs to use gravity {{as a guide}} for growth, named gravitropism, has been {{recognized}} for over two centuries. This growth response to the environment contributes significantly to the upward growth of shoots and the downward growth of roots commonly observed throughout the plant kingdom. Root gravitropism has received {{a great deal of attention}} because there is a physical separation between the primary site for gravity sensing, located in the root cap, and the site of differential growth response, located in the elongation zones (EZs). Hence, this system allows identification and characterization of different phases of gravitropism, including gravity perception, signal transduction, signal transmission, and curvature response. Recent studies support some aspects of an old model for gravity sensing, which postulates that <b>root-cap</b> columellar amyloplasts constitute the susceptors for gravity perception. Such studies have also allowed the identification of several molecules that appear to function as second messengers in gravity signal transduction and of potential signal transducers. Auxin has been implicated as a probable component of the signal that carries the gravitropic information between the gravity-sensing cap and the gravity-responding EZs. This has allowed the identification and characterization of important molecular processes underlying auxin transport and response in plants. New molecular models can be elaborated to explain how the gravity signal transduction pathway might regulate the polarity of auxin transport in roots. Further studies are required to test these models, as well as to study the molecular mechanisms underlying a poorly characterized phase of gravitropism that is independent of an auxin gradient...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the role of the AUX 1 LAX family of auxin import carriers during the establishment of the embryonic root cell pattern. METHODS: The radicle apex of single and multiple aux 1 lax mutant mature embryos was used to evaluate the effect of this gene family upon embryonic root organization and root cap size, cell number and cell size. KEY RESULTS: It was demonstrated here that mutations within the AUX 1 LAX family are associated with changes in cell pattern establishment in the embryonic quiescent centre and columella. aux 1 lax mutants have a larger radicle root cap than the wild type and this is associated with a significant increase in the <b>root-cap</b> cell number, average cell size, or both. Extreme disorganization of the radicle apex was observed among quadruple aux 1 lax 1 lax 2 lax 3 mutant embryos, but not in single aux 1 null or in lax 1, lax 2 and lax 3 single mutants, indicating redundancy within the AUX 1 LAX family. CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that the AUX 1 LAX family of auxin influx facilitators participates in the establishment of cell pattern within the apex of the embryonic root in a gene-redundant fashion. It was demonstrated that aux 1 lax mutants are affected in cell proliferation and cell growth within the radicle tip.
