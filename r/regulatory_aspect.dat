5000|$|BRCA1 {{is part of}} {{a complex}} that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. The strands of the DNA double helix are {{continuously}} breaking as they become damaged. Sometimes only one strand is broken, sometimes both strands are broken simultaneously. DNA cross-linking agents are an important source of chromosome/DNA damage. Double-strand breaks occur as intermediates after the crosslinks are removed, and indeed, biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been identified to be responsible for Fanconi Anemia, Complementation Group S, a genetic disease associated with hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. BRCA1 {{is part of a}} protein complex that repairs DNA when both strands are broken. When this happens, it is difficult for the repair mechanism to [...] "know" [...] how to replace the correct DNA sequence, and there are multiple ways to attempt the repair. The double-strand repair mechanism in which BRCA1 participates is homologous recombination, where the repair proteins utilize a template of the identical homologous intact sequence from a sister chromatid, from a homologous chromosome, or from the same chromosome (depending on cell cycle phase). This DNA repair takes place with the DNA in the cell nucleus, wrapped around the histone. Several proteins, including BRCA1, arrive at the histone-DNA complex for this repair. <b>Regulatory</b> <b>aspect</b> to BRCA1 nuclear ⁄ non-nuclear distribution was first shown by the laboratory of Dr Rao in 1997 ...|$|E
50|$|H.R. 1415 has 13 sections, {{the first}} of which names the act as the “Clean Diamond Trade Act”. The Act defines the {{motivation}} behind the passage as due to the human rights issues associated with the rough diamond trade. It also addresses previous action that has been taken to address threats due to conflicts coming from rough diamond trade. The act mentions the United Nations Security Council prohibiting states from exporting weapons to countries affected by diamond conflicts, in addition to mandating that states prohibit importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone and Liberia (3). The United States subsequently restricted the importation of diamonds to those containing a certificate of origin. Section 4 describes the measures for the importation and exportation of rough diamonds, addressing prohibition of diamonds not controlled through the KPCS and the ability of the president to waive requirements in certain circumstances. In Section 5, the act discusses the <b>regulatory</b> <b>aspect,</b> emphasizing the importance of keeping full records of anyone attempting to import or export rough diamonds. Section 5c also describes the oversight procedures, but does not specify which Government agency is in charge of conducting annual reviews. Section 6 delegates importing authority to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and exporting authority to the Bureau of the Census. Section 8 deals with enforcement, and describes the penalties for violating any aspect of the act. This section specifies a penalty not exceeding $10,000 for anyone who violates an aspect of the act, and not more than $50,000 or 10 years in prison for anyone who willfully violates the act. Section 10 promotes the importance of the executive branch publishing statistics on imports and exports of rough diamonds, and Section 11 mandates that annual reports be released every 12 months, although it does not specify who will be compiling these reports to give to congress. Section 12 states that 2 years after the effective date of the act, the Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report on the effectiveness of the act, in addition to any recommendations of modifications to the act.|$|E

The main issue raised is the critical evaluation of probiotics in randomized clinical trials for conditions such as: infectious diarrhoea; antibiotic associated diarrhoea; inflammatory bowel disease; pouchitis and diverticulitis; H. pylori infection; irritable bowel syndrome. Safety of probiotics is mentioned with respect to susceptible individuals and bacterial translocation. As a conclusion the authors again recall the strain specific actions of probiotics in different clinical situations and that so far probiotics play a role in rotaviral and post antibiotic diarrhoea and pouchitis.

40|$|Plasticity in {{the brain}} is {{essential}} for maintaining memory and learning and {{is associated with the}} dynamic membrane trafficking of AMPA receptors. EphrinB proteins, ligands for EphB receptor tyrosine kinases, are transmembrane molecules with signaling capabilities that are required for spine morphogenesis, synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe a molecular mechanism for ephrinB 2 function in controlling synaptic transmission. EphrinB 2 signaling is critical for the stabilization of AMPA receptors at the cellular membrane. Mouse hippocampal neurons from conditional ephrinB 2 knockouts showed enhanced constitutive internalization of AMPA receptors and reduced synaptic transmission. Mechanistically, glutamate receptor interacting proteins bridge ephrinB ligands and AMPA receptors. Moreover, this function involved a <b>regulatory</b> <b>aspect</b> of ephrinB reverse signaling that involves the phosphorylation of a single serine residue in their cytoplasmic tails. In summary, our findings uncover a model of cooperative AMPA receptor and ephrinB reverse signaling at the synapse...|$|E

40|$|Signaling mucins are cell {{adhesion}} molecules that activate RAS/RHO guanosine triphosphatases and their effector mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. We {{found that the}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae mucin Msb 2 p, which functions {{at the head of}} the Cdc 42 p-dependent MAPK pathway that controls filamentous growth, is processed into secreted and cell-associated forms. Cleavage of the extracellular inhibitory domain of Msb 2 p by the aspartyl protease Yps 1 p generated the active form of the protein by a mechanism incorporating cellular nutritional status. Activated Msb 2 p functioned through the tetraspan protein Sho 1 p to induce MAPK activation as well as cell polarization, which involved the Cdc 42 p guanine nucleotide exchange factor Cdc 24 p. We postulate that cleavage-dependent activation is a general feature of signaling mucins, which brings to light a novel <b>regulatory</b> <b>aspect</b> of this class of signaling adhesion molecule...|$|E

Information systems within the healthcare sector is often viewed as medical devices rather than just systems or services. These medical devices are thoroughly regulated by laws, standards and certifications. In this study I participated in an innovative project that aimed to bring new life and use to the old fashioned patient journal by giving it a visual representation through the use of an avatar. I aimed to study the effects of regulators connected with the patient journal as a source of information for the innovative project. I drew upon Actor-network theory as a theoretical lens to trace the patient journal and connect it with <b>regulatory</b> <b>aspects</b> important to innovative projects such as the studied scenario. I also aimed to research the possibilities and obstacles provided with today’s IT-climate in Swedish healthcare. I found that <b>regulatory</b> <b>aspects</b> according to Actor-network theory proved to be an actor that stabilizes the network that is the innovative project.

Methods: These are the differentially expressed proteins in lung cancer dataset. Initially, the structural template for these proteins is identified from structural database using homology search and perform homology modelling approach to predict its native 3 D structure. Three-dimensional model obtained was validated using Ramachandran plot analysis to find {{the reliability of the}} model. Results: Four proteins were differentially expressed and were significant proteins in causing lung cancer. Among the four proteins, Matrixmetallo proteinase (P 39900) had a known 3 D structure and hence was not considered for modelling.

40|$|High-affinity iron {{acquisition}} in Bacillus subtilis {{is mediated}} via the bacillibactin catechole siderophore pathway. Three {{of the four}} essential pathway steps, bacillibactin synthesis, Fe-bacillibactin uptake, and Fe-bacillibactin hydrolysis have been characterized previously. The functional and regulatory components for bacillibactin secretion, the second step of the siderophore pathway, remained unknown. In this study, the screening of a B. subtilis exporter mutant library led to {{the identification of the}} YmfE major facilitator superfamily (MFS) -type transporter as a target for bacillibactin export. Analysis of iron-limited ymfE mutant cultures displayed an eightfold reduced bacillibactin secretion and, on the other hand, a 25 -fold increased secretion of the bacillibactin precursor 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoate. Investigation of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>aspect</b> revealed that bacillibactin secretion is, in contrast to all other components of the pathway, independent of the ferric uptake repressor Fur.
