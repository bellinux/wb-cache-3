40|$|This study {{describes}} the exchange flow between a region with open {{water and a}} region with a partial-depth porous obstruction, which represents the thermally-driven exchange that occurs between open water and floating vegetation. The partial-depth porous obstruction represents the <b>root</b> <b>layer,</b> which does not penetrate to the bed. Initially, a vertical wall separates the two regions, with fluid of higher density in the obstructed region and fluid of lower density in the open region. This density difference represents the influence of differential solar heating due to shading by the vegetation. For a range of root density and root depths, the velocity distribution is measured in the lab using PIV. When the vertical wall is removed, the less dense water flows into the obstructed region at the surface. This surface flow bifurcates into two layers, one flowing directly through the <b>root</b> <b>layer</b> and one flowing beneath the <b>root</b> <b>layer.</b> A flow directed out of the vegetated region occurs at the bed. A model is developed that predicts the flow rates within each layer based on energy considerations.

In this study, we aimed to quantify plant-available N in thawing permafrost soils of subarctic peatlands. We compared plant-available N-pools and -fluxes in near-surface permafrost (0 - 10 cm below the thawfront) to those taken from a current <b>rooting</b> zone <b>layer</b> (5 - 15 cm depth) across five representative peatlands in subarctic Sweden.

We studied the emergence, survival and reproductive success of the cyst nematode Heterodera arenaria, a root feeding-specialist that occurs in mobile dunes. The host plants of H. arenaria are buried regularly by windblown sand to which the plants respond by upward clonal expansion. As a consequence, the nematodes have to migrate upwards in the soil profile to find new roots for feeding and reproduction, however, not all juveniles migrate. We tested the hypothesis that the offspring from migrated individuals would perform better than from individuals that remained behind and discuss the advantage of this dualistic behavior. The individual performance of the cyst nematodes was better when their juveniles migrated to the new <b>root</b> <b>layer.</b> In the field, in the new <b>root</b> <b>layer</b> the cysts had more eggs and juveniles than cysts collected from the 1 -year-old <b>root</b> <b>layer.</b> Under controlled conditions, cysts from the new <b>root</b> <b>layer</b> released their first juveniles faster than cysts from the 1 -year-old <b>root</b> <b>layer.</b> However, the juveniles that do not migrate might be crucial for the persistence of the population.

However, it turns out that in this model rainfall intermittency and vegetation feedbacks have almost a mutually exclusive role: whenever one of these two components is present, the addition of the other does not further affect vegetation dynamics in a significant way...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of aquatic vegetation {{is a common}} feature in shallow water systems. It alters {{the dynamics of the}} system by producing additional drag and by generating differential heating between regions of vegetation and open water through the shading it provides. The differential heating creates density differences that drive flow between vegetated and open regions. This thesis presents a series of experiments that explored the magnitude and structure of these exchange flows for different forcing and vegetation distributions. The first project considers emergent vegetation with flow forced by a constant density difference. After a short inertial period, the discharge is controlled by the vegetative drag, and the current entering the vegetation, as well as the total discharge, decrease with time. The toe velocity of the current moving into the open region is controlled only by inertia and is constant in time. The second project considers emergent vegetation with a temporally increasing density difference, which was generated by a constant heat input. In the vegetated region, both the buoyancy and vegetative drag experienced by the intruding current increase linearly in time, offsetting on another and resulting in a current velocity moving into the vegetation that is constant in time. The thickness of this intruding layer is set by the length scale of light penetration. The third project considers a mat of floating vegetation whose roots penetrate a fraction of the water depth. The flow was driven by a constant density difference (constant g'). The flow entering the vegetated side bifurcates, with some flow moving through the <b>root</b> <b>layer</b> and the remaining flow displaced downward beneath this layer. The fraction of flow going through and beneath the <b>root</b> <b>layer</b> is allocated such that the conversion from potential energy to kinetic energy is maximized in the system. Finally, this work shows that thermally-driven exchange flow can flush a significant portion of a vegetated sidearm during a diurnal cycle and thus can {{play a crucial role in}} the mass balance and distribution in a natural water body. by Xueyan Zhang.

This {{study was conducted in}} the Illwald forest in the Rhine Plain (eastern France) to assess the removal of nutrients from groundwater in a regularly flooded area. We compared both forest and meadow ecosystems on clayey-silty soils with an anoxic horizon (pseudogley) at 1 • 5 – 2 m depth (eutric gley soil) and a forest ecosystem on a clayey-silty fluviosoil rich in organic matter with a gley at 0 • 5 m depth (calcaric gley soil). Piezometers were used to measure the nutrient concentrations in the groundwater at 2 m depth in the <b>root</b> <b>layer</b> and at 4 • 5 m depth, below the <b>root</b> <b>layer.</b> Lower concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in groundwater were observed under forest than under meadow, which could be explained by more efficient plant uptake by woody species than herbaceous plants. Thus NO 3 -N inputs by river floods were reduced by 73 % in the shallow groundwater of the forested ecosystem, and only by 37 % in the meadow. Compared with the superficial groundwater layer, the lowest level of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N) and the highest level of ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N) were measured in the deep layer (under the gley horizon at 2 • 5 m depth), which suggests that the reducing potential of the anoxic horizon in the gley soils contributes to the reduction of nitrate. Nitrate concentrations were higher in the groundwater of the parcel rich in organic matter than in the one poorer in organic matter. Phosphate (PO 4 -P) concentrations in both shallow and deep groundwater are less than 62 to 76 % of those found in surface water which can be related to the retention capacity of the clay colloids of these soils. Moreover, the temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater are directly related to variations in groundwater level during an annual hydrological cycle. Our results suggest that variations in groundwater level regulate spatio-temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater {{as a result of the}} oxidation–reduction status of soil, which creates favourable or unfavourable conditions for nutrient bioavailability.

3000|$|On the {{contrary}} we propose an attractive alternative solution, {{which does not}} require any parameter to be tuned, once the architecture has been chosen. Indeed, we suggest to perform the full-complexity search over the whole QAM constellation for the carriers affected by the worst-case noise (in the following, [...] "worst carriers" [...] for brevity), limiting the search {{for all the other}} ones to a square subset with a fixed number of points. This way, we always reserve the more robust (full-complexity) algorithm to the carriers affected by higher noise powers at the <b>root</b> <b>layer.</b> This significantly reduces the probability that a transmitted point falls outside the reduced square subset of Figure 2 a.

In the drying moist habitat, the ground water was below the depth of 100 cm in the vegetation season and was periodically inaccessible for the meadow plants. Unfavourable water conditions in drying moist habitat have caused the condensation of peat mass and the decrease of water capacity of soil. In time, the progressive changes of physical and water properties effected negatively the natural values in post-boggy ecosystems. The changes of water properties caused the disappearance of many flora species, often classified as rare or protected species for example Epipatis palustris (L.) Crantz.

Lateral roots are its very important part which creates majority of the main absorbent portion of the plant surface in the rhizosphere. One of the few described mutants (except the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana) with impaired development of lateral roots in early postembryonic development is maize (Zea mays) mutant lrt 1 (lateral rootless 1).

The structure of primordia, also their emergence and later development is strongly affected.
