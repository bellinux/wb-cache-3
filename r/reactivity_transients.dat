40|$|In 1995, {{less than}} a year after {{learning}} of new test results on <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients,</b> this generic issue was initiated to address the effects of high-burnup fuel operation on fuel damage limits used in regulation. Initial attention was on <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients,</b> which were the subject of the specific test results available at that time, but Generic Issue (GI) - 170 was generalized to cover all fuel damage criteria used in licensing. At the time GI- 170 was initiated, it was associated with a High-Burnup Fuel Action Plan generated in NRR. Subsequently, an Agency Program Plan for High-Burnup Fuel was developed jointly by RES and NRR. 1 After that, NRR closed out its High-Burnup Fuel Action Plan stating that the action plan had met its purpose. 2 Three general issues were addressed in the GI information provided initially for GI- 170 and these were (1) <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients,</b> (2) loss-of-coolant accidents, and (3) specified acceptable fuel design limits. 3 In the subsequent agency program plan, reactivity accidents were further described to cover PWR rod-ejection accidents and BWR power oscillations without scram...|$|E

Accidents which {{have to be considered}} are core heat-up, <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients,</b> water or air ingress and primary circuit depressurization. The main effort of this paper belongs to water/air ingress and depressurization, which requires consideration of fission product plate out under normal operation conditions; for the latter it is clearly shown, that absorption (penetration) mechanisms are much less important than assumed sometimes in the past.

40|$|Recent {{availability}} of high performance computers and computational methods {{together with the}} continuing increase in operational experience imposes revising some operational constrains and conservative safety margins. The application of Best-Estimate (BE) method constitutes a real necessity in the safety and design analysis and allows getting more realistic simulation of the processes taking place during the steady state operation and transients. In comparison to the conservative approaches, the application of Best-Estimate methods results in the mitigation of the constraining limits in design and operation. This paper {{presents the results of}} the application of the RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3 system thermal-hydraulic code to the German FRJ- 2 research reactor for a <b>reactivity</b> <b>transient,</b> which has been analyzed in the past using the verified system code CATHENA [1], [2], [3]. The work mainly aims checking the capability of RELAP 5 [4] for research reactor transient analysis by the comparison {{of the results of the}} two codes and including modeling basis and analytical approaches. According to the existing references RELAP 5 applications are concentrated on the transient analysis of nuclear power systems. The considered case consists of a simulation related to a hypothetical fast <b>reactivity</b> <b>transient,</b> which is assumed to be caused by the failure of one shutdown arm. The case has been chosen due to the importance of the models for the precise description of the complex phenomenon of subcooled boiling and two phase flow taking place during the transient. For this purpose, the fuel element assembly was modeled in detail according to design data. The primary circuit was included in the whole model in order to consider the interaction with individual fuel elements with core. In general the results of the two codes are in agreement and comparable during the initial phase of the transient. After reaching the flow regime with fully developed nucleate boiling and two phase flow RELAP 5 exhibits a different prediction for the course of the transient and thermalhydraulic quantities (void fraction and fuel temperature). In this respect the models, constitutive relations and correlations employed in the simulations seem to have influence on the course of the transient...|$|R

A {{thorough understanding of}} different interacting physical phenomena is necessary to avoid underestimation and overestimation of consequences of off-normal transients in the reactor safety analysis results. This feature requires a multiphysics reactor simulation model. In this context, a coupled dynamics model based on a multiphysics formulation is developed indigenously for the transient analysis of large pressurized VVER reactors. Major simplifications are employed in the model by making several assumptions based on the physics of individual phenomenon. Space and time grids are optimized to minimize the computational bulk. The capability of the model is demonstrated by solving a series of international (AER) benchmark problems for VVER reactors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to realize the full core {{conversion}} from the use of High Enriched Uranium (HEU) fuels to the use of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) fuels in Kyoto University Research Reactor (KUR). Although the conversion of nuclear energy sources is required to keep the safety margins and reactor reliability based on KUR HEU core, the uranium density (3. 2 gU/cm 3) and enrichment (20 %) of LEU fuel (U 3 Si 2 –AL) are quite different from the uranium density (0. 58 gU/cm 3) and enrichment (93 %) of HEU fuel (U–Al), which may result in the changes of heat transfer response and neutronic characteristic in the core. So it is necessary to objectively re-assess the feasibility of LEU silicide fuel core in KUR by using various numerical simulation codes. This paper established a detailed simulation model for the LEU silicide core and provided the safety analyses for the <b>reactivity</b> insertion <b>transients</b> in the core by using EUREKA- 2 /RR code. Although the EUREKA- 2 /RR code is a proven and trusted code, its validity was further confirmed by the comparison with the predictions from another two thermal hydraulic codes, COOLOD-N 2 and THYDE-W at steady state operation. The steady state simulation also verified the feasibility of KUR to be operated at rated thermal power of 5 MW. In view of the core loading patterns, the operational conditions and characteristics of the reactor protection system in KUR, the accidental control rod withdrawal transients at natural circulation and forced circulation modes, the cold water injection induced <b>reactivity</b> insertion <b>transient</b> and the <b>reactivity</b> insertion <b>transient</b> due to removal of irradiation samples were conservatively analyzed and their transient characteristic parameters such as core power, fuel temperature, cladding temperature, primary coolant temperature and departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) due to the different ways and magnitudes of reactivity insertions were focused in this study. The analytical results indicate that the quick power excursions initiated by the reactivity insertion can be safely suppressed by the reactor protection system of KUR in various initial power levels and different operational modes (natural circulation and forced circulation modes). No boiling and no burnout on fuel cladding surface and no blister in the fuel meat happens and KUR is safe in all of these <b>reactivity</b> insertion <b>transients</b> if the reactor protection system of KUR works in its minimum degree...|$|R

40|$|The {{non-linear}} {{target tracking}} for fast transients using particle filtering or Sequential Monte Carlo based technique usually {{suffers from the}} common problem of sample impoverishment. The sample impoverishment has been observed to become much severe, for compact measurement densities. In this work, we propose a hybrid estimator for nonlinear target tracking which utilizes the strengths of both Sequential Monte Carlo approach and minimax estimator. The robust H-infinity filtering minimizes the maximum gain from disturbance to the estimation error. The estimation is performed in two phases; the first phase enables the state transitions of samples through Monte Carlo method; the second phase updates the samples through H-infinity correction using Gaussian observation density function. We validate the proposed method for fast <b>reactivity</b> <b>transient</b> in large core Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor model which occurs in a postulated accident of primary heat transport system integrity loss. The neutron flux variation {{with respect to the}} reactivity in large core reactor is approximately described by a set of point kinetic equations (PKEs).

40|$|A recent concern arose {{over the}} {{treatment}} of uncertainty associated with the K-Reactor axial power monitors (APMs). There are nine axial power monitor rods located at various positions in the K-Reactor core. By comparing the output of one sensor {{near the top of}} the rod to the output of another sensor near the bottom of the rod, the relative ratio of the neutron flux from the top to the bottom of the core can be determined. This ratio is called the roof-top-ratio (RTR) and is the output of a top sensor (Sensor 2) divided by the output of a bottom sensor (Sensor 6). The RTR is important to the safety analyses because when the RTR is maintained within certain ranges, the severity of <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients</b> is limited. There are uncertainties associated with the equipment`s ability to measure the true roof top ratio. It was determined recently that sufficient uncertainty was not accounted for either in reactor operation or in the safety analyses. The concern about uncertainty was addressed for three separate issues. One issue dear with the linear response of the sensors for power ranges planned for K-Reactor operation. The second issue dear with overall uncertainty in the RTR channel. The third issue dear with apparent large ranges in confidence bands for the RTR at low reactor powers as represented by original vendor data. Plots of sparse vendor data indicated unacceptably large uncertainties in RTR would have to be accounted for at the power ranges planned for K-Reactor operation. These concerns were brought to management`s attention through the existing procedures for notification, irrespective of their potential impact on the restart schedule. Analyses have been completed to resolve the APM issues described above, and work is progressing to take the needed steps to change operational procedures...|$|E

40|$|The HTR-Module (High Temperature Reactor) is {{supposed}} to be a reactor, which comprises ofthe complete know-how ofHTR-technology. The consequent goal of a passive and inherent safety philosophy in reactor design has been followed. The question remains, however, whether this is also sufficient in the Gase of a spontaneous failure of the reactor pressure vessel, which is not designed as burst-proof Due to this, the assumption of the hypothetical reactor pressure vessel failure is an unalterable boundary condition for all considerations in this thesis. The first part evaluates the non-nuclear effects. Through the means of known investigations of explosions and burst processes, a comparison measure for the HTR-Module is developed. More detailed investigations of the dynamic fragment behaviour are made with the new computer programs FRAG 2 and Xerxes. In the following, it is investigated in which way the burst process also implies nuclear effects. A limitation is made to be time period immediately following the burst of the vessel, meaning that corrosion of the fuel elements is not regarded and the void fraction of the pebble bed remains constant. Thus the calculated reactivities are Input data for the analysis of the stress of the Coated Particles in the fuel elements. The fast <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients</b> are calculated with means of the pointkinetic program HTRKIN and then transformed to transient stresses with use of the new program FAST 2. The stresses of the CP-laysers of interest are rated with the use of comparison values. Additionally, an investigation ofthe longterm behaviour is made in such a way, that the resulting temperature increase by the reactivity input is used as an input data for the thermohydraulic analysis with regard to the changed core structure. The result of the investigations is that the shortterm transients, which will occur without any outer influence, have a relatively small hazardous potential in comparison to experimental results. The longterm transients can be handled through a fitting accident management. The way in which the possible shortterm transients result in a remaining prefailure of the Coated Particles and negatively influence the longterm behaviour still needs to be considered...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of new fast {{reactors}} may be needed earlier than foreseen in the Generation IV plans. According to the median forecast of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios commissioned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control nuclear power will increase {{by a factor of}} four by 2050. The drivers for this expected boost are the increasing energy demand in developing countries, energy security, but also climate concerns. However, staying with a once-through cycle will lead to both a substantially increased amount of high-level nuclear waste and an upward pressure on the price of uranium and even concerns about its availability in the coming decades. Therefore, it appears wise to accelerate the development of fast reactors and efficient re-processing technologies. In this paper, two fast reactor systems are discussed—the sodium-cooled fast reactor, which has already been built and can be further improved, and the lead-cooled fast reactor that could be developed relatively soon. An accelerated development of the latter is possible due to the sizeable experience on lead/bismuth eutectic coolant in Russian Alpha-class submarine reactors and the research efforts on accelerator-driven systems in the EU and other countries. First, comparative calculations on critical masses, fissile enrichments and burn-up swings of mid-sized SFRs and LFRs (600 MWe) are presented. Monte Carlo transport and burn-up codes were used in the analyses. Moreover, Doppler and coolant temperature and axial fuel expansion reactivity coefficients were also evaluated with MCNP and subsequently used in the European Accident Code- 2 to calculate <b>reactivity</b> <b>transients</b> and unprotected Loss-of-Flow (ULOF) and Loss-of-Heat Sink (ULOHS) accidents. Further, ULOFs as well as decay heat removal (protected Total Loss-of-Power, TLOP) were calculated with the STAR-CD CFD code for both systems. We show that LFRs and SFRs can be used both as burners and as self-breeders, homogeneously incinerating minor actinides. The tight pin lattice SFRs (P/D = 1. 2) appears to have a better neutron economy than wide channel LFRs (P/D = 1. 6), resulting in larger BOL actinide inventories and lower burn-up swings for LFRs. The reactivity burn-up swing of an LFR self-breeder employing BeO moderator pins could be limited to 1. 3 $ in 1 year. For a 600 MWe LFR burner, LWR-to-burner support ratio was about two for (U, TRU) O 2 -fuelled system, while it increased to approximately 2. 8 when (Th, TRU) O 2 fuel was employed. The corresponding figures for an SFR were somewhat lower. The calculations revealed that LFRs have an advantage over SFRs in coping with the investigated severe accident initiators (ULOF, ULOHS, TLOP). The reason is better natural circulation behavior of LFR systems and the much higher boiling temperature of lead. A ULOF accident in an LFR only leads to a 220 K coolant outlet temperature increase whereas for an SFR the coolant may boil. Regarding the economics, the LFR seems to have an advantage since it does not require an intermediate coolant circuit. However, it was also proposed to avoid an intermediate coolant circuit in an SFR by using a supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle. But in an LFR, the reduced concern about air and water ingress may decrease its cost further. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|E

40|$|Accelerator Driven systems (ADS) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as safe and reliable nuclear systems for energy production and, especially, for the transmutation of nuclear radioactive waste, thus contributing to a safer and non-proliferating use of nuclear energy for peaceful uses. The ADS can operate at a higher safety level, since, being driven by an external source, is always characterized by a sub-criticality condition and can thus be shut down by simply switching off the source. To ensure that the system always remain at a sub-critical level, an on-line reactivity monitoring is needed during both normal operation and transient conditions. Research programs such as MUSE, FREYA and GUINEVERE {{were involved in the}} development of reactivity measurement methods for ADS. At Politecnico di Torino a method that is suitable for both on-line and off-line reactivity monitoring has been developed and tested. The method has been given the name MAρTA (Monitoring Algorithm for <b>Reactivity</b> <b>Transient</b> Analysis). The method is based on an inverse point kinetic approach which reconstructs the reactivity from the system neutron flux or power measurement obtained instantaneously by a localized neutron detector. The adoption of point kinetics for the reactivity reconstruction is due to the simplicity of the mathematical formulation of the inverse approach. However, the accuracy of the reactivity prediction by point kinetics can deteriorate owing to spatial and spectral effects. Furthermore the kinetic parameters are needed through evaluations or independent measurements. The research activity during the Ph. D. program has been devoted to assess the MAρTA method for reactivity predictions using computationally simulated experiments, evaluated by means of time-dependent diffusion calculations. A technique to improve the prediction when strong spatial and spectral effects are present is proposed and tested. A method for the measurement of the ratio between the effective fraction of delayed neutrons and the effective mean prompt generation time through oscillated experiments has also been proposed and tested.

40|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{of small}} and medium size are generally described by point kinetics model, however, this model is not valid {{in case of a}} large reactor, because in that flux shape under-goes appreciable variation with time. The behaviour of large reactor core can be explained with reasonable accuracy by spatial model like nodal model, which considers the reactor to be divided into number of regions or nodes. The thermal feedbacks which introduce nonlinearity into the problem, should be considered for realistic modeling. The spatial model of 540 -MWe PHWR developed in [4] is augmented with the dynamics of coolant and fuel temperatures and a 72 nd-order model is obtained. As working with such a large model is difficult {{from the point of view}} of numerical computations, the new model having 14 inputs and 14 outputs, is suitably reduced by aggregation technique to obtain a 26 th-order reduced model, which is more suitable to handle. The design of spatial controller by a state feedback based on reduced model needs the availability of all the states of the system for feedback purpose. As all the states of the reactor are not accessible for measurement, one has to resort to output feedback. Also, as the stability is not guaranteed by static output feedback, here the spatial controller is designed by periodic output feedback which is static in nature and at the same time guarantees complete closed-loop pole assignability. The various zones in a large reactor are coupled and a change in the control input to any zone causes respective change in the neutron flux of the other neighbouring zones, which may not be desirable. Therefore, a decentralized controller would serve as a better option, as it ensures that the input to any zone affects corresponding zone only and other zones are not affected by it. The above idea of periodic output feedback controller design yields a gain matrix with large magnitude, which amplifies measurement noise and is difficult to implement practically. Hence, it is desirable to keep the gain low. This objective is suitably expressed as LMI problem and putting appropriate design constraints, a better gain is obtained.

40|$|The 2 -oxoacid {{dehydrogenase}} complexes (ODHc) {{consist of}} multiple copies of three enzyme components: E 1, a 2 -oxoacid decarboxylase; E 2, dihydrolipoyl acyl-transferase; and E 3, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, that together catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of 2 -oxoacids, {{in the presence}} of thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), coenzyme A (CoA), Mg 2 + and NAD+, to generate CO 2, NADH and the corresponding acyl-CoA. The structural scaffold of the complex is provided by E 2, with E 1 and E 3 bound around the periphery. The three principal members of the family are pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHc), 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDHc) and branched-chain 2 -oxo acid dehydrogenase (BCKDHc). In this review, we report application of NMR-based approaches to both mechanistic and structural issues concerning these complexes. These studies revealed the nature and <b>reactivity</b> of <b>transient</b> intermediates on the enzymatic pathway and provided site-specific information on the architecture and binding specificity of the domain interfaces using solubilized truncated domain constructs of the multi-domain E 2 component in its interactions with the E 1 and E 3 components. Where studied, NMR has also provided information about mobile loops and the possible relationship of mobility and catalysis...|$|R
40|$|A novel fully passive small modular {{superheated}} water reactor (SWR) for underwater deployment {{is designed}} to produce 160 MWe with steam at 500 ºC to increase the thermodynamic efficiency compared with standard light water reactors. The SWR design {{is based on a}} conceptual 400 -MWe integral SWR using the internally and externally cooled annular fuel (IXAF). The coolant boils in the external channels throughout the core to approximately the same quality as a conventional boiling water reactor and then the steam, instead of exiting the reactor pressure vessel, turns around and flows downward in the central channel of some IXAF fuel rods within each assembly and then flows upward {{through the rest of the}} IXAF pins in the assembly and exits the reactor pressure vessel as superheated steam. In this study, new cladding material to withstand high temperature steam in addition to the fuel mechanical and safety behavior is investigated. The steam temperature was found to depend on the thermal and mechanical characteristics of the fuel. The SWR showed a very different transient behavior compared with a boiling water reactor. The inter-play between the inner and outer channels of the IXAF was mainly beneficial except in the case of sudden <b>reactivity</b> insertion <b>transients</b> where additional control consideration is required...|$|R
40|$|Availability of fast {{computer}} resources nowadays has facilitated more in-depth modeling of complex engineering systems which involve strong multiphysics interactions. This multiphysics modeling {{is an important}} necessity in nuclear reactor safety studies where efforts are being made worldwide to combine the knowledge from all associated disciplines at one place to accomplish the most realistic simulation of involved phenomenon. On these lines coupled modeling of nuclear reactor neutron kinetics, fuel heat transfer and coolant transport is a regular practice nowadays for transient analysis of reactor core. However optimization between modeling accuracy and computational economy {{has always been a}} challenging task to ensure the adequate degree of reliability in such extensive numerical exercises. Complex reactor core modeling involves estimation of evolving 3 -D core thermal state, which in turn demands an expensive multichannel based detailed core thermal hydraulics model. A novel approach of power weighted coupling between core neutronics and thermal hydraulics presented in this work aims to reduce the bulk of core thermal calculations in core dynamics modeling to a significant extent without compromising accuracy of computation. Coupled core model has been validated against a series of international benchmarks. Accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed multiphysics model has been demonstrated by analyzing a <b>reactivity</b> initiated <b>transient...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: Advances {{in medical}} {{treatment}} {{in recent years}} have led to dramatically improved survival rates of children with severe congenital heart defects (CHD). However, very {{little is known about the}} psychological consequences for these children, particularly during and after the early period of invasive treatment. In this study, we investigated the extent to which the severity of the CHD affects the child's emotional reactivity at 6 months of age. METHOD: We linked prospective data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health with a nationwide medical CHD registry and identified 212 infants with CHD in a cohort of 61 299 infants. Mothers reported on their child's emotional reactivity at age 6 months by means of a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Infants with severe to moderate CHD had 60 % higher odds for severe emotional reactivity (cut-off at the 85 percentile) compared with healthy infants, after controlling for important maternal and child confounders. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to show elevated emotional reactivity in children with moderate to severe CHD, suggesting a need for special parental attention to soothe their distress. Follow-up studies will show whether this emotional <b>reactivity</b> is <b>transient</b> or an early marker of continuing emotional or behavioural problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} energy {{is growing in}} the world and the market of nuclear power is now once more expanding. Some issues of the current light-water {{reactors}} can be solved by the next generation of nuclear power, Generation IV, where sodium-cooled reactors are one of the candidates. Phénix was a French prototype sodium-cooled reactor, which is seen as a success. Although it did encounter an earlier unexperienced phenomenon, A. U. R. N., in which a negative <b>reactivity</b> <b>transient</b> followed by an oscillating behavior forced an automatic emergency shutdown of the reactor. This phenomenon lead to a lot of downtime of the reactor and is still unsolved. However, the most probable cause of the transients is radial movements of the core, referred to as core-flowering. This study has investigated the available documentation of the A. U. R. N. events. A simplified model of core-flowering was also created in order to simulate how radial expansion affects the reactivity of a sodium-cooled core. Serpent, which is a Monte-Carlo based simulation code, was chosen as calculation tool. Furthermore, a model of the Phénix core was successfully created and partly validated. The model of the core has a k_eff = 1. 00298 and a neutron flux of (8. 43 +- 0. 02) ! 10 ^ 15 neutrons/cm^ 2 at normal state. The result obtained from the simulations shows that an expansion of the core radius decreases the reactivity. A linear approximation of the result gave the relation: change in k_eff/core extension = - 60 pcm/mm. This value corresponds remarkably well to the around - 60 pcm/mm that was obtained from the dedicated core-flowering experiments in Phénix made by the CEA. Core-flowering can recreate similar signals to those registered during the A. U. R. N. events, though the absence of trace of core movements in Phénix speaks against this. However, if core-flowering is the sought answer, it can be avoided by design. The equipment that registered the A. U. R. N. events have proved to be insensitive to noise. Though, the high amplitude of the transients and their rapidness have made some researcher believe that the events are a combination of interference in the equipment of Phénix and a mechanical phenomenon. Regardless, the origin of A. U. R. N. seems to be bound to some specific parameter of Phénix due to the fact that the transients only have occurred in this reactor. A safety analysis made by an expert committee, appointed by CEA, showed that the A. U. R. N. events are not a threat to the safety of Phénix. However, the origin of these negative transients has to be found before any construction of a commercial size sodium-cooled fast reactor can begin. Thus, further research is needed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the preparation and {{properties of the}} first example of a synergic nanoantioxidant, obtained by different functionalizations of the external surface and the inner lumen of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). Trolox, a mimic of natural a-tocopherol, was selectively grafted on the HNT external surface; while quercetin, a natural polyphenolic antioxidant, was loaded into the inner lumen to afford a bi-functional nanoantioxidant, HNT–Trolox/Que, which was investigated for its <b>reactivity</b> with <b>transient</b> peroxyl radicals and a persistent 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical {{in comparison with the}} corresponding mono-functional analogues HNT–Trolox and HNT/Que. Both HNT–Trolox and HNT/Que showed good antioxidant performance in the inhibited autoxidation of organic substrates; however HNT–Trolox/Que protection by reaction with peroxyl radicals was 35 % higher in acetonitrile and 65 % in chlorobenzene, as compared to the expected performance based on the sum of contributions of NHT-Trolox and NHT/Que. Similar enhancement was observed also in the trapping of DPPH radicals. Synergism between the distinct antioxidant functions was based on the rapid reaction of externally exposed Trolox (rate constant with peroxyl radicals was 1. 1 106 M 1 s 1 and 9 104 M 1 s 1 respectively in chlorobenzene and acetonitrile, at 30 1 C), followed by its regeneration by quercetin released from the HNT lumen. The advantages of this novel nanoantioxidant are discussed...|$|R

The studies were designed to evaluate the reactivity coefficients and kinetics parameters of the reactor involved in the evolution of peak power <b>transients</b> by <b>reactivity</b> insertion accidents. It was done to show the trend of these reactivity coefficients {{as a function of the}} core size and fuel depletion for RP 10 cores. It was useful to get a better understanding of the progression of the <b>reactivity</b> insertion <b>transients</b> monitoring the critical thermal hydraulic parameters to avoid core damage. To confirm the accuracy of these studies the results were compared with experimental data of the SPERT I reactors. The microscopic cross section calculations were condensed to 15 broad groups using the WIMSD 4 M[1] code for all the isotopes from eight different regions that model seven different assemblies. The Supercell, multiplate and homogenized options were used to represent the different assemblies in the reactor. For diffusion theory calculations the DIF 3 D[2] code was used in planar geometry with input axial buckling to simulate axial leakage. To Benchmark the designed models used in the cross sections generation and the DIF 3 D designed model, the VIM[3] Monte Carlo code was used.
