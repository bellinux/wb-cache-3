There was also a big censorship flap going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our obscenity quota.|$|E

500|$|With U2 having {{released}} two standalone singles written {{during their}} sessions with him, Burton admitted in March 2014 {{that he did}} not know the fate of the record or if he was even still its producer. That month, Billboard reported that the album and a tour would be pushed back until 2015, which was denied by a spokesperson for the band. The report also stated that U2 had scheduled additional recording sessions with Tedder and Epworth; the band were seen shortly after with Epworth in London and believed to be working at Church Studios. In mid-2014, Li met up with the band in London to re-record her vocals for [...] "The Troubles" [...] after they decided to change the song's key. After trying a few different approaches to her vocals, Li said, [...] "We turned off all the music and sang only to the drums, so it was <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> to what the core of the song meant." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{have welcomed}} the simplistic controls, but its [...] "hyper-responsiveness", with the {{characters}} easily dashing and precise movements being difficult to perform, was {{expressed as a}} serious flaw of the game by GameSpot. With a milder criticism of controls, Bryn Williams of GameSpy commented that [...] "movement and navigation seems slightly too sensitive". The basis of Melees gameplay system is the battles between Nintendo characters, which has been suggested as being overly hectic; N-Europe questioned whether the gameplay is [...] "too Frantic?", even though they enjoyed the variety of modes on offer. Similarly, Nintendo Spin's Clark Nielsen stated that [...] "Melee was too fast for its own good", and [...] "skill was more about {{just being able to}} wrap your head around what was happening as opposed to <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> into the combat". In regards to the pace of the game, Edge commented that it even made gameplay features such as [...] "blocking" [...] redundant, as the player is not given enough time to react to an attack.|$|E

The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!"

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool", also by Lee, Moody, and Hodges, {{is about}} celebrities with false images. In a VH1 interview, Lee said: [...] "My little sister was <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> into these, I don't {{want to offend}} anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started {{dressing}} like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] "My Immortal", a piano rock ballad written by Moody with a bridge by Lee, {{is based on a}} short story Moody wrote; in the album booklet he dedicates the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. [...] "Haunted" [...] is also based on a Moody short story which was posted on the Evanescence fan forum, EvBoard.com. [...] "Tourniquet" [...] was originally written for Christian death metal band Soul Embraced, which included future Evanescence member Rocky Gray. [...] "Imaginary", a song from Evanescence's 1998 self-titled EP, was originally intended as Fallen fourth single. The midtempo [...] "Taking Over Mes lyrics are about Lee being consumed by another person's obsession with her. [...] "Hello" [...] remembers one of Lee's sisters, who died of an illness in 1987 at age three. The lyrics of [...] "My Last Breath" [...] explore emotional survival, with the lack of air a metaphor. [...] "Whisper" [...] features the Millennium Choir singing in Latin against muted guitars, but the choir is credited in the booklet by each individual vocalist rather than by the choir's official name.|$|E
500|$|Eight {{months after}} No Line on the Horizons release, Bono {{said he was}} {{disappointed}} with the album's sales. Regarding the lack of commercial appeal, Bono said, [...] "We weren't really in that mindset. We felt that the 'album' is almost an extinct species, and we [...] create a mood and feeling, and a beginning, middle and an end. And I suppose we've made a work that is a bit challenging {{for people who have}} grown up on a diet of pop stars." [...] Clayton agreed that the album's commercial reception must be [...] "challenged" [...] but said, [...] "the more interesting challenge is, 'What is rock 'n' roll in this changing world?' Because, to some extent, the concept of the music fan—the concept of the person who buys music and listens to music for the pleasure of music itself—is an outdated idea." [...] The Edge predicted that, despite its lack of a big hit, No Line on the Horizon would grow on listeners over time. He noted that the reaction to the songs in the live setting made U2 believe that the material was connecting with the fans, adding, [...] "There's a lot of records that make great first impressions. There might be one song that gets to be big on the radio, but they're not albums that people... play a lot. This is one that I gather from talking to people.... Four months later, they're saying, 'I'm <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> into the album now. McGuinness believed that the conditions of the music market were more responsible for the low sales than any decline in U2's popularity.|$|E

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's one of those big Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Deadly Premonition {{originates}} from Rainy Woods, a {{game that}} Access Games began work on in 2004. Rainy Woods debuted as a multi-platform title for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 game consoles during the Tokyo Game Show 2007, during which several video game journalists noted that the title shared strong similarities with the American supernatural television series Twin Peaks. It featured the [...] "young and very cynical" [...] FBI Special Agent David Young Henning as its protagonist. Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut, as, according to Suehiro, [...] "with the differences in memory allocation, lighting, and various other hardware differences between the platforms, {{there were a lot}} of large technological difficulties that prevented us from <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> started." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{this early}} {{attempt at a}} major long novel, DeLillo ended the decade with two shorter works. Players (1977), {{originally}} conceived as being [...] "based on {{what could be called}} the intimacy of language. What people who live together really sound like," [...] concerned the lives of a young yuppie couple as the husband gets involved with a cell of domestic terrorists. Its 1978 successor, Running Dog (1978), written in a brief four-month streak of writing, was a thriller concerning numerous individuals hunting down a celluloid reel of Hitler's sexual exploits. Of Running Dog, DeLillo remarked in his Rolling Stone interview that [...] "What I was <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> at in Running Dog was a sense of the terrible acquisitiveness in which we live, coupled with a final indifference to the object. After all the mad attempts to acquire the thing, everyone suddenly decides that, well, maybe we really don't care about this so much anyway. This was something I felt characterized our lives at the time the book was written, in the mid to late seventies. I think this was part of American consciousness then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mara {{founded the}} charity Faces of Kibera, which aimed to provide housing, food, {{and medical care}} for orphans in Kibera, a Nairobi, Kenya slum. The charity's goal was to build an orphanage in the region, for which 6 acres of land have been purchased. The charity {{auctioned}} memorabilia from the Steelers and Giants, as well as training camp events on eBay to raise money. She visited the area as a volunteer in 2006 and was moved to help the orphans, many whose parents have died from AIDS and HIV-related illnesses. She began the charity due to her frustration with {{the growing number of}} nonprofits that are just business opportunities. [...] "The people who need help aren’t <b>really</b> <b>getting</b> it. So I started my own", she told Interview magazine in 2009. Mara later found it challenging to balance her charity work and acting career. [...] "I need to do both; I can't just do acting," [...] she stated to The Journal News. In January 2011, Faces of Kibera merged with Uweza Foundation which runs community-based empowerment programs in Kibera, including soccer leagues and after-school tutoring.
