50|$|Radio-controlled model {{aircraft}} {{have been used}} to scare or 'haze' bird pests since the early 1980s, mainly over airfields, but have also been used over agricultural areas, fisheries and landfill sites. This method {{has been shown to be}} very effective and birds habituate more slowly to a treatment in which they are being actively hazed. At Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, balsa wood radio-controlled aircraft are one of the primary bird harassment methods used to keep the airfield clear of raptors and other large birds, and they have also proved effective at dispersing the base’s <b>redwing</b> <b>blackbird</b> roost.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's where I'll go!" [...] exclaimed Peter. [...] "I haven't {{been to the}} Smiling Pool {{for some}} time. I'll just run over and pay my respects to Grandfather Frog, and to <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird.</b> <b>Redwing</b> {{was one of the}} first birds to arrive, and I've {{neglected}} him shamefully." ...|$|R
40|$|Seed rice {{was treated}} with 0. 25 % {{methiocarb}} to test its effectiveness as a blackbird repellent in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana {{in the spring of}} 1975. Two replications of 3 treated and 3 untreated plots showed 68 % more seedlings in treated plots (2, 393) than in untreated plots (1, 429). Half as many birds (chiefly <b>redwing</b> <b>blackbirds</b> (Agelaius phoeniceus) were recorded in treated (1. 18 /mi n) as in untreated plots (2. 39 /min) ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter {{had come}} over to the Smiling Pool {{especially}} to pay his respects to <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird,</b> so as soon as he could, without being impolite, he left Mrs. Teeter sitting on her eggs, and Teeter himself bobbing and bowing in the friendliest way, and hurried over to where the bulrushes grow. In {{the very top of the}} Big Hickory-tree, a little farther along on the bank of the Smiling Pool, sat some one who at that distance appeared to be dressed all in black. He was singing as if there were nothing but joy in all the great world. [...] "Quong-ka-reee! Quong-ka-reee! Quong-ka-reee!" [...] he sang. Peter would have known from this song alone that it was <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird,</b> for there is no other song quite like it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't, eh?" [...] exclaimed Jenny. [...] "Well, for one who pokes {{into other}} people's affairs as you do, you don't know much. The Orioles and the Meadow Larks and the Grackles and the Bobolinks all {{belong to the}} Blackbird family. They're all related to <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird,</b> and Sally Sly the Cowbird belongs in the same family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Jimmy. [...] "I never {{waste time}} wishing I could do things {{it was never}} meant I should do. It's funny where Old Mr. Toad is. He {{said that he was}} coming down here to sing, and <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird</b> seemed to be expecting him. I've looked {{everywhere}} I can think of without finding him, but I don't believe in giving up without another try. Stop your dreaming and come help us hunt." ...|$|R

60|$|Seeing Farmer Brown's boy {{coming through}} the Old Orchard Peter {{decided that it was}} high time for him to depart. So he scampered for the Green Forest, lipperty-lipperty-lip. Just within the edge of the Green Forest he caught sight of {{something}} which for the time being put all thought of Farmer Brown's boy out of his head. Fluttering on the ground was a bird than whom not even Glory the Cardinal was more beautiful. It was about the size of <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird.</b> Wings and tail were pure black and all the rest was a beautiful scarlet. It was Redcoat the Tanager. At first Peter had eyes only for the wonderful beauty of Redcoat. Never before had he seen Redcoat so close at hand. Then quite suddenly it came over Peter that something was wrong with Redcoat, and he hurried forward to see what the trouble might be.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was of}} no use. The sharp eyes of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow saw him. They {{actually}} {{flew into}} the very tree under which he was hiding, and how they did scream! Pretty soon Ol' Mistah Buzzard came dropping {{down out of the}} blue, blue sky and took a seat on a convenient dead tree, where he could see all that went on. Ol' Mistah Buzzard began to grin {{as soon as he saw}} that tin pail on Buster's neck. Then came others,--Redtail the Hawk, Scrapper the Kingbird, <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird,</b> Drummer the Woodpecker, Welcome Robin, Tommy Tit the Chickadee, Jenny Wren, Redeye the Vireo, and ever so many more. They came from the Old Orchard, the Green Meadows, and even down by the Smiling Pool, for the voices of Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow carried far, and at the sound of them everybody hurried over, sure that something exciting was going on.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} spring evening. Over back of the Purple Hills to which Old Mother West Wind had taken her children, the Merry Little Breezes, and behind which jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had gone to bed, {{there was still a}} faint, clear light. But over the Green Meadows and the Smiling Pool the shadows had drawn a curtain of soft dusk which in the Green Forest became black. The little stars looked down from the sky and twinkled just to see their reflections twinkle back at them from the Smiling Pool. And there and all around it was perfect peace. Jerry Muskrat swam back and forth, making little silver lines {{on the surface of the}} Smiling Pool and squeaking contentedly, for it was the hour which he loves best. Little Friend the Song Sparrow had tucked his head under his wing and gone to sleep among the alders along the Laughing Brook and <b>Redwing</b> the <b>Blackbird</b> had done the same thing among the bulrushes. All the feathered songsters who had made joyous the bright day had gone to bed.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{constructed}} wetlands for tertiary {{wastewater treatment}} {{is emerging as}} a cost-effective wastewater treatment technology. Constructed wetlands are theoretically designed and operated so that the target constituents have ample time to interact with wetland substrates and microbiota to effect constituent removal necessary to achieve water quality discharge limits. Unfortunately, engineering natural systems is complicated and operational criteria are poorly defined. Long-term research is needed that compares design configurations as well as performance since each constructed wetland system is subjected {{to a variety of}} stochastic events (i. e. wind speed and direction, sedimentation due to pulsed rain events, plant dispersal and plant succession). The 650 -acre constructed wetland system in Augusta, Georgia was developed in three phases, beginning with a 60 -acre pilot study that evaluated use of the technology for ammonia and BOD removal. The pilot study was operated from 1997 – 1999. Design changes resulting from the pilot study were incorporated into Phases 2 and 3, which were completed in 2000 and 2002 respectively. During 2003 - 2004, an innovative optimization study was conducted to compare performance criteria between wetland cells of different design configurations, age, planting schemes, and operational criteria such as depth and flow. The cells were monitored using multiprobe HydroLab® technology. Water quality analyses included BOD, TSS, nitrate+nitrite, TKN, ammonia, ortho- and total phosphate. Continuous weather data were also collected using a GroWeather® monitoring station. Results of this research indicated that wetland cell performance was similar regardless of design, age, planting scheme, flow rates and various operational manipulations. The study suggested cell orientation to prevailing winds and duckweed cover may have impacted treatment efficiency. Nitrogen removal may also have been compromised by nitrogen import from large colonies of roosting <b>redwing</b> <b>blackbirds</b> as well as blue-green algae blooms. There is also evidence that suggests preferential flow patterns and stagnant zones within the cells may be potentially decreasing efficiency and overall removal performance. A tracer study is planned to evaluate aboveground and belowground processes that may alter the theoretical homogenous flow design of constructed wetland systems.
