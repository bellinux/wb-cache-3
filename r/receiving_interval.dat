Breast cancer treatment sequelae, such as lymphedema, may occur early or late and often negatively affect function. Secondary prevention through prospective physical therapy surveillance aids in early identification and treatment of breast cancer–related lymphedema (BCRL). Early intervention may {{reduce the need for}} intensive rehabilitation and be cost saving. This perspective article compares a prospective surveillance model with a traditional model of impairment-based care and examines direct treatment costs associated with each program. Intervention and supply costs were estimated based on the Medicare 2009 physician fee schedule for 2 groups: (1) a prospective surveillance model group (PSM group) and (2) a traditional model group (TM group). The PSM group com-prised all women with breast cancer who were <b>receiving</b> <b>interval</b> prospective sur-veillance, assuming that one third would develop early-stage BCRL. The prospective surveillance model includes the cost of screening all women plus the cost of inter-vention for early-stage BCRL. The TM group comprised women referred for BCR...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{we focus}} on two areas of video adaptation: video rate control and frame rate control. The first part is on video rate control, which aims to adjust video bitrate to meet the network constraint. To that end, we propose a joint source rate and {{congestion}} control scheme called video TCP-friendly rate control (VTFRC) that incorporates the video bit rate characteristic into the TFRC rate. VTFRC uses a frame complexity measure and the rate gap between the TCP and TFRC rates to opportunistically encode the video at a higher rate. Experiments show that VTFRC improves video quality over existing scheme while maintaining TCP-friendliness. However, VTFRC needs the encoder meet a target bitrate and provide a frame complexity measure. To do this, we propose a complexity-based rate control scheme using edge energy. We show that this scheme can describe the individual complexities of the frames without needing any information on the whole video. Experiments show that the scheme produces a video stream that {{is closer to the}} target bitrate while improving on its video quality over existing schemes. The second part of this thesis is on frame rate control, which aims to maximize the video quality and continuity using the frame generation rates. To approach this, we propose a frame rate optimization framework that characterizes the frame rate control problem and use Lyapunov optimization to systematically derive decoupled optimization policies. Results show that the framework reduces the prebuffering requirements significantly with a modest tradeoff in video quality. We then examine different ways of improving the frame rate optimization framework. Firstly, we reformulated the framework based on a discontinuity penalty virtual buffer, which is the cumulative difference between the <b>receiving</b> <b>interval</b> and playout interval. We show that this discontinuity penalty correlates to the discontinuity of the video and enables a wider range of frame quality functions to be used with the framework. Secondly, we introduce a constraint on the playout slowdowns using a virtual buffer that records the cumulative delays. Results show that this provides a superior tradeoff between the video quality and the delay introduced compared to the existing scheme. Lastly, we show how the optimization policies can be derived in the presence of feedback delays. Analyses show that the delayed feedbacks had a minimal impact on the optimization policies...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{two main}} subjects: {{the development of}} efficient electromagnetic-acoustic transducers (EMATs) and the synthesis of coded sequences for pulse-echo mode. EMATs are desirable because no mechanical contact with the sample is required; however, EMATs are inherently inefficient. To improve their performance, a ferromagnetic core surrounded by permanent magnets whose like poles face the core is proposed as the bias magnetic field source; this configuration can outperform a single magnet by an order of magnitude. Coil configurations that result in linear and radial polarisations of the ultrasonic waves are also compared; the linear polarisation was found to yield higher mode purity and penetration depths. Furthermore, the optimal impedance of the EMAT coil is discussed. Although improvements in EMAT sensitivity of up to 20 dB were achieved, {{this is not enough}} to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (> 30 dB) without averaging {{over a long period of}} time. Therefore, efficient encoding techniques to achieve a greater SNR over shorter periods of time were investigated. The maximum length of conventional coded sequences and hence the maximum SNR increase is limited by the location of the closest reflectors. In this thesis, coded sequences that have <b>receive</b> <b>intervals</b> are introduced so that their overall length and therefore the SNR increase is not affected by the location of the reflectors; the proposed sequences can produce a given SNR increase an order of magnitude faster than averaging. These sequences are then used to drive EMATs using less than 0. 5 W and a repetition rate of 10 Hz; this rate can be perceived by a human inspector as quasi-real-time. Moreover, a set of pseudo-orthogonal sequences that have common <b>receive</b> <b>intervals</b> can simultaneously be transmitted through several transducers. This makes it possible to increase the number of active elements in an array, which combined with synthetic focusing, can increase the resolution and contrast of the resulting image without affecting the frame rate. Binary quantisation is also investigated in this thesis. It can be used with low-SNR systems resulting in minimal loss of information while reducing the data throughput and the complexity of the electronics, especially in arrays with many elements. The theory behind binary quantisation is reviewed and the maximum input SNR range that does not cause unacceptable distortions is investigated. Finally, the first low-power, pulse-echo EMAT phased array system is proposed. This array can perform similarly to conventional piezoelectric arrays mounted on a wedge to excite angled shear wave in the sample. Racetrack coils are used as the array elements laid out in an overlapping pattern that minimises inter-element crosstalk and results in an array element width and pitch equivalent to 1 and 2 / 3 of the wavelength respectively. Coded sequences that have <b>receive</b> <b>intervals</b> are used to reduce the drive power to just a few watts (24 Vpp).

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a new measurement algorithm for the available bandwidth in a network path between two endhosts. This algorithm is an adaptation from existing active measurement methods {{for the purpose of}} being applied in inline network measurement. Inline network measurement method measures the available bandwidth by using packets which an active TCP connection transmits, instead of using probe packets, as in the existing methods. The measurement is performed by inferring network characteristics information from transmitting and <b>receiving</b> <b>intervals</b> of TCP data and ACKnowledgement packets. Inline network measurement is useful in service overlay networks, in which up-to-date information on the available bandwidth in the underlying IP network should be known as early as possible. In this paper, we first introduce the measurement algorithm and then discuss the problems with applying the proposed measurement algorithm to an active TCP connection. We evaluate the proposed measurement algorithm using simulation experiments and show that it can provide an estimation of available bandwidth every 2 - 4 RTTs. Moreover, the accuracy of measurement results can be maintained considerably well while the number of packets in a measurement is reduced by approximately 90 % in comparison with existing methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological and Agricultural EngineeringNaiqian ZhangIn {{order to}} meet food, fiber, and {{bio-fuel}} needs of a growing world population, crop-breeding methods must be improved and new technologies must be developed. One area under focus is the decoding of the genetic basis of complex traits, such as yield and drought stress tolerance, and predicting these traits from genetic composition of lines or cultivars. In the last three decades, significant advances in genotyping methods {{have resulted in a}} wealth of genomic information; however, little improvement has occurred for methods of collecting corresponding plant trait data, especially for agronomic crops. This study developed a mobile, field-based, high-throughput sensor platform for rapid and repeated measurement of plant characteristics. The platform consisted of three sets of sensors mounted on a high-clearance vehicle. Each set of sensors contained two infrared thermometers (IRT), one ultrasonic sensor, one Crop Circle, and one GreenSeeker. Each sensor set measured canopy temperature, crop height, and spectral reflectance. In addition to the sensors, the platform was equipped with an RTK-GPS system that provided precise, accurate position data for georeferencing sensor measurements. Software for collecting, georeferencing, and logging sensor data was developed using National Instruments LabVIEW and deployed on a laptop computer. Two verification tests were conducted to evaluate the phenotyping system. In the first test, data timestamps were analyzed to determine if the system could collect data at the required rate of 10 Hz and 5 Hz for sensor data and position data, respectively. The determination was made that, on average, IRT, ultrasonic, and Crop Circle data are <b>received</b> in <b>intervals</b> of 100 ms (SD = 10 ms), GreenSeeker data are <b>received</b> in <b>intervals</b> of 122 ms(SD= 10 ms), and position data are <b>received</b> in <b>intervals</b> of 200 ms (SD = 32 ms).

Methods:A total of 33 clinical patients received 131 I-tositumomab (n 5 23) or 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (n 5 10) and underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans before radioimmunotherapy and at 12 wk after radioimmunotherapy. A third scan was performed on 13 patients at 24 wk after radioimmunotherapy, 12 of whom did not <b>receive</b> <b>interval</b> therapy. Tumor metabolic activity was assessed before and after radioimmunotherapy visually and quantitatively by lean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVlean max). Response was assessed by the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) and Revised IWC, which includes 18 F-FDG PET (IWC-PET). Results: Mean SUVlean max de-creased from baseline in 244 target lesions 12 wk after radioim-munotherapy (from 6. 51 6 4. 05 to 3. 94 6 4. 41; P, 0. 01), regardless of response at 12 wk after radioimmunotherapy (P # 0. 02). After radioimmunotherapy, SUVlean max was lower for responders than for nonresponders (P # 0. 01). Median per-centage change in SUVlean max of target lesions per patient was 251 % (295 % to 97 %). No significant difference in decline in SUVlean max between patients who received 131 I-tositumomab and those who received 90 Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan was demon-strated (231 % 6 51 % vs. 247 % 6 46 %; P 5 0. 38).
