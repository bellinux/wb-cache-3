60|$|So their preacher {{went and}} did his errand, and {{received}} this answer {{from the mouth}} of his Lord: that Captain Credence should be the great doer in all the King's army, against the King's enemies, and also for the welfare of Mansoul. So he bowed to the ground, and thanked his Lordship, and returned and told his news to the townsfolk. But all this was done with all imaginable secrecy, because the foes had yet great strength in the town. But <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story</b> again.|$|R
60|$|But <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> At {{one end of}} {{this village}} the creek sprang over a ledge of rock in a low cascade and opened out into a {{beautiful}} lake, the bosom of which was studded with small islands. Here were thousands of those smaller species of wild water-fowl which were either too brave or too foolish to be scared away by {{the noise of the}} camp. And here, too, dozens of children were sporting on the beach or paddling about in their light bark canoes.|$|R
60|$|But <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> Having consented, as above, to his proposal, we had {{not much}} more to do. He gave me my writings, and the bond for my {{maintenance}} during his life, and for five hundred pounds after his death. And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards, that two years after we were thus, as he called it, married, he made his will, {{and gave me a}} thousand pounds more, and all my household stuff, plate, &c., which was considerable too.|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> In {{much shorter}} time {{than we have}} spent in {{reminding}} the reader of these historical particulars, Joliffe had made his mystic communication; and being duly answered as {{by one of the}} initiated, he undid the door, and there entered our old friend Roger Wildrake, round-head in dress, as his safety and dependence on Colonel Everard compelled him to be, but that dress worn in a most cavalier-like manner, and forming a stronger contrast than usual with the demeanour and language of the wearer, to which it was never very congenial.|$|R
60|$|But <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> We {{came back}} to the king timely enough to put the Earl of Essex's men out of all humour of {{renewing}} the fight, and as I observed before, both parties stood gazing at one another, and our cannon playing upon them obliged Sir William Balfour's horse to wheel off in some disorder, but they returned us none again, which, as we afterwards understood, was, as I said before, for want of both powder and gunners, for the cannoniers and firemen were killed, or had quitted their train in the fight, when our horse had possession of their artillery; and as they had spiked up some of the cannon, so they had carried away fifteen carriages of powder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Grandfather, [...] "it often happens, {{that the}} outcasts of one generation are those, who are reverenced as the wisest {{and best of}} men by the next. The securest fame is that which comes after a man’s death. But let us <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> When Roger Williams was banished, {{he appears to have}} given the chair to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. At all events it was in her possession in 1637. She was a very sharp-witted and well-instructed lady, and was so conscious of her own wisdom and abilities, that she thought it a pity that the world should not have the benefit of them. She therefore used to hold lectures in Boston, once or twice a week, at which most of the women attended. Mrs. Hutchinson presided at these meetings, sitting, with great state and dignity, in Grandfather’s chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>to</b> <b>return</b> again <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> After supper, {{the lads}} desired a bed, for {{that they were}} weary with travelling. Then Gaius called to show them their chamber; but said Mercy, [...] "I will have them to bed." [...] So she had them to bed, and they slept well; but the rest sat up all night, for Gaius and they were such {{suitable}} company, {{that they could not}} tell how to part.|$|R

Then after much talk of their Lord, themselves, and their journey, old Mr. Honest, he that put forth the riddle to Gaius, began to nod. Then said Great-heart, What, Sir, you begin to be drowsy; come, rub up; now here is a riddle for you. Then said Mr. Honest, Let us hear it. Then said Mr. Great-heart, ...|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>return,</b> then, <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> The {{king was}} very much dejected and melancholy. Steeny, in order to divert him, had a pig dressed up in the clothes of an infant child. Buckingham's mother, who was a countess, personated the nurse, dressed also {{carefully}} for the occasion. Another person put on a bishop's robes, satin gown, lawn sleeves, and the other pontifical ornaments. They also provided a baptismal font, a prayer-book, and other things necessary for a religious ceremony, and then invited the king {{to come in to}} attend a baptism. The king came, and the pretended bishop began to read the service, the assistants looking gravely on, until the squealing of the pig brought all gravity to an end. The king was not pleased; but the historian thinks the reason was, not any objection which he had to such a profanation, but to his not happening to be in a mood for it at that time.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{when the}} uproar was over, Diabolus sends for my Lord Understanding, and Mr. Conscience, and claps them both up in prison, as the ring-leaders and {{managers}} of this most heavy riotous rout in Mansoul. So now the town {{began to be}} quiet again, and the prisoners were used hardly; yea, he thought to have made them away, but that the present juncture did not serve for that purpose, for that war was in all their gates.[132] But let us <b>return</b> again <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>story.</b> The captains, when they were gone back from the gate, and were come into the camp again, called a council of war, to consult what was further for them to do. Now some said, Let us go up presently and fall upon the town, but the greatest part thought rather better {{it would be to}} give them another summons to yield; and the reason why they thought this to be best was, because, that so far as could be perceived, the town of Mansoul now was more inclinable than heretofore. And if, said they, while some of them are in a way of inclination, we should by ruggedness give them distaste, we may set them further from closing with our summons, than we would be willing they should.[133] ...|$|R

Wherefore to this advice they agreed, and called a trumpeter, put words into his mouth, set him his time, and bid him God speed. Well, many hours were not expired before the trumpeter addressed himself to his journey. Wherefore, coming up to the wall of the town, he steereth his course to Ear-gate, and there sounded, as he was commanded. They then that were within came out to see what was the matter, and the trumpeter made them this speech following: ...|$|R
