Bungie wanted to re-negotiate the contracts for Oni in 1999, which resulted in O'Donnell joining the Bungie team ten days before the company was bought by Microsoft. Salvatori <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> to manage the business aspect of TotalAudio, which he continues to do.|$|E

Navy's record went to 513, a slight {{improvement}} from the previous year, when the team went 52. It became Navy's eighth straight winning season.|$|E
5|$|When GHQ {{moved up}} to Brisbane, LHQ <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> in Melbourne, but Blamey formed an Advanced LHQ under his Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS), Major General George Alan Vasey, which moved to nearby St Lucia. Major General Frank Berryman {{replaced}} Vasey as DCGS in September 1942, and remained in the post until January 1944. He resumed the post in July 1944 and remained until December 1945. When {{the main body of}} GHQ moved to Hollandia, Advanced LHQ followed, opening there on 15 December, but when the main GHQ moved to Leyte in February 1945, Advanced LHQ <b>remained</b> <b>behind.</b> A Forward Echelon LHQ was formed under Berryman that remained co-located with the main body of GHQ, while the main body of LHQ remained at Hollandia until it moved to Morotai for the operations in Borneo in April 1945.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong's {{instructions}} for Portugal were to negotiate an expanded {{treaty with the}} government. They arrived at Santa Apolónia railway station in Lisbon on August 19. Kalākaua was presented with the Grand Cross Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa during an audience with King Luís I at the Palace of Ajuda, and also attended a bullfight with Luis's father King Ferdinand II at the Pena Palace. When they left Portugal on August 24, Armstrong <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> to initiate a treaty.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battle}} and the {{following}} siege, French-speaking Canadians were active {{on both sides of}} the conflict. The American forces received supplies and logistical support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.|$|E

5|$|On {{formation}} {{the brigade}} {{was assigned to}} the 1st Airborne Division, and as such had to supply reinforcements to make the 1st Parachute Brigade up to strength before they left to take part in Operation Torch. When the 1st Airborne Division left England for operations in the Mediterranean, the 3rd Parachute Brigade <b>remained</b> <b>behind,</b> and was assigned as the first unit of the newly raised 6th Airborne Division. The brigade would remain part of the 6th Airborne Division until 1947, when it was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|One soon {{latched onto}} him and began firing. McCudden dived steeply but the enemy pilot <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> him. At 800 feet McCudden began a {{spinning}} dive until the German, now some distance behind, abruptly turned away. The enemy aircraft was fired at by British ground forces and McCudden, who by now had unjammed his Lewis machine gun, turned to give pursuit. The enemy pilot, apparently unaware of this, {{was already too}} high and McCudden watched as he re-joined his flight and departed the area.|$|E
5|$|Pole {{position}} driver Edwards {{maintained his}} {{lead on the}} first lap to begin the race, as Newman, who started in the second position on the grid, <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> him.

On lap 298, Hamlin made a pit stop and became a lap behind. He didn't return to the first ten positions afterward. Edwards maintained the lead to win the race.|$|E

5|$|The next {{significant}} part {{he would play}} in the war would occur at the Battle of Abydos. Alcibiades had <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> at Samos with a small force while Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus led {{the greater part of}} the fleet to the Hellespont. During this period, Alcibiades succeeded in raising money from Caria and the neighboring area, with which he was able to pay the rowers and gain their favor. After the Athenian victory at Cynossema, both fleets summoned all their ships from around the Aegean to join them for what might be a decisive next engagement.|$|E
5|$|As {{promised by}} Massasoit, {{numerous}} Native Americans arrived at Plymouth {{throughout the middle}} of 1621 with pledges of peace. On July 2, a party of Pilgrims led by Edward Winslow (who later became the chief diplomat of the colony) set out to continue negotiations with the chief. The delegation also included Squanto, who acted as a translator. After traveling for several days, they arrived at Massasoit's capital, the village of Sowams near Narragansett Bay. After meals and an exchange of gifts, Massasoit agreed to an exclusive trading pact with the English; thus, the French were no longer welcome, though they were also frequent traders in the area. Squanto <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> and traveled throughout the area to establish trading relations with several tribes.|$|E
5|$|As the ANZAC Mounted Division {{pulled back}} {{to the west bank}} of the Jordan, the Wellingtons <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> {{strengthening}} the defences at the Ghoraniyeh bridge-head. On 18 April, the regiment, less the 6th Squadron, were part of a brigade force that advanced on the village of Shunet Nimrin. The operation was a deception to convince the Turks that further raids on Amman were imminent. The next day patrols from the regiment located a large Turkish force in the foothills around the village. The brigade positioned as if to attack them, then when they reinforced their position, the brigade withdrew. That night they crossed back over the river and camped outside Jericho. The regiment moved again on 23 April, to camp in the foothills to the south of Jericho.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on July 20, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. Dean <b>remained</b> <b>behind</b> and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon. As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the early}} Jurchens had no written records, {{the story of}} Hanpu was first {{transmitted}} orally. According to the History of Jin (compiled in the 1340s), Hanpu arrived from Goryeo {{at the age of}} sixty and settled among the Jurchen Wanyan clan. Other sources claim that Hanpu was from Silla, the state that had ruled the Korean peninsula but was annexed by Goryeo in 935. The same story recounts that when Hanpu left Goryeo, his two brothers <b>remained</b> <b>behind,</b> one in Goryeo and one in the Balhae area. Because the Jurchens considered Hanpu to be the sixth-generation ancestor of Wanyan Wugunai (1021–1074), historians postulate that Hanpu lived in the early tenth century, when the Jurchens still consisted of independent tribes, or sometime between the founding of Goryeo in 918 and its destruction of Silla in 935.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Chadwick gave Rotblat a {{fellowship}} (the Oliver Lodge Fellowship), doubling his income, {{and in that}} summer of 1939 the young Pole returned home, intending to bring Tola back with him. When {{the time came to}} leave Warsaw in late August, however, she was ill following an operation for appendicitis, and <b>remained</b> <b>behind,</b> expecting to follow within days; but the outbreak of war brought calamity. Tola was trapped, and desperate efforts in the ensuing months to bring her out through Denmark (with the help of Niels Bohr), Belgium, and finally Italy came to nothing, as each country in turn was closed off by the war. He never saw her again; she died in the Holocaust at the Belzec concentration camp. This affected him deeply {{for the rest of his}} life, and he never remarried.|$|E
