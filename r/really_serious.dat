25|$|That project {{endeavors to}} present all the {{phenomena}} in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute {{a challenge to}} creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the problems that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are <b>really</b> <b>serious,</b> little effort {{has been made to}} determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that complexity. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.|$|E

Key is probably best understood as {{the tone of the}} dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “special brackets will have to be introduced should he want to say something in a relatively serious way: [...] "Kidding aside," [...] "Now, I'm <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> about this," [...] and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.” ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} derived from Big Boi's long-time moniker [...] "Sir Lucious Left Foot". In several interviews, he has {{explained}} part {{of it as a}} reference to the Southern slang phrase [...] "gettin’ out on the good foot", while describing the entire moniker as an indication of maturity, noting it as [...] "my real grown-man persona" [...] and [...] "like my Luke-Skywalker-becoming-a-Jedi persona. Like, I'm just <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> about my craft, I've mastered it, and I'm very skilled at it, and I take pride in making this music". He incorporated the nickname [...] "Chico Dusty" [...] to the album's title as a dedication to his late father, Tony Kearse, who gained it while serving as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force and Marines. The spelling of luscious in the album's title, Big Boi's moniker, is intended to reflect on its distinctive pronunciation [...] "loo-shuss", which according to Big Boi, is not [...] "the girl name; you call a girl luscious, along the lines of voluptuous".|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E
500|$|On 31 August 2012, Jesy Nelson told Jenn Selby of Glamour that Little Mix's third single will be {{completely}} different from their previous two, {{and that it will}} show a different side to the group that has never been seen before. Leigh-Anne Pinnock went on to reveal to Selby that the song will serve as the album's second single, in turn resulting in the group's debut single [...] "Cannonball" [...] not featuring on the album altogether. Pinnock added that the second single was a pending choice between two songs at that time, and that the group were leaning towards the [...] "darker" [...] and [...] "different" [...] track. Speaking to Selby, Pinnock reasoned the group's choice: [...] "It's just a chance for us to show that we can be <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> and really show off our vocals well. This one's really about the vocals." [...] On 11 September 2012, details of the song and its title were revealed when music industry insiders were played a preview of [...] "DNA" [...] during the Sony Music Entertainment Conference Day. [...] Following the conference, Chart Show TV described the song as an [...] "electro ballad" [...] on Twitter. Before promptly deleting the tweet, they added that the song is [...] "very cool" [...] and has [...] "big vocals". On 27 September 2012, [...] announced that [...] "DNA" [...] will be sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2012. The song then leaked onto the internet on 28 September 2012, two days before its radio premiere.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E

Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, [...] "I have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet."

The {{prosecution}} said [...] "postmortem examinations on the four young men who died revealed that each had died from a drug overdose featuring high levels of GHB", but Port surreptitiously used other drugs on his victims: amyl nitrite (poppers), Viagra, mephedrone (meow meow) and methamphetamine (crystal meth). At his trial, the Judge accepted that Port's intention was only to cause <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> harm and not death, but {{made the point that}} Port must have foreseen that there was a high risk of death, especially {{after the death of his}} first victim.

2500|$|A {{reason for}} not {{revealing}} it to everyone is partially discussed in Phaedrus (276 c) where Plato criticizes the written transmission of knowledge as faulty, favoring instead the spoken logos: [...] "he who has knowledge of the just and the good and beautiful ... will not, when in earnest, write them in ink, sowing them through a pen with words, which cannot defend themselves by argument and cannot teach the truth effectually." [...] The same argument is repeated in Plato's Seventh Letter (344 c): [...] "every serious man in dealing with <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> subjects carefully avoids writing." [...] In the same letter he writes (341 c): [...] "I can certainly declare concerning all these writers who claim to know the subjects that I seriously study ... there does not exist, nor will there ever exist, any treatise of mine dealing therewith." [...] Such secrecy is necessary in order not [...] "to expose them to unseemly and degrading treatment" [...] (344 d).|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how much it will cost. The consequences are <b>really</b> <b>serious</b> when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways".
