25|$|Blennerhassett Phase of the Fort Ancient Tradition appears by 1250 CE. These people {{extend from}} the Mouth of the Little Kanawha area {{and began a}} few centuries before the Orchard people appear. They no longer {{utilized}} small burial mounds. The graves are now found amongst the houses surrounding the central plaza. Houses tended to be rectangular with <b>round</b> <b>corners</b> or oval in shape and were semi-subterranean with compacted floors. These people would become adept in palisading their circular villages with logs. This period shows a marked increase in maize diet than the earlier domesticated grasses or cereals of the preceding hamlet farmer. They continued to hunt small mammals, birds, fish, mollusks, elk, and white-tail deer. They follow the Roseberry Phase (Brose et al. 2001:70,85. CE 1050-1250) also northly from the Great Kanawha.|$|E

The approach {{leads to the}} solution of two problems: one on the device where <b>rounded</b> <b>corners</b> are replaced by sharp corners {{and the other on}} an unbounded domain representing the shape of the <b>rounded</b> <b>corner</b> after an appropriate rescaling. Both problems are solved using different techniques and numerical results are provided to assess the effciency and the accuracy of the techniques. Peer reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "Sanctuary of the Knife" [...] {{was built}} outside the enclosure wall {{east of the}} southern temple section {{and south of the}} future entry leaves constructed in the second building phase. It was a ritual slaughterhouse for sacrificial animals for the ruler cult. The function and the description of the sanctuary is verified through papyri in the mortuary temple of Neferirkare. The building was constructed from mud brick and its external wall had <b>round</b> <b>corners.</b> The northern part of the sanctuary included an open slaughterhouse {{as well as in the}} north-east corner a realm for dissection of animals and conservation of meat. The middle and southern part of the building occupied the warehouse for the storage of meat. The meat was possibly dried in the roof terrace. According to the Abusir papyri, 130 bulls were sacrificed in this sanctuary during a ten-day feast.|$|E
2500|$|The spur to such {{commercial}} designs can {{be found}} in the [...] "free Renaissance" [...] style that was espoused by Charles Eastlake. In 1868 he published Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details which was very influential in Britain and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. Although the archaeology of Mr. Eastlake's volume was always careful, most of the principles in it are beyond question, and can be generally stated in a few words. The Italianate style would have no carving or molding or other ornament glued on—such work must be done in the solid; no mitered joints, but joints made at the right angle, and secured by mortise, tenon and pin; woods in their native colour, and unvarnished, or else painted in flat colour, with a contrasting line and a stenciled ornament at the angles; unconcealed construction everywhere, and purposes plainly proclaimed; and with veneering, <b>round</b> <b>corners</b> and all curves weakening the grain of the wood being absolutely forbidden. The furniture that he thus proposed has straight, strong, squarely cut members equal to their intention. Its ornament is painted panels, porcelain plaques and tiles, metal trimmings, and conventionalized carvings in sunk relief, a part of the construction entering into the ornament, also in the shape of narrow striated strips of wood radiating in opposite lines, after a fashion not altogether unknown in the time of Henry III. It has the honesty and solidity, but not the attraction, of the Medieval; and if it is stiff and somewhat heavy, and fails entirely to please, it has yet a wholesome and healthy air.|$|E
