The game's first trailer later premiered at E3 2004 and was well received by critics. During the E3 2004 showing, F.E.A.R.s lead designer, Craig Hubbard, stated that the game [...] "... evolved out of a concept we started developing right after [...] that we've been dying to work on." [...] Monolith Productions' director of technology, Kevin Stephens, later elaborated that this concept was [...] "... to make an action movie in a first-person shooter, where you <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> an action star." [...] To this effect, the team focused on immersing the player, using elements like a silent, nameless protagonist with an unknown background, and allowing the player to see the protagonist's body when looking down or sideways.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you have a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate {{the course of a}} linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I {{know a lot of people}} have already given up, but I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good.

[...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ...

R.E.M. and author William S. Burroughs collaborated on a new version of [...] "Star Me Kitten", a song that had originally appeared on the band's 1992 album Automatic for the People. Rob Zombie has described his collaboration with Alice Cooper on the song [...] "Hands of Death (Burn Baby Burn)" [...] as one of the [...] "great moments where you <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> you've made your dreams come true".

500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} for the publication, Hollis explained {{the title of}} the song: [...] "It's called 'Watch n' Learn,' and people will understand what it's about once it comes out. It's a very sexy record, but it's fun. It's [...] great melodies; it's catchy; the beat knocks. It's so many different elements to it." [...] When asked how is he satisfied with Rihanna's vocals and his prediction on the song he further stated: [...] "She definitely murdered it vocally. I was just at the studio last week listening to a mix of it, and man, she killed it. I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like,</b> this song, it's going to be big. I'm really excited about it."

500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "It's a total cliché, but [...] doesn't make you happy. There's a lot missing. Success has given people the right to yell at me on the street, but I don't <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies' constant touring, Perry's frustration was only exacerbated by the media's persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted [...] " [...] unapologetically play ska right in the face {{of people who want to}} hear swing".|$|E

500|$|For [...] "Twenty-Twenty Surgery" [...] Lazzara {{had several}} lyrics and melodies, [...] "but nothing was working {{and it was}} the most {{frustrating}} thing"; its chorus was the album's final composition.

Lazzara later called the solo [...] "funny and great." [...] According to Mascherino, the group wanted the song [...] "to sound as much like the Cure as possible, so it’s all clean guitars." [...] He said that the drums on [...] "I'll Let You Live" [...] were recorded at a faster tempo, sounding [...] "totally deeper" [...] when played back. [...] "Sleep" [...] was the band's attempt at a Motown-inspired bass sound. [...] "Brooklyn (If You See Something, Say Something)" [...] contains a [...] "real floaty, airy pre-chorus and then it’s upbeat but dark," [...] according to Lazzara.

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like,</b> emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session.

[...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you <b>really</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

Regarding the publisher's decision to feature Clancy's name at the top in massive letters and having his name in smaller letters for the covers of the post-Clancy novels, Greaney commented: “It <b>really</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> a humongous honor to do it.

2500|$|Flynn {{has also}} said that she wanted this novel to capture the sense of {{bankruptcy}} that both individuals and communities feel when the economy spirals.
