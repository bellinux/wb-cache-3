5|$|This {{series of}} {{successful}} British infantry and mounted operations {{resulted in the}} complete defeat of the 16,000 to 18,000 strong German, Austrian and Ottoman force, about half of whom were killed or wounded, and nearly 4,000 taken prisoner. Also captured were a mountain gun battery of four heavy guns, nine machine guns, a complete camel-pack machine gun company, 2,300 rifles and a million rounds of ammunition, two complete field hospitals with all instruments, fittings and drugs, while a great quantity of stores in the supply depot at Bir el Abd was destroyed. All the captured arms and equipment were made in Germany, and the camel-pack machine gun company's equipment had been especially designed for desert warfare. Many of the rifles were of the latest pattern and made of <b>rustless</b> <b>steel.</b> Murray estimated the total German and Ottoman casualties at about 9,000, while a German estimate put the loss at {{one third of the}} force (5,500 to 6,000), which seems low considering the number of prisoners.|$|E

50|$|Symington {{resigned}} in 1930 to become President of the Colonial Radio Corporation. In January 1935, {{he accepted the}} presidency of <b>Rustless</b> Iron and <b>Steel</b> Corporation (manufacturers of stainless steel) but remained a director of Colonial Radio Corporation.|$|R

40|$|A brief {{description}} is given of {{different groups of}} high chromium <b>steels</b> (<b>rustless</b> iron and stainless steels) according to their composition and more generally accepted names. The welding procedure for a given group will be much the same regardless of the slight variations in chemical composition which may exist within a certain group. Information is given for the tensile properties (yield point and ultimate strength) of metal sheets and welds before and after annealing on coupons one and one-half inches wide. Since welds in rustless iron containing 16 to 18 percent chromium and 7 to 12 percent nickel show the best combination of strength and ductility in the 'as welded' or annealed condition, it is considered the best alloy to use for welded construction...|$|R
40|$|The wear {{behaviour}} {{of metal}} cutting tools fitted with coated cermets {{has been studied}} in turning and milling of steel for hardening and tempering (42 CrMo S 4 V), <b>rustless</b> <b>steel</b> (X 5 CrNi 18 - 10) and the cast material GGG 70. As coatings TiN, (Ti, Al) N, TiN-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -TiN multilayers, TiCN-based multilayers and diamond, and as the coating processes PVD, CVD and PCVD were applied. With all studied coatings the wear resistance has been essentially improved. At application of PVD the (Ti, Al) N layers achieved highest tool life cycles. In addition, the high potentials of novel PVD layer systems {{on the basis of}} zirconium and niobium have been demonstrated. Under the PCVD and CVD multilayer systems especially the Al_ 2 O_ 3 -containing systems were found to be highly wear resistant. The optimum of the layer thickness depends on the applied cutting process. For turning with smooth cuts a thickness of the coating layer of > 10 #mu#m is required.
