5|$|A {{beaked whale}} is any {{of at least}} 22 species of small whale in the family Ziphiidae. They {{are one of the}} least-known {{families}} of large mammals: several species have only been described in the last two decades, and it is entirely possible that more <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> yet undiscovered. Six genera have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{read the}} Haüy books repeatedly, {{and he was}} equally {{attentive}} to the oral instruction offered by the school. He {{proved to be a}} highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> a teacher's aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.|$|E

5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{descended from}} tribal chiefs through his mother, Kimou N'Drive (also known as N'Dri Kan). She died much later in 1936. Doubts <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> to the {{identity}} of his father, N'Doli. Officially {{a native of the}} N'Zipri of Didiévi tribe, N'Doli Houphouët died shortly after the birth of his son Augustin, although no reliable information regarding his death exists. Houphouët-Boigny had two elder sisters, Faitai (1898?–1998) and Adjoua (d. 1987), as well as a younger brother Augustin (d. 1939).|$|E
5|$|In August 1886, Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan sent Company M, 1st U.S. Cavalry to the Park, {{where they}} {{established}} Camp Sheridan, named after General Sheridan, at Mammoth Hot Springs. Camp Sheridan consisted of {{an arrangement of}} temporary facilities {{at the base of}} Capitol Hill just east of the Mammoth Hot Springs travertine terraces. None of the facilities that comprised Camp Sheridan <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> they were all removed over the years.|$|E
50|$|Crowthers <b>remained</b> <b>as</b> charter {{operator}} as of January 2016. Caringbah Bus Service also <b>remained</b> <b>as</b> {{a charter}} operator under their previous charter operation name Tiger Tours until May 2015, when {{the business was}} purchased by Dunn Motor Traction and merged into its Telford's Bus & Coach operations.|$|R

5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 completely in stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King {{had invited}} Macdonald {{to run for}} federal office during the general {{election}} of 1935. Although Macdonald turned him down, there were strong rumours in 1937 that Macdonald would soon enter federal politics. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes however, that Macdonald wanted to <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> premier so he could present Nova Scotia's case to a Royal Commission on federal-provincial relations.|$|E

5|$|The area of North Parade, South Parade, Pierrepont and Duke Streets {{was part}} of a wider scheme to build a Royal Forum, similar to Queen Square, which was never completed. Wood {{designed}} the facade, of Bath stone, after which a variety of builders completed the work with different interiors and rear elevations. Many of the buildings are now hotels and shops whilst some <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> private residences.|$|E
5|$|The house {{sits on a}} south facing slope giving views {{across the}} {{extensive}} deer park and the Weald beyond.

The parks and gardens are listed Grade II.|$|E
5|$|When Lithuania {{declared}} {{its independence from}} Russia in 1918, the song was declared the national anthem. It held this status until Lithuania was annexed into the Soviet Union during World War II. During the interwar period, there had been suggestions to modify the words to include a reference to God. It was decided, in Kudirka's memory, that the lyrics should <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> he had written them.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|After being {{reformed}} {{during the}} early part of 1942, 4th Brigade spent time in Syria with most of the 2nd New Zealand Division. In June, the New Zealanders were rushed back to Egypt after the Panzer Army Afrika attacked Gazala, near Tobruk, to begin an advance into Egypt in pursuit of the retreating Eighth Army. The division made a stand at Minqar Qaim and was surrounded by German forces on 27 June. As the Germans probed the perimeter of the New Zealand positions, Freyberg was wounded. Inglis assumed temporary command of the division and successfully led it in an outbreak from Minqar Qaim that night. He would <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> divisional commander for the next two months as Freyberg recovered, and was later awarded a bar to his DSO which acknowledged his leadership of the division during this period.|$|E
5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic {{side of the aisle}} had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily if he were to switch parties. However, Mathias chose to <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E

5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> part of the circle, which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E
5|$|As a {{minister}} of finance, Banza directed {{much of his}} energy and time into lifting the country out of bankruptcy. Banza was also successful {{in his efforts to}} build the government's reputation abroad, all the while establishing himself as a respected and well-liked leader. Many believed that the natural-born leader would not <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> Bokassa's right-hand man for much longer. After Banza was promoted from Captain to Lieutenant Colonel in 1965, Bokassa realized that his greatest political threat wasn't from the remaining group of Dacko supporters, but from Banza himself.|$|E
5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas <b>remain</b> <b>as</b> parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
