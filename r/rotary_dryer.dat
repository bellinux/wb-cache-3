50|$|The maximum soil {{temperature}} {{that can be}} obtained in a <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> depends on {{the composition of the}} dryer shell. The soil discharge temperature of carbon steel drums is typically 300 to 600 degrees F. Alloy drums are available that can increase the soil discharge temperature to 1,200 degrees F. Most rotary dryers that are used to treat petroleum contaminated soil are made of carbon steel. After the treated soil exits the <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer,</b> it enters a cooling conveyor where water is sprayed on the soil for cooling and dust control. Water addition may be conducted in either a screw conveyor or a pugmill.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> systems use a {{cylindrical}} metal reactor (drum) that {{is inclined}} {{slightly from the}} horizontal. A burner located at one end provides heat to raise {{the temperature of the}} soil sufficiently to desorb organic contaminants. The flow of soil may be either cocurrent with or countercurrent to the direction of the purge gas flow. As the drum rotates, soil is conveyed through the drum. Lifters raise the soil, carrying it to {{near the top of the}} drum before allowing it to fall through the heated purge gas. Mixing in a <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> enhances heat transfer by convection and allow soils to be rapidly heated. Rotary desorber units are manufactured for a wide range of treatment capacities; these units may be either stationary or mobile.|$|E

50|$|A <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> can {{consist of}} a single shell or many, though any more than three drums is not usually necessary.

The addition of a combustion chamber on the entry end helps ensure efficient fuel usage, and that homogenous drying air temperatures. As the material moves through the rotating drum is heated and moisture released. Some dryers also offer the option to cool, clean, shred, and/or separate the dried material.|$|E

50|$|Besides the {{direction}} of purge gas flow relative to soil feed direction, there is one major difference in configuration between countercurrent and cocurrent rotary dryers. The purge gas from a countercurrent <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> is typically only 350 °F to 500 °F and does not require cooling before entering the baghouse where fine particles are trapped. A disadvantage is that these particles {{may not have been}} decontaminated and are typically recycled to the dryer. Countercurrent dryers have several advantages over cocurrent systems. They are more efficient in transferring heat from purge gas to contaminated soil, and the volume and temperature of exit gas are lower, allowing the gas to go directly to a baghouse without needing to be cooled. The cooler exit gas temperature and smaller volume eliminates the need for a cooling unit, which allows downstream processing equipment to be smaller. Countercurrent systems are effective on petroleum products with molecular weights lower than No.2 fuel oil.|$|E
50|$|Direct fired rotary desorbers {{have been}} used {{extensively}} over the years for petroleum contaminated soils and soils contaminated with RCRA hazardous wastes {{as defined by the}} USEPA. A 1992 paper on treating petroleum contaminated soils estimated that between 20 and 30 contractors have 40 to 60 <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> systems available. Today, it is probably closer to 6 to 10 contractors with 15 to 20 portable systems commercially available. The majority of these systems utilize a secondary combustion chamber (afterburner) or catalytic oxidizer to thermally destroy the volatilized organics. A few of these systems also have a quench and scrubber after the oxidizer which allows them to treat soils containing chlorinated organics such as solvents and pesticides. The desorbing cylinder for full scale transportable systems is typically four to ten feet in diameter with heated lengths ranging from twenty to fifty feet. The maximum practical solids temperature for these systems is around 750 to 900 °F depending on the material of construction of the cylinder. Total residence time in this type of desorber normally ranges from 3 to 15 minutes. Treatment capacities can range from 6 to over 100 tons per hour for transportable units.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} dryer employed to reduce or minimize the liquid moisture content of the material it is handling by bringing it into direct contact with a heated gas. The dryer is made up of a large, rotating cylindrical tube, usually supported by concrete columns or steel beams. The dryer slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back {{down to the bottom of}} the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as co-current flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct heated dryer. Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect heated dryers are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct-indirect heated rotary dryers are also available to improve the overall efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Rotary dryers are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used wood drying system in the particleboard industry. These dryers also play an increasingly important role in drying wood residues for fuel. Many potential benefits may be realized through an improved understanding of the rotary drying process. A <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> simulation model was developed, {{in the form of a}} computer program, for the purpose of analyzing the drying behavior of wood particles. The model is applicable to single pass rotary drums, with or without a centerfill flighting section. Modifications to the base program could be made to allow for alternative rotary drum designs, such as multiple pass drums. The approach used in the model development analyzed the rotary drying process in a sequential manner. Beginning with a study of particle residence time in a rotary drum, the process of heat transfer, and then mass transfer, were incorporated to yield a complete <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> simulation model. The resultant computer program does not require empirical constants or equations developed for a particular <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> system. Experiments on a commercially manufactured <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> were performed to check the performance of the simulation model as a predictor of overall residence time and drying behavior. The variables tested were drum rotation rate, gas flow rate, and inlet gas temperature. Measurements of gas temperature, particle temperature, and particle moisture content were obtained along the drum length. Comparison between the predictions and the measured results were good, indicating a percent root mean square error of 22. 2 in the prediction of the outlet particle moisture content. A series of computer simulation trials were performed to check the affect of inlet particle moisture content, blend-box gas temperature, drum diameter, air leakage, drum length, gas volumetric flow rate, particle size, particle sphericity, drum speed, and angle of repose on dryer behavior. It was discovered that an optimal gas flow rate exists at which the greatest extent of drying may be achieved. In addition, the presence of centerfill flights enhances the extent of drying in a <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer.</b> The <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> simulation model developed in this study should prove useful for optimizing process parameters in the drying of wood particles...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study theoretically, by {{mathematical}} model development, the effect of particle size distribution {{on the performance of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> to dry ammonium sulphate fertilizer assuming plug flow with axial dispersion pattern (PFDA model) for solid particle flow. The mathematical model development was carried out by combining the drying processes model with particle size distribution model. Particle size distribution models used are Rosin-Rommler model and Gamma distribution model. For simplicity, the model of drying processes of solid particles in the <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> was developed by assuming of uniform air conditions (temperature and humidity) along the <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> as in the entry conditions. The resulting differential equations were solved analytically under Matlab 6. 1 facility. Since this model, solid hold up, and axial dispersion number were obtained from empirical correlations in the literatures. The drying rate of ammonium sulphate fertilizer in <b>rotary</b> <b>dryer</b> was estimated using isothermal diffusion model with effective diffusivity of moisture in the particle obtained from previous study [2]. Using Gamma function distribution, this research showed that for the value of the coefficient of variance (CV) less than 0. 5, particle size distribution does not have significant effect on dryer performance. For the value of CV greater than 0. 5, the dryer performance increase (or outlet solid moisture content decrease) with increasing the value of CV. The application of Rosin-Rammler model gives lower prediction of outlet solid moisture content compared to the application of Gamma function model...|$|E
