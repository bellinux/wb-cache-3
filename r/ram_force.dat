40|$|In robotic excavation, hybrid position/force {{control has}} been {{proposed}} for bucket digging trajectory following. In hybrid position/force control, the control mode is required to switch between position- and force-control {{depending on whether the}} bucket is in free space or in contact with the soil during the process. Alternatively, impedance control can be applied such that one control mode is employed in both free and constrained motion. This paper presents a robust sliding controller that implements impedance control for a backhoe excavator. The control law consists of three components: an equivalent control, a switching control and a tuning control. Given an excavation task in world space, inverse kinematic and dynamic models are used to convert the task into a desired digging trajectory in joint space. The proposed controller is applied to provide good tracking performance with attenuated vibration at bucket-soil contact points. From the control signals and the joint angles of the excavator, the piston position and <b>ram</b> <b>force</b> of each hydraulic cylinder for the axis control of the boom, arm, and bucket can be determined. The problem is then how to find the control voltage applied to each servovalve to achieve force and position tracking of each electrohydraulic system for the axis motion of the boom, arm, and bucket. With an observer-based compensation for disturbance force including hydraulic friction, tracking of the piston <b>ram</b> <b>force</b> and position is guaranteed using robust sliding control. High performance and strong robustness can be obtained as demonstrated by simulation and experiments performed on a hydraulically actuated robotic excavator. The results obtained suggest that the proposed control technique can provide robust performance when employed in autonomous excavation with soil contact considerations. ...|$|E

40|$|Computational {{simulations}} of glass extrusion are performed {{to quantify the}} effects of material behavior and slip at the die/glass interface on the die swell. Experimental data for three glass types are used to guide the computational study, which considers glass material to be viscous with and without shear thinning and viscoelastic using the Maxwell upper-convected model. The study starts with assuming no-slip at the glass/die interface to see if material behavior alone can explain the die swell results, and then considers slip using the Navier model where interface shear is directly proportional to the relative slip speed at the interface. Consistent {{with the possibility of}} slip and intended high viscosity applications, viscosity ranging from 107. 4 – 108. 8 Pa·s was used. Based on optimization of the various input parameters required to achieve the measured die swell and <b>ram</b> <b>force</b> values, the study concludes that interface slip occurred as only extreme values of the shear thinning parameters provided an alternative.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the room temperature ductility behavior of irradiated Zircaloy- 4 nuclear fuel cladding has been developed and applied to evaluate tensile hoop strength of material irradiated to different levels. The test utilizes a polyurethane plug fitted within a tubular cladding specimen. A cylindrical punch is used to compress the plug axially, which generates a radial displacement that acts upon the inner diameter of the specimen. Position sensors track the radial displacement of the specimen outer diameter as the compression proceeds. These measurements coupled with <b>ram</b> <b>force</b> data provide a load-displacement characterization of the cladding response to internal pressurization. The development of this simple, cost-effective, highly reproducible test for evaluating tensile hoop strain {{as a function of}} internal pressure for irradiated specimens represents a significant advance in the mechanical characterization of irradiated cladding. In this project, nuclear fuel rod assemblies using Zircaloy- 4 cladding and two types of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel pellets were irradiated to varying levels of burnup. Fuel pellets were manufactured with and without thermally induced gallium removal (TIGR) processing. Fuel pellets manufactured by both methods were contained in fuel rod assemblies and irradiated to burnup levels of 9, 21, 30, 40, and 50 GWd/MT. These levels of fuel burnup correspond to fast (E > 1 MeV) fluences of 0. 27, 0. 68, 0. 98, 1. 4 and 1. 7 1021 neutrons/cm 2, respectively. Following irradiation, fuel rod assemblies were disassembled; fuel pellets were removed from the cladding; and the inner diameter of cladding was cleaned to remove residue materials. Tensile hoop strength of this cladding material was tested using the newly developed method. Unirradiated Zircaloy- 4 cladding was also tested. With the goal of determining the effect of the two fuel types and different neutron fluences on clad ductility, tensile hoop strength tests were performed on cladding for these varying conditions. Experimental data revealed negligible performance differences for cladding containing TIGR vs non-TIGR processed fuel pellets. Irradiation hardening was observed in tensile hoop data as the strength of the cladding increased with increasing neutron dose and appeared to saturate for a fast fluence of 1. 7 1021 neutrons/cm 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{aluminium}} extrusion process {{is based on}} simple principles, but allows profiles with the most complex cross-sectional shapes to be produced {{at a very high}} rate. One of the greatest challenges of {{aluminium extrusion}} is to control material flow and dimensional variability of thin-walled high-strength profiles, for which the demand is growing. The die outlet geometry and the temperatures of the billet and tools must be carefully tuned in order to secure satisfactory material flow conditions. Due to the high pressures in the container, the deformation of the extrusion dies and the distortion of the die outlet may be significant and must be compensated for. The thermal conditions in the extrusion press must also be controlled. Even in the age of numerical modelling much trial and error is needed to make certain that the product satisfies the customer requirements. If simple and effective process control could be implemented, the cost and dimensional variability of extruded profiles could be significantly reduced. This would not only secure the continued use of extruded profiles in old markets but also open new ones. The main objective of this study has been to establish useful and simple methods for measuring the pressure at the interface between the die and the billet and the deformation of the die during hot extrusion of aluminium. Pressure measurement data may be used to establish {{a better understanding of the}} extrusion process and to carefully evaluate the many numerical extrusion models that are presently being developed and refined for the purpose of predicting profile shape and properties. A most important task is the evaluation of constitutive models used to describe bulk material and friction behaviour. The requirements for such models should be viewed in relation to common flow instability phenomena such as buckling. Sensors may in the future be integrated in intelligent extrusion dies in order to make certain that temperature and flow condition changes are as small as possible and to prevent overloading of extrusion dies during production. It is of the utmost importance that dimensional variability is detected early. This study has consisted of many parts. The first step was a careful evaluation of sensor designs using the Capacitec HPC- 75 high-temperature capacitive displacement probes and the Capacitec 4004 amplifier series. The feasibility of high- and low-temperature pressure measurement was demonstrated through various types of compression testing. The capacitive sensors were repeatedly tested in a hot air furnace to 650 ºC, and results were satisfactory for all but one of the sensors. The sensor sensitivity to temperature changes that occur during extrusion is usually less than 10 % of the full sensor response. The pressure sensors have been repeatedly tested in several dies for aluminium rod extrusion. The feasibility of, and a method for, performing useful measurements in the high-temperature extrusion environment have been demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is better than ± 10 % of full scale of 200 MPa when the effects of temperature changes are compensated for. The measurement repeatability is of a similar magnitude for genuinely replicated measurements. The measurement resolution is better than 1 %. It is firmly believed that the measurement and calibration technology may be further improved, and that the measurement accuracy may be better than 5 % of full scale. Rod extrusion experiments allowed the quality of the finite element modelling approach to be evaluated. The code ALMA 2 π was used, and material data of the Zener-Hollomon flow rule have been obtained by compression testing. Simulated and measured results of the <b>ram</b> <b>force,</b> die face pressure and liner force generally differed less than 10 %. The estimated die outlet temperature change was systematically 10 ºC too high. As there are significant differences between extrusion and compression testing, the use of material data from compression testing amounts to an extrapolation of data. Experiments did not demonstrate that the approach is unacceptable, but plots showing the deviation between experimental and estimated <b>ram</b> <b>force</b> and outlet temperature data indicated that there are a number of parameter combinations that are equally good as or even better than those obtained through compression testing. Very high accuracy determination of flow parameters may be difficult. Measurement errors significantly complicate matters. The pressure sensors may be used to study practical extrusion problems and to establish a better understanding of metal flow and the significance of die deformation. Thin strip extrusion experiments were performed to gain insight into the thermo-mechanics of flow instability (buckling). The feasibility of performing pressure measurement during the extrusion of thin strips was demonstrated, but sensors were not properly calibrated. The first round of the experiments was run with a die outlet 78. 5 mm wide and 1. 7 mm thick, and a container diameter of 100 mm. During extrusion of AA 6060 flow instability phenomena were not encountered. A second round of experiments was performed with non-instrumented dies and somewhat thinner profiles (1. 1 and 1. 4 mm). Flow instability in the form of buckling was provoked for high outlet temperatures, and many replicate experiments were performed. The shape of the buckled thin strip was also measured continuously with a laser triangulation technique during extrusion at high speed. Due to limitations related to the experimental set-up, neither the resolution nor the accuracy of the approach was entirely satisfactory. Nonetheless, the feasibility of the approach was demonstrated, and it is quite possible to improve the measurement technique. Capacitive pressure measurement techniques have been combined with methods for measuring the deformation of the mandrel and the straining of the bridges to study the behaviour of dies during tube extrusion. Capacitec capacitive probes were used to measure bridge strains. High temperature Kyowa strain gauges were also used for the same purpose. The die mandrel deflection was measured by conventional displacement transducers connected to the mandrel and the die cap by rods. Only measurements by the capacitive sensors proved sufficiently reliable during measurements. The study revealed that the state of stress in dies for hollow profiles may be very close to critical. The die face pressure at the top face of the mandrel exceeded 500 MPa. Two rounds of industrial experiments were performed with a U-profile that proved most difficult to extrude. In the first round of experiments, the flow stability was not satisfactory, and plugging of the outlet ruined experiments. The second round was more successful, and sensors were used to record the die face pressure on-line. The experiments demonstrated the feasibility of industrial experiments, but clearly indicated that further development of the sensors should be performed. It is important that sensors are made more durable, and that calibration techniques are further developed. Practical die designs that allow simple integration of sensors in the press should be developed. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

40|$|The present {{work has}} been carried out in order to {{investigate}} Al-Mg-Si alloys that are deformed at moderate temperatures. These temperatures are in the range between 200 C and 300 C. Also some experiments are performed at room temperatures. Two deformation models have been applied in the experiments: material deformation by compression testing and by forward extrusion. The investigated alloys are AA 6063, AA 6082 and an alloy that is named “Alloy R” in this work. The latter alloy is the industrial alloy AA 6082 without the Mn-addition (0. 56 wt%Mn in the AA 6082). The “R” denotes the recrystallized microstructure in the material after hot forming operations. The investigations show the effect of changing the temperature in the given temperature interval on the stress-strain relationship for each alloy. From the compression testing, it is found that none of the alloys AA 6063 or Alloy “R” reaches a steady state condition as true strain approaches 0. 8 for deformation temperatures between 200 C and 250 C. At compression testing performance at 300 C, the alloy “R” reaches a steady state condition at a true strain equal to 0. 4. As true stress-true strain relationship has been investigated for the “Alloy R” and the AA 6063 at comparable deformation parameters, it is shown that the alloy “R”, with the highest Si-content, requires the highest true stress for a given true strain value (AA 6063 : 0. 45 wt%Si, Alloy “R”: 0. 87 wt%Si). From the compression testing, the effect of Mn on the material properties in the AA 6082 -alloy has been determined. For the Alloy “R” and the AA 6082, the true stress reached the same value after a certain amount of deformation. As deformation temperature increases, this common value of true stress corresponds to a decrease in true strain. The AA 6082 and Alloy “R” are also compared in experiments performed in forward extrusion. One observes that for the same deformation temperature and at identical die diameters, the <b>ram</b> <b>force</b> is identical. It is worth noticing that these alloys did not show the same relationship during the compression testing at low values of true strain (< 0. 8). On a microscopic scale, one concludes that Mn has no significant effect on the stress-strain relationship for the applied deformation parameters in the forward extrusion equipment. Hardness measurements indicate that the age hardening potential in the extruded test specimen decreases as the deformation temperature increases. The hardness data is similar for both the AA 6082 and the Alloy R, thus indicating that the Mn content has no significant effect on the strength of the material. The deformed material has been annealed in order to investigate the recrystallization process in the AA 6082 and the Alloy “R”. The recrystallization grain size in the Alloy “R” is significantly larger than in the AA 6082 at comparable deformation parameters after annealing at 530 C for 15 minutes. This result is due to the effect of Mn-containing dispersoids in the AA 6082. The recrystallization grain size in the Alloy “R” seems to be unaffected by the deformation temperature after annealing for 15 minutes. The observation of the AA 6082 is quite different. A small increase in grain size is observed for both reduction ratios as the deformation temperature is elevated from 20 C to 200 C and further to 250 C. At extrusion temperatures of 300 C the recrystallization grains are significantly larger. Annealing experiments performed at 430 C on the AA 6082 indicates that a change in the deformation temperature from 200 C to 250 C does not affect the amount of stored energy in the material significantly. The Forge 2 programme has been used to perform numeric simulations of the forward extrusion experiment. From this the temperature distribution, strain rate variation and true strain development in the test piece had been investigated. As the simulated true strain values are compared to the grain size in the annealed material, the recrystallization grain size is related to the amount of stored energy in the material in a very convincing way. It is also shown that the recrystallization grain diameter is related to the amount stored energy as the grain diameter is investigated in the radial and the extrusion direction separately. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
