The <b>remaining</b> <b>portions</b> of modern NY28 were unnumbered. By 1926, the portion of current NY28 from Margaretville to Meredith was {{designated}} as part of NY64. Past Meredith, NY64 continued north to NY23 on Palmerville Road, McDougal Road, Rathbun Road, and Prosser Hollow Road. Additionally, the segment of modern NY28 from Middleville to Trenton was designated as part of NY29.

5|$|US 80 {{was removed}} from the state highway system in the 1964 state highway {{renumbering}} when I-80 was designated; I-8 assumed the routing from San Diego to El Centro and Yuma. However, US 80 signs were posted for several years afterward on the <b>remaining</b> <b>portions</b> of the original asphalt road that had not been bypassed by the freeway. The AASHO formally recognized California's requested elimination of US 80 by 1969. Gradually, the route {{was removed from}} Arizona, New Mexico and part of Texas between 1977 and 1991. After the freeway was built, the population of Jacumba went from 400 to 200, and many businesses closed or relocated. However, the population began to increase after a few years, and residents began commuting to jobs in El Centro and San Diego. Following a campaign from the local Old Highway 80 Committee and endorsement from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, the California State Legislature passed a resolution allowing for the route to be designated and signed as a state historic route, Historic U.S. Route 80, in 2006.|$|E
