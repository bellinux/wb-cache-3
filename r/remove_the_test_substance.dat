30|$|A {{new test}} method {{suited for the}} {{assessment}} of the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is proposed. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> method foresees that an accurately known amount of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added to the sludge inoculum, and that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of <b>the</b> surfactant <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> By measuring <b>the</b> difference in the gas volumes produced in the sludge inoculum plus <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this <b>test</b> allows <b>the</b> quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> {{should be}} {{unambiguously}} {{described by the}} sponsor {{in accordance with the}} quality assurance requirements (see Item 1).

30|$|The {{development}} of a new test method suited for the assessment of the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is based on an analysis of the existing methods, which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002). As the most promising basis, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> method according to DIN 38414, part 8 was chosen. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> method was modified in that way that an accurately known amount of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added to the sludge inoculum, and that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of <b>the</b> surfactant <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> By measuring <b>the</b> difference in the gas volumes produced (after the second addition of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance)</b> in <b>the</b> sludge inoculum plus <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this <b>test</b> allows <b>the</b> quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{purity of}} <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> was not stated {{in six of}} the nine studies. Neither {{stability}} nor by-products of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> was stated {{in any of the}} studies. Other factors such as vapor pressure, water solubility, octanol/water partitioning coefficient (logKow) and bioconcentration factor were missing in several or all of the studies.|$|R
30|$|As <b>the</b> general <b>test</b> principal, <b>the</b> {{difference}} between the gas production from the bottles containing <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and <b>the</b> bottles without <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> (blank) is taken as the evaluation criterion for assessing the anaerobic degradation of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> Determination of <b>the</b> amount of gas that is dissolved in the liquid medium is neglected to keep the method {{as simple as possible}} (it is expected that neglecting to IC does cause only a relatively small error, because the ration between the volume of the liquid medium and <b>the</b> amount of <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> added is much lower in <b>the</b> AnBUSDic <b>test</b> compared to e.g. OECD 311).|$|R
30|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities we have modified <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> scheme of <b>the</b> DIN 38414, part 8 in regard to <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> addition. Assuming that any unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface activity of the added surfactant takes place immediately after {{the addition of the}} surfactant, we have introduced a second <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> addition into <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> scheme. <b>The</b> second addition of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> should ideally be done after the gas formation has reached the plateau phase.|$|R

30|$|As {{surfactants}} are a quite heterogeneous {{group of}} chemicals {{with regard to}} structure, charge, molecular weight, they have different physicochemical properties.

30|$|OECD TG 305 {{describes}} a procedure for characterizing the bioconcentration potential of <b>substances</b> in fish. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> {{consists of two}} phases: the exposure (uptake) and post-exposure (depuration) phases. During the uptake phase, separate groups of fish of one species are exposed to at least two concentrations of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> They are then transferred to a medium free of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> for <b>the</b> depuration phase. The concentration of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> in <b>the</b> fish is followed through both phases of <b>the</b> <b>test.</b> Where possible, <b>the</b> BCF is calculated preferably both as {{the ratio of the}} concentration in the fish and in the water at apparent steady state (BCFss) and as the kinetic bioconcentration factor BCFK, which is the ratio of the rate constants of uptake (k 1) and depuration (k 2) assuming first-order kinetics [2]. OECD TG 305 does not define specific analytical techniques to determine analyte concentrations in the water phase. Commonly applied are liquid-liquid extraction [LLE] and solid-phase extraction [SPE].|$|R
30|$|It {{is assumed}} that any unspecific {{digester}} gas evolution caused by the surface activity of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> takes place within the first three weeks. Therefore, after the initial degradation reaction has reached the plateau phase (usually at about day 21), another aliquot of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> (with or without the toxicity control) is added. To avoid oxygen entering the system, this is done e.g. under a nitrogen atmosphere. Verification of the anaerobic status of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> system at <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> using an oxygen indicator like resazurin – as in the OECD 311 - is not easily possible, as the high sludge concentration does not allow per se to determine {{the color of the}} redox dye.

40|$|Blood-brain barrier {{permeability}} studies made in man {{using the}} indicator dilution method {{revealed that the}} extraction of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> increases during <b>the</b> upslope of the venous (outflow) dilution curve. The present study aimed to obviate the possibility that this could result from intravascular phenomena, such as interlaminar diffusion (the result of differences in molecular size) and erythrocyte carriage. Several reference substances were employed for {{the determination of the}} extraction in order that careful correction could be made for differences in intravascular behavior of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> and reference <b>substance.</b> <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>substances</b> studied were D-glucose, L-phenylalanine, water, propranolol, and benzodiazepines, representing both carrier-transported and lipophilic substances.

For all <b>the</b> <b>substances</b> <b>tested,</b> and after correction for intravascular phenomena, the extractions were found to increase during the initial part of the dilution curve. This increasing extraction can be ascribed to heterogeneity of the cerebral circulation; the higher extraction corresponds to longer contact with the blood-brain barrier and indicates a longer transit time. Signs of heterogeneity were also present when blood flow was elevated above normal. Any influence that heterogeneity might have on the mean extraction value can be minimized by using an appropriate calculation of the extraction of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|R
30|$|An {{explanation}} for the overestimation of the degradation value is that the total organic carbon (TOC) value {{used to calculate the}} theoretical gas production (using Equation one from Bendt and Willing [5]) is too low and does not represent the TOC left in the system in phase 2. There was a discussion within Bendt and Willing [5] with regards to the calculation of the maximum theoretical gas production value if 100 % of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> TOC was to be degraded. It was argued that the TOC used in the calculation of the theoretical gas production should be taken as the TOC from the second addition of <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> only. <b>The</b> justification was that when phase 1 reaches the plateau phase <b>the</b> remaining <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is no longer degradable and that the addition of the remaining phase 1 TOC to the second phase TOC (for use in calculating theoretical gas production) would lead to underestimation of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> degradability (i.e. a theoretical gas production value which was too large). It is suggested that in the degradation rate graph, the plateau phase does not equate to <b>the</b> end of <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> degradation, but rather that the degradation of sludge with and without <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is <b>the</b> same (as defined by Equation four). Achieving results of up to 130 % degradation during <b>the</b> ring <b>tests</b> suggests that <b>the</b> degradability of <b>test</b> <b>substances</b> is being to a certain extent overestimated.|$|R
