5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 <b>remodel,</b> using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that <b>remodel,</b> the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Bone <b>remodeling</b> {{process is}} {{investigated}} theoretically and numerically {{within the framework}} of the extended adaptive elasticity. The coupling between the internal and surface <b>remodeling</b> is considered for the solution of the bone <b>remodeling</b> process. A semi-analytical solution based on the state-space method was used to analyze <b>remodeling</b> process of inhomogeneous bone materials subjected to multi-field loadings. The results show that, in contrast to the former works without considering the coupling between the internal and the surface <b>remodeling,</b> the magnitude of the electrical field changes is obviously lower and the <b>remodeling</b> time is shorten significantly. This implies that the coupling between the internal and the surface <b>remodeling</b> plays an important role in the bone <b>remodeling</b> process...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{consequences}} of aggressive therapy following a myocardial infarction (MI) on ventricular <b>remodeling</b> {{are not well}} established. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to analyze the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and predictors of left ventricular <b>remodeling</b> in the era of modern medical therapy. Material/Methods: Clinical characteristics and echocardiographic data were analyzed in 66 consecutive patients with anterior infarction at admission and at 6 -month follow-up. Ventricular <b>remodeling</b> was defined as an increase of 10 % in ventricular end-systolic or end-diastolic diameter. Results: In our study, 58 % of patients presented with ventricular <b>remodeling.</b> Patients with <b>remodeling</b> possessed higher total plasma creatine kinase (CPK), MB-fraction (CPK-MB), heart rate, heart failure, shortness of breath, and reperfusion therapy than patients without <b>remodeling.</b> In contrast, patients with <b>remodeling</b> had a smaller ejection fraction, E-Wave deceleration time (EDT), and early (E' Wave) and late (A' Wave) diastolic mitral annulus velocity (average of septal and lateral walls), but a higher E/E' than patients without <b>remodeling.</b> Patients with <b>remodeling</b> used more diuretics, digoxin, oral anticoagulants and aldosterone antagonists than patients without <b>remodeling.</b> In the multivariate analyses, only E' Wave was an independent predictor of ventricular <b>remodeling.</b> Each 1 unit increase in the E' Wave was associated with a 59 % increased odds of ventricular <b>remodeling.</b> Conclusions: In patients with anterior MI, despite contemporary treatment, ventricular <b>remodeling</b> is still a common event. In addition, diastolic function can have an important role as a predictor of <b>remodeling</b> in this scenario...|$|R

40|$|Next to plaque formation, {{arterial}} geometric <b>remodelling</b> is {{an important}} determinant of luminal narrowing in atherosclerotic disease. Expansive <b>remodelling</b> retards, whereas constric-tive <b>remodelling</b> accelerates lumen loss by plaque formation. Expansive arterial <b>remodelling</b> is a double edged sword, however. While luminal area is preserved, the plaque {{beneath the surface of}} the lumen often reveals large atheroma with heavy inflammation in expansive <b>remodelling.</b> These characteristics have been associated with plaque rupture and subsequent myocardial infarction. Thus, in the long term expansive <b>remodelling</b> may lead to thrombosis of angiographically silent lesions while constrictive <b>remodelling</b> is often associated with stable coronary syndromes.

40|$|Background—In vivo {{studies with}} {{intravascular}} ultrasound {{have shown that}} complex plaque anatomy and plaque rupture are more frequent {{in the presence of}} marked outward <b>remodeling.</b> A large lipid core and a high macrophage count are recognized histological markers for plaque vulnerability. The link between plaque vulnerability in terms of these markers and <b>remodeling</b> in coronary arteries has not been explored. Methods and Results—In 88 male subjects who died suddenly with coronary artery disease, 108 plaques were studied. The percent <b>remodeling</b> was calculated. Lesions with <b>remodeling</b> 0 % were considered to have positive <b>remodeling,</b> and those in which <b>remodeling</b> was 0 % were considered to have negative <b>remodeling.</b> Percent lipid core and macrophage count at the plaque were assessed. Of 108 plaque sites, 64 (59. 2 %) had undergone no <b>remodeling</b> or positive <b>remodeling,</b> and 44 (40. 7 %) had negative <b>remodeling</b> (vessel shrinkage). Lesions with positive <b>remodeling,</b> compared with lesions with vessel shrinkage, had a larger lipid core (percent mean lipid core was 39. 021. 0 % versus 22. 323. 1 %, respectively; P 0. 0001) and a higher macrophage count (mean macrophage count was 15. 612. 3 versus 8. 911. 6, respectively; P 0. 005). Conclusions—We have shown that coronary artery plaques with positive <b>remodeling</b> have a higher lipid content and macrophage count, both markers of plaque vulnerability. These results may explain why plaque rupture is often apparent at sites with only modest luminal stenoses (but marked positive <b>remodeling).</b> (Circulation. 2002; 105 : 939 - 943. ...|$|R

40|$|Bone <b>remodelling</b> is the {{adaptation}} of bone mass in response to localized changes in loading conditions. The nature of the mechanical signal governing <b>remodelling,</b> however, remains the subject of continued investigation. The aims {{of this study were}} to use an iterative finite element (FE) bone <b>remodelling</b> technique to explore the effect of different <b>remodelling</b> signals in the prediction of bone <b>remodelling</b> behaviour. A finite element model of the turkey ulna, following that of Brown et al., was analysed using the ABAQUS package. The model was validated against the static predictions of the Brown et al. study.

However, its impact on left ventricular (LV) <b>remodeling</b> remains unclear. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to clarify whether elevated PBMC count contributed to LV <b>remodeling</b> in patients with AMI. Subjects and methodsA total of 131 patients with AMI were recruited. White blood cell (WBC), monocyte, and lymphocyte counts were measured at presentation and every 24 h for five days after presentation. The correlation between PBMC count and LV <b>remodeling</b> was evaluated. LV <b>remodeling</b> was defined as an increase of LV end-diastolic volume index ≥ 10 % at the 6 -month follow-up left ventriculography.
