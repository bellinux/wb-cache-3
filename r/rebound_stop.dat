Impulsive suspension loads are applied to tyre and suspension elements under such conditions. In particular, the aim is to specifically study the reactions of jounce bumper– <b>rebound</b> <b>stop</b> and tyre characteristics. For this purpose, a vehicle in-plane pitch dynamics model with 7 degrees of freedom suffices. Non-linear and hysteretic characteristics of the bump-stop elements are included through a new parametric map concept, based on displacement and velocity-dependent hysteresis. Furthermore, a static tyre model is described, tailored to predict the radial stiffness against penetration of an edge with a flat-type rigid body geometry. The tyre model is derived on the basis of classical membrane theory and represented in terms of only a few input parameters. Model validation is supported through experiments at both component and system levels...|$|E

40|$|Background: Few {{individuals}} commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) {{in primary}} HIV infection (PHI) maintain undetectable viremia after treatment cessation. Associated factors remain unclear {{given the importance}} of the phenomenon to cure research. Methods: Using CASCADE data of seroconverters starting ART in PHI (≤ 6 months from seroconversion), we estimated proportions experiencing viral blips (> 400 copies followed by 1000 copies per milliliter) and magnitude and frequency of blips while on ART, time from seroconversion to ART, time on ART, adjusting for mean number of HIV-RNA measurements/year while on ART, and other confounders. Results: Seven hundred seventy-eight seroconverters started ART in PHI with ≥ 3 HIV-RNA measurements. Median interquartile range (IQR) ART duration was 16. 2 (8. 0 – 35. 9) months, within which we observed 13 % with ≥ 1 blip. Of 228 who stopped ART, 119 rebounded; time to loss of control was associated with longer interval between seroconversion and ART initiation [hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 16 per month; 1. 04, 1. 28], and blips while on ART (HR = 1. 71 per blip; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 94 to 3. 10). Longer time on ART (HR = 0. 84 per additional month; 0. 76, 0. 92) was associated with lower risk of losing control. Of 228 stopping ART, 22 (10 %) maintained post treatment control (PTC), ie, HIV-RNA < 50 copies per milliliter ≥ 24 months after ART cessation. Conclusion: HIV viral blips on therapy are associated with subsequent viral <b>rebound</b> on <b>stopping</b> ART among individuals treated in PHI.

30|$|We have {{performed}} a combination {{study of the}} two treatments in the sst 2 -expressing CA 20948 tumor-bearing rat model on which we recently reported the first data [11]. In this study, we compared either 177 Lu-DOTATATE, RAD 001, or their combination for treatment of tumor-bearing rats. RAD 001 was administered orally twice a week for 4.5  weeks, and a suboptimal dose of 177 Lu-DOTATATE (leaving room for additional effect of RAD 001) was given once. Unexpectedly, we observed that the majority (77 %) of rats treated with RAD 001 (single treatment or combined with PRRT) developed metastases. We have used this subcutaneous CA 20948 tumor model in many PRRT studies for more than 10  years, and metastases never occurred before. We have hypothesized that a <b>rebound</b> effect after <b>stopping</b> the RAD 001 treatment after 4.5  weeks initiated a metastasizing process. Furthermore, we observed that rats treated with the combination of RAD 001 and 177 Lu-DOTATATE showed less impressive anti-tumor effects compared to those treated with 177 Lu-DOTATATE-only.|$|R

40|$|Although {{widespread}} {{availability of}} antiretroviral therapy (ART) has markedly enhanced survival in HIV- 1 infected individuals, its long-term use and cessation {{has been linked}} to an increase in non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of these complications is thought to reflect excessive immune activation and inflammation. The SMART trial showed that in chronic HIV- 1 infection, inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers were predictive of all cause mortality, and that stopping ART lead to a rise in these biomarkers. The impact of interrupting ART started in primary HIV- 1 infection (PHI) on these biomarkers is unknown. This thesis examines the effect of different stages of HIV- 1 infection on markers of inflammation, coagulation and immune activation, and focuses on the effects of short-course ART in participants enrolled in the SPARTAC trial; a blinded RCT investigating the role of short-course ART versus no therapy in PHI. Baseline parameters associated with biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation, immune activation, endothelial activation and microbial translocation, and the effect of starting and stopping ART on IL- 6 and D-dimer levels, were examined in SPARTAC participants. Viral dynamics on treatment discontinuation were compared in PHI (SPARTAC) to chronic infection (SMART). The majority of biomarkers were raised in HIV- 1 infected individuals compared to healthy controls and highly correlated with HIV RNA levels. Viral and host factors, including age, HLA type and viral tropism, determined levels of T-cell activation. IL- 6 and D-dimer fell significantly on commencing ART but rebounded to baseline levels within 4 weeks of <b>stopping.</b> Viral <b>rebound</b> after <b>stopping</b> ART initiated in PHI was lower than that observed in chronic infection. This work highlights factors associated with immune activation and inflammation in PHI, which could potentially be used to identify individuals at high risk of disease progression. Immune activation and inflammation are influenced by direct effects of the virus, ART and other variables. The clinical impact of these findings warrants further investigation.

40|$|AbstractFundamental {{safety measure}} for falling {{is to prepare}} flat and {{effective}} wide workplace with guardrails. However, their countermeasures {{may be difficult to}} apply for short-duration works and disaster relief works. In such cases, the fall arrest system has been applied to the height workplaces. This study focuses on fundamental characteristics of full body harness in various postures of wearer during falling. Three kinds of situation, such as (1) leg first fall, (2) head first fall, and (3) stop falling when the wearer body in parallel to the ground, were considered to recognize the performance. Experiments were carried out using 735 N of human dummy, called HybridIII pedestrian 50 %tile model in the automobile industry. The shock-absorber of the Lanyards used in this study were designed about 4 kN. Impact force acting on hook, head accelerations, and a chest displacement were measured during falling. From the results, not only the vertical acceleration of the human dummy but also horizontal were measured. Due to the horizontal acceleration, a huge bending moment acting on the dummy's neck observed in several situations. It indicates that the wearer may have risks of whiplash or more serious injuries such as dislocation of cervical vertebrae or spinal injuries. Chest deformations measured in this study were not also small for aged workers. It indicates that there are some risks of rid fractures or related chest injuries. The back of the head crashed aggressively to the D-ring of the full harness when the dummy <b>rebounded</b> due to <b>stop</b> falling by lanyard. Therefore, special helmet to resist the impact force due to D-ring, and the design force of shock-absorber should be reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the virological and biochemical relapse rates in Chinese CHB patients with lamivudine-induced HBeAg seroconversion after stopping lamivudine therapy, {{and to identify}} significant viral or biochemical factors predictive of subsequent relapse. METHODS: All patients from all Hepatology Clinic with lamivudine-induced HBeAg seroconversion with subsequent cessation of lamivudine therapy were recruited. Liver biochemistry, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and serum HBV DNA by PCR (COBAS Taqman) was determined {{at the time of}} stopping lamivudine, at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and yearly thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included, of which 16 (73 %) were male with a median age of 32 years (range, 21 - 55). The median duration of follow-up was 104 months (range, 31 - 150). Six (27 %) patients had undetectable HBV DNA by PCR at the time of stopping lamivudine treatment. In total, 7 (32 %) patients had subsequent flare (as defined by ALT > 2 x upper limit of normal), with associated virological rebound of HBV DNA (as defined by 1 log increase from time of stopping therapy). The cumulative incidence of flare at 5 years was 44 %, all occurring before 25 months. There {{was no significant difference in}} the cumulative incidence of flares between those patients that continued lamivudine for 6 - 12 months, 1 - 2 years and over 2 years after HBeAg seroconversion (p= 0. 58). In patients who had normal ALT and undetectable HBV DNA, their cumulative incidence of flare was not significantly different to those that had detectable HBV DNA or abnormal ALT at time of stopping lamivudine (p= 0. 73). Two patients underwent HBeAg seroreversion at 5 and 10 months, with resulting flares. The cumulative incidence of HBeAg seroreversion after stopping lamivudine was 9 % at 5 years. Fourteen (64 %) patients underwent virological rebound, with a cumulative incidence of 82 % at 4 years. There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of virological rebound in patients with undetectable HBV DNA at the time of stopping lamivudine therapy compared to those with detectable HBV DNA. Of those with virological rebound, 8 (57 %) had HBV DNA > 105 copies/ml. Neither patient age or gender, genotype, presence of precore or core promoter mutations were significant factors in subsequent flare or virological <b>rebound</b> after <b>stopping</b> lamivudine therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite the high sustained HBeAg seroconversion (81 %) after stopping lamivudine, HBV DNA rebound occurred in 64 %, of which 57 % had HBV DNA > 105 copies/ml and 32 % had ALT flares. Patients who had both normal ALT and undetectable HBV DNA by PCR at the time of stopping lamivudine therapy did not have a lower cumulative incidence of flares. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
2500|$|Michigan Tech hosted Wisconsin for a two-game series the {{following}} weekend {{to open its}} WCHA conference schedule, but did so without junior defenseman Tommy Brown, who underwent an appendectomy that week. Pearson wanted his team to play with more discipline so as to limit the Badgers' power play chances, and the Huskies responded by taking one penalty through the first two periods of the Friday game. Michigan Tech freshman Tanner Kero opened the scoring {{in the second period}} with his first career goal by deflecting a shot from Riley Sweeney. In the third period, however, the Huskies incurred two consecutive penalties in the first seven minutes, and Wisconsin forward Tyler Barnes beat Josh Robinson for a power play goal. The Huskies outshot the Badgers 16–8 in the third period, but could not put the puck past Landon Peterson to win the game in regulation. Nearly three minutes into the overtime period, Michigan Tech started a dump-and-chase and Peterson stopped the puck behind his net, but he collided with teammate John Ramage while the Huskies forechecked, leaving Jordan Baker to score on an undefended goal and win the game. In the Saturday game, Wisconsin started Joel Rumpel at goaltender and Huskies forwards Kero and Blake Pietila each scored a power play goal on a deflection. Midway through the second period, Wisconsin scored off a <b>rebound</b> after Robinson <b>stopped</b> the initial shot. Michigan Tech killed off a five-minute major penalty to Alex MacLeod in the third period, but the Badgers tied the game with two minutes remaining. Twenty seconds into overtime, however, Huskies captain Brett Olson scored on a wrap-around shot that went through Rumpel's five-hole for the win. Pearson was pleased with his team's performance, saying, [...] "Our kids are working hard, there's {{a lot of good things}} going on in our locker room and we see it every day as coaches".

40|$|Purpose of the study: Efficacy of DRV-containing regimen in antiretroviral-experienced {{patients}} in Brazil is unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors associated with virologic failure (VF) to DRV containing salvage regimen in experienced HIV-infected {{patients in}} Sao Paulo and also determine the prevalence of DRV resistance associated mutations (RAM) in this population. Methods: Retrospective study of 131 patients who started a DRV-containing salvage regimen between 12 / 2007 to 12 / 2009 in 2 centers in Sao Paulo. Protease resistance mutations listed by 2011 IAS-USA panel update were considered. Genotypic sensitivity score (GSS) was calculated for the proposed regimen using the 2008 Rega algorithm. We have assessed VF during 48 weeks of follow up and VF was defined as the failure to achieve viral suppression in 48 weeks or viral <b>rebound</b> after suppression. <b>Stopping</b> the use of DRV for any reason was also considered VF. Summary of results: We analysed 131 patients, 71 % male, median age 44 y. More than half of the patients had a baseline CD 4 cell count&# 60; 200 /mm 3 (58, 9 %) although only 21, 4 % presented a VL &#x 2265; 100. 000 copies/ml. 78, 6 % had previous used more than 2 PI and more than half of the patients harbored viruses with at least 11 IAS PI resistance mutations (59, 5 %) The majority of patients had less than 2 DRV RAM (84, 7 %) and the most prevalent major and minor DRV RAM were respectively I 84 V (24, 4 %) and L 33 F (34, 3 %). Most patients (79, 4 %) have received more than 2 active drugs in their regimen. Twenty patients (15, 3 %) have failure in achieving VL &# 60; 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks. Ten patients were lost of follow up and the remaining 10 were treatment failure. In multivariate analysis, VL&#x 2265; 100. 000 copies/mL (p= 0, 002), less than 15 years of HIV diagnosis (p= 0, 013) and previous fosamprenavir use (p= 0, 027) were independently predictive of VF. Conclusions: This study, conducted in routine clinical conditions, is probably the large cohort to evaluate risk factors to VF with DRV containing regimen worldwide and is the first one to evaluate prevalence of VF with DRV containing regimen in Brazil. We found an elevated response rate in this population (84, 7 %) which couples with the low number of DRV RAM despite the elevated number of previous PI used and by the high GSS. The factors associated with VF were similar to previous reports except for the time of HIV diagnosis, and one can speculate that this correlates with lower adherence in this group...|$|R
