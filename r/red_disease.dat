5000|$|Edwardsiella tarda is {{a member}} of the Enterobacteriaceae family. The {{bacterium}} is a facultatively anaerobic, small, motile, gram negative, straight rod with flagella. Infection causes Edwardsiella septicemia (also known as ES, edwardsiellosis, emphysematous putrefactive disease of catfish, fish gangrene, and <b>red</b> <b>disease)</b> in channel fish, eels, and flounder. Edwardsiella tarda is also found in largemouth bass and freshwater species such as rainbow trout. It is a zoonosis and can infect a variety of animals including fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Edwardsiella tarda has also been the cause of periodic infections for various animals within zoos. E. tarda has a worldwide distribution and can be found in pond water, mud, and the intestine of fish and other marine animals. [...] It is spread by carrier animal feces.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} investigations of intestinal microflora {{were made on}} healthy and diseased eels collected from culturing ponds in Yoshida, Shizuoka Prefecture. The whole intestine of each eel was homogenized in sterile 0. 85 %NaCl solution. Tenfold dilutions were prepared and 0. 1 ml of which was inoculated {{on the surface of}} nutrient agar(Difco). Plate cultures were incubated for five or seven days at 25 °C and colonies were counted. Every colony within a given area of the plate of suitable dilutions was subcultured for identification. The numbers of viable bacteria per gram of intestinal tract with contents in healthy eels were ranged from 10 to 10 ^ 9 through the year. The percentage of Aeromonas spp. (mostly A. hydrophila) was relatively higher in winter, while that of En:erobacteriacea was higher from spring to fall. Vibrio sp. appeared only in October. Streptococcus sp. was always present 20 % to 80 % in the intestine of fed eels. Viable counts of intestinal bacteria of diseased eels were 10 to 10 ^ 6 higher than those of the healthy ones (Fig. 1 and Table 4).

40|$|Surveys {{undertaken}} on diseases {{caused by}} Vibrio spp. in Penaeus monodon from culture ponds of coastal Andhra Pradesh recorded {{the occurrence of}} five types of diseases : tailnecrosis,shelldisease,reddisease,looseshellsyndrome(LSS), and white gut disease(WGD). Amongthese,LSS,WGD,and <b>red</b> <b>disease</b> caused mass mortalities in shrimp cultureponds. Six species of Vibrio V. harveyi,V. parahaemolyticus,V. alginolyticus,V. anguillarum,V. vulnificus,and V. splendidus {{are associated with the}} diseased shrimp. The number of Vibrio spp. associated with each disease ranged from two to five. Additionally,shrimp with <b>red</b> <b>disease</b> had concurrent infections with white spot syndrome virus. Vibrio harveyi in the case of LSS and WGD, V. parahaemolyticus for reddisease, and V. algino-lyticus for shell disease are the major etiologcalagents. Differences occur in the degree of virulence of different species of Vibrio and also different isolates of the same species. Vibrioharveyi isolated from LSS shrimp is the most virulent. Ingeneral, allthe Vibrio isolates from LSS shrimp tend to be more virulent as compared to their counter parts fromo the diseased shrimp. It is apparent that the degree of virulence of various Vibrio isolates depends on its source and the pond environmental conditions. Most of the Vibrio isolates showed susceptibility to oxy-tetracycline, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. The luminous V. harveyi exhibited resistance to many antibiotics and susceptibility to only three drugs. Considering the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains of Vibrio, the need for using probiotics in place of antibiotics for disease control is stressed...|$|E

Investigations initially covered diseases of hatchery-bred shrimp fry and extensively-cultured shrimp juveniles which eventually extended to semi-intensive and intensive cultured shrimps. To date the following diseases of Penaeus monodon and other Penaeids in the Philippines were reported: Monodon Baculovirus (MBV) Disease, the Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) Disease, Hepatopancreatic Parvo-like Virus (HPV) Disease, Yellow-head Virus (YHV) Disease, Spawner-isolated Mortality Virus Disease, Luminous Vibriosis, Other Vibrio Infections, Shell Disease, Filamentous Bacterial Disease, Chronic Soft Shell Syndrome, Blue Disease, <b>Red</b> <b>Disease,</b> Ascorbic Acid Deficiency Disease, Parasitic Infestations, Acid Sulfate Disease and Hypoxia.

40|$|Toxins {{produced}} by Aeromonas hydrophila strain A 10 in the muscle of carp {{at the site}} of injec-tion were studied. Carps injected with the crude toxins showed swelling and reddening of the body surface as those injected with the live bacteria. The toxic substance was partially purified from a extract of the necrotized muscles by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. As a result, it was suggested that a-type hemolysin was implicated in the toxicity. The hemolysin was heat-labile, and inactivated by EDTA, trypsin and papain, but stable at pH value between 4. 0 and 11. 2. Aeromonas hydrophila is an important pathogen of freshwater fishes. The disease was charac-terized by hemorrhages of the body surface and formation of hemorrhagic and necrotic regions in the internal organs (EGUSA, 1978). From bac-teriological and histopathological studies, the site of bacterial multiplication was generally con-fined, e. g. the eyes in the infectious disease of ayu (MIYAZAKI and Jo, 1985) and the intestines in <b>red</b> <b>disease</b> of eel (KANAI et ai., 1977; MIYAZAKI, 1980).

30|$|During {{the spring}} of 2010, a wide {{mortality}} occurred in two aquaculture farms, starting in the offshore farm and then the same sign and the same mortality occurred in the inshore farm. The clinical signs of vibriosis affecting sea bass (D. labrax) included darkened body colour, white nodular skin lesion and sudden death with haemorrhages in the skeletal muscle. The six strains isolated during our study were reported to exhibit variation {{in one or two}} biochemical reactions, inducing errors in species identification (Dileep et al. 2003). The atypical reactions in environmental Vibrio spices may pose difficulties in organism biochemical identification (Karunasagar et al. 1996). B. gladioli is indole negative and lysine decorboxylation negative bacteria, knowing that most of the Tunisian Vibrio isolates were negative for indole production (Ben Kahla-Nakbi et al. 2007). Identifying V. parahaemolyticus strains through PCR-based method which targets the conserved region of V. parahaemolyticus such as gyrB and toxR gene is more efficient, reliable and faster compared to identifying through biochemical tests (Kim et al. 1999). Although V. parahaemolyticus is widely distributed in the coastal environments all over the world, most of the environmental strains are not pathogenic to humans, and only 1 to 2 % of the environmental strains have shown to be positive Kanagawa TDH (Hervio-Heath et al. 2002; Robert-Pillot et al. 2004). In the present study, four of the isolates were found to exhibit weak haemolysis, and none of them was found to exhibit positive amplification for the tdh gene; none of the weak haemolytic strains were found to exhibit urease activity. It is likely that the tdh and trh positive strains are present in very low numbers along with strains negative for these genes (Dileep et al. 2003). The weak haemolysis points towards the presence of other virulence factors other than tdh in V. parahaemolyticus. This is confirmed during the determination of LD 50. All strains showing haemolytic activity are virulent and cause mortality during the infection tests even with the absence tdh and trh genes. V. parahaemolyticus is considered as a human pathogen more than a fish pathogen. Several cases of fish mortality due to this germ are reported in Mediterranean coasts (Alcaide et al. 1999; Zorrilla et al. 2003). The organism has been associated with mortalities in Iberian toothcarp (Aphanius iberus) with the signs centred on external haemorrhages and tail rot (Austin and Austin 2007). Cultures regarded as intermediate between V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus were recovered from diseased milkfish (Chanos chano s) in the Philippines (Austin and Austin 2007). In Penaeus monodon, the organism has been implicated as a cause of <b>red</b> <b>disease</b> in India (Jayasree 2009). Pathogenicity has been established in Solea senegalensis, amberjack and eel by i.p. infections with LD 50 dose of 6.3 [*]×[*] 105, 5 [*]×[*] 103 and 6.2 [*]×[*] 105  cfu fish− 1, respectively (Alcaide et al. 1999; Zorrilla et al. 2003). The corresponding value in abalone post-larvae was 3.5 × 105 cfu mL− 1, with the disease mirroring that of natural infections (Cai et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the commercial culture of penaeid shrimps and prawns {{has been accompanied by}} the occurrence of diseases of infectious and noninfectious etiologies. Many of the important penaeid diseases are caused by organisms {{that are part of the}} normal microflora and fauna of penaeids. These organisms are opportunistic pathogens that cause disease only under conditions that favor them over the host. Many organisms in this category are ubiquitous, and most have been recognized and/or reported from each of the major penaeid culture areas of the world. Included among this category of pathogens are the filamentous bacteria Leucothrix mucor, Flexibacter sp. and Cytophaga sp. (agents of filamentous gill and surface fouling diseases); the peritrich protozoans Zoothamnium sp., Epistylis sp., and Vorticella sp. (surface epibionts that cause protozoan gill disease and surface fouling diseases), the invasive bacteria Vibrio alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus (agents of various bacterial disease syndromes); and the fungi Lagenidium callinectes, Sirolpidium sp., and Fusarium solani (agents of the most common fungus diseases of penaeids). Among the most important disease-causing agents are the penaeid viruses. These penaeid viruses may once have been limited in their geographic distribution in wild stocks, but they have become widespread in penaeid culture facilities. With the advent of commercial penaeid hatcheries, the shipment of broodstock and postlarvae from these culture facilities to others in different geographic regions has often resulted in the spread of these agents outside their normal range in wild populations. Included in this category of the penaeid viruses are the baculoviruses: Baculovirus penaei (BP), P. monodon baculovirus (MBV), baculoviral midgut gland necrosis virus (BMN); the hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus (HPV); the probable picornavirus infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), and a reo-like virus in P. japonicus. The final group of important diseases of cultured penaeids are the nutritional, physical, and toxic disease syndromes. The ascorbic acid deficiency syndrome called "black death" is the best understood nutritional disease of penaeids. Among the physical diseases occurring in penaeid culture, gas bubble disease and tail cramp are probably the most common. Important toxic disease syndromes include aflatoxicosis and <b>red</b> <b>disease</b> (which may be due to mycotoxins); hemocytic enteritis (due to certain species of filamentous blue-green algae, especially Schizothrix calcicola) and toxic syndromes due to toxic algal blooms. There are five areas of research that should receive emphasis in the next several years in penaeid disease research: 1) Appropriately equipped laboratories in each of the major penaeid culture areas should identify and catalog those diseases occurring in culture facilities in their region; 2) Penaeid diagnostic laboratories should use, or strive to develop for general use, "standardized" diagnostic procedures whenever possible, especially for highly infectious agents such as the penaeid viruses; 3) Penaeid cell culture methods for primary cultures or cell lines must be developed to aid in the {{development of}} much needed rapid, sensitive diagnostic tests for the penaeid viruses; 4) Improved methods of disease prevention, control, or chemotherapy are needed for many of the penaeid diseases now adversely affecting the penaeid culture industry; and 5) Approval is needed from those government agencies (such as the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency) for the drugs and chemicals used as chemotherapeutics in penaeid culture that may pose a health risk to humans...|$|E

The aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of using an optical sensor to estimate <b>red</b> tip <b>disease</b> severity. This work was performed in a commercial pineapple plantation located in Simpang Renggam, Johor. Four observation plots bearing pineapple variety SR 36 were demarcated based on crop growth stage. Each plot comprised a total of eighty corresponding measurements of percent Disease Severity (% DS) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our data showed a strong correlation between % DS and NDVI. The 7 - and 11 -month plantings registered a correlation coefficient (r) of - 0. 83 and - 0. 88, respectively. The negative correlation infers that NDVI increases when disease severity is low. This is expected since healthy leaves reflect more near-infrared light and less visible light which results in a higher NDVI. The regression of NDVI on % DS for the 7 -month planting was explained by: % DS = 181. 6 - 185. 6 *NDVI. Meanwhile, the regression of NDVI on % DS for the 11 -month planting was explained by: % DS = 213. 2 - 219. 8 *NDVI. The linear fit between meas ured % DS and estimated % DS from the 7 - month and 11 -month plantings was relatively strong. This work has demonstrated that NDVI is a reliable predictor of % DS in pineapple. </p...|$|R
