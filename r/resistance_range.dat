The PCjr Color Display sold by IBM included an internal amplified speaker, being the only IBM monitor in the PC line to do so. Cartridge BASIC enhances the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality. Two joystick ports are also evidence of IBM's goal for marketing the PCjr as a home-friendly machine to compete with popular home machines like the Commodore 64, the Atari home computers, and the Apple II line. Other than the Tandy 1000, which was designed as an enhanced PCjr clone to directly compete with the PCjr, and Amstrad IBM PC compatible lines a few years later, the dual built-in joystick ports introduced by the PCjr never became standard on IBM PC compatibles, and have not been seen since. (However, the single 15-pin D-subminiature joystick port common on later PCs supports two two-axis, two-button joysticks like those supported by the PCjr, and the 15-pin port can be split out to two separate joystick ports with a passive Y-adapter cable.) Also, {{in addition to the}} joystick ports having a different connector from PC game ports, they require joysticks that had a different electrical <b>resistance</b> <b>range</b> in their X/Y axis controllers, necessitating the use of PCjr-compatible joysticks (or special electrical converter-adapters that were never mass-marketed).|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The growing demand in portable and compact consumer devices and appliances {{has resulted in the}} need for the miniaturisation of electronic components. These miniaturised electronic components are sensitive and susceptible to damage by voltages as low as 20 V. Electrically conductive styrenic thermoplastics are widely used in electronic packaging applications to protect these sensitive electronic components against electro-static discharge (ESD) during manufacturing, assembly, storage and shipping. Such ESD applications often require the optimal volume <b>resistance</b> <b>range</b> of ≥ 1. 0 x 105 to < 1. 0 x 108 Ω. The best known method to render styrenic thermoplastics conductive is by the incorporation of conductive fillers, such as carbon black but the main limitation is the difficulty in controlling the conductivity level due to the steep percolation curve. Thus the aim of this research is to develop electrically conductive styrenic thermoplastics by blending several styrenic resins with polymeric conductive additives to achieve optimal volume <b>resistance</b> <b>range</b> for ESD applications with the ease in controlling the conductivity level.

This issue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile.

The commercially available automatic speech valves close upon strong exhalation and open again when the pressure drops. This method makes long sentences or pauses difficult. The novel iValve is designed to allow almost natural speech, with mid-sentence pausing and whispering. METHODS: The inhalation closing flows and exhalation opening pressures of 6 iValve prototype versions at different settings were compared with physiological values. The airflow resistance at inhalation was compared to physiological values and to commercial valve values. RESULTS: The iValve prototypes showed flow and pressure ranges in concordance with the physiological values in the literature. The airflow resistance in the breathing mode was within the physiological airflow <b>resistance</b> <b>range,</b> yet above the values from the two commercial valves. The resistance in the speaking mode was above the physiological airflow <b>resistance</b> <b>range.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In vitro tests show that the iValve versions can be selected and adjusted to operate within the physiological range.
