She hadn't such a thing as an old friend in the world. 'Very well, then,' says the lawyer, you must trust me.

50|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, when {{interest}} {{loans were}} illegal, the main method of securing realty was by wadset (ME wedset). A wadset was a loan masked as a {{sale of land}} under right of reversion. The borrower (reverser) conveyed by charter a fee simple estate, in consideration of a loan, to the lender (wadsetter) who on redemption would <b>reconvey</b> the estate to the reverser by a second charter. The difficulty with this arrangement was that the wadsetter was absolute owner of the property and could sell it to a third party or refuse to <b>reconvey</b> it to the reverser, who was also stripped of his principal means of repayment and therefore in a weak position. In later years the practice—especially in Scotland and on the continent—was to execute together the wadset and a separate back-bond according the reverser an in personam right of reverter.|$|E

As a condition of that conveyance, Escambia County can <b>reconvey</b> the properties to the federal government or to the State of Florida. Title I would remove that condition and add new conditions. First, any conveyance of the specified properties would require the county to convey to Santa Rosa County any of the property that falls within the jurisdictional boundaries of Santa Rosa County. Second, any proceeds above the direct or incidental costs from conveyances would be transferred to the federal government. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing title I would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information provided by the National Park Service (NPS) and local government entities, CBO estimates that the proceeds from any conveyances would be used to cover those costs. [...] Title II, Anchorage, Alaska Formerly [...] Title II would require the Secretary of the Interior to convey the reversionary interest of the United States in three acres of land to the city of Anchorage, Alaska. Under current law, the city holds title to those lands and will retain title as long as the lands are used for public purposes. If the city stops using the lands for such purposes, title would revert to the federal government. [...] Based on information provided by the city of Anchorage, CBO expects that, under current law, the city would continue to use the affected lands for public purposes and hold title to those lands over the next 10 years. Furthermore, under title II, any administrative costs associated with conveying the reversionary interest in those lands would be paid by the city; therefore, CBO estimates that implementing title II would have no effect on the federal budget. [...] Title III, Fernley, NevadaFormerly [...] Title III would direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell up to 9,400 acres of federal land to the city of Fernley, Nevada.

To what extent can the initial ticket seller limit that transferability? Does it matter whether the initial purchaser planned to sell at a profit all along?

Part II looks more globally at the economics of the market in sales and resales of tickets. Part III examines and compares the roles of the private market and the government in transactions involving the sale and resale of event tickets.

40|$|The {{essential}} idea of real {{security is}} that the debtor transfer to the creditor a possessory interest in a specific item or aggregate of property, chattel or realty, to serve as security for the loan. There are four possible generic types: (1) the debtor vests both ownership and possession of the property in the creditor, subject to a personal obligation to <b>reconvey</b> on repayment; (2) the debtor vests ownership in the creditor, but retains possession of the property by leave of the creditor; (3) the debtor retains ownership of the property, but grants possession irrevocably to the creditor until repayment of the debt; and (4) the debtor retains both ownership and possession of the property, but transfers to the creditor a possessory interest in the property. These four types represent stages of increasingly sophisticated abstraction in the relationship of legal interests denominated as real security. Roman law knew all four of these modes under the names of muncipatio cum fiducia or in iure cessia cum fiducia (commonly known and hereafter designated simply as fiduci), pignus, and hypotheca. The exact character of the real security encompassed by each of these terms is difficult to ascertain and lately has oc- casioned some dispute among Roman law scholars. As a preliminary working definition it may be stated that fiducia. indicated the transfer of ownership to the creditor, who generally but not always retained possession as well; pignus indicated the retention of ownership by the debtor, but the transfer of possession to the creditor; and hypotheca indicated the retention of both ownership and possession by the debtor, but {{with the creation of}} a possessory interest in the creditor. It is {{the purpose of this article}} to present an appraisal of the historical evolution of the Roman real securities and a neutral delineation of the substantive law underlying each possible mode - ownership and possession in the creditor, ownership in the creditor with possession in the debtor, possession in the creditor but ownership in the debtor, and ownership and possession in the debtor with a possessory interest in the creditor entitling him to eventual legal possession...|$|E

5000|$|More recent {{research}} has shown that the background of Taltarum's Case was as follows. A man called Thomas Trevistarn granted land in Portreath to one William Smyth in fee tail. On William Smyth's death, his eldest son and heir Humphrey took possession of the land under the entail. Humphrey Smyth then conveyed part of the land to a man called John Tregoz, probably as part of a marriage settlement, and Tregoz accordingly <b>reconveyed</b> it back entailed on Humphrey and his wife Jane, with remainder to Humphrey's heirs. Humphrey's wife died childless, and he suffered a recovery of the land to another man, Thomas Talcarn (the person whose name was afterwards misspelt [...] "Taltarum"). At this point, Humphrey probably believed that the recovery, in accordance with usual practice, would bar both existing entails. Talcarn, in turn, conveyed it to Henry Hunt - probably without even taking possession. However, on Humphrey Smyth's death, John Smyth, the son and heir of Humphrey's younger brother Robert, claimed possession of the land under the original entail, evicting Hunt. The case itself was concerned with Hunt's action on forcible entry against John Smyth. Hunt {{would be able to get}} a favourable judgment if he, and his lawyer John Catesby, could demonstrate that the recovery to Talcarn had destroyed the operation of the entail originally created by Trevistarn.|$|R

One story I give, for it is singular in itself, {{is well known in}} Tahiti, and has this of interest, that it is post-Christian, dating indeed from but a few years back. A princess of the reigning house died; was transported to the neighbouring isle of Raiatea; fell there under the empire of a spirit who condemned her to climb coco-palms all day and bring him the nuts; was found after some time in this miserable servitude by a second spirit, one of her own house; and by him, upon her lamentations, <b>reconveyed</b> to Tahiti, where she found her body still waked, but already swollen with the approaches of corruption. It is a lively point in the tale that, on the sight of this dishonoured tabernacle, the princess prayed she might continue to be numbered with the dead. But it seems it was too late, her spirit was replaced by the least dignified of entrances, and her startled family beheld the body move. The seemingly purgatorial labours, the helpful kindred spirit, and the horror of the princess {{at the sight of her}} tainted body, are all points to be remarked.|$|R
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be <b>reconveyed.</b> An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|R
6000|$|In the Berlin Act, {{the three}} Powers recognise, on the threshold, [...] "the {{independence}} of the Samoan government, and the free right of the natives to elect their chief or king and choose their form of government." [...] True, the text continues that, [...] "in view of the difficulties that surround an election in the present disordered condition of the government," [...] Malietoa Laupepa shall be recognised as king, [...] "unless the three Powers shall by common accord otherwise declare." [...] But perhaps few natives have followed it so far, and even those who have, were possibly all cast abroad again by the next clause: [...] "and his successor shall be duly elected according to the laws and customs of Samoa." [...] The right to elect, freely given in one sentence, was suspended in the next, and a line or so further on appeared to be <b>reconveyed</b> by a side-wind. The reason offered for suspension was ludicrously false; in May 1889, when Sir Edward Malet moved the matter in the conference, the election of Mataafa was not only certain to have been peaceful, {{it could not have}} been opposed; and behind the English puppet it was easy to suspect the hand of Germany. No one is more swift to smell trickery than a Samoan; and the thought, that, under the long, bland, benevolent sentences of the Berlin Act, some trickery lay lurking, filled him with the breath of opposition. Laupepa seems never to have been a popular king. Mataafa, on the other hand, holds an unrivalled position in the eyes of his fellow-countrymen; he was the hero of the war, he had lain with them in the bush, he had borne the heat and burthen of the day; they began to claim that he should enjoy more largely the fruits of victory; his exclusion was believed to be a stroke of German vengeance, his elevation to the kingship was looked for as the fitting crown and copestone of the Samoan triumph; and but a little after the coming of the chief justice, an ominous cry for Mataafa began to arise in the islands. It is difficult to see what that official could have done but what he did. He was loyal, as in duty bound, to the treaty and to Laupepa; and when the orators of the important and unruly islet of Manono demanded to his face a change of kings, {{he had no choice but}} to refuse them, and (his reproof being unheeded) to suspend the meeting. Whether by any neglect of his own or the mere force of circumstance, he failed, however, to secure the sympathy, failed even to gain the confidence, of Mataafa. The latter is not without a sense of his own abilities or of the great service he has rendered to his native land. He felt himself neglected; at the very moment when the cry for his elevation rang throughout the group he thought himself made little of on Mulinuu; and he began to weary of his part. In this humour, he was exposed to a temptation which I must try to explain, as best I may be able, to Europeans.|$|R
