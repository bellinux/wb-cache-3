5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the Sun's radius. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E

5|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), {{also called the}} lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a {{waddling}} gait due to its shorter front legs; it is <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.|$|E
5|$|The story {{takes place}} in the world of Eora, in a region placed in the {{southern}} hemisphere called the Eastern Reach, an area <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> Spain. The Eastern Reach contains several nations, including the Free Palatinate of Dyrwood, a former colony of the mighty Aedyr Empire that won its independence through a revolutionary war; the Vailian Republics, a confederation of sovereign city-states; and the Penitential Regency of Readceras, a quasi-theocratic state ruled by priests of the god Eothas.|$|E
5|$|Which {{part of the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum—the visible, near-infrared (NIR) or mid-infrared (MIR)—produces the most accurate angular measurement is still debated. In 1996, Betelgeuse was shown to have a uniform disk of 56.6 ± 1.0mas. In 2000, the SSL team produced another measure of 54.7 ± 0.3mas, ignoring any possible contribution from hotspots, which are less noticeable in the mid-infrared. Also included was a theoretical allowance for limb darkening, yielding a diameter of 55.2 ± 0.5mas. The earlier estimate equates to a radius of roughly 5.6AU or , assuming the 2008 Harper distance of 197.0 ± 45pc, a figure <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU, published in 2009 in Astronomy Magazine {{and a year later}} in NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day.|$|E

In contrast, differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat of Asia are slight, {{to the point where}} the two species were once thought to be conspecific. The only noticeable differences between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat are the former's much shorter and coarser fur, larger ears, and longer postmolar extension of the palate.|$|E

25|$|A scapula {{from the}} Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, about 70 mya (million years ago), {{was found in}} the Nemegt Formation in Mongolia; it is now in the PIN collection.

A Maastrichtian (Late Cretaceous, c. 66 mya) right femur, AMNH FR 25272 from the Lance Formation near Lance Creek, Wyoming, is sometimes suggested to be the second-oldest record of the Phalacrocoracidae; this was from a rather smaller bird, {{about the size of a}} long-tailed cormorant.|$|E
25|$|However, {{pressure}} from the Admiralty kept microwaves in everyone's mind. While the 1.5m sets were fine for detecting larger ships, they could not effectively see smaller objects, like U-Boat conning towers. This was {{for the same reason}} that antennas need to be <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the wavelength; to provide a reasonable reflection, the objects need to be at several times larger than the wavelength. The Admiralty had the advantage of administering the UK's vacuum tube development efforts, under the Communication Valve Development Committee (CVD), and were able to continue development of suitable tubes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} was that the three button Xerox mouse cost over US$400 to build, which was not practical for a consumer-based personal computer. Apple commissioned Hovey-Kelley Design (which later became IDEO) to assist them with the mouse design, which not only had to be redesigned to cost US$25 instead of US$400, but also needed to be tested with real consumers outside a laboratory setting to learn how people were willing to use it. Hundreds of prototypes later, Apple settled on a single button mouse, <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> a deck of cards. With the design complete, the operating system was adapted to interface with the single button design using keystrokes in combination with button clicks to recreate some of the features desired from the original Xerox three-button design.|$|E
