2500|$|The SAB AB-20 was a four-engine night bomber {{development}} of the three-engine Dyle et Bacalan DB-70 airliner. The change of manufacturer's name {{was the result of}} the financial failure of Dyle et Bacalan in 1929, followed by its immediate reappearance as SAB, who took over DB-70 development. The latter was built around a thick, wide chord airfoil centre section which provided generous internal space for passengers. The engines were mounted on this structure as were twin fuselages to carry the tail. [...] The outer wings were of normal thickness and chord, and the cockpit and undercarriage were also attached to the centre section. [...] The generous intra-wing volume equally offered crew, fuel and bomb-room for military purposes. [...] Initially the AB-20 was intended to have three engines like its predecessor, but during the design phase there was a military <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a bombardier's <b>position</b> and a gunner's cockpit in the nose, which required the removal of the centre engine and its replacement by two extra engines wing-mounted outboard of the centre section.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{combination}} between a routing protocol Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) and Hierarchical Location Service (HLS) that we denote Hybrid Hierarchical Location Service (HHLS). HLS and GPSR {{used to be}} combined in the original work with a direct method, i. e. GPRS takes care of routing packets and HLS is called to get the destination position when the target node position is not known or is not fresh enough. When a destination is quite {{far away from the}} sender, the exact position of the target is calculated, and an extra overhead is generated from sender to receiver. Our main purpose is to reduce this overhead in HHLS. We suggest to proceed as follows: when a packet has to be sent to the destination, it will be sent directly to the former position of the target instead of <b>requesting</b> <b>for</b> the exact <b>position.</b> When the packet is approaching the former position, the exact position request is then sent. We have proposed a patch over the NS- 2 simulator for HHLS according to our proposal. We have conducted experimentations which show promising results in terms of latency, packet delivery rate and overhead...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain more {{knowledge}} concerning individuals’ preferences for alternative GPs within a municipality. We have data on the population’s first, second and third choice of GPs. The data stem from the entry form the inhabitant filled in as a result of the implementation of a list patient system in general practice in Norway. To assess the potential demand for GPs 3 or individuals’ <b>request</b> <b>for</b> a <b>position</b> on a certain GP’s list, we formulate and estimate a structural demand model based on probabilistic theories of individual choice behaviour. The model originates from the work of Luce (see for instance Luce, 1959 and Block and Marschak, 1960). Such models are successfully used to obtain knowledge of people’s preferences for different transportation vehicles. We raise the question of whether individuals’ choice of GPs is informed or purely random, as well as the question of whether observable demographic characteristics of a GP can tell us anything about the person who wants him or her as a personal physician. We find systematic dependencies between characteristics of an individual and characteristics of his or her choice of a GP. But we also find that the random part plays a major role in the choice process. In the last part of the paper we discuss policy implications of our findings. Central points are both how local health authorities can use the information on rankings to put together collegiums of GPs that serve the need – or the demand – of the inhabitants in the best way, and how a payment system for GPs should be designed if our results should be taken into account.

40|$|In indoor environments, {{visible light}} {{communications}} paradigm {{is emerging as}} a viable promising solution complementary to well-known radio frequency technology. At the same time, the information about user's location is useful for accessing the medium via space-division multiplexing, handling over or providing access to location-based contents. In this paper, we present two localization mechanisms based on the wavelength domain by assuming that each anchor point uses a spectrally dedicated signature for the user to readily identify it. The first approach, i. e., wavelength-based localization, assumes a simultaneous transmission of three different pulse streams emitted by the red-green-blue (RGB) light emitting diodes (LEDs). The second method, i. e., color-based localization, considers the subsequent transmission of RGB pulses. Localization is then computed through traditional received signal strength and time difference of arrival approaches. Moreover, we resort to the properties of metamerism so that the red, green, and blue components used by LEDs provide the white light sensation to the human eye. The performances of the two proposed schemes are close to theoretical bounds. Even in the worst cases, the estimation error variance is {{in the order of}} $ 10 ^- 4 $ m$^ 2 $. Finally, the signaling <b>request</b> <b>for</b> estimating user <b>position</b> is less than others in the literature and is independent from the number of anchor points...|$|R
