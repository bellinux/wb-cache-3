50|$|Some coco peat is {{not fully}} {{decomposed}} when it arrives and will use up available nitrogen as it does so (known as drawdown), competing with the plant {{if there is not}} enough. This is called nitrogen robbery; it can cause nitrogen deficiency in the plants. Poorly sourced <b>coco</b> <b>fibre</b> can have excess salts in it and needs washing (check electrical conductivity of run-off water, flush if high). It holds water well and holds around 1000 times more air than soil. Adding slow release fertilizers or organic fertilizers are highly advised when growing with <b>coco</b> <b>fibre.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Naples during a 12 -month period, in a heated glasshouse (set point 12 °C). The effects of the addition of an upper <b>coco</b> <b>fibre</b> layer to perlite on growth and productivity of cut gerbera grown in pot in an open hydroponic system were investigated. Plants of Gerbera jamesonii cultivar Leader were cultivated at the planting density of 5. 5 plants per m 2 and fertilized via a drip-system. EC and pH of nutrient solution were kept at 1. 6 dS m- 1 and 6. 0 respectively and the number of pulses ranged from 1 (October-January) to 7 (July) per day (400 ml per pulse). The addition of the upper layer of <b>coco</b> <b>fibre</b> to the perlite raised the leaf water potentials (- 0. 74 vs - 0. 84 MPa) and the rates of net assimilation (13. 7 vs 12. 1 mol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) and transpiration (6. 01 vs 5. 19 mmol H 2 O m- 2 s- 1) of Gerbera plants compared to the perlite only, and higher differences were observed during the warmer months. The substrate significantly influenced the plant growth: plants on perlite +coco fibre had larger leaf area per plant compared to P, due to both the higher leaf number and the larger unitary leaf area, and produced more cut stems (53 vs 44. 4 stems per plant), with no significant difference in stem quality between the two substrates. The cumulated water consumption was higher in plants grown with the addition of <b>coco</b> <b>fibre</b> compared to those grown on perlite (71. 6 vs 58. 9 L plant- 1).

U.) from process and ambient air of a composting plant. After a period of seeding, 3 different air velocities have been applied (125 m/h, 175 m/h and 200 m/h) during approximately 1 ½ month each. Results show a better NH 3 removal in filters containing wood (92 % to 98 %) than in the one with <b>coco</b> <b>fibre</b> (between 17 % and 63 %) depending on the air velocity and on the pollutant concentration (from 35 to 60 ppmV). Concerning VOCs the efficiency was globally the same (approx. 75 %) and that for each velocity and for a relatively constant inlet concentration of 20 ppmV Carbon equivalent. Differences are less obvious in terms of Odours Unit that is mainly due to the variability of the analysis itself.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{identifying}} and evaluating natural organic materials {{which could be used}} as sorbents in clean-up operations following hydrocarbons spills on both soils and bodies of water. The sorption capacity of three materials (sugarcane <b>fibre,</b> <b>coco</b> <b>fibre</b> and water Eichornia crassipies was evaluated with three hydrocarbons (35 °, 30 ° and 25 °API) and two types of water (distilled and artificial marine water) adopting the ASTM F- 726 standard and following the methodology suggested in the “Oil spill sorbents: testing protocol and certification listing programme” Canadian protocol. It was found that the three materials being evaluated had a sorption capacity equal to or greater than that of the commercial material to which they were compared. It was observed that sorption capacity results depended on some variables such as hydrocarbon viscosity, granulometry (particle size in Tyler sieve) and the structure of the material. Sugarcane fibre sorption in water showed the greatest hydrophobicity, different to Eichornia crassipies which is extremely hydrophilic. The materials’ sorption kinetics were determined and modelled with the three hydrocarbons (35 °, 30 ° and 25 °API). It was found that the materials became saturated in less than a minute, leading to a rapid alternative for cleaning-up and controlling hydrocarbon spills. Materials were also thermally treated for improving their hydrophobicity and behaviour during spills on bodies of water. Sugarcane fibre was the material which presented the best results with the thermal treatment, followed by water Eichornia crassipies. <b>Coco</b> <b>fibre</b> did not present any significant change in its hydrophobicity...|$|R
40|$|Acoustical {{sustainable}} materials, either {{natural or}} {{made from recycled}} materials, are quite often a valid alternative to traditional synthetic materials. The production of these materials generally has a lower environmental impact than conventional ones, though a proper analysis of their sustainability, through Life Cycle Assessment procedures, has to be carried out. Airborne sound absorption of natural materials such as flax or of recycled cellulose fibres {{is similar to the}} one of rock or glass wool. Many natural materials (bamboo, kenaf, <b>coco</b> <b>fibres)</b> show good sound absorbing performances; cork or recycled rubber layers can be very effective for impact sound insulation. These materials also show good thermal insulation properties, are often light and they are not harmful for human health. Furthermore, many of these materials are currently available on the market at competitive prices There is however a need to complete their characterization, both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view, and especially to propose a standard and unique procedure to evaluate their sustainability. The paper presents an updated survey on the acoustical properties of sustainable materials, both natural and from recycled materials, including mixed and composite materials and systems such as green roofs and green walls, and is completed by a wide selection of recent related bibliography...|$|R
40|$|A low {{technological}} {{corn cob}} particleboard {{has been under}} research by this research team. It intends to be affordable and sustainable. So far, some of its assessed material properties (e. g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required {{for most of the}} above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3 cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e. g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e. g. kenaf, <b>coco</b> <b>fibre,</b> sheep wool, cork and cellulose). The obtained results indicate that the proposed product may also have an interesting acoustic behaviour for building purposes. This conclusion is even more interesting taking into account that corn cob is a natural, organic, renewable and local raw building material...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that the thermal {{utilization}} of solar energy is often - in spite of high possible energy savings - economically unattractive. The aim of this project therefore was the development of systems for use in equatorial regions, where aspects like a simple construction and inexpensive materials are of primary importance. Thermal losses from the aperture area should be minimized with new transparent insulation materials. Within the project different collector systems for domestic hot water were investigated as well as two solar cookers. Experiments were carried out with five prototypes of a so-called plastic bag collector. This essentially concerns a transparent plastic bag acting as a water storage (150 l) which lies on top of a horizontal, insulated absorber. The influence of different transparent cover foils on the systems' efficiency could be shown by determining the values of Eta (0. 47 - 0. 60) and the overall U-values (6. 0 - 7. 2 W / (qm K) for usual foils, 2. 2 W / (qm K) for transparent insulation). Comparative measurements with thermosiphon systems were included. With the emphasis on a high storage (heat) capacity together with a low overall U-value, a new concept of a solar cooker was developed and tested under the Freiburg weather conditions. The cooker consists of a massive storage with a transparently insulated, horizontal absorber. The choice of the materials to be used for the storage (sand, concrete) and for the opaque insulation (straw, <b>coco</b> <b>fibres)</b> depends on their actual local availability. The measured storage temperatures of two proto-types were between 100 and 110 degree C with a mean insolation of 6. 6 kWh/square meter and a mean ambient temperature of 21 degree C. Optimizations of the overall U-value and the ratio of absorber area to gross area could further improve the cooker's performance...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the suitability of}} selected substrates for mushroom production. Ten different substrates namely water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), maize cobs (Zea mays), coconut <b>fibre</b> (<b>Cocos</b> nucifera), finger millet straw (Seteria microcheata), banana fibre (Musa sp.), sawdust (Eucalyptus sp.), rice straw (Oryza sativa) bean straw (Phaseolus vulgaris) and wheat straw (Tritichum aestivum) were tested for their suitability in mushroom production. Plastic bags were filled with 250 g of substrate and arranged in a randomized complete block design. The substrates had a significant (p≤ 0. 05) effect on days to pinning, number of caps and biological efficiency. Compared to the control, which pinned at 28 days, maize cobs, sawdust and coconut fiber had short pinning durations of 19, 22 and 23 days, respectively. With the exception of sawdust, water hyacinth and maize cobs, {{the rest of the}} organic substrates significantly increased the marketable caps of the oyster mushroom. The straws, namely, bean, rice, finger millet and wheat had the highest biological efficiency in decreasing order of 106, 92, 85 and 77 %, respectively. Stipe length was longest in oyster mushroom grown on bean straw, followed by finger millet straw, maize cobs, banana fiber and shortest in sawdust. Mushroom yield was, 80, 78, 76, 73 and 68 %, higher in bean straw, rice straw, millet straw, wheat straw and banana fibre treatment compared to the control.
