5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy <b>religious</b> <b>tax</b> known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as {{designed}} to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E

She stated that, as early as age 18 when he watched his idol Mao Zedong defeat the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, Jones realized that the way to achieve social change in the United States was to mobilize people through religion.

50|$|It was Shahīd ath-Thānī {{who took}} the concept of Nā'ib al-'Amm to its logical {{conclusion}} in the religious sphere and applied it {{to all of the}} religious functions and prerogatives of the Hidden Imām.

This satiric tendency continued in Die Klatshe (The nag, 1873) about a prince, a stand-in for the Jewish people, who is bewitched and becomes a much put-upon beast of burden, but maintains his moral superiority throughout his sufferings (a theme evidently influenced by Apuleius' classical picaresque novel The Golden Ass).|$|R

However, despite these differences, there have been numerous fatwas regarding the acceptance of Jaʿfari fiqh as an acceptable Muslim madhhab by Sunni religious bodies. These include the Amman Message and a fatwa by Al-Azhar. In the modern era, former Prime Minister of Sudan Sadiq al-Mahdi defined the recognized schools of Muslim jurisprudence as eight, Ja'fari was one of them. While many differences between Ja'fari fiqh and that of Sunni Muslims are minor, a notable difference being that Ja'fari jurisprudence allows temporary marriage in the form of Nikah mut‘ah, while Sunni Islamic Law allows for temporary marriage in the form of Nikah Misyar and Nikah 'urfi.|$|R
