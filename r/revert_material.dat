An important requirement of this systems is the integration of external knowledge management resources into them. The digital libraries are helpful to this purpose because materials of many digital libraries are valuable for learning. The availability of teaching materials provided by an E-Learning Systems can be enlarged by <b>reverting</b> to <b>materials</b> existing in several digital libraries. In this case, {{it is necessary to}} find the right document source and to supply the suitable documents basing on the student requirements, also when the student model of the e-leaming system is still not available.

It was first split into two small spaces, by creating a false floor at circle level, and used by the Royal Court. Then in 1999 the venue was returned to its original design, renamed the New Ambassadors and hosted niche works and plays not normally seen outside of smaller fringe venues.

40|$|Biological systems rely on {{recyclable}} materials {{resources such}} as amino acids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. When biomaterials are damaged {{as a result of}} aging or stress, tissues undergo repair by a depolymerization–repolymerization sequence of remodelling. Integration of this concept into synthetic materials systems may lead to devices with extended lifetimes. Here, we show that a metastable polymer, end-capped poly(o-phthalaldehyde), undergoes mechanically initiated depolymerization to <b>revert</b> the <b>material</b> to monomers. Trapping experiments and steered molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with a heterolytic scission mechanism. The obtained monomer was repolymerized by a chemical initiator, effectively completing a depolymerization–repolymerization cycle. By emulating remodelling of biomaterials, this model system suggests the possibility of smart materials where aging or mechanical damage triggers depolymerization, and orthogonal conditions regenerate the polymer when and where necessary. M aterials systems with reusable building blocks are attractive for autonomous adaptive structures that have the ability to remodel themselves in response to environmental con-ditions, including damage or degradation. A familiar example of reusable resources found in nature is the recycling of monomeri...|$|R
2500|$|Most PTC {{thermistors}} {{are made}} from doped polycrystalline ceramic (containing barium titanate (BaTiO3) and other compounds) which have the property that their resistance rises suddenly at a certain critical temperature. Barium titanate is ferroelectric and its dielectric constant varies with temperature. [...] Below the Curie point temperature, the high dielectric constant prevents the formation of potential barriers between the crystal grains, leading to a low resistance. [...] In this region the device has a small negative temperature coefficient. [...] At the Curie point temperature, the dielectric constant drops sufficiently to allow the formation of potential barriers at the grain boundaries, and the resistance increases sharply with temperature.

40|$|Due to its {{remarkable}} {{mechanical and}} biological properties, {{there is considerable}} interest in understanding, and replicating, spider silk's stress-processing mechanisms and structure-function relationships. Here, we investigate the role {{of water in the}} nanoscale mechanics of the different regions in the spider silk fibre, and their relative contributions to stress processing. We propose that the inner core region, rich in spidroin II, retains water due to its inherent disorder, thereby providing a mechanism to dissipate energy as it breaks a sacrificial amide-water bond and gains order under strain, forming a stronger amide-amide bond. The spidroin I-rich outer core is more ordered under ambient conditions and is inherently stiffer and stronger, yet does not on its own provide high toughness. The markedly different interactions of the two proteins with water, and their distribution across the fibre, produce a stiffness differential and provide a balance between stiffness, strength and toughness under ambient conditions. Under wet conditions, this balance is destroyed as the stiff outer core <b>material</b> <b>reverts</b> to the behaviour of the inner core...|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, the Aggarwal model {{shed light}} on the {{asymmetric}} catalysis of the MBH reaction. It suggested that all four diastereomers of the intermediate alkoxide are formed in the reaction, but only one has the hydrogen-bond donor suitably positioned to allow fast proton transfer, while the other diastereomers <b>revert</b> to starting <b>materials.</b> These mechanistic studies directed attention to the proton-donor ability (Bronsted acid) of the catalyst. If either the Bronsted acid or the Lewis base could be appropriately positioned on a chiral molecule, the Lewis base would react with the substrate (Michael addition), while the acid in an asymmetric environment would allow the chiral proton transfer. The Bronsted acid remains hydrogen-bonded to the resulting enolate in the enolate-addition step to the aldehyde, and finally ensures efficient proton transfer in the rate-determining proton abstraction step. The action of the Bronsted co-catalysts, which are often employed in MBH reaction, is not limited to a role in proton transfer step. It rather promotes conjugate addition by binding to the zwitterionic enolate, and stabilizing these intermediates.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, 2004. Engineers and Technologists {{have always}} been {{identified}} as those individuals that put into practice the theories developed by scientists and physicists to enhance the lives of human beings. In the same spirit as those that came before, this thesis describes {{the development of a}} computational engineering tool that will aid Engineers and Technologists to design smart or intelligent structures comprising of NiTi shape memory alloy rods for actuation purposes. The design of smart actuators consisting of NiTi shape memory alloy structural members will be beneficial to industries where light weight, compactness, reliability and failure tolerance is of utmost importance. This is mainly due to the unique material responses exhibited by this smart material. The shape memory effect, one of these material responses consists out of two stages: a low temperature load induced phase transformation causing a macroscopic deformation (either extension, contraction, etc.) also known as quasi-plasticity; and a high temperature phase transformation that erases the low temperature macroscopic deformation and <b>reverts</b> the <b>material</b> to some predefined geometry. When designing actuators consisting of this smart material, the quasi-plastic material response produces the actuation stroke while the high temperature phase transformation produces the actuation force. The successful engineering design of smart structures and devices particularly suited for applications where they operate in a capacity, as actuators harnessing the shape memory effect are dependent on a few important factors. These include the engineers familiarity with the type of smart material used, the availability of sound experimental data pertaining to the complex material responses exhibited by the smart material, the engineers level of proficiency with existing constitutive models available to simulates these material responses, and the engineers knowledge of simulation tools consisting of a suitable control algorithm fo~ the modeling of not only the device or structure itself but also the actuator involved in the design...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of obtaining vanadium dioxide (VO 2) [wherein the vanadium ionic state is 4 +] from a precursor of ammonium metavanadate (NH 4 VO 3) bearing the ion V 5 + is investigated. The reduction {{is carried out}} by calcining the NH 4 VO 3 powders in similar concentrations of H 2 flow at varying temperatures. The resulting powders have been studied by several techniques including XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, TEM, BET and DSC. It is found that remnants of bright yellow V 5 + still exist up to calcination temperatures of 100 °C after which the sky-blue VO 2 dominates at calcination temperatures of 150 °C- 250 °C. There is a population surge of metastable dark-blue V 6 O 13 (where V is in between V 4 + and V 5 + ionic states) between 250 °C and 300 °C. However above 350 °C the <b>material</b> <b>reverts</b> to the stable V 5 + in the yellow-orange V 2 O 5.

40|$|The Raman {{scattering}} from Lu 1. 8 Y 0. 2 SiO 5 single crystals {{was investigated}} for quasi-hydrostatic pressures ranging from atmospheric to about 15 GPa at room temperature. The material, originally {{belonging to the}} monoclinic C 2 /c structure, transforms gradually to a higher-density phase upon the application of pressure. Unit cell volume, peak position, and the Gruneisen parameter have been calculated and analyzed, revealing three different pressure regimes. The first low-pressure regime relates mainly to the change of unit cell volume. In the second pressure regime, the gradual phase transformation starts at about 3 GPa and is completed at a pressure of 10 GPa. The third pressure regime part reveals a sensibly lower pressure dependence. A {{detailed analysis of the}} data allowed us to propose a scheme for a pressure-induced gradual phase transition, resulting in the coexistence of phases over a wide pressure range. Moreover, the <b>material</b> <b>reverts</b> to the ambient-condition phase upon release of pressure, showing an almost total reversibility. By comparison with the vibrational spectra of the pure Y 2 SiO 5 compound and from the analysis of the crystal structures, the pressure-induced high-density phase is assigned to the P 2 (1) /c monoclinic structure, typical of oxyorthosilicates.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{behavior of}} arsenic (As) and gallium (Ga) atoms from semi-insulating GaAs (SI-GaAs) into ZnO films upon post-growth annealing vis-à-vis the resulting charge compensation was investigated {{with the help}} of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The films, annealed at 600 ºC and 700 ºC showed p-type conductivity with a hole concentration of 1. 1 × 1018 cm− 3 and 2. 8 × 1019 cm− 3 respectively, whereas those annealed at 800 ºC showed n-type conductivity with a carrier concentration of 6. 5 × 1016 cm− 3. It is observed that at lower temperatures, large fraction of As atoms diffused from the SI-GaAs substrates into ZnO and formed acceptor related complex, (AsZn– 2 VZn), by substituting Zn atoms (AsZn) and thereby creating two zinc vacancies (VZn). Thus as-grown ZnO which was supposed to be n-type due to nonstoichiometric nature showed p-type behavior. On further increasing the annealing temperature to 800 ºC, Ga atoms diffused more than As atoms and substitute Zn atoms thereby forming shallow donor complex, GaZn. Electrons from donor levels then compensate the p-type carriers and the <b>material</b> <b>reverts</b> back to n-type. Thus the conversion of carrier type took place due to charge compensation between the donors and acceptors in ZnO and this compensation is the possible origin of anomalous conduction in wide band gap materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of chalcone formation via {{aldol condensation}} was studied using UV spectrophotometry. Chalcone was formed from substituted benzaldehyde (ArCHO) and acetophenone (Ar'COCH₃) with catalyst sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolved in acetonitrile and H₂O or deuterium oxide (D₂O). The rate of appearance of each chalcone was measured at its [lambda]max using a UV spectrophotometer, and time curves of Absorbance vs. Time were analyzed. The rate expression {{for the formation}} of chalcone is third order: Rate = k₃ [ArCHO][Ar'COCH 3][⁻OH]. With excess [Ar'COCH₃], the reaction becomes pseudo first order in [ArCHO], where the observed rate constant (kobs) is simply proportional to the concentrations of [Ar'COCH₃] and [⁻OH]. Kinetic runs with different initial conditions of [ArCHO], [Ar'COCH₃], and [⁻OH] were prepared in H₂O and in D₂O to measure the rates and the kinetic isotope effect kD /kH. The formation of chalcone or substituted chalcone was observed to be faster in D₂O than in H₂O, which indicates that Deprotonation 2 is not the rate-limiting step. Using a process of elimination, we can conclude that the rate- limiting step for chalcone mechanism via aldol condensation is the Elimination step in the dehydration process. The intermediate [Beta]-hydroxy ketone in each chalcone formation was synthesized. The [Beta}-hydroxy ketone intermediates were reacted with NaOH to <b>revert</b> to starting <b>materials</b> ArCHO and Ar'COCH₃, and to dehydrate to product chalcone.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{properties and}} transitions occurring {{in a random}} liquid crystalline polymer were studied over a range of thermal conditions {{using a combination of}} complementary characterisation techniques, including differential scanning calorimetry, wide angle x-ray scattering and optical microscopy. From the results, ordering in the polymer is observed to increase as a function of temperature and time prior to melting. An anisotropic phase develops at 330 C and degradation cxxurs at 400 C. The polymer displays a nematic phase on heating and hence is said to be thermotropic. Any order induced by annealing is destroyed on heating well above the polymer's melting point The <b>material</b> <b>reverts</b> back to its original random structure. This behaviour is atttibuted to transesterification reactions occurring, over relatively short annealing times (120 seconds) at elevated temperatures. Although order and crystallinity are observed to increase as a function of annealing conditions, very little structural rearrangement is observed to occur for samples annealed over die time range, 0 - 2 hours. In general, die behaviour of the polymer is very dependent upon its thermal history. The synthesis of a chemically ordered version of the liquid crystalline polymer of identical composition, was attempted to enable a back to back characterisation with the original random version. Attempts at the synthesis proved, unsuccessful. Small angle neutron scattering techniques were used to study the mechanism and kinetics of transesterification. The activation energy calculated is identical to the value stated in the literature for PET, suggesting that the reaction mechanism is identical for both die rigid and the flexible polyester. The rate constants calculated for a range of polymers are inversely related to their initial molecular weights thus transesterification appears to proceed via an active chain end mechanism. A unique route to the formation of highly blocky structures via a process termed crystallisation induced reorganisation (C. I. R.), based upon die transesterification reaction, is discussed in the literature. The present study aims to establish whether a C. I. R. reaction occurs in the random polymer. Samples were annealed at selected temperatures for reaction times ranging from 0 - 72 hours. An ester-interchange catalyst was impregnated into selected samples. The polymer was observed to undergo the C. I. R. reaction both above and below the melt, leading to a block structure. The presence of the catalyst did not influence the rate of structure developmen...|$|R
