40|$|The {{population}} dynamics <b>of</b> fisheries <b>stock</b> enhancement, {{and its potential}} for generating benefits over and above those obtainable from optimal exploitation <b>of</b> wild <b>stocks</b> alone are poorly understood and highly controversial. I review pertinent knowledge of fish population biology, and extend the dynamic pool theory <b>of</b> fishing to <b>stock</b> enhancement by unpacking recruitment, incorporating regulation in the recruited stock, and accounting for biological differences between wild and hatchery fish. I then analyse the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> enhancement and its potential role in fisheries management, using the candidate <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> North Sea sole as an example and considering economic as well as biological criteria. Enhancement through release of recruits or advanced juveniles is predicted to increase total yield and stock abundance, but reduce abundance of the naturally recruited stock component through compensatory responses or overfishing. Economic feasibility of enhancement is subject to strong constraints, including trade-offs between the costs of fishing and hatchery releases. Costs of hatchery fish strongly influence optimal policy, which may range from no enhancement at high cost to high levels <b>of</b> <b>stocking</b> and fishing effort at low cost. Release of genetically maladapted fish reduces the effectiveness of enhancement, and is most detrimental overall if fitness of hatchery fish is only moderately compromised. As a temporary measure for the <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> depleted <b>stocks,</b> enhancement cannot substitute for effort limitation, and is advantageous as an auxiliary measure only if the population {{has been reduced to}} a very low proportion of its unexploited biomass.

40|$|Fisheries {{discards}} {{are often}} seen as an enormous waste of resources and an impediment to the <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>stocks.</b> However, many traditional fisheries management measures have effectively encouraged discarding {{in an effort to}} enforce catch quotas and protect undersize fish or undesirable species.

Of key concern is the North Sea which accounts for some of the highest discard rates in the world. It is jointly managed under two different policies (The European Common Fisheries Policy and the Norwegian Marine Resources Act). In Norwegian waters discarding is banned, whereas in EU waters discarding is widespread. To assess the ecological and economic effectiveness of the Norwegian ban on discards we examined its effect on Northeast Arctic fish stocks. These are considered to be biologically isolated from those in the North Sea, allowing for a meaningful comparison.

By contrast, strategies to delay age at first capture may improve economic value over current levels with only modest reductions in short-run fishery yield.

40|$|What {{went wrong}} {{and what can}} we learn from it? NOEL ROY Memorial University The recent closure of the Northwest Atlantic cod and other {{groundfish}} stocks off {{the east coast of}} Canada has prompted calls from several quarters for a reconsideration of our understanding <b>of</b> fisheries <b>stock</b> dynamics. It is disturbing to acknowledge that in 1979, immediately after Canada had declared Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction off its shores, the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of northern cod (2 J 3 KL Cod) had been expected to rise to 402, 000 tonnes by 1985 (Department of Fisheries and Oceans 1981). This outcome was expected to result from the <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> from the depleted state to which it had been reduced {{as a result of the}} actions of distant-water fleets over the previous two decades. In fact, the TAC for this stock never rose above 266, 000 tonnes, and beginning in 1989 the TAC was progressively reduced until the directed fishery was effectively closed in mid- 1992. Subsequently, seven other cod stocks, and several flatfish and redfish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic have also been closed. This outcome would have had no credibility, even as a worst-case scenario, even 2 a few years ago. Indeed, the East Coast fishery was the subject of numerous studies in this period immediately after the establishment of Extended Fisherie...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{lays out}} a simple model and an {{accounting}} framework for analysing {{the relationship between}} different components of regional savings and investment, between internal savings and external savings, and between government sector savings and private sector savings. In general, stepping up investment to enhance regional growth must cause a deterioration of the regional trade balance in the short run, even though the trade balance is likely to improve in the longer run. Analyses in recent years often ignore the effect of capital formation on trade. As an example, the German unification, in requiring a <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>stock</b> suddenly rendered obsolete by {{a major change in}} relative factor prices, requires a real appreciation of the DM and a deterioration of the German trade balance. Given nominal exchange rates, this means higher German inflation than its trading partners. On the other hand, the paper shows that, under fixed exchange rates, different inflation rates among regions may be part of the adjustment needed to re-establish trade balance. In the absence of this (either because of market rigidity or deliberate policy) persistent inter-regional fiscal transfers may be required. The “success” of the American fixed exchange rate model should be interpreted in the light of large inter-regional fiscal transfers that have taken place decade after decade. Proponents for a single European currency should be prepared that similar fiscal transfers will become necessary...|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Baltic cod {{stock was}} until {{recently}} below {{safe biological limits}} and suffered from high fishing pressure. In most recent years, fishing mortality substantially declined and spawner biomass more than tripled. Similar developments have not been observed for any other depleted cod stock in the North Atlantic {{during the last few}} decades. This paper investigates relative impacts of changes in different ecological and management-related drivers, which could have contributed to the rapid recovery of the Eastern Baltic cod. The results show that the success to reduce fishing mortality below management target in 2008 was due to a combination of increased recruitment and improved compliance with TAC. The reversal of the negative trend in biomass and <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> to the present level were largely driven by increased recruitment. Harvest control rules of the multi-annual management plan for setting TACs currently maintain the fishing mortality at a low level, which allows the stock to accumulate biomass and further accelerate its recovery. Relatively strong incoming year-classes and recently better control over removals distinguish the Eastern Baltic cod from other depleted European cod stocks, which have not shown similar positive trends in recent years. Sound management measures and compliance to those as well as favourable biological conditions are required for a successful stock recovery.

40|$|Overfishing and {{eutrophication}} affects {{coastal communities}} worldwide, leading to dwindling fish stocks and deteriorated habitats. Hence, attempts to rebuild overfished stocks to past fish productivities need {{to account for}} functional relations between habitat types and fish performance. Here we quantify resource availability, foraging performance and anti-predator behaviour of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) to assess {{the costs and benefits}} associated with different coastal habitats. In the laboratory, Atlantic cod foraged more efficiently in sand habitats compared to the structurally more complex habitats of eelgrass (Zostera marina) and the canopy forming bladderwrack (Fucus vesicolosus). Presence of chemical cues from a cannibal reduced Atlantic cod consumption rates in all habitats, but most pronounced in the sand habitat. Field observations in the three habitats showed highest resource density in the bladderwrack habitat and lowest in the sand habitat, irrespective of season. Habitat profitability, calculated by combining data from field estimates of prey density and experimental quantifications of foraging performance, revealed the bladderwrack habitat most profitable independent of season. The difference in profitability between the complex habitats was relatively small, suggesting that Atlantic cod in the field contributed to drive habitat profitability towards equalization. The results strengthen the view that the ongoing loss of seagrass and macroalgae habitats may have significant ramifications for juvenile Atlantic cod performance, which ultimately may lower the productivity <b>of</b> entire <b>stocks.</b> Consequently, future and ongoing <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> commercial fish <b>stocks</b> should revise the expectations <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> productivity (and hence harvesting intensity) accordingly...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} fisheries in the northern Benguela is the Namibian hake fishery, which targets both Merluccius capensis and Merluccius paradoxus. In spite <b>of</b> attempts to <b>rebuild</b> the hake stocks that were severely depleted by distant-water fleets before Namibia's independence in 1990, stocks have failed to recover. Because the ecological goal <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> <b>rebuilding</b> competes with social and economic objectives on the political stage, the ability to make accurate abundance estimates is important. However, the precision of abundance estimates is impeded by lack of understanding of hake behavior and of the effects of environmental factors. Furthermore, at present both species of hake are assessed and managed as one Namibian stock. We present qualitative information derived from interviews that we conducted with Namibian hake trawl and longline fishers during the 2009 and 2010 fishing seasons, and information gleaned from analyzing logbook data. We contextualize both types of data within the scientific literature on Namibian hakes and the Namibian hake fishery. Fishers monitor sea surface and bottom temperature, water quality, currents, and weather, and they have detailed knowledge about the behavior and habitat of hakes. Fishers differentiate between three different types of M. capensis, which they associate with different fishing areas. They also describe innovations that have taken place over the past 20 years, which are of relevance to the assessment of fishing efficiency and effort, but have not been taken into account in the stock assessments. Our analysis of logbook data supports the increase in efficiency. The results show that closer collaboration between scientists and fishers has the potential to improve the accuracy of survey estimates and stock assessments, and thus is important for <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> hake <b>stocks</b> and the hake fishery...|$|R

40|$|Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} (ABFT) has always {{displayed}} spectacular {{changes in its}} spatial distribution, but the underlying mechanism of such variations still remains obscure. This study focuses on this challenging issue by scrutinizing the intriguing ‘Brazilian episode’ during which a large quantity of ABFT (a temperate species) was caught during the 1960 s in the equatorial Atlantic. To investigate this event, we applied a niche model to an extensive data set of catch and environmental variables from 1960 to 2009. ABFT exhibited a remarkably large ecological niche, which matches well with our current knowledge of ABFT. Our results also depicted a high probability of ABFT occurrence in the South Atlantic and, more interestingly, favorable environmental conditions in the western equatorial Atlantic during the 1960 s, but not later. ABFT could thus have migrated from their northern spawning grounds to the South Atlantic during the 1960 s through the western equatorial Atlantic, {{playing the role of}} an ‘ecological bridge’. We argue that the rarity of ABFT in the southern Atlantic during the last four decades would result from the interaction of several processes, particularly oceanographic conditions, migratory behavior, density-dependence, exploitation levels and population structure. Examination of the catch data further indicated that the fish caught in the equatorial Atlantic were from the western stock and we concluded that the lack <b>of</b> <b>rebuilding</b> <b>of</b> this <b>stock</b> could result from a regime shift due to the combination of oceanographic changes in the equatorial Atlantic and overfishing in the North Atlantic in the 1960 s and 1970 s...|$|R
