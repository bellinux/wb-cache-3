40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{attempted}} to identify climate {{conditions that are}} associated with the occurrence of pyrethroid residues using a multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). A total of 132 raw milk samples were collected from dairy farms in Minas Gerais State - Brazil and analyzed for seven analytes using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Of the 132 milk samples, pyrethroid residues were identified in 14 (10. 6 %) milk samples, of which 12 (9. 1 %) and two (1. 5 %) milk samples had the identification of cypermethrin and deltamethrin, respectively. From those samples, nine (6. 8 %) milk samples were regarded as non-compliant for cypermethrin with this analyte concentration above the maximum residue limits set by Brazilian legislation. A PCA assessing pyrethroid residues in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> demonstrated that the average temperature and the Temperature-Humidity Index were associated with pyrethroids residues in <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> <b>tank,</b> although the relative humidity was inversely correlated.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} aimed to {{identify}} the climate condition parameters {{that are associated with}} the occurrence of antimicrobial and macrocyclic lactone residues in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> using a multivariate principal components analysis (PCA). A total of 132 raw milk samples were collected at dairy farms in Minas Gerais State in Brazil and analyzed for 35 analytes, comprising macrocyclic lactones and antibacterials, using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in tandem mode spectrometry. Of the 132 samples, 34 (25. 76 %) <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> samples were positive for at least one analyte. PCA showed that antimicrobial residues in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> occurred less frequently on days with a higher average temperature, maximum temperature and temperature-humidity index. In contrast, relative humidity was inversely associated with antimicrobial residues in raw milk. The PCA showed that daily milk production was also related to macrocyclic lactone residues, while rainfall showed an inverse association. Thus, some climate conditions, such as average temperature, maximum temperature and temperature-humidity index, can predict the moments with lower risk of occurrence of antimicrobial residues in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk,</b> in contrast to relative humidity. Furthermore, the risk of macrocyclic lactone residues in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> was higher in months with less rainfall...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a {{recently}} emerged virus of ruminants in Europe. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are commonly used}} to detect SBV-specific antibodies in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> samples to monitor herd exposure to infection. However, it has previously been shown that a <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> sample can test positive even though the majority of cows within the herd are seronegative for SBV antibodies. Development of a pen-side test to detect antibodies in individual milk samples would potentially provide a cheaper test (for which samples are obtained non-invasively) than testing individual serum samples by ELISA. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the agreement between antibody levels measured in milk and serum. RESULTS: Corresponding milk and serum samples from 88 cows in two dairy herds in the UK were tested for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to SBV using a commercially-available indirect ELISA. A serum neutralisation test (NT) was also performed as a gold standard assay.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine on-farm risk factors for bacteriological quality of <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk.</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>tank</b> raw <b>milk</b> quality was evaluated on all Prince Edward Island dairy herds (n= 235) over a 2 -yr period (March 2005 to March 2007). Biweekly total bacterial, preliminary incubation, laboratory pasteurization, and coliform counts were conducted using a Petrifilm culture system. For the assessment of risk factors, a case-control study was conducted from January 2006 to May 2007. Case and control herds were defined based on the last 6 analyses of bulk tank bacterial counts before on-farm evaluation. Cases were herds that had multiple elevated counts for any of the parameters measured. A total of 69 herds (39 cases and 30 control herds) were evaluated. Data collection included (1) observation and questionnaire on basic hygiene and farm management practices; (2) complete wash analysis of the milking equipment, monitoring the presence of bacterial films on equipment and evaluation of cooling system function; and (3) environmental and cow hygiene scoring. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. The results of the final model indicated that high alkalinity in the wash water and poor teat-end cleanliness were associated with high bacterial counts in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> (odds ratios= 12 and 5. 3, respectively). It was also observed that high water temperature of detergent wash and the use of a water softener were associated with low bacterial counts in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> (odds ratios= 0. 87 and 0. 11, respectively).

40|$|Q fever is a {{zoonotic}} disease, {{caused by}} the obligate intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Between 2007 and 2010, Q fever {{has been a major}} public health concern in the Netherlands, with almost 3500 human cases reported and dairy goats considered to be the most probable source. At the end of 2009, the Dutch government decided to cull all pregnant dairy sheep and dairy goats based on <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii positive farms, aiming to preventing shedding and to reducing environmental contamination. On <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive farms, a life-time breeding ban was implemented for all remaining non-pregnant small ruminants. This study describes test results on a <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive dairy goat farm on which all goats had been vaccinated against Q fever with an inactivated phase one vaccine since 2008. All pregnant dairy goats of this farm were culled in 2010, after which <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> was negative in the C. burnetii PCR. One year later, however, this farm became <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> C. burnetii PCR positive again. From all lactating animals on the farm (n = 350), individual milk samples were collected and tested using a commercial real-time PCR assay. Individual milk samples from five dairy goats appeared to be C. burnetii PCR positive. These positive goats had been born on the farm between 2002 and 2006. At postmortem examination, out of 33 mostly tissue samples per animal, only milk and mammary tissue samples were C. burnetii PCR positive.

This bacteria {{is known as a}} zoonotic pathogen and recent researches explain its probable role in Crohn’s disease in humans. This study compared four laboratory diagnostic tests; including Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA), direct microscopic examination, milk culture and Nested-PCR for diagnosis of herds <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> infection with MAP bacteria. 100 <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> samples were obtained from 100 industrial dairy herds of Tehran province. Samples were screened by four tests and 82 samples (82 %) detected as positive in culture media, 94 milk samples (94 %) were positive by Nested-PCR test and 98 samples were positive in ELISA test results (98 %). But direct microscopic examination identified just 33 milk samples as positive. Four positive samples of ELISA test were detected as negative samples by Nested-PCR. These 4 samples in addition to 12 other samples which diagnosed as positive by ELISA, had no growth in culture media (16 samples). These results indicated superiority of Nested-PCR among these four tests for diagnosis of <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> infection with MAP bacteria. Furthermore, the results represent high prevalence of MAP bacteria in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> of dairy herds in Tehran province and it needs more serious eradication efforts...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the on-farm management factors that are associated with the Bacillus cereus count in raw <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> using a cross sectional study design. <b>Bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> quality was monitored for B. cereus on 63 dairy farms between July and August 2012. <b>Bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> samples corresponding with processor milk collection dates were taken over a two week period prior to the farm visit and tested for B. cereus. The four most recent samples taken prior to the on-farm visit were averaged and log transformed to give the outcome variable; mean log 10 B. cereus cfu/mL. On-farm data collection included recording observations and providing a questionnaire on basic hygiene, management factors and cow hygiene scoring. All independent variables were analysed individually with the outcome variable using simple linear regression and one-way ANOVA; a multivariable regression model was subsequently developed. Only significant variables were retained in the final model (P < 0. 05). The geometric mean B. cereus count for all milk samples was 40 cfu/mL. The start temperature of the cleaning solution wash, dry wiping teats prior to unit application, the feeding of silage and reusing the cleaning solution more than once were all unconditionally associated (P < 0. 10) with the B. cereus count in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk</b> but did not enter the final multivariable model. B. cereus count was four times greater (201 cfu/mL) when cows had been housed compared to when they were on pasture (50 cfu/mL). The allocation of fresh grass every 12 h (62 cfu/mL) resulted in a decrease in B. cereus count (166 cfu/mL every 24 h or greater). The testing of water for bacteriology was associated with an increase in B. cereus count. In conclusion, this study highlights specific management factors associated with the B. cereus count in <b>bulk</b> <b>tank</b> <b>milk.</b> peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|R
2500|$|Plate heat {{exchangers}} have also evolved {{as a result}} of the increase of dairy farm herd sizes in the United States. As a dairyman increases the size of his herd, he must also increase the capacity of his milking parlor in order to harvest the additional milk. This increase in parlor sizes has resulted in tremendous increases in milk throughput and cooling demand. Today's larger farms produce milk at a rate which direct expansion refrigeration systems on <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> coolers cannot cool in a timely manner. PHE's are typically utilized in this instance to rapidly cool the milk to the desired temperature (or close to it) before it reaches the <b>bulk</b> <b>milk</b> <b>tank.</b> Typically, ground water is still utilized to provide some initial cooling to bring the milk to between [...] A second (and sometimes third) section of the PHE is added to remove the remaining heat with a mixture of chilled pure water and propylene glycol. These chiller systems can be made to incorporate large evaporator surface areas and high chilled water flow rates to cool high flow rates of milk.|$|R
