5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, {{and that the}} league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a <b>result,</b> <b>on</b> September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E

In Milan–San Remo, Cancellara was in the leading group, sprinting to seventh place. The following week, Cancellara crashed badly in E3 Harelbeke, suffering two minor fractures in the transverse processes of his lower vertebrae. His injuries prevented him from defending his Tour of Flanders title, thereby ending his spring classics campaign.

5|$|Following the {{fighting}} on 31 August, the Japanese forces ashore had reported {{the situation to}} their headquarters at Rabaul. In response, plans were made to send the Aoba Detachment, which comprised the Army's 4th Infantry Regiment and an artillery company, to Rabi to complete the capture of the airfield. However, they were not scheduled to arrive until 11 September {{and so it was}} planned in the meantime to reinforce Yano's men with 130 men from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF. An abortive attempt was made to land these troops on 2 September and then again on 4 September. By that time, however, as further reports were received by the Japanese headquarters, it became apparent that Yano's troops {{would not be able to}} hold out until the Aoba Detachment could arrive. As a <b>result,</b> <b>on</b> 5 September, the Japanese high command ordered a withdrawal. This was carried out from the sea that evening.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{they were}} {{withdrawn}} from the front line. By this time casualties amongst the Australian Corps had reached critical level {{and as a result}} many battalions—from an authorised strength of over 1,000 men—were only able to field between 300 and 400. As a result, {{the decision was made to}} reduce the number of infantry battalions in each brigade from four to three by disbanding one battalion and using its personnel to reinforce the others. The 29th Battalion was one of those chosen to be broken up and as a <b>result</b> <b>on</b> 19 October 1918, the 29th Battalion was disbanded. The majority of the battalion's personnel—29 officers and 517 other ranks—were transferred to the 32nd Battalion as reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson.

5|$|In mid-1967, the 4th Infantry Division's 1st and 2nd Brigades {{conducting}} Operation Francis Marion {{in western}} Kon Tum Province were making heavy contact with PAVN forces.

The 173rd had been operating near Bien Hoa Air Base outside Saigon and had been in combat only against Viet Cong guerrillas. Prior to its deployment to the highlands, Peers' operations officer, Colonel William J. Livsey, attempted to warn the Airborne officers of the hazards of campaigning in the highlands. He also advised them that PAVN regulars were a much better equipped and motivated force than the Viet Cong. These warnings, however, made little impression on the paratroopers, who were about to become victims of their own overconfidence.|$|E

This unit remained in existence until 1987, when further reforms to the Army Reserve led to a {{reduction in the number of}} infantry units across Australia and, at a ceremony held at Newcastle on 5 December 1987, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 17th to form the 2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, within the 8th Brigade.
