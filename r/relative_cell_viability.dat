40|$|Alzheimer s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of {{dementia}} among elder. Neuropathological hallmarks include amyloid plaque formation, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss. The deposit of senile plaques is consistent with induction of oxidative stress, and since free radical scavengers can alleviate amyloid-beta-induced oxidative stress markers, this study aims to identify the neuroprotective effects of the selenium compounds (ebselen and diphenyl diselenide) on the neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta in primary cultures of murine hippocampal neurons. Samples were subjected to immunocytochemistry and western blotting techniques to determine what influence the treatments may have on synaptic protein SNAP- 25 and neuronal death. There was a strong increase in <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> associated with ebselen and diphenyl diselenide treatment. Significant increases were observed in the level of synaptic marker synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP- 25 with both selenium compounds treatment. Although demonstrated the potential protective effect of selenium compounds in the course of AD, further investigations of synaptic function are important as a therapeutic strategy for A...|$|E
30|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} of GS, GS-PEG-Apt, and GS-PEG/HA 2 -Apt NPs {{was evaluated}} against A 549 cells using MTT assay. Briefly, A 549 cells (1 [*]×[*] 104  cells/well) were seeded in polystyrene 96 -well culture plates and incubated for 24  h till the 70  % confluence. The culture medium was then replaced by 100  μl of serum-free DMEM medium containing nanoparticles (100 – 600  mg/mL). Cells treated with medium only {{served as a}} negative control group. After 24  h co-incubation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 20  μL of MTT solution (5  mg ml− 1 in PBS buffer) for 4  h at 37  °C. Then, MTT solution was removed, and 100  μL of DMSO was added to dissolve the blue formazan crystal produced by proliferating cells. The plate was incubated for additional 30  min before determination at 570  nm using a spectrophotometric plate reader (Bio-tek ELX 800, USA). All experiments were performed in quadruplicate, and the <b>relative</b> <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> (%) was expressed as a percentage relative to the untreated control cells.|$|E
30|$|To verify how {{nanowire}} interfacing {{affects the}} <b>cell</b> <b>viability,</b> an MTT assay, a technique widely {{used to measure}} <b>cell</b> <b>viability,</b> was performed under the same conditions. Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 shows that {{the activity of the}} GH 3 cell interfaced with a certain nanowire density and culture time is higher than that cultured on the bare silicon substrate. It also shows that too many interfaces with nanowires can have an adverse effect on the <b>cell</b> <b>viability.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>viability</b> was {{determined}} using a CCK- 8 <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> assay kit (DOJINDO Laboratories, Japan). All cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were pre-treated with various methods as indicated and then incubated 16 h in a 96 -well plate. A 10 μL of <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> assay kit solution {{was added to}} each well of the plate. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark, absorbances were measured at 450 nm using a multi-well plate reader [43].|$|R
50|$|Chan (2007) {{also tested}} {{the effect of}} {{citrinin}} on <b>cell</b> <b>viability,</b> but in an embryonic stem cell line (ESC-B5) in vitro. The ESC-B5 cells were treated with 10-30 μM CTN for 24 hours and a dose-dependent reduction in <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> was found. Chan further determined that this reduction in <b>cell</b> <b>viability</b> was due to apoptosis and not necrosis as CTN exposure led to an increase of nuclear DNA fragmentation or breakdown of chromatin, which are both characteristics of apoptosis.|$|R
