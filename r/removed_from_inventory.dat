2500|$|... 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT and 7,62 ItKk/31-40 VKT {{were the}} most {{numerous}} anti-aircraft machine guns used by the Finnish army during World War II. They were used in anti-aircraft machine gun companies and platoons, and later as close defence weapons for anti-aircraft gun batteries. After the war the guns were used in training until the 1960s, and were kept warehoused until 1986, when they were finally declared obsolete. When the guns were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> there were 467 weapons, of which 41 were in the original 7,62 ItKk/31 VKT configuration. A portion of the guns were given to museums, and rest were scrapped in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its final}} years, Building 20 and its demise {{were marked by}} some {{farewell}} hacks (student pranks). [...] In March 1998, a large red banner appeared bearing the words [...] "MASS.

In April 1999, a full-sized elevator shaft enclosure was revealed amidst {{the rubble of the}} just-demolished Building 20. [...] Since the elevator indicator displayed levels [...] "G" [...] and [...] "B1" [...] through [...] "B5", the elevator presumably traveled to previously-concealed secret lab space below the misleadingly-numbered ground floor of Building 20. In the years since, there has been a persistent joke on campus that the old Building 20 is still standing, but concealed by an invisibility cloaking field.|$|E
50|$|Non-malicious {{shrinkage}} {{can result}} {{from a number of}} operational failures within the business structure. The processing of returned and/or damaged stock, for example, can cause articles to be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> and discarded (which contributes directly to shrinkage) rather than sold at a discount, donated, returned to vendors for credit, or otherwise <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> in a manner that minimizes financial loss.|$|E

2500|$|... 225 {{examples}} of the BOAR rocket were produced by NOTS. In service, the rocket proved unpopular with the pilots of the aircraft assigned to carry it: the loft-bombing maneuver, called an [...] "idiot loop", was considered dangerous. By 1963, maintenance issues with the solid rocket motor were proving acute, and the rocket was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory</b> during that year.|$|R
50|$|The missile was retired {{beginning}} in July, 1967, {{with the final}} missile <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> in 1970. Five hundred missiles were produced during {{the life of the}} weapon program.|$|E
50|$|As of 2006, {{the ship}} has been <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> of Beaumont Reserve. It is now located at Esco in Brownsville, Texas and awaits scrapping. Scrapping may be {{complete}} {{as soon as}} September 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Security Layer 2: Issuance Check Out/In. When {{an asset}} is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory,</b> {{we know it}} {{has been removed from}} shelf, but {{ownership}} has to be transferred from a “storekeeper” to a new owner, a soldier or guard or asset guardian. This is done using ruggedized Apple iPads known as gRaps® that have a RuBee embedded reader. Tags are read as the asset is passed across the check out counter.|$|E
5000|$|The vowels [...] do {{not occur}} initially—or, at least, in initial {{position}} they are pronounced [...] It {{has been argued that}} the initial vowels [...] are phonetically , so initial consonants {{do not need to be}} posited in such cases (and marginal [...] can be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory</b> of native words), or that they are phonemically , with glottal stop (Bradley 2003).|$|R
2500|$|The {{squadron}} was activated {{again in}} 1964 as the 400th Strategic Missile Squadron, an LGM-30B Minuteman I {{intercontinental ballistic missile}} squadron. [...] In 1973 it modernized its Minutemen and in 1986 became the only operational squadron in the Air Force to equip with the LGM-118A Peacekeeper.

50|$|The SM04 {{was mainly}} sold to industry, where they carried their factory {{designation}} of 409Da. A mere 2 examples were acquired by PKP {{at the beginning}} of the 1990s. Both locomotives had been salvaged from Zakłady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego w Sędziszowie (Sędziszów Rolling Stock Reparation Plant), but were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> PKP's <b>inventory</b> in 2000. One of these is now stationed as an exhibit at the railway museum in Chabówka.|$|R

50|$|After World War 2, {{numbers of}} ex-Luftwaffe MG 151/20 cannon were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> and from {{scrapped}} aircraft {{and used by}} various nations in their own aircraft. The French Air Force and French Army aviation arm (ALAT) utilized MG 151/20 cannon as both fixed and flexible armament in various aircraft, including helicopters. The FAF and ALAT jointly developed a rubber-insulated flexible mount for the MG 151/20 {{for use as a}} door gun, which was later used in combat in Algeria aboard several FAF/ALAT H-21C assault transport helicopters and on Sikorsky HSS-1 Pirate gunship helicopters. French Matra MG 151 20mm cannons were used by Portugal and Rhodesia fitted to their Alouette III helicopters, while Denel designed its own variant for the South African Air Force.|$|E
50|$|Security becomes {{far more}} reliant on human trust with loss of any layer. RuBee reduces that human trust {{reliance}} with full “process free” automation {{in all three}} layers. For example, if something is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> off the racks, but does not get checked out an alarm is issued. If an asset exits facility but is not checked out, an alarm is issued etc.RFID and barcode systems are blocked by steel and the human body. As a result, security is based on new human processes focused only on Layer 2. Both become human assisted asset tracking systems, not real-time automated security systems. Visible has repeatedly proven that RuBee is the wireless technology that can provide fully integrated, visibility with three security layer automation.|$|E

50|$|The AIM-9M-8/9 {{incorporated}} {{replacement of}} five circuit cards {{and the related}} parentboard to update infrared counter counter measures (IRCCM) capability to improve 9M capability against the latest threat IRCM. The first AIM-9M-8/9 modifications, fielded in 1995, involved deskinning the guidance section and substitution of circuit cards at the depot level, which is labor-intensive and expensive—as well as <b>removing</b> missiles <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> during the upgrade period. The AIM-9X concept is to use reprogrammable software to permit upgrades without disassembly.|$|R
50|$|The AIM-7P {{is similar}} in most ways to the M versions, and was {{primarily}} an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The F {{class of}} US Navy blimps {{comprised}} a single airship, built during World War I by Goodyear {{as one of}} a group of three small blimps offered to the US government. Two were purchased for the US Navy and one for the US Army. The Navy blimps were designated E-1, F-1, and the Army airship A-1. Classified as an [...] "Experimental Engine Testing Dirigible." [...] F-1 had the same envelope size as the E-1, due to the use of a tractor mounted 125 hp Union engine, the performance was different. F-1 spent its entire career at Hampton Roads (Norfolk, Virginia). It was flown in both tractor and pusher configurations. It also may have been flown with a Curtiss OXX engine. F-1 was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> in November 1923.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} above, {{this alternative}} to backflushing has a self-correcting property: the shop-floor stock is always {{related to a}} certain production order, onto which all the consumed materials were actually issued. On the other hand, backflushing by its very definition can never be self-correcting and should only be used when corrections are rarely needed. An objection {{can be made with}} the above described alternative that scrap is not reported with a reason code, or broken out separately from other forms of non-standard usage. But how accurate is scrap reporting in an environment without inventory accuracy? Better to settle for inventory accuracy and worry about scrap later as a separate issue. Option: implement a separate scrap analysis protocol unrelated to inventory transactions. Scrapped parts are segregated for subsequent inspection, quality data recording and possible rework. In both cases, scrapped parts are already <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> {{at the end of the}} manufacturing cycle (presumably by returning fewer components to stores). Therefore, an inventory transaction is only needed when parts are deemed acceptable upon inspection, or after a rework operation is performed. Scrap reporting can also be done by using data from the Process control system and/or Manufacturing Execution System. Usually such a system exists to some degree in any firm, even if it is not called PCS or MES and even if it is used eventually only for keeping data regarding personnel performance and piecework, as a basis for calculating the salary of the workers. Such a system could be extended so that each worker reports also the scrapped parts.|$|E
50|$|Puzzle {{rooms are}} hidden {{throughout}} each level and found in various drainage pipes and manholes. Each puzzle room contains the scrambled {{name of the}} object that belongs there. The player must unscramble the word and select the proper item <b>from</b> their <b>inventory.</b> Correctly choosing the item that belongs within the room reveals one section of a picture puzzle. However, if the player chooses the wrong item, the item is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> their <b>inventory</b> {{and returned to the}} object room in which it was previously located, forcing the player to complete the challenge within that room to re-obtain the object.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1965 {{and the end}} of 1968, the {{squadron}} frequently deployed to the Pacific to support combat operations with refueling over the Gulf of Tonkin and South China Sea. In July 1969, the 454th wing was inactivated as older model B-52s were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory</b> and Columbus was transferred to Air Training Command. [...] The squadron was inactivated along with the wing. In September 1985 the 301st Fighter Squadron was consolidated with the 901st, but the unit remained inactive.|$|R

It {{is an important}} primary source of information for military historians researching the types and capabilities of ammunition available to the British military {{at the time of}} various conflicts, and for collectors wishing to identify artifacts. However, the individual editions lack historical context, in that they omit dates and rationales for particular types and Marks of ammunition being added to or <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an inventory}} system within the {{economic order quantity}} (EOQ) model framework under random supply. The production process can go "out-of-control" with a constant probability and start producing imperfect quality items. Such a system has been studied in the literature {{under the assumption that}} defective items are reworked instantaneously and returned to inventory. In some situations, imperfect quality items are not necessarily defective and are removed from the inventory to be used elsewhere. This paper develops two models where imperfect items are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory.</b> The first model finds the expected cost and optimal lot size assuming that imperfect quality items are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> at no cost. The second model assumes that batches of imperfect quality are consolidated and shipped together due to economies of scale in shipping. Analytical and numerical results are developed for both models revealing several managerial insights. Imperfect quality Random yield Lot sizing EOQ...|$|E

At the time of a repairable failure, a repair kit is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>inventory</b> and used to renew the system. Nonrepairable failures are assumed to occur at some time in the future distributed as a random variable of phase type and permanently terminate the life of the system. Under general stochastic assumptions concerning the lifetime of the components and the time required to perform repair, reorder strategies are identified which maximize the expected net discounted contribution over the lifetime of the systems. reliability modeling, optimal inventory of spares, design redundancy, computational probability...|$|E

The Soviet Army also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, {{but it is}} not clear whether that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 36 Type Os (also {{known as the}} Burgess Gunbus), powered by a single 140 hp (104 kW) Sturtevant engine, was ordered by the British Admiralty in 1915 {{for use by the}} Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). Built in the United States they were shipped to Hendon Aerodrome for erection. The first {{aircraft}} flew from Hendon on 26 August 1915 and some of first aircraft were used for training at Hendon and Eastchurch but most went into storage, the last six were not even unpacked.

50|$|In 1972 the Air Force Reserve {{began to}} receive Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs, which were {{becoming}} surplus to Air Force needs in Southeast Asia. To operate these fighters, it formed three tactical fighter groups, {{the last of}} which was the 508th Tactical Fighter Group at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, which was activated in January 173. Hill was selected because the 945th Military Airlift Group there was slated to lose its Douglas C-124 Globemaster IIs, which were being <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory.</b> The transition <b>from</b> four reciprocating engine transports to supersonic jet fighters {{was one of the most}} difficult the reserves had faced.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989, the Australian {{government}} donated four ex-RAAF Bell UH-1H Iroquois helicopters under Project Wit Koki on the proviso {{they would}} not be armed which were later controversially used armed in the Bougainville Civil War. In 1992, a fifth helicopter was purchased as an attrition replacement. In 2012, the Australian government entered into a lease for two Bell 212 helicopters from Hevilift PNG to provide a rotary wing capability due to all Iroquois helicopters not being in service. In 2016, the Australian government extended the lease until 2019. The Statement of Intent for 2016 stated that all the Iroquois helicopters would be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Force <b>inventory</b> by 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of [...] "modernized UR-100" [...] was authorized on 19 August 1970 (document №682-218) and assigned to both OKB-586 and TsKBM (builder of UR-100). The design bureau conducted flight tests from 1971 through 1974. Deployment commenced in December 1978. The more advanced MR-UR-100UTTh version began development in 1979, with flight tests from 1977 through 1979. The new missiles had completely replaced {{the original version}} by 1983, at which time the Soviets fielded 270 launchers. From there the number of launchers declined, and by the 1991 START I Treaty they were down to 76. All were scheduled for dismantling and <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the <b>inventory.</b>|$|R

However, some spells, such as those acquired through pre-order bonuses or importing demo save data, cannot be gifted. Use of this function does require the online pass.|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridge}} is {{in principle}} an enhanced Russian {{version of the}} 7.63×25mm Mauser. The Russians produced {{a wide array of}} loadings for this cartridge for use in submachine guns. These include armor-piercing, tracer, and incendiary rounds. This cartridge has excellent penetration and can easily defeat lighter ballistic vests (NIJ level I and IIA) as well as some kevlar helmets, such as the American PASGT helmet. When fired from a carbine length barrel the cartridge may penetrate NIJ level II, but is readily stopped by the current standard armor NIJ level IIIA. Although most firearms chambered in this caliber were declared obsolete and <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> military <b>inventories,</b> some Police and Special Forces units in Russia, Pakistan and (mainly) in China may still use it because of the large quantity of stored ammunition available.|$|R
