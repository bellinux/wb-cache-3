50|$|Bars and CollarsFrom {{the early}} 1930s {{until the early}} 1950s, BUR sold a {{standard}} 1-1/16” bar. Collars were attached separately. Most, if not all, of these bars were knurled in 3 places. None had a separate <b>revolving</b> <b>sleeve.</b> There were no markings on the BUR bars or collars to distinguish these from the bars or collars of other manufacturers. Bar lengths ranged from 4’ to 6’.In the 1950s, {{with the introduction of}} the BUR-140, BUR began selling a bar with a 1” diameter and a removable 38” chrome plated sleeve that allowed for bar rotation during lifts. BUR oversized inner collars were included with the new bar. These collars were stamped “BUR BARBELL Co LYNDHURST NEW JERSEY”.Finally, for a brief period during the 1950s, BUR also offered a 10-pound hollow bar with welded on end-caps.|$|E
5000|$|BUR-140 - The “BUR-140” {{is arguably}} the best known BUR product. It {{replaced}} the BUR-130. [...] Unlike previous BUR sets, the BUR-140 came with a 38-inch chrome-plated and knurled <b>revolving</b> barbell <b>sleeve.</b> This sleeve increased the grip diameter of the 5 ft steel bar from 1" [...] to 1-1/8”. The set's dumbbells also included removable <b>revolving</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Finally, the BUR-140 came with BUR’s own oversized inner collars; these collars were machined to allow the bar sleeve to rotate freely while simultaneously eliminating the gaps between sleeve and collars that were common at the time. According to BUR brochures, the new bar could support a maximum weight of 400-pounds. The BUR-140 sold for $16.80 in the early 1950s (about $140 in 2010 adjusted dollars) and was still being produced when the company closed in the 1960s.|$|R
