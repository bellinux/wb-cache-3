The results show that there is strong seasonal demand for occasional <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> from April to August for several main harvests. The seasonal unit root test detected the presence of seasonal unit root. This result confirms the presence of a seasonal pattern in the <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> time series. The ARIMA model caught the <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> dynamism for occasional workers. It was necessary to add three moving average parameters of small orders, beyond a seasonal moving average parameter, and an autoregressive parameter which represents the hiring of permanent workers. <b>Rural</b> <b>employment,</b> Seasonality, ARIMA model, X- 12 method, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R

Then we analyse the main characteristics of the rural labour force. Finally we synthesize the opinions expressed by 33 consultants (working at the Offices for Agricultural Consultancy from different counties in Transylvania) about the estimated short term evolution of <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> and the impact of CAP on Romanian rural areas. change of agricultural structure, <b>rural</b> <b>employment,</b> impact of the Common Agricultural Policy on Romanian <b>rural</b> <b>employment,</b> Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Environmental Economics and Policy, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyNon-agricultural <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> {{accounts}} for an increasing proportion of total <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> in Latin America. Its potential for stimulating rural {{development has been}} noted, {{but it has also}} been analysed as a focal point of poverty. This article considers the magnitude and composition of this employment in some of the Central American countries and examines the conditions under which non-agricultural activities may help to improve <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> and income. It is noted that non-agricultural <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> is heterogeneous and different types of employment arise in response to different dynamics. Although there are potential sources of non-agricultural <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> which have no connection with agriculture, in the countries analysed it is the characteristics of the agricultural sector which influence most heavily the composition and characteristics of such employment. Agriculture influences both the generation of non-agricultural productive employment and the creation of makeshift alternative jobs, primarily through demand for non-agricultural goods and services and the discharge of surplus labour. Consequently, in order for non-agricultural rural activities to make a significant contribution to rural development it is necessary to adopt an approach which integrates both the agricultural and non-agricultural elements of such development...|$|R

This paper combines two complementary data sets on rural households and their members from the State Statistic Committee of Ukraine 2004 household survey to present a profile of <b>rural</b> non-farm <b>employment</b> in Ukraine. Also, we empirically investigate the factors enhancing or impeding access to non-farm <b>rural</b> <b>employment</b> and income diversification for Ukraine’s rural population, {{as well as its}} (nonagricultural sector) importance for the agricultural sector’s growth. The evidence suggests that, despite substantial heterogeneity of the nonagricultural sector, gender, education, access to infrastructure and land are important factors influencing access to <b>rural</b> non-farm <b>employment,</b> as well as rural non-farm incomes...|$|R
