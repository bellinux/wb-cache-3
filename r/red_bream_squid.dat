40|$|The {{long-range}} {{studies on}} the ecology and dynamics of various organisms, chiefly including larvae and juveniles of <b>red</b> sea <b>bream,</b> and on the environmental conditions of the ecosystem, have been performed at Shijiki Bay, Hirado Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. An ecosystem model of Shijiki Bay was developed mainly {{with regard to the}} dynamics of 0 -age <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> and verification of the model was carried out. The following summarizes the results. (1) Basic concept for the development of an ecosystem model of Shijiki Bay, its boundary conditions and state variables and parameters to be introduced into the model were determined by rearranging available information on the bay such as non-biological elements in the bay, ecology, dynamics and production process of zooplankton, phytoplankton and feed benthos, life form of 0 -age <b>red</b> sea <b>bream,</b> stock variations, and carrying capacity. (2) Spatial range of the model was decided to be central and inner parts of the bay where the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> settles and grows, and time range of the model was decided to be four months from May 5 which is the normal settling time of the fish to September 5 when the fish starts to migrate toward the open sea. (3) The model system is divided into seven parts: Copepoda, Gammaridea and Mysidacea which in turn are used as feed by the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> as it grows, wild <b>red</b> sea <b>bream,</b> reared <b>red</b> sea <b>bream,</b> competitors of the fish for feed and their predators. (4) A total of 37 parameters were used and the relationship among these components and changes in the individual numbers were expressed by a differential equation. (5) Individual numbers of feed organisms were expressed using a logistic model by incorporating predation pressure into the basal model. As parameters, intrinsic rate of increase, carrying capacity and the number of feed organisms preyed on by the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> and other fish were introduced. (6) Change in the individual numbers of <b>red</b> sea <b>bream,</b> competitors and predators were expressed using certain parameters such as the decreasing coefficient, feed richness-depending increasing rate and the number of prey. (7) Initial values of the variables and parameters were determined after analyzing the information obtained mainly from Shijiki Bay and analyzing the results of various sensitivity tests of provisional variables and parameters. (8) When conditions of Shijiki Bay from 1976 to 1977, a period during which individual numbers of <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> juveniles and their changes thereafter had been well detected, were simulated, the results coincided to the most part with the actually examined results. Simulation using the ecosystem model confirmed a generally considered view that the limit of the carrying capacity for <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> is about two million individuals. (9) Simulation of a releasing experiment of artificial <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> performed in 1984 showed slight differences from the results of an actual tracing examination.

The range of turbulence at which <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> larvae could survive and ingest prey increased with larval growth.

The reactions for specific functional groups were also performed. In the integuments of the sea bream, the existence of α-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, α-doradexanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin was confirmed. In the internal organs β-carotene, echinenone, lutein, zeaxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene and astaxanthin were found. In the integuments of the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream,</b> the existence of α-cryptoxanthin, 3, 3 '-dihydroxy-ε-carotene, lutein (trace), zeaxanthin, 3 -hydroxycanthaxanthin and astaxanthin were clarified. In the internal organs, canthaxnthin, lutein, astaxanthin and P_E- 518 were found. The carotenoids in the sea <b>bream</b> and the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> were compared, and the most conspicuous differences among them, the sea bream contains lutein besides astaxanthin in the integuments, on the contrary, the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> contains the traces. It is very interesting that the bright red color of the sea bream comes from the mixture of astaxanthin (red color), lutein (yellow) and α-doradexanthin (trace). It was confirmed that the sea <b>bream</b> and the <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> could not convert β-carotene to astaxanthin by feeding β-carotene- 15, 15 '-^ 3 H_ 2, but they could transfer astaxanthin in the diet to their body astaxanthin. The carotenoids in Kinmedai, Beryx splendes Lowe, Amadai, Branchiostegus japonicus, and Akahana, Cephalopholis aurantius, were also extracted, isolated and the metabolic pathway from plant carotenoids to astaxanthin was proposed. When the results and those of previous studies are taken together, consistent patterns are seen. Thus aquatic animals are divided into three classes {{on the basis of}} where astaxanthin is biosynthesized as follows : 1. Prawn-Form, 2. Sea bream-Form, 3. Red carp-Form. Prawn-Form ― The aquatic animals, which belong to this group, can convert β-carotene to their body astaxanthin. Almost all crustacea which contain astaxanthin in their body belong to this group. Prawn, lobster and crab belong to this group. Sea bream-Form ― Can not convert β-carotene, lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, and can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals are carnivorous, and half digested crustacea were found in their stomach. Sea <b>bream</b> (Madai), <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> (Chidai), Amadai, Kinmedai and Akahana belong to this group. Red carp-Form ― Can convert lutein or zeaxanthin to astaxanthin, but β-carotene is not the major precursor of astaxanthin. They can transfer astaxanthin in the diet to body astaxanthin. These animals contain α-doradexanthin. Gold fish, red carp, fancy red carp, yellow-golden carp, and Benibuna belong to this group...|$|R
40|$|Epitheliocystis {{disease was}} found in <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> Pagrus major, transported from Hong-Kong, and tiger puffer Takifugu rubripes and carp Cyprinus carpio cultured in Japan. Histopathological and {{electron}} microscopic studies were made on these diseased fishes. Epitheliocystis cysts of these fishes developed in gills. Cysts of <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> {{were found on the}} capillary under respiratory epithelium of gill lamellae in the early stage of the infection. Heavily infected gills showed many cysts among the hyperplastic epithelium of the interlamellar spaces, followed by clubbing of the gill filaments. The cysts ranged in diameter from 15 µm to 55 µm. The cysts had a cellular capsule and an inclusion body which was revealed to be packed with chlamydia-like organisms ranging from 0. 52 µm to 0. 71 µm in size, by electron microscopy. Epitheliocystis cysts of tiger puffer developed on the capillary under the respiratory epithelium of gill lamellae. The cysts ranged in size from 25 µm to 43 µm. Epitheliocystis cysts of <b>red</b> sea <b>bream</b> and tiger puffer indicated that they developed from infected cells forming larnellar capillaries. Epitheliocystis cysts of carp developed within the epithelium of the interlamellar spaces on gill filaments and ranged in diameter from 12 µm to 50 µm...|$|R
