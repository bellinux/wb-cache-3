About 10minutes after the earthquake, TEPCO operators removed both of Unit 1's isolation condensers from service, and instead chose to activate the HPCI (High Pressure Coolant Injection) systems to cool the reactor and the core spray system was activated at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool. The core spray system was disabled with AC power loss at 15:37 (The tsunami) and the HPCI system failed following DC (i.e., battery back up) power loss.|$|E

25|$|A manual {{shutdown}} {{was initiated}} {{during the middle}} of a start-up operation. The cause was a high pressure alarm that was caused by the shutting of a turbine bypass valve. The reactor was at 12% of full power when the alarm occurred at 4:03am (local time) due to a pressure increase to 1,030 psi (7,100 kPa), exceeding the regulatory limit of 1,002 psi (6,910 kPa). The reactor was reduced to 0% power, which exceeded the 5% threshold that requires event reporting, and pressure dropped back under the regulatory limit at 4:25am. Later, at 8:49am the control blades were completely inserted, constituting a manual <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdown.</b> An inspection then confirmed that one of the 8 bypass valves had closed and that the valve had a bad driving fluid connection. The reactor had been starting up following its 25th regular inspection, which had begun on October 18, 2008.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{comprises}} six separate {{boiling water}} reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and {{maintained by the}} Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At {{the time of the}} quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance. Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdown</b> (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).|$|E

In 1980, Cintichem, Inc. began the production/isolation of Mo-99 in its reactor, and became the single U.S. producer of Mo-99 during the 1980s. However, in 1989, Cintichem detected an underground leak of radioactive products that led to the <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdown</b> and decommissioning, putting an end to the commercial production of Mo-99 in the USA.|$|E
40|$|Poor {{control of}} the steam {{generator}} water level in the secondary circuit of {{a nuclear power plant}} can lead to frequent <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> These shutdowns are caused by violation of safety limits on the water level and are common at low operating power where the plant exhibits strong non-minimum phase characteristics and flow measurements are unreliable.

40|$|Poor {{control of}} steam {{generator}} water level {{is the main}} cause of unexpected shut-downs in nuclear power plants. Particularly at low powers, it is a difficult task due to shrink and swell phenomena and flow measurement errors. In addition, the steam generator is a highly complex, nonlinear and time-varying system and its parameters vary with operating conditions. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} systematically inves-tigate the problem of controlling the water level in the steam generator in order to prevent such costly <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> The objective of this paper is to design, eval-uate and implement a water level controller for steam generators based on a fuzzy model predictive control approach.

2500|$|In 2016, {{following}} a discovery at Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant, about 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 {{have been found}} to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> likely to continue over the winter high electricity demand period into 2017. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply. As of late October 2016, 20 of France's 58 reactors are offline. These steel quality concerns may prevent the regulator giving the life extensions from 40 to 50 years, that had been assumed by energy planners, for many reactors.

40|$|The {{ability to}} infer the reactor flux from spent fuel or seized fissile {{material}} would enhance {{the tools of}} nuclear forensics and nuclear nonproliferation significantly. We show that reactor flux can be inferred from the ratios of xenon- 136 to xenon- 134 and cesium- 135 to cesium- 137. If the average flux of a reactor is known, the flux inferred from measurements of spent fuel could help determine whether that spent fuel was loaded as a blanket or close to the mid-plane of the reactor. The cesium ratio also provides information on <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns</b> during the irradiation of fuel, which could prove valuable for identifying the reactor in question through comparisons with satellite reactor heat monitoring data. We derive analytic expressions for these correlations and compare them to experimental data and to detailed reactor burn simulations. The enrichment of the original uranium fuel affects the correlations by up to 3 percent, but only at high flux. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the concept {{design for a}} hybrid nuclear/fuel-cell power plant for a submarine capable of nuclear powered high speed transits and fuel-cell powered slow speed operations. Additionally, the concept provides a fully air independent auxiliary power source to increase safety {{in the event of}} unplanned <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns</b> during under-ice operations and high sea states. The PEM fuel-cells provide 477 kW, sufficient to power the 3, 000 tonne submarine to a maximum sustainable 8 knot dived speed. Sufficient hydrogen and compressed oxygen is carried to provide 7 days fuel-cell operations at an average 6 knots; the fuel-cell system could either be distributed around the hull or inserted as a 5. 6 m plug. The selection of reversible fuel-cells allows onboard hydrogen and oxygen regeneration whilst in nuclear mode, negating the requirement for separate electrolysers. A full safety analysis failed to identify any risk from hydrogen although using compressed pure oxygen requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The CANDU nuclear {{reactors}} that supply {{a major portion}} of the electrical power to eastern Canada house the uranium fuel elements in long tubes made of a zirconium-niobium alloy. After lengthy exposure to the radiation inside the reactor, these tubes become filled with hydride precipitates that can ultimately nucleate small cracks. To avoid failure from these cracks, the tubes are now being replaced after a conservative length of time. If a quantitative method of determining the actual hydride content of particular tubes were available, {{it would be possible to}} extend this time on many tubes and thus avoid retubing costs and the expense of <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> Unfortunately, nondestructive tests for the hydride content are not available because the effect of hydride formation on the physical properties of the tube is small and the sensors available for the tests must be able to operate in the nuclear reactor environment of an elevated temperature, high background radiation levels and a long tube geometry...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere {{are already}} many studies {{that seek to}} link the {{reliability}} of systems to their host organisation [1, 2, 3, 4]. Although the issues have traditionally been addressed {{in terms of an}} a posteriori analysis of crises or disasters [1, 5, 6, 7] a significant body of research has focused on the observation of systems under normal operating conditions, notably the Berkeley researchers who worked on the High Reliability Organization (HRO) project. Other researchers have chosen to observe organisations and their actors in specific phases of operation. This was the strategy selected by Mathilde Bourrier [3] and Pierre Fournier [8, 9], for example, in the context of scheduled nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> It was also the approach adopted for the study presented here, which looks at the effect of ongoing organisational changes taking place in a nuclear power plant being prepared for decommissioning.

Shutdown sites are defined as those commercial nuclear power reactor sites where the nuclear power reactors have been shut down and the site has been decommissioned or is undergoing decommissioning. In this report, a preliminary evaluation of removing used nuclear fuel from 12 shutdown sites was conducted. The shutdown sites were Maine Yankee, Yankee Rowe, Connecticut Yankee, Humboldt Bay, Big Rock Point, Rancho Seco, Trojan, La Crosse, Zion, Crystal River, Kewaunee, and San Onofre.
