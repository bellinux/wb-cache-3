25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating <b>room</b> <b>environment</b> must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{increasing}} popularity of unreliable narrators in television, Hawley {{said that he}} did not want the audience thinking that the series is a puzzle that needs to be solved, saying, [...] "We're going to take a character out of confusion into clarity and an audience out of mystery into clarity"; this is seen in the season's latter episodes, which are more narratively straightforward after Haller becomes [...] "clear on what’s going on [...] we are as well." [...] A noted sequence in the season's penultimate episode sees Haller explain the series' backstory and events to himself (and the audience)—Haller was institutionalized not because of his abilities, but because his mind had been infected by the Shadow King. Hawley wanted to indicate to the audience that this would be the only sequence in the series so exposition heavy, and so it features Haller creating a class <b>room</b> <b>environment</b> within his mind to make the teaching purpose of the scene explicit.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{increased}} {{usage of}} CCTV, and technological advances of surveillance systems, {{there is still}} relatively little understanding of how well it actually works for the many purposes {{for which it is}} deployed. Most purposes require that humans detect and respond to events in an appropriate and timely fashion. From a human factors and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective, it is important to identify whether CCTV systems support human operators effectively, and are fit for the purpose. To answer this question, we take a Socio-Technical System (STS) perspective of CCTV: any system is deployed for one or more purposes, and has a number of stakeholders, who carry out a number of activities. In this paper, we focus on one set of stakeholders- CCTV operators, and examine the activities they carry out in control <b>room</b> <b>environments.</b> We use observations and interviews to identify issues they encounter in the operation of the system. Our results show that task performance is currently impaired because of high screen to operator ratio, absence of camera maps, or lack of integration with other databases. Findings in this paper present the challenges CCTV operators are faced within complex city centre control <b>room</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R
