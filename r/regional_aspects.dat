In hot climates, clothing provides protection from sunburn or wind damage, while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important. Shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats, gloves, and other superficial layers are normally removed when entering a warm home, particularly if one is residing or sleeping there. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and <b>regional</b> <b>aspects,</b> so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer seasons and regions than in colder ones.|$|E

Although recent {{research has focused on}} local and <b>regional</b> <b>aspects</b> of the Revolution, it was a [...] "genuinely national revolution." [...] Its outbreak in 1910 resulted from the failure of the 35-year long regime of Porfirio Díaz to find a managed solution to the presidential succession. This meant there was a political crisis among competing elites and the opportunity for agrarian insurrection. Wealthy landowner Francisco I. Madero challenged Díaz in the 1910 presidential election, and following the rigged results, revolted under the Plan of San Luis Potosí. Armed conflict ousted Díaz from power and a new election was held in 1911, bringing Madero to the presidency.|$|E

The Latvian authorities do not consider that granting voting rights at local level to non-citizens in Latvia would strengthen the incentive to naturalise; the contrary is much more likely. In fact, an extensive research project entitled The effect of <b>regional</b> <b>aspects</b> on tackling citizenship issues {{carried out by the}} Naturalisation Board revealed that one of the major obstacles for applying for Latvian citizenship is the lack of motivation, including the negligible differences between the rights of citizens and non-citizens. Latvia prefers having many citizens with full rights to having many non-citizens with many rights, at the same time acknowledging that any restrictions must have strong justification and shall be in accordance with international standards. Furthermore, there are no international standards on voting rights to non-citizens and at present it is not a widely accepted practice among the CoE Member States.

These disparities are driven not only by economic differences within society but by differences among regions as well.

The main aim {{of this paper is}} to examine the influence of redistribution mechanism on development of disparities - in the <b>regional</b> <b>aspect</b> - within the Czech Republic. Based on empirical results, we can suggest that the mechanism is inefficient in general, and therefore it doesn’t fulfil its macroeconomic function well.
