50|$|PE files {{normally}} {{do not contain}} position-independent code. Instead they are compiled to a preferred base address, and all addresses emitted by the compiler/linker are fixed ahead of time. If a PE file cannot be loaded at its preferred address (because it's already taken by something else), the operating system will <b>rebase</b> it. This involves recalculating every absolute address and modifying the code {{to use the new}} values. The loader does this by comparing the preferred and actual load addresses, and calculating a delta value. This is then added to the preferred address {{to come up with the}} new address of the memory location. Base relocations are stored in a list and added, as needed, to an existing memory location. The resulting code is now private to the process and no longer shareable, so many of the memory saving benefits of DLLs are lost in this scenario. It also slows down loading of the module significantly. For this reason rebasing is to be avoided wherever possible, and the DLLs shipped by Microsoft have base addresses pre-computed so as not to overlap. In the no <b>rebase</b> case PE therefore has the advantage of very efficient code, but in the presence of rebasing the memory usage hit can be expensive. This contrasts with ELF which uses fully position-independent code and a global offset table, which trades off execution time against memory usage in favor of the latter.|$|E
