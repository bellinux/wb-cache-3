The complex concept meets the operational, technical and ergonomic demands of such engines. The project is focused on the design concept and complex contour-composition of the swivel cabin <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck.</b> Designed of the <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> stems from the modern technological methods and the construction is ready for production and everyday operating usage, hence the production of this project would be rather expensive for the local market. However, {{it might be possible to}} start the production of this <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck,</b> equipped by various functional components, sometime in the future and such extra functional components will be included as basic accessories of any <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck...</b>|$|R
40|$|This project {{studies the}} dynamic {{response}} of a composite floor system to excitations from moving <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> The floor system analysed {{is a system}} of precast and partially prestressed double-tee elements with a cast in-situ topping. Currently, there are concerns whether the vibrations caused by <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> might exceed acceptable limits due to an ongoing trend towards structures of higher slenderness. This study investigates the mechanical background of the excitation and the current design of the floor system. The study {{is divided into three}} major chapters: Dynamic <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> model A dynamic load model of a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> is developed which can be used in the analytical verification of the vibration serviceability of structures. The model is based on tests performed on four <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> in various configurations. The tests are analysed for the spectrum of accelerations. The analysis results in a simple two-degree-of-freedom model. Its only variables are velocity and time. All other values are constant throughout a simulation and depend on the geometry of the specific <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> and its payload. The frequencies and phase delays are constants and they are verified as eigen-frequencies of a three-degree-of-freedom model. FE-simulation of vibrations of a composite floor system The <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> model is applied to a three-dimensional model of a composite floor system. The finiteelement model is developed to simulate the construction process of the composite floor system and its influence on the in-service properties of the structure. As part of this work a preliminary investigation of the damping potential of the joint between precast and cast in-situ concrete is undertaken. A linear time-step analysis of the structure is performed and the nodal accelerations are analysed for their magnitude, dependence on the excitation and frequency content. Field test In order to verify the FE-model of the floor system and the results of the dynamic analysis a field test was undertaken: a floor system was monitored under service conditions. The field data comprise the accelerations of the floor and the forklift truck and the position of the truck relative to the points of measurement. A comparison of the field data and the simulation results proves the validity of both the dynamic <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> model and the FE-model of the floor system.

Aimed at the {{vibrations}} of driver seat and {{wheel of a}} working <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck,</b> the acceleration was measured and a vibration analysis based on the finite element method was made. Comparing the finite element analysis result with the result of model test analysis, the finite model is modified with the result of test. The mode analysis is done.

40|$|Long-span {{warehouse}} floors {{can suffer}} problematic vibrations due to dynamic interaction with moving <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> However, the dynamic loads caused by trucks are poorly understood and no mathematical model of these loads {{suitable for use}} in a dynamic analysis has previously been proposed. This paper presents a two-degree-of-freedom dynamic load model of a <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> suitable {{for use in a}}n analytical floor vibration assessment. The load model comprises two time-varying vertical forces that are a fixed distance apart. Each force {{is the product of a}} mass matrix and a vertical acceleration vector, which is in turn a function of the horizontal velocity of the truck. The model derivation is partly analytical and partly experimental, with some key parameters derived from field tests on four <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks</b> in a total of twelve configurations. Data for general models are presented for a range of truck capacities from 1000 kg to 6000 kg. The model fills a significant gap in the current state of the art of vibration analysis, enabling a realistic assessment of fork-lift truck-induced floor vibrations to be performed using a finite-element program.

40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the overhead guard is connected with the frame by the rubber cushion blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the rubber cushion blocks (shock mount) in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved <b>fork-lift</b> <b>truck</b> and vibration energy are lower. The result proves the practical value of this method in the research of the vibration characteristics of complete engineering machine...|$|R

50|$|Flatbeds became {{rare in the}} 1980s as the {{majority}} of road freight changed to either containers or pallet loads carried on larger and more efficient trucks, optimised for quicker loading by <b>fork-lift</b> <b>trucks.</b> Containers are carried on specialised semi-trailers with twistlocks in the corners to retain the container.
