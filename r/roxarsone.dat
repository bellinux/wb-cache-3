40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Roxarsone</b> (3 -nitro- 4 -hydroxy benzene arsonic acid) is an arsenic {{compound}} {{widely used}} in the poultry industry as a feed additive to prevent coccidiosis, stimulate growth, and to improve tissue pigmentation. Little {{is known about the}} potential human health effects from <b>roxarsone</b> released into the environment from chicken waste or from residual compound in chicken products. OBJECTIVE: The growth potentiation and enhanced tissue pigmentation suggest that low levels of <b>roxarsone</b> exposure may have an angiogenic potential similar to that of inorganic arsenite (AsIII). The goal of this investigation was to test the hypothesis described above using cultured human aortic and lung microvascular endothelial cells in high-content imaging tube-forming assays and begin developing a molecular level understanding of the process. METHODS: We used a three-dimensional Matrigel assay for probing angiogenesis in cultured human endothelial cells, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array to probe the gene changes as a function of <b>roxarsone</b> or AsIII treatment. In addition, we used Western blot analysis for changes in protein concentration and activation. RESULTS: <b>Roxarsone</b> was found to exhibit a higher angiogenic index than AsIII at lower concentrations. Increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was observed for <b>roxarsone</b> but not for AsIII-induced angiogenesis. However, AsIII caused more rapid and pronounced phosphorylation of eNOS. Quantitative PCR array on select genes revealed that the two compounds have different and often opposite effects on angiogenic gene expression.
