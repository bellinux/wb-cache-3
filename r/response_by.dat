5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From Polaris to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd Wilson, to the U.S. Air Force; the service was {{demanding}} a large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile. Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune <b>response</b> <b>by</b> killing {{dividing}} cells such as activated T cells.

5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild <b>response</b> <b>by</b> Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
5|$|Helper T cells {{regulate}} {{both the}} innate and adaptive immune responses and help determine which immune responses the body makes {{to a particular}} pathogen. These cells have no cytotoxic activity and do not kill infected cells or clear pathogens directly. They instead control the immune <b>response</b> <b>by</b> directing other cells to perform these tasks.|$|E
5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which {{functions as a}} unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune <b>response</b> <b>by</b> themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In {{the days after the}} storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the <b>response</b> <b>by</b> gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a <b>response</b> <b>by</b> radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the riot, the England team cancelled the remaining games they were scheduled to play in Sydney. The incident also caused much press comment in England and Australia. In Australia, the newspapers were united in condemning the unrest, viewing the chaos as a national humiliation and a public relations disaster. An open letter by Lord Harris about the incident was later published in English newspapers, and caused fresh outrage in New South Wales when it was reprinted by the Australian newspapers. A defensive letter written in <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the New South Wales Cricket Association further damaged relations. The affair led to a breakdown of goodwill that threatened the future of Anglo-Australian cricket relations. However, friction between the cricketing authorities finally eased when Lord Harris agreed to lead an England representative side at The Oval in London against the touring Australians in 1880; this match became the fourth-ever Test and cemented the tradition of Anglo-Australian Test matches.|$|E

5|$|In {{the quarter}} final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Arsenal {{initially}} went {{down by a}} goal but an equaliser was gained after a further 15 minutes by Billy Blyth. Both teams had good attacks on goal {{throughout the rest of}} the game, but the only further goal came following a header by Joe Hulme for Arsenal after a run and a cross from Jack Butler. The draw for the semi-final saw Arsenal play Southampton at Stamford Bridge. The muddy state of the pitch hampered the normal pace of the play shown by Arsenal, but both Buchan and Hulme scored for the gunners to Southampton's single <b>response</b> <b>by</b> Bill Rawlings. Southampton were denied two penalty appeals.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{residents}} across Guam {{were critical}} of the delayed <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the U.S. government; no aid had arrived within two days of the storm, but unsafe conditions at airports had prevented aircraft from landing. With the majority of homes destroyed across Guam, structures that remained standing were used as temporary shelter for those left homeless. Similarly, damaged military installations at Anderson Air Force Base were made available to all civilians. By November14, the USS Daniel I. Sultan arrived in Guam with 1,100troops to provide emergency power. A U.S. Air Force AC-130 landed on the island that day carrying the first package of relief supplies. About 400troops and 80public works employees were sent from Hawaii on November14. The Red Cross and civil defense offices were placed in charge of coordinating recovery efforts. Water distribution centers were set up across the island to provide residents with clean drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Madison, {{a member}} of the Democratic-Republican Party, was elected to the Democratic-Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E

5|$|On 6December1961, {{prior to}} the design being {{submitted}} to NATO, {{it was decided that}} the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy. In February1962, the Royal Navy's Admiralty received the aircraft concept with great interest as the Royal Navy {{was in the process of}} seeking a new interceptor aircraft for use on their aircraft carriers at the time. By March 1962, the Ministry of Defence was openly interested in the potential for the P.1154 being adopted as a replacement for both the RAF's fleet of Hawker Hunters and the Royal Navy's de Havilland Sea Vixens. Accordingly, in April 1962, a first draft of a new joint Naval/Air Staff requirement was issued in the form of Specification OR356/AW406, to which HSA had submitted a <b>response</b> <b>by</b> June of that year. Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention onto working upon this joint requirement.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any <b>response</b> <b>by</b> Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
5|$|Socio-economic {{problems}} of the region {{that had not been}} addressed during British Raj continued to linger and were reflected in a representation made to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1947, which highlighted the issues of regional autonomy and Nepali nationality in Darjeeling and adjacent areas. After the independence of India in 1947, Darjeeling was merged with the state of West Bengal. A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and some parts of the Terai region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the Partition of India. A cautious and non-receptive <b>response</b> <b>by</b> the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the Nepali language; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.|$|E
