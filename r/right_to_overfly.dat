50|$|By 1610 {{the flight}} had boarded and at 16:20:30 hrs, Antonov was given {{clearance}} to taxi to Runway 04 or Runway 31 at his discretion. (He {{chose to use}} Runway 31 whose extended centreline crossed the Little Carpathians.) At the same time, he was cleared to take off, to turn <b>right,</b> <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the Nitra radio beacon and to proceed to overhead Brno and on to Prague at 5100 m Meanwhile, an Il-14 airliner of Czechoslovak Airlines had taken off from Bratislava. In order to maintain separation between the slower Il-14 and his faster Il-18, Antonov was instructed to maintain a height of 300 m until cleared to climb to his cruise altitude.|$|E

50|$|Captain {{and first}} officer on Northwest Airlines Flight 188 in October 2009, fell asleep and {{remained}} unresponsive for ninety minutes causing them <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> their destination by 150 nautical miles.|$|R
2500|$|These new {{coordinates}} {{changed the}} flight plan to track [...] east of their understanding. The coordinates programmed the plane <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> Mount Erebus, a [...] volcano, instead of down McMurdo Sound.|$|R
25|$|When the Roald Amundsen, Lincoln Ellsworth and Italian {{explorer}} Umberto Nobile in 1926 {{mounted a}} successful expedition <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the North Pole in the airship Norge, Heimdal {{served as a}} transport and support vessel at Kings Bay, Spitsbergen.|$|R
50|$|The Handley Page HP.100 was a {{tendered}} {{submission to}} build a long-range, high-speed reconnaissance aircraft for the Royal Air Force, able <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> Soviet territory {{in the face of}} anti-aircraft defences, and to supply information for the V bomber force carrying nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|In April 1931, {{during the}} Azores Revolt, three small hydroplanes of the Portuguese Navy used Horta {{as a base}} <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> Angra do Heroísmo and Monte Brasil. These planes dropped {{pamphlets}} onto the island in order to convince the mutineers to surrender.|$|R
5000|$|The {{program was}} {{intended}} to develop technology that may allow next generation supersonic transports <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> populated areas at above Mach 1 without the high intensity of sonic boom that proved problematic for first generation supersonic transports such as Concorde (c.f.

(b) Member States should deny {{permission}} to any aircraft destined for Iraq or Kuwait <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> its territory, unless {{approved by the}} Security Council Committee, via inspection {{that it is not}} in violation of Resolution 661, or is certified for use by the Military Observer Group; ...|$|R
50|$|CCIP {{calculation}} {{is sometimes}} {{combined with an}} autorelease system so that an aircraft can lock a low-drag bomb onto a target from a safe distance, then release it while in a high-G climb (the target would not be visible over the aircraft's nose), without the need <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the target.|$|R
50|$|Romania {{enforced}} United Nations' {{sanctions against}} Yugoslavia. Despite {{divisions within the}} Parliament and among the people, Romania supported NATO in the Kosovo campaign and granted approval for NATO <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> Romanian airspace. It was the first country to enroll in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, later joining NATO in 2004.|$|R
50|$|Winzen Research Inc created {{balloons}} in the 1950s and 1960s {{that were}} used by the United States Navy in its Projects Helios, Skyhook, and Strato-Lab. Balloons were also sold to the United States Air Force for use in Project Manhigh and for a secret reconnaissance mission, called Moby Dick, <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|At {{the flight}} meeting in Brig, he tried <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the Alps {{for the first}} time. On a meeting in Bern with six pilots, Taddéoli succeeded in a flight over 58 minutes at an {{altitude}} of 600 m. On 10 October 1910 Emile Taddéoli received the Swiss pilot's licence number 2; number 1 was issued to Ernest Failloubaz.|$|R
5000|$|He is a {{researcher}} and reporter of the terrorism {{of state in}} Colombia {{as well as the}} American policy, mainly against Latin America. He discovered in 2009 that he was in a No Fly List of the USA authorities when the plane he had boarded received the prohibition <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the American aerospace [...] "due to national security reasons".|$|R
5000|$|The UAV {{would not}} {{necessarily}} be designed <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> protected airspace. One or two dozen such UAVs would be bought at a minimum total price of $1.5 billion USD. Ironically, if the new UAV is built, it will bring the US full circle, back to the [...] "Tier 3" [...] UAV that was cancelled early in the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} computing a reference airspeed for time constrained descent at idle thrust. More specifically, we will assume a futuristic 4 D trajectory application where the air traffic controller will ask an aircraft <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> a meter fix at a specific time; this time {{is assumed to be}} specified by the air traffic controller to settle properly the arrival sequence and could be given for example through an Arrival Manager (AMAN). In addition, this clearance is assumed to be given after the Top Of Descent (TOD) of the aircraft. The aircraft is assumed to descent at idle thrust and has <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the meter fix at a given altitude and airspeed to be correctly prepared to land. Idle thrust enables to reduce noise, fuel burn and emissions. A BADA model of an Airbus A 320 is used to illustrate the proposed design...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Demonstrate {{capabilities}} of UAS <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> and collect sensor data on wildfires throughout Western US. Demonstrate long-endurance mission capabilities (20 + hours). Image multiple fires (greater than 4 fires per mission), to showcase extendable mission configuration {{and ability to}} either linger over key fires or station over disparate regional fires. Deliver real-time imagery to (within 10 -minutes of acquisition) ...|$|R
50|$|It {{was then}} decided that all {{countries}} should prohibit planes from Sudan or operated by Sudan Airways take off, land or <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> their territory. The sanctions {{would not take}} effect until at least ninety days after {{the adoption of the}} current resolution. By 15 November 1996, the Secretary-General was asked to report on whether Sudan had complied with the OAU request.|$|R
50|$|In December 1977 the {{aircraft}} flew the London - Singapore round trip route {{three times in}} Singapore Airline livery before the Malaysian government rescinded permission from overflying their airspace, likely {{as a result of}} their own airline being denied increased access to London. Concord was also denied permission <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> India as the United Kingdom government was unwilling to grant additional flight slots or Fifth freedom rights.|$|R
50|$|Mosquitoes {{can carry}} malaria, yellow fever, and equine encephalitis. The bites of yellow flies can sting people and {{domestic}} animals. The county conducts spraying for these pests, spraying {{at night to}} minimize the possibility of contaminating people or killing benign insects such as bees, which are active during the day. Each municipality must authorize the county <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> its area <b>to</b> spray for mosquitoes.|$|R
5000|$|Toss bombing is {{generally}} used by pilots whenever {{it is not}} desirable <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the target with the aircraft at an altitude sufficient for dive-bombing or level bombing. Such cases include heavy anti-air defenses such as AAA and SAMs, when deploying powerful weapons such as 2,000 lb. [...] "iron bombs" [...] or even tactical nuclear bombs, {{and the use of}} limited-aspect targeting devices for guided munitions.|$|R
25|$|Although {{originally}} designed to succeed the U-2 in overflights over the Soviet Union and Cuba, the A-12 was never used for either role. After a U-2 was shot down in May 1960, the Soviet Union was considered too dangerous <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> except in an emergency (and overflights were no longer necessary, thanks to reconnaissance satellites) and, although crews trained for flights over Cuba, U-2s continued to be adequate there.|$|R
50|$|In May 1945 an RAF Lancaster of the Aries {{expedition}} {{became the}} first Commonwealth aircraft <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the North Geographic and North Magnetic Poles. The plane was piloted by David Cecil McKinley of the Royal Air Force. It carried an 11-man crew, with Kenneth C. Maclure of the Royal Canadian Air Force {{in charge of all}} scientific observations. In 2006, Maclure was honoured with a spot in Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame.|$|R
5000|$|Although [...] "pop-up" [...] bombing is {{generally}} characterized by its low-level approach, the same technique of a toss starting from level flight {{can be used}} at any altitude {{when it is not}} desirable <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the target. Additional altitude at release gives the bomb additional time of flight and range, at the cost (in the case of unguided munitions) of accuracy due to windage and the increased effect of a slight deviation in flight path.|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{describes the}} objectives of the 2007 Western States Fire Mission (WSFM), which included demonstrating capabilities of the Ikhana unmanned aerial system (UAS) <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> and collect sensor data on widespread fires throughout the Western United States, demonstrating long-endurance (20 + hours) mission capabilities, and delivering real-time imagery within 10 minutes of acquisition. Additionally, the operations concept, operational zones, and landing sites are highlighted. Provisions of the certificate of authorization are also addressed.

50|$|Most BRCON was {{traditionally}} {{conducted by}} specially constructed spy planes of the United States against the Soviet Union, using high powered cameras <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> Soviet airspace <b>to</b> locate {{the positions of}} missile silos, and by Soviet planes using MAD or FLIR gear to locate US ballistic missile submarines. This was a back and forth {{effort on the part}} of the two superpowers and lead to the development of single-use planes such as the SR-71, the SR-75, and the Soviet Tsybin RSR.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was born}} in 1884 in Oakland, California to Ada L. and William H. Cooke. On 19 December 1911 Cooke {{was the first person}} <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California in an {{aircraft}} called the [...] "Black Diamond". The flight ended in Mill Valley, California inroute to Oakland after an engine failure and glide to landing from 2000ft of altitude.

50|$|The D-21 drone, {{similar in}} design to the Blackbird, was built <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the Lop Nur nuclear test {{facility}} in China. This drone was launched {{from the back}} of a specially modified A-12, known as M-21, of which there were two built. After a fatal mid-air collision on the fourth launch, the drones were re-built as D-21Bs, and launched with a rocket booster from B-52s. Four operational missions were conducted over China, but the camera packages were never successfully recovered.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 December 1939, The Times of London {{published}} {{the story of the}} Battle of the River Plate and the demise of , and a few hours later RAF Bomber Command attempted to sink another major warship. In accordance with Operational Order B. 60, dated 17 December, the targets were German warships either in port or at sea.

50|$|Numbers of {{tourists}} arrive via small planes or helicopters, or use them <b>to</b> <b>overfly</b> the Sound {{as part of}} the trip. In 2004 Milford Sound Airport had approximately 16,000 aircraft movements, most associated with flights to and from Queenstown. Around 35 aircraft can operate at the airport at any one time, though this level has not yet been reached. As flights can be spread over the day better than coach trips, only about 25 aircraft operated here during peak times of the day in 2004.|$|R
