40|$|A {{simulation}} {{package was}} developed to model the size reduction and separation process commonly used in Chinese coal preparation plants. {{the data for the}} simulation package was collected in coal preparation plants in China, and supplemented by data collected at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre, during studies of dense medium separators. The new or improved models developed are: (1) a roll crusher model; (2) a <b>rotary</b> <b>breaker</b> model; (3) an empirical model to predict the ash content of coal fractions after breakage; and (4) partition curve models for jigs and dense medium separators. These models were used in conjunction with existing process models to develop a simulation package for five size reduction and fourteen gravity separation flowsheets. These flowsheets can be combined to simulate the commonly used Chinese coal preparation circuits. The simulation program includes an optimization package to optimize: (1) screen apertures; (2) the separation densities for gravity separation devices; and (3) flotation time, so as to maximize the plant clean coal yield at a specified ash content. The Rosenbrock search technique was found to be the most suitable optimization method...|$|E
30|$|Processing of mined {{product to}} meet {{customer}} requirements is common and necessary. Current bituminous coal cleaning technologies for coarse coal employ density separation while fine coal cleaning applies surface chemistry-based methods, (Demir et al. 1999). Processing plant recoveries in the US range 50  %– 80  % depending upon seam thickness and associated strata {{in the roof}} and floor with typical values around 60  %– 65  %. The 35  %– 40  % reject material consists of two components: coarse coal processing waste (CCPW) larger than 100  mesh (150  micron) size {{or in some cases}} larger than 3  mm (1 / 8  inch) size, and fine coal processing waste (FCPW) or slurry generally less than 100  mesh sizes. The term “coal refuse” refers to coal processing waste and reject from <b>rotary</b> <b>breakers</b> prior to the ROM coal entering the processing plant circuits. The ratio of CCPW/FCPW varies depending upon the mining site but the ratio of 2.5 : 1 by weight is typical. Current processing trends tend to increase the top particle size reporting to the fine circuit to be about 10  mesh to reduce the load on the intermediate size circuits or to allow processing of the entire + 10  mesh fraction using a single processing unit operation. This will lead to higher amounts reporting to fine circuits which typically use inefficient technologies for recovering the coal. Some processing plant operators have opted to dispose fine material {{due to the lack of}} technologies available for treating moderately difficult-to-clean fine coal and for dewatering of the final product. The result of these practices would be increased number of FCPW ponds (slurry ponds) containing a significant amount of recoverable high purity carbon material (Black et al. 1996; Beck 2007).|$|R

In {{order to meet the}} expected demand for product, the current biopharmaceutical production process is being scaled-up. This study describes the scale-up approach for the upstream process and the resulting bioreactor design and operation strategy leading towards a feasible solution for bulk production of a vaccine against meningococcal disease. The technically realized 1. 2 m(3) bioreactor, equipped with a turbine impeller for gas dispersion, was complemented with an upward pumping impeller and a <b>rotary</b> plate foam <b>breaker</b> to contain foam inside the bioreactor. Aeration and ventilation in the culture broth were controlled by increasing the stirrer speed and gas flow rate simultaneously at increasing oxygen demand. The scale-up was successful and comparable growth curves and nutrient consumption profiles were reached on 0. 06 and 1. 2 m(3) ...|$|R
