40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) {{involves}} the use of a system of three spacecraft with instrument packages for measuring the earth's radiation balance to an accuracy which has been unattainable in previous experiments. The experiment is to determine the monthly averaged <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> at te 'top of the atmosphere' (TOA) over the earth with a resolution of 250 km. The realization of this goal requires the conduction of high accuracy measurements, and the computation of the instantaneous <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> from these measurements. The operation involved in this computation is called an 'inversion'. A third requirement is related to the computation of the daily and monthly averaged regional values from the instantaneous values. A brief description is provided of the algorithms for the inversion of the measurements to TOA <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances,</b> taking into account also the techniques which are used to validate the methods and results...|$|R

The measurement process is an approximately linear transformation of the original field of <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances,</b> so that linear statistical techniques may be employed. The combination of variability, measurement strategy, and error propagation is presently made {{with the help of}} information theory, as suggested by Kondratyev et al. (1975) and Peckham (1974).

40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment {{carries a}} three-channel {{scanning}} radiometer {{and a set}} of nadir-looking wide and medium field-of-view instruments for measuring the radiation emitted from earth and the solar radiation reflected from earth. This paper describes the algorithms which are used to compute the <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> at a reference level ('top of the atmosphere') from these measurements. Methods used to analyze data from previous radiation budget experiments are reviewed, and the rationale for the present algorithms is developed. The scanner data are converted to radiances by use of spectral factors, which account for imperfect spectral response of the optics. These radiances are converted to <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> at the reference level by use of directional models, which account for anisotropy of the radiation as it leaves the earth. The spectral factors and directional models are {{selected on the basis of}} the scene, which is identified on the basis of the location and the long-wave and shortwave radiances. These individual results are averaged over 2. 5 x 2. 5 deg regions. Data from the wide and medium field-of-view instruments are analyzed by use of the traditional shape factor method and also by use of a numerical filter, which permits resolution enhancement along the orbit track...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} filter {{inversion technique}} that reduces wide-angle satellite measurements to top-of-the-atmosphere <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> {{has been proposed}} for the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). The matrix formulation of this technique is presented, and {{the design of the}} numerical filter is discussed. The filter is smoothed with a singular value decomposition. The inversion process is simulated by generating synthetic measurements from a 24 degree spherical harmonic radiation field derived from Nimbus 6 ERB data. The numerical filter is applied to these measurements after they are corrupted with instrument error. The results are curves of expected error versus resolution area...|$|R
40|$|Two {{instrument}} modules of each satellite {{on which}} the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is orbiting observe components of the earth radiation budget with three different scales of earth view. An intercomparison of longwave measurements by these instruments provides relative information concerning radiometric performance at satellite altitude, techniques of estimating upwelling exitances, and an end-to-end evaluation of the data processing system. Results indicate that the ERBE radiometers are mildly sensitive to varying thermal loads from the spacecraft and/or the earth-space environment. Radiometric variations at the satellite and methods of data interpretation contribute about equally to the uncertainty of <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> from the earth...|$|R
40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite {{experiment}} {{which is}} to be implemented in the mid 1980 s. The experiment involves a utilization of instruments on one or more sun-synchronous satellites in the NOAA series, and the employment of a dedicated spacecraft, the ERBS, in a 57 deg orbit. One of the objectives of ERBE is related to an improvement of knowledge regarding the diurnal variability in the earth's radiation balance. In the present investigation, satellite samples of longwave (LW) radiation over land are simulated for both sun-synchronous and non-sun-synchronous orbits. Three different LW diurnal models are then applied to the sampled data, and the resulting modeled monthly net LW <b>radiant</b> <b>exitances</b> are compared against reference values based on complete hourly sampling of the area for a month. The results demonstrate the general usefulness of a trigonometric diurnal LW model for land regions with daytime heating trends...|$|R

50|$|Note that in {{the above}} formula for Planck’s Law, {{you might as well}} use c1L = 2hc2 (the first {{radiation}} constant for spectral radiance) instead of c1 (the “regular” first radiation constant), in which case the formula would give the spectral radiance L(λ,T) of the black body instead of the spectral <b>radiant</b> <b>exitance</b> M(λ,T). However, this change only affects the absolute values of XT, YT and ZT, not the values relative to each other. Since XT, YT and ZT are usually normalized to YT = 1 (or YT = 100) and are normalized when xT and yT are calculated, the absolute values of XT, YT and ZT do not matter. For practical reasons, c1 might therefore simply be replaced by 1.|$|E
