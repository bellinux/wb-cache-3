5|$|In winemaking, fruit sugars are {{converted}} into alcohol by a fermentation process. If the must formed by pressing the fruit {{has a low}} sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called chaptalization. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E

25|$|The maximum {{allowable}} doses {{depend on the}} sugar content of the wine: the <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> is susceptible to attack by microorganisms which would cause a restart of fermentation. In France the dose is limited to 150mg/litre for Vin de Pays (country wines), 185mg/l for Sparkling wines, 200mg/l for Fortified wines, 200mg/l for dry white wines, 250mg/l for white wines with <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> greater than 5g/litre (Moelleux wines), and 300mg/l for liquoreux sweet wines.|$|E

[...] "Dry beer" [...] {{refers to}} beers with less <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> and a dry taste."Nama beer" [...] {{generally}} refers to unpasteurized draught beer usually served from a pressurized keg. However, {{in the above}} brands, it is merely a marketing term; compare to Miller Genuine Draft.|$|R
50|$|The basic DOC {{red wine}} {{must have a}} minimum alcohol level of 14.5% if it has some <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> or 14% if it is labeled as dry (secco). Both the sweet (Liquoroso Dolce Naturale) and dry (Liquoroso Secco) {{fortified}} styles must have a minimum alcohol level of 17.5%.|$|R
50|$|In {{white wine}} production, grapes are quickly pressed after {{crushing}} to avoid skin contact with pomace as {{a byproduct of}} the pressing. The resulting debris is a pale, greenish-brown color and contains more <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> than it contains tannins and alcohol. This is the pomace normally used in brandy production.|$|R

5000|$|North Country Brünette, ABV 5.4%, The long, slow, {{secondary}} fermentation allowed the authentic Brettanomyces yeast culture {{to work on}} the <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> that remained in the beer, transforming it into a complex, almost spicy flavor profile. North Country Brünette is very tart and dry, with a fine, rounded acidic profile, and a malty, spiced fruity character. This beer is unfiltered, hand bottled, and bottled conditioned in 750ml cork and caged champagne bottles.|$|R

25|$|While recioto are {{typically}} sweet, {{with high levels}} of <b>residual</b> <b>sugar,</b> the must can be allowed to ferment completely dry. Often producers will label this wine as Amarone, but they may also choose to produce it as Valpolicella DOC wine or even an Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) table wine if they choose to use grape blends outside the DOC requirement. Some producers are experimenting with international varieties and producing dry Amarone style wines from grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E
25|$|A {{risk factor}} {{involved}} with fermentation {{is the development}} of chemical residue and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2), although excess SO2 can lead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels of <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> (like a dessert wine) may stop fermentation early either by dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high level of alcohol (like brandy) to the must to kill off the yeast and create a fortified wine.|$|E

25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as <b>residual</b> <b>sugars.</b>|$|R
25|$|Anjou Coteaux de la Loire AOC Located {{southwest}} {{of the city of}} Angers, this white wine only appellations was designated in 1946 to produce sweet wines from Chenin blanc. The grapes in this AOC are harvested at same sugar levels as in Sauternes (221grams per liter) with the finished wines having <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> levels of 17grams per liter. In the early 21st century, as the market for dessert wines dwindle, vineyards in this area are rapidly being converted to Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon for production of red wines under the Anjou AOC appellation.|$|E
25|$|The acidity in wine is an {{important}} component in the quality and taste of the wine. It adds a sharpness to the flavors and is detected most readily by a prickling sensation {{on the sides of the}} tongue and a mouth-watering aftertaste. Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus the sweetness of the wine (the leftover <b>residual</b> <b>sugar)</b> and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine with too much acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste flabby and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E
25|$|As Vouvray {{can be made}} in a {{wide range}} of {{sweetness}} styles, the wine labels may indicate the sweetness level by the terms Sec, Demi-Sec, Moelleux and Doux. While these terms are not strictly defined, they tend to roughly fall into the guidelines below. Note that the <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> level may not equate to the level of sweetness that a taster will perceive in the wine due to balance of acidity in the wine. In some cases a producer's Demi-Sec wine may taste drier than their Sec. Sparkling Vouvray may also have the sweetness level indicated on the label.|$|E

50|$|The high {{moisture}} content of bagasse, typically 40-50 percent, is detrimental to its {{use as a}} fuel. In general, bagasse is stored prior to further processing. For electricity production, it is stored under moist conditions, and the mild exothermic process that results from the degradation of <b>residual</b> <b>sugars</b> dries the bagasse pile slightly. For paper and pulp production, it is normally stored wet in order to assist in removal of the short pith fibres, which impede the paper making process, {{as well as to}} remove any remaining sugar.|$|R
25|$|The {{style of}} {{winemaking}} {{that would become}} associated with Maury {{has its roots in}} the work of the Catalan alchemist and physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova. He perfected the technique of stopping fermentation with distilled alcohol in the late 13th century and was given an exclusive patent on the process by King James II of Majorca. In 1872, Roussillo politician François Aragon convinced the French government to legally recognize the style of vin doux naturels as wines which had <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> and sweetness retained from having their fermentation stopped with grape spirits. In 1936, the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) established Maury as an officially recognized AOC.|$|E
25|$|Like France, rosés {{are made}} {{throughout}} Italy with {{the style and}} grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate. The long history of Italian rosés, particularly in the warm {{southern part of the}} country, stem from difficulties {{in the early days of}} winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> in the remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers realized that if they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.|$|E
25|$|Bonnezeaux AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC {{comprises}} three southwest facing slopes {{within the}} village of Thouarcé that produce sweet, often botrytized, wines made entirely from Chenin blanc. Harvest in Bonnezeaux is very labor-intensive requiring harvested {{to go through the}} vineyards in multiple passes or tries selecting only the ripest individual grapes. In 2003 the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) increased the harvest sugar levels from 204grams per liter to 238 and the minimum <b>residual</b> <b>sugar</b> levels of the finished wine from 17grams per liter to 34. Wine expert Tom Stevenson describes the wines of Bonnezeaux as being more full-bodied and richer than those of Quarts-de-Chaume with an aging potential of up to 20 years or more.|$|E
