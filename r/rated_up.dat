500|$|Up! Close and Personal {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. David Bianculli of New York City's Daily News wrote, [...] "After watching Britney Spears' [...] special last week, Twain's act will {{seem like an}} exercise in restraint. It'll also seem like someone singing, rather than lip-syncing." [...] Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant gave Up! Close & Personal a negative review. He found himself straining to hear Alison Krauss and Union Station, and asked, [...] "And {{when was the last}} time you tuned in to a star's special to hear the background singers?" [...] Furthermore, he would have preferred the band to duet with Twain, rather perform backup for her. Catlin also criticized Twain's decision to model the show after Presley's 68 Comeback Special, believing she did so with far less efficiency. [...] "Not only is she not Elvis, she's not even Alison", he concluded. Allmusic <b>rated</b> <b>Up!</b> Close and Personal three out of five stars.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} reason for <b>rating</b> <b>up</b> {{the quality of}} {{evidence}} is a large effect. GRADE suggests considering <b>rating</b> <b>up</b> quality of evidence one level when methodologically rigorous observational studies show at least a two-fold reduction or increase in risk, and <b>rating</b> <b>up</b> two levels {{for at least a}} five-fold reduction or increase in risk. Systematic review authors and guideline developers may also consider <b>rating</b> <b>up</b> quality of evidence when a dose-response gradient is present, and when all plausible confounders or biases would decrease an apparent treatment effect, or would create a spurious effect when results suggest no effect. Other considerations include the rapidity of the response, the underlying trajectory of the condition, and indirect evidence...|$|R

2500|$|The Sherwood Ranger first flew in 1992. Several {{versions}} of the Ranger have been built, with different maximum take-off weights (MTOW) and engines. [...] The early aircraft were built as the LW variant, with a MTOW of 390kk (860lb) and with engines in the 37-49kW (50-65hp) power range. Engines fitted include the 48kW (64hp) Rotax 532, the similar 48kW (64hp) Rotax 582 two cylinder two stroke engine and the 64kW (85hp) Jabiru 2200 flat four. [...] Some were later built as, or upgraded to, an MTOW of 450kg (992lb), the ST variant standard. [...] Some of these use the Rotax 582 or Jabiru engines and one is fitted with a BMW RS1100. The LW is no longer offered but the ST is available for building from plans, kit or quick build kit.
