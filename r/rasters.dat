25|$|The STEM <b>rasters</b> {{a focused}} {{incident}} probe across a specimen that (as with the TEM) has been thinned to facilitate detection of electrons scattered through the specimen. The high {{resolution of the}} TEM is thus possible in STEM. The focusing action (and aberrations) occur before the electrons hit the specimen in the STEM, but afterward in the TEM. The STEMs use of SEM-like beam rastering simplifies annular dark-field imaging, and other analytical techniques, but also means that image data is acquired in serial rather than in parallel fashion. Often TEM can be equipped with the scanning option and then it can function both as TEM and STEM.|$|E
2500|$|A TEM can be {{modified}} into a {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM) by the addition of a system that <b>rasters</b> the beam across the sample to form the image, combined with suitable detectors. Scanning coils are used to deflect the beam, such as by an electrostatic shift of the beam, where the beam is then collected using a current detector such as a Faraday cup, which acts as a direct electron counter. By correlating the electron count to the position of the scanning beam (known as the [...] "probe"), the transmitted component of the beam may be measured. The non-transmitted components may be obtained either by beam tilting or by the use of annular dark field detectors.|$|E

The solution led in the direction of creating such a <b>raster</b> element that has at least two independent shells where one increases in size together with the <b>raster</b> element increase, and the other one decreases when the <b>raster</b> element size increases.
