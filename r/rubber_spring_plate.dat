This article presents {{the effect of a}} vertical vibration input, which is also aimed at applying the laminated spring for high frequency excitation. Static analysis is discussed here using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to observe the stress and strain distribution as well as the safety factor of the isolator due to the axial force. Solid <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> experienced greater deformation while it decreased for the laminated rubber-metal <b>spring</b> as more <b>plates</b> were embedded in the rubber. However, higher stress distributions occurred on <b>spring</b> with multiple <b>plates</b> compared to solid rubber and the stress concentrate on steel plate layers. Strain distribution was observed to be high at solid <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> and it was decreasing on the laminated rubber-metal spring. The critical part for the strain distribution in the laminated rubber-metal spring was in the rubber layers...|$|R

It is, therefore, necessary to establish a suitable criterion for the replacement period of chevron <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> In this study, we performed characteristic analysis and useful lifetime prediction of chevron <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> <b>Rubber</b> material coefficient was obtained by curve fittings of uniaxial tension equibiaxial tension and pure shear test. Computer simulation was executed to predict and evaluate the load capacity and stiffness for chevron <b>rubber</b> <b>spring.</b> In order to useful lifetime prediction of rubber material, we carried out the compression set with heat aging test in an oven at the temperature ranging from 50 °C to 100 °C during a period 180 days. By using the Arrhenius plot, several useful lifetime prediction equations for rubber material was proposed.

40|$|Dampening {{systems are}} {{important}} in heavy vehicles utilized in rough terrains, with purpose to reduce shocks and vibrations with negative influences on the vehicle and, more importantly, on the operator of the vehicle. During the years the heavy vehicles require sturdier construction parts, due to demands on higher load capacity, where the easy solution to scale up the construction parts is not always applicable for dampening systems with nonlinear behavior. Hence, the sturdiness {{in the design of}} these dampening systems requires improvement. In this thesis the design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> used as <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> in Volvo’s articulated hauler A 40 G is treated. The aim of this thesis is to find alternative design solutions on the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring,</b> improving its lifetime. The usual failure of these <b>rubber</b> <b>springs</b> is crack propagation in the rubber body. In the method of this thesis, alternative design solution are generated in concepts though brain storming, which are adjusted to achieve the desired behavior of the <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> through calculations and tested in performance through simulations in Abaqus. From analyzing the generated data, it is concluded that among the tested design solutions, a combination of fewer plates and shaping the plates as thin bowls, results in highest potential increase in lifetime...|$|R

40|$|Element Analysis(동적유한요소해석), Rubber(고무), Nonlinear(비선형), Viscoelastic(점탄성) Recently, the {{vibration}} and structure-borne noise induced by passing trains are of great con-cerns, and the floating slab track is highlighted {{as one of}} most efficient alternatives to reduce the railway vibration. However, due to the non-linearity and viscosity of <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> used in the floating slab track, its dynamic behavior is very complex. In this study, therefore, to simulate the dynamic behavior of floating slab track with a better accuracy, a nonlinear viscoelastic <b>rubber</b> <b>spring</b> model that can be incorporated in commercial finite element analysis codes has been proposed. This model is composed {{of a combination of}} elastic spring element, friction element and viscous element, and termed the “generalized friction viscoelastic model(GFVM) ”.
