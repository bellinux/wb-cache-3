There are also address standards developed by international organizations for specific domains (such as postal delivery) and initiatives to develop <b>regional</b> <b>address</b> standards (particularly, within Europe). This workshop was conceived with the aim of discussing what an address actually is and exploring the possibility of developing an international address standard across the various domains that use addresses. This paper attempts to provide an overview of addresses and address standards, presenting a preliminary taxonomy of addresses. 1. Background to the workshop There is a variety of addresses used for many purposes. Various {{countries around}} the world have address standards or are developing them. There are also address standards developed by international organizations for specific domains (such as postal delivery) and initiatives to develop <b>regional</b> <b>address</b> standards (particularly, within Europe). Coetzee et al (2008) assessed ten of these standards against a variety of criteria, such as the standard's status; its purpose; the availability of supporting material; whether the standard supports geo-referencing with coordinates, postal addresses and non-posta...|$|E

40|$|The call to regionalize economic, {{social or}} {{environmental}} policy is heard {{in many areas}} throughout the world because existing local institutions are often unable to manage regional problems efficiently. Regionalization of policy introduces new institutions at the regional level. These institutions differ, acting as advocacy groups, regional governance institutions, and regional leadership institutions. Most regions which heed the call of regionalization create regional leadership institutions. Conducting case studies in the Bay Area, whose problems mirror those of nearly all US metropolitan areas, the author provides a systematic overview of regional leadership institutions and presents two main points of focus: (1) how a region's actors organize the process of <b>regional</b> decision-making and <b>address</b> <b>regional</b> problems; and (2) understanding the activities and goals of regional leadership institutions and finding out if the groups they target are benefitting from the activities. In addition, the author provides an in-depth look at six examples of regional institutions in the Bay Area that broadly <b>address</b> <b>regional</b> economic, social or environmental issues, characterizing them by their aims and structure {{as well as by}} the projects they have undertaken...|$|R
