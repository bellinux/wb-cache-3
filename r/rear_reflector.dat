25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central <b>rear</b> <b>reflector</b> {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E

50|$|The new Hawk {{announced}} in May 1957 had {{a completely new}} body with unitary construction which it {{would go on to}} share with the 1958 Humber Super Snipe. The Estate Car was the biggest bodyshell for a saloon based estate car built in Great Britain at the time. The 2267 cc engine was carried over, though with modifications to the distributor mounting, and other details; and an automatic transmission, the Borg Warner D.G. model, was now available. The body was styled in Rootes' own studios and featured more glass than previous models, with wrap-around front windscreen, which gave it a considerable resemblance to a base model 1955 Chevrolet 4-door sedan. The missing rear quarter-lights were returned in Series IV. The estate version featured a horizontally split tailgate—the lower half opening downwards (to provide an extra length of luggage-platform if necessary) and the upper half upwards.

40|$|Simple diffuse <b>rear</b> <b>reflectors</b> {{can enhance}} the light path length of weakly absorbed near {{infrared}} light in silicon solar cells and set a benchmark for more complex and expensive light trapping structures like dielectric gratings or plasmonic particles. We analyzed such simple diffuse <b>rear</b> <b>reflectors</b> systematically by optical and electrical measurements. We applied white paint, TiO 2 nanoparticles, white backsheets and a silver mirror to bifacial silicon solar cells and measured the enhancement of the external quantum efficiency for three different solar cell geometries: planar front and rear side, textured front and planar rear side, and textured front and rear side. We showed that an air-gap between the solar cell and the reflector decreases the absorption enhancement significantly, thus white paint and TiO 2 nanoparticles directly applied to the rear cell surface lead to the highest short circuit current density enhancements. The short circuit current density gains for a 200 mu m thick planar solar cell reached up to 1. 8 mA/cm(2), compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and up to 0. 8 mA/cm(2) compared to a high-quality silver mirror rear side. For solar cells with textured front side the short circuit current density gains {{are in the range}} between 0. 5 and 1. 0 mA/cm(2) compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and do not significantly depend on the angular characteristic of the <b>rear</b> side <b>reflector</b> but mainly on its absolute reflectance...|$|R

5000|$|On 16 March 1989, Proton officially {{launched}} the Saga saloon and hatchback duo in the United Kingdom. The saloon models were renamed Proton 1.3 and Proton 1.5 respectively {{according to their}} engine displacement {{in addition to a}} suffix such as S.E. or G.L. which denoted trim levels. The U.K.-market models also differed slightly from their Malaysian counterparts. All U.K.-market models were equipped with the original Mitsubishi Lancer Fiore dashboard and <b>rear</b> <b>reflector</b> lamps to pass U.K. safety regulations. Britain also received many limited edition models such as the Proton Puma, Lynx, Emerald, Prism and SE Le Mans, which featured higher trim levels and unique equipment. Proton advertised their models with the slogan [...] "Japanese Technology, Malaysian Style" [...] in the United Kingdom. Proton later set the record for the 'Fastest selling make of new car ever to enter the United Kingdom', exceeding their 12-month sales target within 6 months. Prior to its launch, the Saga underwent a strict homologation process to be allowed entry and sale in the U.K. market. The process included various quality, safety and emissions tests and over 400 modifications where necessary, as well as a 1,000 mile-trial on British roads and weather conditions. The Saga also went on sale in Singapore in October 1989.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the demands}} for energy saving and {{environmental}} conservation, the development of sustainable zero-carbon buildings has become an inevitable trend. Building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) is a promising technology capable of producing clean electricity onsite and replacing conventional building materials. This paper designs and investigates {{the performance of a}} planar Lambertian reflector-based concentrating BIPV system. A comprehensive 3 D ray-tracing simulation was applied to study the optical characteristics of the proposed module. It was found that when the geometric concentration ratio is 2. 0, the optical efficiency of the investigated Concentrating Photovoltaics (CPV) module is 62. 5 % and the radiant flux received by the solar cells is about 1. 4 times that of the counterpart module without solar concentrators. Through parametric analyses, it was concluded that the optical performance can be enhanced by selecting a suitable glass thickness and type, integrating the glazing cover with edge mirrors, adjusting the distance between the solar cells and improving the reflectivity of the Lambertian reflectors. Comparative analysis was also conducted for the CPV systems integrated with Lambertian and v-groove <b>rear</b> <b>reflectors</b> under different incident light angles, respectively. It was confirmed that the system integrated with Lambertian <b>rear</b> <b>reflectors</b> shows less angular dependence...|$|R
40|$|Photovoltaics {{are a key}} {{technology}} which can meet rising global demand for clean energy. However, significant improvements in performance are required to maximize their utilization of incoming solar radiation. Plasmonics show promise to improve light trapping in cells, taking advantage of properties of nanoscale metals. Plasmonic light trapping allows for significant increases to the path-length of light through a solar cell, increasing the chance of absorption. Since metal forms {{an integral part of}} solar cell designs, the motivation of this work is to investigate metal-based structures with potential to improve cell performance in thin-film solar cells without adding to the cost. In this thesis, rear-located reflectors are investigated, comprising arrays of metal nanoparticles, or nano-textured metal films. 3 D simulations explore various aspects of these structures’ performance, including scattering and absorption, the angle at which they scatter light, electric field profiles, and idealised photocurrent. Key design parameters are identified and optimised. This thesis also examines the underlying mechanisms of their performance enhancement. Beyond investigating the design of plasmonic <b>rear</b> <b>reflectors,</b> the impact their deployment in more realistic environments is also considered. Ageing of metal nanoparticles exposed to atmosphere is found to lead to tarnishing which can reduce the performance enhancement offered by such structures and needs to be considered in their design. Overall, the nano-textured reflectors investigated show potential to provide significant performance enhancements over a standard planar rear mirror, and in some cases to the metal nanoparticles. They also have the additional advantage of potentially serving as a cell’s rear contact. Particularly promising enhancements are shown for thinner cells. Parasitic absorption losses in such metal <b>rear</b> <b>reflectors</b> is investigated. Large angle scattering at resonant wavelengths is found to provide performance enhancements that significantly outweigh the negative impacts of increased parasitic absorption in such textured metal films...|$|R

40|$|As {{wafer-based}} {{solar cells}} become thinner, light-trapping textures for absorption enhancement will gain in importance. In this work, crystalline silicon wafers were textured with wavelength-scale diffraction grating surface textures by nanoimprint lithography using interference lithography as a mastering technology. This technique allows fine-tailored nanostructures {{to be realized}} on large areas with high throughput. Solar cell precursors were fabricated, with the surface textures on the rear side, for optical absorption measurements. Large absorption enhancements are observed in the wavelength range in which the silicon wafer absorbs weakly. It is shown experimentally that bi-periodic crossed gratings perform better than uni-periodic linear gratings. Optical simulations have {{been made of the}} fabricated structures, allowing the total absorption to be decomposed into useful absorption in the silicon and parasitic absorption in the <b>rear</b> <b>reflector.</b> Using the calculated sil icon absorption, promising absorbed photocurrent density enhancements have been calculated for solar cells employing the nano-textures.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a study into the bicycle lighting use. In this study the lighting on bicycles, on mopeds, and on cycles with auxiliary motors was specifically investigated {{for the first}} time regarding both the front and rear light. The measurements were conducted in January and February, 1996. The percentage of bicycles using front lighting had fallen to 51 %, when limiting firstly to the same four measurement locations as used in 1988 (65 %) and in 1993 (54 %). Here, Amsterdam represented the greatest anomaly with a user percentage of 27 %. The number of locations were extended to ten with the latest measurements. For these ten locations (including Amsterdam), the percentage of bicycles that used front lighting was 55 %, while for moped riders and cyclists with auxiliary motors, the figures were 94 % and 91 %, respectively. The operative rear light figures were only a few percent below the front light figures. The <b>rear</b> <b>reflector</b> presence was 94 %. If there was no <b>rear</b> <b>reflector,</b> the rear light only burned in 13 % of the cases. Cyclists aged over 25 years used lighting more often than the younger age categories.

In 1977, following a 1976 report by NAMI on the Volga's major shortcomings (problematic steering prime among them), GAZ refused to update the GAZ-24's front suspension, instead making only cosmetic changes. (The front suspension would be unchanged until 2003, when the kingpins were changed to sealed ball joints, while the rear got an antiroll bar.)
