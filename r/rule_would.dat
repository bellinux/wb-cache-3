5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|By moving {{ice hockey}} game indoors, the smaller {{dimensions}} of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being {{more or less the}} number that could fit on a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens. The nine-man per side <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.|$|E

5|$|On 13 February 1386 Corfu became {{once more}} a Venetian {{possession}} {{and this time}} Venetian <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> last {{until the end of}} the Republic. This was accomplished voluntary by the people of Corfu. On 10 May, the Corfiotes appointed five ambassadors to submit to the Venetian senate. The Ottomans made several attempts to capture Corfu, the first of which was in 1537. This attack led Venice to an alliance with the Pope and Emperor Charles V, known as the Holy League, against the Ottoman Empire. Another major unsuccessful Ottoman attack was that of July 1716.|$|E
5|$|The affair came {{amid the}} larger dispute between Whitehall and Salisbury {{regarding}} the terms under which Rhodesia could be granted sovereign independence. Rhodesia's mostly white government insisted that statehood should {{come under the}} constitution introduced with Britain's approval in 1961, while Whitehall insisted that a set timetable for the introduction of black majority <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> {{have to be in}} place before the country could be fully independent. The Rhodesian government's stance on this matter caused it to become isolated within the Commonwealth, which from 1964 excluded it from most of its internal bodies, while the Rhodesian military became unofficially embargoed by its established British and American suppliers.|$|E
5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling the formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority <b>rule</b> <b>would</b> split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
5|$|Narseh sent an {{ambassador}} to Galerius to plead {{for the return}} of his wives and children {{in the course of the}} war, but Galerius dismissed him. Serious peace negotiations began in the spring of 299. The magister memoriae (secretary) of Diocletian and Galerius, Sicorius Probus, was sent to Narseh to present terms. The conditions of the resulting Peace of Nisibis were heavy: Armenia returned to Roman domination, with the fort of Ziatha as its border; Caucasian Iberia would pay allegiance to Rome under a Roman appointee; Nisibis, now under Roman <b>rule,</b> <b>would</b> become the sole conduit for trade between Persia and Rome; and Rome would exercise control over the five satrapies between the Tigris and Armenia: Ingilene, Sophanene (Sophene), Arzanene (Aghdznik), Corduene (Carduene), and Zabdicene (near modern Hakkâri, Turkey). These regions included the passage of the Tigris through the Anti-Taurus range; the Bitlis pass, the quickest southerly route into Persian Armenia; and access to the Tur Abdin plateau.|$|E

5|$|The {{context of}} the Confrontation in the murk of Indonesian {{politics}} is extremely layered. Sukarno's choice of pursuing this strategy would {{come at the expense}} of an important program aiming at the rehabilitation of the damaged economy, as it relied upon funding from Britain and America, who would not support the strengthening of another Communist power forming in Asia. However, the Indonesian populace and much of the government, who had recently fought their way from the hands of Dutch <b>rule,</b> <b>would</b> likely not support the economic program as it would seem as if Indonesia was sliding back into the embrace of the 'imperialist' powers of the West. The proposal was also beginning to lose support from the army, as they learned that demobilisation and lessening of funding that the program entailed would affect them adversely. Confrontation, on the other hand, might serve as a far more stabilising force, as it garnered support from both the Communists and the military, whose internecine political conflict weakened Sukarno's government. A campaign could keep the army busy while the Communists became accepted into mainstream Indonesian politics, which the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) found favourable. The nationalist-leaning army was content to fight the Malaysians to both remove British influence from the region as well as to establish Indonesian dominance in Southeast Asia. Some of the military high command thought that conflict could solidify a central role for the army in Indonesian politics, as well as increase their budget and return the country to martial law, which would greatly empower the military. Short of all-out war, the military was largely supportive of Confrontation.|$|E
