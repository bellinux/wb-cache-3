50|$|Recently, the pragma-dialectical {{theory of}} argumentation has {{incorporated}} insights from rhetoric into {{the analysis of}} argumentative discussion (Van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 2002; 2006). Parties involved in {{a difference of opinion}} “maneuver strategically” to simultaneously realize their dialectical and their rhetorical aims. In other words, the parties in an argumentative discussion attempt to be persuasive (have their standpoint accepted) while observing the critical standards for argumentative discourse. In each of the critical discussion stages there is a <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goal</b> that corresponds with the dialectical goal and interlocutors can make use of three analytical aspects to balance effectiveness and reasonableness: making an opportune selection from the topical potential available at the stage concerned, approaching the audience effectively, and carefully exploiting presentational means. These three aspects correspond with some focal points of rhetorical study - topics, audience adaptation and presentational devices - so that insights acquired in rhetoric are brought to bear in explaining how rhetorical and dialectical considerations play a part in the various ways of strategic maneuvering.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to present a rhetorical {{analysis}} of selected Women’s Liberation addresses of Gloria Steinem delivered in two distinctly different audience situations. The study was divided into chapters dealing with the historical development of the Women’s Liberation Movement and the status of the movement in the 1970 ’s; a biography of the speaker, including Steinem’s personal philosophy concerning Women’s Liberation; the analysis of Steinem’s 1970 Vassar College Commencement Address; and an analysis of Steinem’s 1972 National Press Club Address. The method of analysis employed in the study is the strategy approach advanced by Kenneth Burke.

A key prediction of the model is that dispositionally guided text production will lead to the development of more conceptually coherent new ideas than writing directed towards extrinsic goals.

40|$|When {{required}} to use knowledge in a given source to answer a question, many student writers reproduce content information from the source without restructuring it to address the focal demand of the question. The result is an oblique answer. This paper analyses obliqueness as a writing problem {{from the perspectives of}} cognitive process writing theory and Halliday’s functional grammar, using from the latter the concepts of Theme/Rheme (Halliday, 1985, 1994). A cognitivist study of oblique answers suggests that the lack of fit between answer and question arises from limitations in the mental processes of task interpretation and <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goal</b> setting. The student writer interprets the task posed by the teacher’s question as an information recount task and consequently the writing is driven by goals that are essentially content- and sentence-based. A Theme/ Rheme analysis of oblique answers reveals that inappropriate choice of information for Theme position in sentences contributes towards the gap between an oblique answer and the question. Analysing obliqueness in students ’ texts from a cognitive as well as a thematization perspective uncovers insights about students ’ composing processes that have implications for the academic writing classroom...|$|E
40|$|Posters {{have been}} used in {{political}} communication for more than a century, and are still an important element in the election campaigns. However, few studies have been devoted {{to the way in which}} text and image work together in order to obtain the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goal</b> of making voters vote for a specific party. In this study, election posters in the 2002 general election in Sweden from all parties represented in the Swedish parliament are analysed. The context of this specific sample of political communication is described through a sociological approach inspired by Pierre Bourdieu, and through theories of political marketing. The model for analysis of the posters combine semiotics and rhetoric in order to present a model capable of analysing both text and image, and the way in which they are used in order to influence and persuade voters. The conclusions are that Swedish parties favour textual messages and not visual elements, and that when visual elements are used, these are mostly portraits of candidates. So apparently, the predominance of visual elements in advertising does not show in election posters. Neither can one claim that personalisation is a predominant element, as the total percentage of posters depicting candidates is quite low. The tendency towards negative campaigning seen in earlier elections is not present in the 2002 posters, and the rhetoric is mostly epideictic and thus aimed at keeping already convinced voters rather than attracting new ones. This might indicate that the posters have lost their role as means of attracting new voters and have become more of an “internal” affair, telling the party’s voters, in a way which presupposes shared points of view, that the party is there to be voted for as always. The posters thus fulfil a symbolic function of binding together adherents rather than attracting newcomers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the nature, messages, {{and methods of}} television communication through the rhetorical categories of 2 ̆ 7 ethos 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 logos 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 pathos 2 ̆ 7, to determine the implications for preaching today. Television 2 ̆ 7 s main goal is to attract the largest audience for advertisers, and uses messages and methods that appeal to emotion, so that people experience television more than they learn from it. Deductive 2 ̆ 7 logos 2 ̆ 7 is virtually absent from television, and only messages that elevate 2 ̆ 7 pathos 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 ethos 2 ̆ 7 succeed on television. The environment, values, and perceptions of everyone have been altered by television. It is the major storyteller of the culture, and has redefined society 2 ̆ 7 s communication expectations. People have become more sceptical about who they will listen to, and more demanding that messages be creative and appeal to their experience and emotion. Television is an effective communicator because it matches methods and messages to the felt needs of people and dominant cultural moods and expectations. Preachers have a similar <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goal,</b> {{to find out how}} people are persuaded and to design the right arguments in the right order {{for the benefit of the}} audience. They need today to realize the importance of emotional appeal in attracting attention and changing values. Preachers can become more fluent in using 2 ̆ 7 pathos 2 ̆ 7 by reading the Scriptures according to the text 2 ̆ 7 s emotional flow and analyzing their own points of identification. Sermons should be designed according to narrative principles for maximum emotional impact.

40|$|In {{response}} to a dual problem of critical water scarcity and rapid population growth, leaders of metropolitan Las Vegas implemented a region-wide, internationally marketed sustainability campaign. Preliminary studies found that, while sustainability policy attains its <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goals,</b> solutions initiated not only perpetuate but also purposefully expand the original dual problem to justify continuous water resource acquisitions. To examine this sustainability conundrum constructed by leadership—problem-perpetuation rather than problem-resolution—a critical examination in resource management asked two basic questions: what is being sustained and by what means? Via this inquiry, specific processes by which leaders perpetuate problems can be identified; and, so-informed, new choices capable of resolving human-constructed dilemmas can be applied. Drawing on Las Vegas’ sustainability campaign as example, this paper argues that sustainability policy inherently sustains polity rather than natural or cultural resources and does so by means of policy structure, policy content (and omissions), and policy goals...|$|R

As this paper shows, the physician-narrator assigns to his craft a crucial role in fostering the birth and progress of human civilization. The <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goals</b> of the historical account are, as I argue, attained through a subtle narrative strategy.

40|$|While {{there is}} an {{acknowledgement}} in apology research that political apologies are highly mediated, the process of mediation itself has lacked scrutiny. This article suggests {{that the idea of}} reconstruction helps to understand how apologies are mediated and evaluated. David Cameron's apology for Bloody Sunday is examined to see how he constructs four aspects of apology: social actors, consequences, categorization, and reasons. The reconstruction of those aspects by British, Unionist, and Nationalist press along with reconstructions made by soldiers in an online forum are considered. Data analysis was informed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis which helped to explore key aspects of reconstruction and how elements of Cameron's apology are altered in subsequent mediated forms of the apology. These mediated reconstructions of the apology allowed their authors to evaluate the apology in different ways. Thus, in this article, it is suggested that the evaluation of the apology by different groups is preceded by a reconstruction of it in accordance with <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goals.</b> This illuminates the process of mediation and helps to understand divergent responses to political apologies...|$|R
40|$|In this essay, I {{suggest that}} the central section of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein – the creature’s {{description}} of his first experiences – echoes Hume’s and Bacon’s discussions of inductive reasoning. Because the creature must learn the causes of phenomena the reader takes for granted, his story defamiliarizes both the reader’s world {{and the process of}} induction itself. The creature’s tale thus functions as a travel narrative, and produces the cognitive estrangement associated with science fiction. I then examine the prominence of inductive reasoning in the novel as a whole, and discuss Victor’s and the creature’s singular situations as resistant to inductive understanding. I argue that Shelley uses various narrative techniques (such as embedded narratives and character doubling) to invite and frustrate readers’ attempts to use induction to solve the novel’s central moral questions. The reader’s inability to form coherent inductive patterns in part accounts for the novel’s radical ambiguity. Finally, I suggest some consequences for Frankenstein’s relation to the gothic: the novel departs from gothic conventions in its unusual use of the doppelgänger, and its <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goals</b> in invoking induction...|$|R

It is apparent that minority and majority claims are not fixed but are flexibly used to achieve local <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goals.</b> Furthermore, the speeches differ before and after the Good Friday Agreement, with a reactionary “hegemonic” Unionist position giving way to a “majority-rights power sharing” argument and a “pseudo-minority” status giving way to a “disempowered minority” argument.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognised}} that language learners require extensive vocabulary knowledge {{to cope with}} the demands of studying content fields in English.

Variation in metaphor production is compared for the two conditions and across learner abilities, and the interaction between the frequency, dispersion and salience of metaphors in classroom input and learner output is considered.

40|$|Although {{frequently}} {{praised for}} her rhetorical abilities and {{widely recognized as}} an influential leader in the African-American community, Nannie Helen Burroughs' speeches and writings {{have been the subject}} of little scholarly treatment. 	The quest for freedom and equality in America, Burroughs believed, would be satisfied through individual and collective struggle, and while she never advocated directly the use of physical force, she often evoked martial themes [...] using terms such as battles, enemies, crusades, weapons, and sacrifice [...] along with ideas related to movement and progress, to motivate action among African-Americans. These ideas, complemented by her stylistic tendencies, inspired continued action during a time when basic citizenship rights seemed out of reach for many African-Americans. 	This rhetorical tendency seemed most strategic during the 1920 s and 1930 s, a time when African-Americans experienced a renewed and seemingly coordinated assault on their identity as American citizens. They found their constitutional right to vote threatened, their social and economic status weakened, and their identity as American citizens undermined. Burroughs would skillfully combine various styles of discourse to match her <b>rhetorical</b> <b>goals</b> and the demands of the audiences she addressed.
