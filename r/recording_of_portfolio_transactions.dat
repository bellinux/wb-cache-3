40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{mitigation}} is rapidly becoming {{an item of}} social concern. Climate change mitigation involves reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through emissions reduction and or sequestration enhancement (collectively called offsets). Many have asked how agriculture and forestry can participate in mitigation efforts. Given that over 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions arise from the energy sector, the role of agriculture and forestry depends critically on {{the costs of the}} offsets they can achieve in comparison with offset costs elsewhere in the economy. A number of researchers have examined the relative offset costs but have generally looked only at producer level costs. However there are also costs incurred when implementing, selling and conveying offset credits to a buyer. Also when commodities are involved like bioenergy feedstocks, the costs of readying these for use in implementing an offset strategy need to be reflected. This generally involves the broadly defined category of transaction costs. This dissertation examines the possible effects of transactions costs and storage costs for bioenergy commodities and how they affect the agriculture and forestry <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> mitigation strategies across a range of carbon dioxide equivalent prices. The model is used to simulate the effects with and without transactions and storage costs. Using an agriculture and forestry sector model called FASOMGHG, the dissertation finds that consideration of transactions and storage costs reduces the agricultural contribution total mitigation and changes the desirable <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> alternatives. In terms <b>of</b> the <b>portfolio,</b> <b>transactions</b> costs inclusion diminishes the desirability of soil sequestration and forest management while increasing the bioenergy and afforestation role. Storage costs diminish the bioenergy role and favor forest and sequestration items. The results of this study illustrate that transactions and storage costs are important considerations in policy and market design when addressing the reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations in climate change related decision making...|$|R
40|$|We analyse a {{model for}} pricing {{derivative}} securities {{in the presence of}} both transaction costs as well as the risk from a volatile portfolio. The model is based on the Black-Scholes parabolic PDE in which transaction costs are described following the Hoggard, Whalley, and Wilmott approach. The risk from a volatile portfolio is described by the variance <b>of</b> the synthesized <b>portfolio.</b> <b>Transaction</b> costs as well as the volatile portfolio risk de-pend on the time lag between two consecutive transactions. Minimizing their sum yields the optimal length of the hedge interval. In this model, prices of vanilla options can be computed from a solution to a fully nonlinear parabolic equation in which a diffusion coefficient representing volatility nonlinearly depends on the solution itself giving rise to explaining the volatility smile analytically. We derive a robust numerical scheme for solv-ing the governing equation and perform extensive numerical testing of the model and compare the results to real option market data. Implied risk and volatility are introduced and computed for large option datasets. We discuss how they can be used in qualitative and quantitative analyses of option market data. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>portfolio</b> choice <b>of</b> an {{investor}} who can invest in two risky assets (in {{addition to a}} riskless asset) and who is subject to taxes on realized capital gains. These taxes appear in the portfolio choice problem {{as a form of}} time-dependent, endogenous transaction costs. Similar to the case <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> choice with <b>transaction</b> costs, the optimal strategy of the taxable investor contains a “no trade ” region originating from the exercise of the option to defer capital gains taxes. This may lead an investor to hold a markedly undiversified portfolio, for reasonable parameter values. With multiple risky assets the investor is effectively holding a <b>portfolio</b> <b>of</b> tax-deferral options. The value of these options is considerable, in the range of 5 to 10 % of the wealth of an investor with constant relative risk aversion. Such value is decreasing in the volatility and correlation of the assets and in the risk aversion. If the risky assets can be held only through a mutual fund, the investor incurs a cost due to the loss of flexibility whose magnitude is small when assets are positively correlated Investors in many countries are subject to a non-trivial amount of taxes whenever they sell securities they hold at a profit.

40|$|This master thesis {{considers}} and evaluates {{a few different}} risk {{models for}} stock portfolios, including an ordinary sample covariance matrix, factor models and an approach inspired from random matrix theory. The risk models are evaluated by simulating minimum variance portfolios and employing a cross-validation. The Bloomberg+ transaction cost model is investigated and used to optimize <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> stocks, {{with respect to a}} trade off between the active risk <b>of</b> the <b>portfolio</b> and <b>transaction</b> costs. Further a few different simulations are performed while using the optimizer to rebalance long-only portfolios. The optimization problem is solved using an active-set algorithm. A couple of approaches are shown that may be used to visually try to decide a value for the risk aversion parameter λ in the objective function of the optimization problem. The thesis concludes that there is a practical difference between the different risk models that are evaluated. The ordinary sample covariance matrix is shown to not perform {{as well as the other}} models. It also shows that more frequent rebalancing is preferable to less frequent. Further the thesis goes on to show a peculiar behavior of the optimization problem, which is that the optimizer does not rebalance all the way to 0 in simulations, even if enough time is provided, unless it is explicitly required by the constraints...|$|R

40|$|CONCLUSION The {{analysis}} of the exposure measurement problem {{has shown that the}} proper measurement of counterparty exposure for <b>portfolios</b> <b>of</b> derivatives <b>transactions</b> is a complex task that cannot be performed without making a lot of simplifying assumptions. Because of the complicated interaction of correlation effects and offsettings from different transactions, the single transaction framework which is currently used by most banks is definitely not capable of accurately determining the portfolio credit risk. When simulation techniques are applied to estimate exposure, the accuracy of exposure estimations can be increased significantly. However, a lot of modelling choices has to be made concerning the valuation of transactions and the stochastic model of underlying market rates. Because the system has to make projections of market rates into the far future, the choice of an appropriate stochastic model for market rate dynamics is crucial in order to prevent unreasonable scenarios. The predominant application of models based on Brownian Motion in today’s bank risk management therefore leads to questionable results in respect to derivatives exposure evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} Investment Position (IPP) is {{a statement}} that shows the value of external financial assets and liabilities of residents of an economy {{at a point in}} time. Its evolution {{at the end of a}} specific period reflects balance of payments financial account transactions, valuation changes (in asset prices and exchange rates) and other adjustments, which consist mainly of reclassifications of external financial assets and liabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide figures on trends of valuation adjustments due to price and exchange rate changes implicit in Spain´s International Investment Position (IIP), and to briefly analyze their limitations. We found that valuation effects depend on the characteristics of the financial instruments involved, and on the sources of information available for each component. In the case <b>of</b> <b>portfolio</b> investment <b>transactions,</b> we used security by security market prices that were available for the years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, in Spain´s international investment position, most foreign direct investment data are not available at market values. As these assets and liabilities have experienced important price increases between 1993 and 2006, we present a new methodology for measuring foreign direct investment positions that includes valuation effects. The results presented in this paper show that in Spain, revaluations of stocks explain a very important part of changes in the IIP during recent years: 55 % of the increase in the net liability position of the Spanish economy between 1993 and 2004 reflects changes of value due to variations in prices or in exchange rates of external assets and liabilities. Overall, the sum of these revaluation effects represent 19 % of GDP of the year 2004. Between 1997 and 2004, Spain’s net liability position increased 247, 930 million euros, of which balance of payments financial account transactions accounted for 52, 6 %, whereas revaluations and other adjustments explain the remaining 47, 3 %. The latter is broken own into 27, 6 % due to price effects, 10, 1 % to exchange rate changes, and 9, 6 % to other adjustments. ...|$|R

Neste sentido, este trabalho terá como finalidade a caraterização do investimento imobiliário nas carteiras de activos dos fundos de pensões e das empresas seguradoras, em Portugal. As principais fontes de informação utilizadas, neste trabalho, foram os registos históricos tanto das carteiras de investimento dos investidores institucionais, como dos principais tipos de activos, nomeadamente, acções, obrigações e imobiliário, e a elaboração de um questionário dirigido aos gestores das carteiras de activos dos referidos investidores. Constatando-se que, para os investidores institucionais em análise, a razão mais atractiva para o investimento no imobiliário se prende com a possibilidade de diversificação da carteira de activos, e que o maior risco é o da falta de liquidez, a opção de investimento mais consensual, é contudo em obrigações, visto que o peso da classe do investimento imobiliário é obtido através do modelo de Asset Liability Management (ALM), que traduz a gestão integrada de activos e passivos.
