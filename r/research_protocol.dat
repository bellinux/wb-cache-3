He was in Amsterdam attending an AIDS conference when he learned of Rathbun's arrest by way of CNN. [...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight. Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third <b>research</b> <b>protocol,</b> [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997. [...] The study was funded with $978,000 from the National Institutes of Health with cannabis supplied by NIDA., DEA. : [...] "The results of that study were extremely promising and I think very surprising to NIDA in that we, one of the common concerns that NIDA had put forth was that we know that marijuana hurts the immune system, how could you possibly talk about using marijuana with people who are immuno-compromised? [...] And what Dr. Abrams found is that marijuana did not hurt the immune system, did not increase viral load, did not negatively interact with the protease inhibitors and actually did facilitate, increase caloric intake as well as weight gain, and also oral THC was included in this study as well as a placebo." ...|$|E

50|$|The Arabin Pessary is a {{silicone}} {{device that}} has been suggested to prevent spontaneous preterm birth {{without the need for}} surgery. The leading hypotheses for its mechanisms were that is could help keep the cervix closed similarly to the cerclage, as well as change the inclination of the cervical canal so that the pregnancy weight is not directly above the internal os. However, large randomized clinical trials in singleton and twin pregnancies found that the cervical pessary did not result in a lower rate of spontaneous early preterm birth. Therefore, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendation is that placement of cervical pessary in pregnancy to decrease preterm birth, should be used only {{in the context of a}} clinical trial or <b>research</b> <b>protocol.</b>|$|E

50|$|As {{with any}} {{experimental}} design, the CCCS design has limitations. When the sample {{in the series}} is drawn from a particular clinic, there is the potential that that sample may not {{be representative of the}} broader population because of referral bias. One additional limitation of reporting on a series of cases receiving clinical treatment (as opposed to participants enrolled in a formal <b>research</b> <b>protocol)</b> is that there tend to be variations in how the treatment is applied across participants. This is particularly the case with behavioral interventions which are individualized, and continuously evaluated, and altered based on the individual’s response. An ideal middle ground would involve the use of treatment algorithms to structure how treatment components are sequenced while still preserving the response-guided approach that is the hallmark of good clinical practice in applied behavior.|$|E
5000|$|EPA {{recruiting}} {{information for}} CHEERS claimed {{that participation in}} the study presented [...] "no risk" [...] to the study subjects or their families. Critics contend that the state of knowledge about pesticide exposure risks to infants and children is imprecise, but suggests that residential pesticide exposures pose developmental risks to infants and children. CHEERS protocols may have provided for intervention with subjects where technicians discovered use of pesticides inconsistent with product label directions, although EPA has never publicly produced the <b>research</b> <b>protocol</b> submitted to an Institutional Review Board (IRB). However, EPA has canceled residential use of some of the pesticides CHEERS was to study, based on potential harm to infants and children. CHEERS made no provision for informing subjects of risks associated with continued residential use of those pesticides.|$|E
50|$|Think-aloud {{protocols}} involve participants thinking aloud as {{they are}} performing a set of specified tasks. Participants are asked to say whatever comes into their mind as they complete the task. This might include what they are looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives observers insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. In a formal <b>research</b> <b>protocol,</b> all verbalizations are transcribed and then analyzed. In a usability testing context, observers are asked to take notes of what participants say and do, without attempting to interpret their actions and words, and especially noting places where they encounter difficulty. Test sessions are often audio- and video-recorded so that developers {{can go back and}} refer to what participants did and how they reacted.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the FDA must approve all {{clinical}} trials involving newly developed pharmaceuticals. Researchers must complete an Investigational New Drug (IND) application {{in order to}} earn the FDA's approval. IND applications typically include data from animal and toxicology studies in which the drug's safety is tested, drug manufacturing information explaining how and where the drug will be produced, and a detailed <b>research</b> <b>protocol</b> stating who {{will be included in}} the study, how the drug will be administered and how participants will be consented. Testing for new drugs must successfully go through three phases of research before a drug can be marketed to the public. In Phase I trials, the drug's safety is tested on a small group of participants. The drug's effectiveness is tested during Phase II trials with a larger number of participants. Phase III trials, involving 1,000- 3,000 participants, analyze effectiveness, determine side effects and compare the outcomes of the new drug to similar drugs on the market. [...] An additional phase, Phase IV, is included to continually gain information after a drug is on the market. Geron's IND application for the GRNOPC1 clinical trial, nearly 28,000 pages in length, {{was one of the most}} extensive applications ever to be submitted to the FDA.|$|E
