5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> {{not have the}} highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey of Presidential Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E

50|$|What would <b>Reagan</b> <b>do?</b> (sometimes {{abbreviated}} WWRD) is {{a phrase}} that has become popular primarily among conservatives and Republicans in the United States. Its usage reflects a belief in former United States President Ronald Reagan as a model conservative leader whose philosophy and policies provide guidance and a good example for modern politicians.|$|R
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher became closely {{aligned with}} the Cold War {{policies}} of US President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism. A disagreement came in 1983 when <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not consult {{with her on the}} invasion of Grenada. During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US to station more than 160cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £12billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985–86, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} to appear to be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked two hours a day in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, {{spending}} surged by approximately 3% of gross domestic product and the tax rate surpassed that of Ronald Reagan's administration. However, government accountability was a highly contentious issue in the late 1970s, and John Howard maintains that under Fraser [...] "spending went up... at about two per cent per year in real terms... <b>Reagan</b> <b>do</b> better than that".|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} day, Ed Meese, {{who served}} as Counselor to the President (1981-1985) and Attorney General (1985-1988), penned a joint op-ed with Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation Executive Director John Heubusch detailed more inaccuracies in O'Reilly's book, saying [...] "we believe that Killing <b>Reagan</b> <b>does</b> a real disservice to our 40th president and to history itself." [...] The same day, Frank Donatelli, President Reagan's Assistant for Political and Intergovernmental Affairs, also penned an op-ed for The Washington Times disputing O'Reilly's key thesis as another discredited [...] "senility myth" [...] about Ronald Reagan.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his years}} as Reagan Foundation chief, Heubusch has become a readily {{available}} spokesman on all Reagan matters, such as when a vial of the late President's blood was publicly auctioned in 2012, or when the former First Lady suffered broken ribs in a fall that same year. In 2015, Heubusch and Ed Meese, who served as Counselor to the President (1981-1985) and Attorney General (1985-1988), penned a joint op-ed to detail numerous inaccuracies in Killing Reagan, a best-selling book by Bill O'Reilly, saying, [...] "We believe that Killing <b>Reagan</b> <b>does</b> a real disservice to our 40th president and to history itself." ...|$|R

25|$|However, Hudson's revelation did not {{immediately}} dispel the stigma of AIDS. Although then-president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy were friends of Hudson, Reagan made no public statement concerning Hudson's condition. However, <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> in fact phone Hudson privately in his Paris hospital room where he was being treated in July 1985 and released a condolence statement after his death.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of this election, San Francisco and Alameda were the only two {{counties}} in California to have never been carried by Reagan in either of his campaigns for president or for Governor of California (<b>Reagan</b> also <b>did</b> not carry Yolo County in any of his presidential campaigns; however, he carried the county in his 1966 gubernatorial campaign).|$|R
25|$|Atwater: But <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences {{was looking}} into {{research}} about the controversial issues regarding acid rain. President Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not place a huge {{attention on the}} issues of acid rain until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US. Reagan honored the agreement to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s enforcement of anti-pollution regulation. In 1982, US President Ronald Reagan commissioned William Nierenberg to sit on National Science Board. Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to sit on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reviewed the draft report and sent Fred Singer’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain. The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nirenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was {{due to the fact that}} the report was not ready to be published.|$|E
25|$|The House of Representatives, {{which was}} the first chamber to {{consider}} amendments, conducted seven weeks of hearings on amendatory legislation at which over 100 witnesses testified, most of whom supported extending the Act's special provisions by at least 10 years. President Ronald Reagan's administration largely stayed out of the debate as the legislation worked its way through the House. However, President <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> indicate he supported replacing the coverage formula with a nationwide preclearance requirement. The House ultimately passed legislation maintaining the coverage formula and permanently extending the special provisions. Supporters of the House bill hoped to sustain the momentum from the House and expedite approval of the House bill in the Senate, but Senators opposing the legislation slowed its passage through extensive committee hearings. Furthermore, the Reagan Administration announced its support for only a 10-year extension of the special provisions. The Senate eventually compromised on maintaining the coverage formula unchanged and extending the special provisions by 25 years, except for the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirement, which was extended for seven years. The Senate also agreed to liberalize the bailout procedure to allow a covered state or local government to escape coverage by proving to the U.S. District Court for D.C. that it had complied with the Voting Rights Act and undertook constructive efforts to expand opportunities for political participation in the 10 years preceding its bailout request. The bailout procedure was also amended to allow a local government to bail out of coverage even if its parent state was covered.|$|E

500|$|But {{there was}} also {{speculation}} over how long Reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration. Not long after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, at a reception for mayors, Reagan greeted his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Samuel Pierce in 1981 by saying [...] "How are you, Mr Mayor? How are things in your city?" [...] Former CBS White House correspondent Lesley Stahl recounted that, in her final {{meeting with the president}} in 1986, <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not seem to know who Stahl was, and that she came close to reporting that Reagan was senile, {{but at the end of}} the meeting, Reagan had regained his alertness. However, Dr. Lawrence K. Altman, a physician employed as a reporter for The New York Times, noted that [...] "the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer's can be fuzzy," [...] and all four of Reagan's White House doctors said that they saw no evidence of Alzheimer's while he was president. Dr. John E. Hutton, Reagan's primary physician from 1984 to 1989, said the president [...] "absolutely" [...] did not [...] "show any signs of dementia or Alzheimer's." [...] His former Chief of Staff James Baker considered [...] "ludicrous" [...] the idea that Reagan slept during cabinet meetings. Other staff members, former aides, and friends said they saw no indication of Alzheimer's while he was president. <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> experience occasional memory lapses, though, especially with names. Reagan's doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992 or 1993, several years after he had left office. For example, Reagan repeated a toast to Margaret Thatcher, with identical words and gestures, at his 82nd-birthday party on February 6, 1993.|$|E
500|$|Entering the {{presidency}} in 1981, Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His supply-side economic policies, dubbed [...] "Reaganomics", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived an assassination attempt, spurred the War on Drugs, and fought public sector labor. Over his two terms, the economy saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4; while <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, tax cuts and increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned {{on the notion that}} it was [...] "Morning in America", winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in American history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran–Contra affair. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire", and during his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate, President Reagan challenged Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to [...] "tear down this wall!". He transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback, by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Gorbachev, which culminated in the INF Treaty, shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency came during the decline of the Soviet Union and just ten months after the end of his term, the Berlin Wall fell, Germany reunified the following year, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E

5000|$|Following the 2016 presidential {{election}} which saw many Rust Belt counties flip to Donald Trump, a Republican strategist {{said that the}} working-class [...] "Reagan Democrats" [...] who favored Trump in 2016 should now be called [...] "Trump Republicans". Conversely, {{it has been suggested}} that <b>Reagan</b> Democrats <b>did</b> not necessarily swing the Rust Belt states in 2016, but rather that Democrat voters in those regions stayed home on election day.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Laikin {{teamed with}} {{cartoonist}} Mort Drucker on the highly successful JFK Coloring Book (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies, prompting follow-up coloring books on Ollie North and Ronald <b>Reagan.</b> They <b>did</b> JFK Coloring Book in 1962 and The Ollie North Coloring Book in 1987.

5000|$|Reagan won the {{election}} in Tennessee with a 16-point sweep-out landslide. While Tennessee typically voted conservative at the time, {{the election}} results in Tennessee are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the [...] "second American Revolution." [...] This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. <b>Reagan</b> generally <b>did</b> better in the West than the South, but still pulled far ahead of Mondale in this election.|$|R
2500|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} criticism surrounds Reagan's silence about the AIDS epidemic spreading in the 1980s.

During the press conference in 1985, Reagan expressed skepticism in allowing children with AIDS to continue in school although he supported their right to do so, stating: ...|$|E
2500|$|Many annual dinners {{have been}} {{cancelled}} or downsized due to deaths or political crises. The dinner was cancelled in 1930 {{due to the}} death of former president William Howard Taft; in 1942, following the United States' entry into World War II; and in 1951, over what President Harry S. Truman called the [...] "uncertainty of the world situation." [...] In 1981, Ronald <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not attend because he was recuperating after the attempted assassination on his life the previous month. Donald Trump eschewed the 2017 dinner in favor of a political rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E
2500|$|Lyons also {{received}} backing from Ronald W. Reagan, former host of CBS's General Electric Theater. At the time, <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> not fly {{and came to}} Louisiana by train, a trip that required several days. He was accompanied by his wife, Nancy. The stops for Lyons occurred ten months before Reagan delivered his address, [...] "A Time for Choosing", on national television on October 27, 1964, to promote Barry Goldwater's presidential bid against President Lyndon B. Johnson. The speech was credited with catapulting Reagan into the vanguard of national politics. Like Lyons, Reagan was a former Democrat who had switched party allegiance in 1962. Charlton Lyons, Jr., said he cannot recall how his father met Reagan but believes the two had been friends for several years before the 1964 campaign.|$|E
50|$|Responsibility for {{handling}} the S&L crisis lay with the Cabinet Council on Economic Affairs (CCEA), an intergovernmental council {{located within the}} Executive Office of the President. At the time, the CCEA was chaired by Treasury Secretary Donald Regan. The CCEA pushed the FHLBB to refrain from re-regulating the S&L industry and adamantly opposed any governmental expenditures to resolve the S&L problem. Furthermore, the <b>Reagan</b> administration <b>did</b> not want to alarm the public by closing {{a large number of}} S&Ls. Such actions significantly worsened the S&L crisis.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, two of Ronald Reagan's {{most senior}} aides {{disagreed}} {{over how to}} reduce {{the federal budget deficit}} in fiscal year 1985.

40|$|An {{increasingly}} controversial area {{within the}} realm of governmental hiring policies lies in the distinction between the passive or colorblind approach to equal employment opportunity and the results-based orientation more commonly associated with affirmative action programs.

The authors conclude that the EEO bias characteristic of most city officials coupled with the staffing and per-sonnel management philosophy of the <b>Reagan</b> Administration <b>does</b> not augur well for the future of affirmative action program implementation...|$|R
