40|$|We {{revisit the}} seminal paper on {{endogenous}} fertility by Barro and Becker (1989) {{taking into account}} households' heterogeneity in terms of capital endowments, mortality differential and cost per surviving child. Focusing on an endogenous growth version, we show at first that there exists a unique balanced growth path (BGP) where the population growth rates of all dynasties are identical. Then, we study the long-run effects of shocks on mortality rates (such as epidemics), mortality differential and total factor productivity (TFP) on the economic and demographic growth rates. The main mechanism rests on the adjustment of the average <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> of a surviving child. Finally, we extend the model considering the effects of labor taxation. We find that a higher tax rate may, on the one side, enhance growth but, on the other side, raise wealth inequalities. endogenous fertility, heterogeneous households, mortality differential, labor taxation, endogenous growth...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to estimate the}} income from native poultry production and analyze the efficiency of resources used covering three coastal districts of Bangladesh namely Noakhali, Patuakhali and Satkhira. A total of 180 poultry rearers were selected from different villages of the districts using purposive sampling technique. Primary and secondary data were collected and analyzed following a combination of descriptive statistics, sensitivity analysis, statistical model and mathematical technique. Gross and net returns per household per day from native poultry rearing were estimated at Tk. 34. 04 and Tk. 27. 93, respectively. The undiscounted benefit cost ratio was 5. 57, implying that this enterprise is highly profitable. Moreover, the contribution from poultry rearing to total income was 8. 25 percent. Sensitivity analysis shows that the gross margins and benefit cost ratios were strongly influenced by the {{factors such as the}} cost of inputs, price of outputs and poultry inventory. Multiple Regression model revealed that almost all variables were influenced income from native poultry farming except <b>rearing</b> <b>cost.</b> Increasing returns to scale was found which indicates that there was bright prospect to earn more through the use of more inputs in the production process.

40|$|A {{problem with}} augmenting predatory bugs through mass release is the {{logistical}} difficulty of delivering nymphs onto the foliage of field crops. In this paper we examine postrelease establishment and dispersal of the nymphs of the predatory bug Pristhesancus plagipennis on soybean, cotton and sunflower {{in an effort}} to devise an appropriate strategy for field release. The effects of predator stadia and release rates on field establishment and within-crop-canopy dispersal after hand release were recorded in soybean, cotton and sunflower. Field establishment improved with the release of more-developed nymphs, with third instars providing the most appropriate compromise between field hardiness and <b>rearing</b> <b>cost.</b> Increased nymphal density at the point of release had little effect on nymphal dispersal throughout the crop canopy. The patterns of nymphal dispersal observed on the three crops suggest that crop-canopy architecture may {{have an effect on the}} ability of nymphs to spread out postrelease, as nymphs dispersed poorly in cotton and sunflower compared to soybean. To overcome poor dispersal of nymphs after release, a mechanical release method, where nymphs were mixed with vermiculite and delivered onto a target crop through a spinning disk fertiliser spreader, was tested, and provided similar nymph establishment rates and dispersal patterns as releasing nymphs individually by hand. The implications of nymph dispersal and field hardiness in regard to inundative field release techniques are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Young {{stock rearing}} is an {{important}} factor on dairy farms. However, the costs of young stock rearing are often unknown while most costs are contributed to the dairy cows. In addition to that, most farmers have great difficulties in estimating the costs of young stock rearing. Previous research shows that the costs of young stock rearing can be up to € 1540 per successfully bred heifer or 13 % of the cost price of milk (Mohd Nor et al., 2012). In order to calculate the young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> on Dutch dairy farms, 43 farms were visited and a calculation of their young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> was made using JonKos, a module designed by WUR Livestock Research, DLV and WUR Business economics (WUR Livestock Research et al., 2011). The average costs of young stock rearing on dairy farms according to this research project were € 1559 per successfully reared heifer. Young stock rearing farms had lower average <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> than dairy farms (€ 1273 versus € 1606 resp.), although this proved not to be significant (p= 0. 056; B=- 0. 294). The total hours spent on young stock rearing had a significant effect on the total young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> per heifer on dairy farms (p= 0, 049; B= 0. 326). In addition, a rise in the average age at first calving did lead to a significant rise the costs of young stock rearing per 100 kg milk (p= 0, 01; B= 0, 426). The farmers that participated in this research project estimated their <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> to be € 994 per successfully reared heifer, thereby underestimating the young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> by € 312 per heifer. There was no significant relation between the calculated young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> on a farm and the estimation by the farmer, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} farmers that participated in this project were not able to make an educated guess of their young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs.</b> All farmers that participated in this research project wanted more information on young stock <b>rearing</b> and the <b>costs</b> accompanied with the rearing period.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of plumage color polymorphism in the parasitic jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus) {{is still not}} well understood. Earlier studies indicated that selection may favor pale females and melanic males. If so, females would maximize their fitness, producing pale female and melanic male offspring. We therefore predicted that females might bias their offspring sex ratio toward daughters in pale pairs and toward sons in melanic pairs. Females might also choose to mate assortatively in relation to plumage color, thereby maximizing the probability of producing either pale or melanic offspring. Because females are larger than males, differential <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> may affect the offspring sex ratio independent of parental plumage color. We examined offspring sex ratio allocation, breeding variables indicative of parental quality, and mating pattern in relation to plumage color in a colony of parasitic jaegers in northern Norway. Jaegers tended to mate assortatively in relation to plumage color. The reproductive performance declined with season, and matched pairs appeared to be of lower quality than mixed pairs. The proportion of male offspring increased with hatching date in matched pale and mixed pairs, whereas the situation was reversed in matched melanic pairs. Matched pale pairs produced an overall surplus of favorable pale but costly daughters despite their lower quality, while melanic pairs produced a surplus of favorable melanic sons. However, differential offspring <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> and parental <b>rearing</b> capacity may have additionally affected the realized offspring sex ratio. Mixed pairs producing an overall surplus of pale and melanic daughters allocated their resources according to differential <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> and parental quality only. We suggest that both strategies of sex ratio allocation together with differences in reproductive success in matched versus mixed pairs may have a balancing effect on the mating pattern between plumage morphs and {{may contribute to the}} {{maintenance of}} the color polymorphism in this species.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show that, when {{endogenous}} fertility is considered via Cobb-Douglas preferences, public debt plays a clear-cut role on dynamic inefficiency (DI) of an OLG economy: in fact, for correcting the DI problem, debt must be increased (decreased) {{when the economy}} is overaccumulating (underaccumulating). The occurrence of overaccumulation, and, thus, the necessity of a positive level of debt, is favoured by a small capital income share, on the technological side, and a sufficiently high degree of patience and a low preference for children on preferences grounds. As for the optimal level of debt, our analysis shows that a high level ofdebt {{is more likely to be}} optimal for countries with a relatively low share of capital, with high costs for rearing children, with high individuals' degree of patience; as for individuals preference for children, as expected, the preference for a numerous family reduces the risk of overaccumulation and, thus, the optimal level of national debt. Moreover, interestingly, although in our model the occurrence of dynamic inefficiency (DI) does not depend on the level of the child <b>rearing</b> <b>cost,</b> such cost magnifies the degree of inefficiency and, therefore, a higher public debt is required for correcting DI. Finally, it is argued that such findings can provide useful criteria for assessing the optimality of public debt-cutting policies undertaken by several Europen countries.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we show that, when one allows for {{endogenous}} fertility in Diamonds (1965) OLG model, public debt plays still a clear-cut role on dynamic inefficiency (DI) : for correcting DI, national debt must be increased. DI {{is more likely}} to occur when the economy capital income share and the preference for children are sufficiently low and the degree of patience is sufficiently high. However, differently from Diamond's case, DI {{turns out to be a}} necessary but not a su¢cient condition for welfare improvements to obtain via debt increases, since, in presence of endogenous fertility, the optimal level of debt is typically lower than the one associated to the traditional Golden Rule. Hence, not taking fertility choices into account would lead policymakers to overshoot the target, i. e. to issue too high a level of national debt. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal level of debt is higher the lower the capital share, the higher individuals' degree of patience, the bigger the child <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> and the lower the preference for children. On policy grounds we argue that for debt tightening policies to be optimal in the long run, it is necessary that the cost of rearing children does not increase (or, if anything, reduces).

40|$|The NI {{artificial}} diet is {{the only}} known successful diet for mass rearing the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae). This diet {{has been used for}} more than a decade. However, because it contains cooked chicken egg, and thus requires laborious preparation (Cohen 2000), this diet is difficult to use. Three modifications (D 1, D 2, D 3) of the NI diet were investigated in hopes of developing a more easily prepared diet that avoids the cooked egg and improves mass fitness parameters of L. hesperus. The modified D 3 diet, containing autoclaved chicken egg yolk based component, had the highest egg/cage/day production (13120 ± 812 SE). This was significantly greater than diets D 1, containing autoclaved dry chicken egg yolk based component (9027 ± 811 SE), D 2, containing autoclaved chicken egg white based component (8311 ± 628 SE), and NI, which contained autoclaved chicken egg yolk + cooked egg diet (7890 ± 761 SE). Significant differences were observed in the weights of all developmental stages except for eggs and first instar nymphs. Higher rates of fertility, hatchability, and low mortality in nymphs during the first instar were also obtained in the modified D 3 diet. The results clearly indicated that the D 3 diet provided an opportunity to significantly reduce <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> by avoiding time-consuming issues with preparation of a cooked egg diet.

40|$|Rarely human {{communities}} coexist {{in harmony}} with large predators. Most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15 ± 0. 1 SE/ 100 km(2). Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25 /km(2) - 31 /km(2) with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33 ± 3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30 %). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1, 798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42 % of lions' biomass consumptions, of which only 16 % was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58 ± 0. 2 SE% of annual livestock <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76 ± 0. 05 SE%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude {{that a combination of}} strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives.

40|$|Abstract only. The {{development}} of aquaculture {{in developing countries}} of the Asia-Pacific region is constrained by inadequate seeds, diseases and other causes of mortality, lack of effective natural food and formulated feeds, problems associated with technology of culture systems, and {{lack of knowledge of}} the breeding biology of culture species. Other problems include inaadequate qualified technicians and skilled labor and high cost of fertilizers, pesticides, pumps, and blowers. All these are only those related with production part of aquaculture. Problems associated with post harvest are also numerous, not to mention financing, socio-economic condition, and local peace and order situation. The problems are aggravated when fish farmers go into semi-intensive and intensive methods of culture. Applications of endocrinology willhave their greatest impact in enhancing aquaculture development by improving the seed supply. These may be done through induced maturation and spawning, larval rearing, and nursery management. T. J. Lam reviewed the application of endocrinilgy to fish culture in 1982. Hormonal intervention of seed production can result in (1) year round supply of fry, (2) accelereted larval development and metamorphosis, which save on cost of hatchery operation, and (3) production of monosex individuals that are faster growing and which reduce <b>rearing</b> <b>cost.</b> The quantity and quality of seed supply will determine the extent of development, whether by expansion in area by intensification of culture. The present source of seeds in many areas is still largely from the wild which is inadequate, uncertain, and threatened by coastal pollution. M ilkfish farming, for instance, in the Philippines and Indinesia alone covers olny 400, 000 hectares but the seeds come entirely from the wild. In 1983 the Asia-Pacific region produced 8. 4 million metric tons from aquaculture, and contributed 82 % of the total aquaculture production for that year. As the developing countries of the region go into industrialization and coastal pollution is increased, the natural supply of seed will have to depend largely on artificial breeding...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} part of a dairy farm is the rearing of young stock. This {{has to be done}} accurately, not only because the new dairy cows will replace the old ones, but also as a lot of money is involved. This has become clear in previous research, which has shown that the successful rearing of one heifer costs € 1. 540. This is 13 % of the cost price of milk. 9 To gain more understanding in young stock rearing costs, 40 farms from the Veterinary Centre Zuid-Oost Drenthe were visited. During this visit, calculations of young stock rearing costs were made with the spreadsheet Jonkos from, among others, WUR Livestock Research. In this study, the average of the young stock rearing costs on the visited farms was € 1. 967 per heifer, with costs ranging from € 919 to € 3. 307. It was also shown that increased scaling is beneficial for costs. An increase in scaling factors researched led to a lower total young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> per heifer. An increase in milk production (β=- 0, 337; P= 0, 028), the number of dairy cows (β=- 0, 360; P= 0, 037) or the number of young stock (β=- 0, 435; P= 0. 009) were all significant factors leading to reduction of costs. The age at first calving (AFC) was vice versa: a increase in AFC lead to a significant rise in the rearing costs per heifer (β= 0, 551; P= 0, 001). Comparing the net returns from the heifers with the AFC (P= 0, 109) also showed a remarkable result, namely that there was no significant link between the two. This is surprising, as a lot of farmers claim to experience otherwise. The net returns of the heifers compared with the score of the veterinarian was shown to be almost significant (P= 0, 054), suggesting that a higher level of management skills may lead to an increase in the net returns...|$|E
40|$|The {{costs of}} rearing young dairy cattle {{are a part}} of the cost of the price of milk, as rearing {{produces}} the future dairy cows. As most dairy farmers are not aware of the rearing costs, the rearing of dairy replacements often does not get the attention it deserves. Calculating the distribution of the rearing costs throughout the rearing process is difficult as the costs are correlated with biological processes, such as variation in growth rate and disease uncertainty. In this study, a calf level simulation model was built to estimate the rearing costs and their distribution from 2 weeks of age until first calving in the Netherlands. The uncertainties related to calf diseases (calf scours and bovine respiratory disease) were included, in which both the probabilities of disease and the effects of diseases (growth reduction) differ at different ages. In addition, growth was modeled stochastically and in a detailed manner using a two-phase growth function. The total cost of rearing young dairy cattle was estimated as € 1567 per successfully reared heifer and varied between € 1423 and € 1715. Reducing the age of first calving by 1 month reduced the total cost between 2. 6 % and 5. 7 %. The difference in the average cost of rearing between heifers that calved at 24 months and those calving at 30 months was € 400 per heifer reared. Average rearing costs were especially influenced by labor efficiency and cost of feed. The rearing costs of a heifer that experienced disease at least once (20 % of the simulated heifers) were on average € 95 higher than those of healthy heifers. Hence, for an individual diseased heifer, disease costs can be rather high, while the relative contribution to the average <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> for a standard Dutch dairy farm is low (approx. 3 %). Overall, the model developed proved to be a useful tool to investigate the total cost of rearing young dairy cattle, providing insights to dairy farmers with respect to the cost-efficiency of their own rearing managemen...|$|E

Information on the key factors influencing the cost of rearing under different management systems is, however, limited and many farmers are unaware of their true costs. This study determined the cost of rearing heifers from birth to first calving in Great Britain including the cost of mortality, investigated the main factors influencing these costs across differing farming systems and estimated {{how long it took}} heifers to repay the cost of rearing on individual farms. Primary data on heifer management from birth to calving was collected through a survey of 101 dairy farms during 2013. Univariate followed by multivariable linear regression was used to analyse the influence of farm factors and key rearing events on costs. An Excel spreadsheet model was developed to determine the time it took for heifers to repay the <b>rearing</b> <b>cost.</b> The mean±SD ages at weaning, conception and calving were 62 ± 13, 509 ± 60 and 784 ± 60 days. The mean total cost of rearing was £ 1819 ± 387 /heifer with a mean daily cost of £ 2. 31 ± 0. 41. This included the opportunity cost of the heifer and the mean cost of mortality, which ranged from £ 103. 49 to £ 146. 19 /surviving heifer. The multivariable model predicted an increase in mean cost of rearing of £ 2. 87 for each extra day of age at first calving and a decrease in mean cost of £ 6. 06 for each percentile increase in time spent at grass. The model also predicted a decrease in the mean cost of rearing in autumn and spring calving herds of £ 273. 20 and £ 288. 56, respectively, compared with that in all-year-round calving herds. Farms with herd sizes⩾ 100 had lower mean costs of between £ 301. 75 and £ 407. 83 compared with farms with < 100 milking cows. The mean gross margin per heifer was £ 441. 66 ± 304. 56 (range £ 367. 63 to £ 1120. 08), with 11 farms experiencing negative gross margins. Most farms repaid the cost of heifer rearing in the first two lactations (range 1 to 6 lactations) with a mean time from first calving until breaking even of 530 ± 293 days.

After 6 months, mean survival was 69 %, the smallest surviving fish weighed 197 mg at tagging, and success in tag reading was 79 % for the size class 300 - 400 mg after 63 days. No negative effects were observed on growth and most deaths occurred within 15 days after tagging with a first peak after 5 days but that did not particularly affect the smallest individuals. Differences in swimming responses were detected between tagged fish and untagged controls immediately after the surgical procedure with tagged fish swimming more than controls for 45 min. However, after 21 days, the tagged fish swam less than the untagged controls after being placed in the observation tank for 1 h and 45 min. At 42 days post-tagging, no further differences were observed. Overall, results suggested that the tagging method was suitable for fish as small as 400 mg and 36 mm in total length. This type of early tagging method is invaluable for the longitudinal monitoring of individual biological traits (e. g., growth) or for repeated assays with the same individual at distinct time points (e. g., behavior studies). We used it for a first evaluation of early growth differentiation between sexes and demonstrated a 31 % mass gain difference in females that was visible as soon as the fish reached 105 days old. This confirms the potential of the method for the selection of early-expressed character traits which could lead to <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> savings for the aquaculture research field.

40|$|A three-year field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the tolerance and compensatory response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) to injury caused by the sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (F.). Two mechanisms of within-plant tolerance/compensation were observed. Stem injured plants produced ca. 0. 69 more tillers than uninjured plants, while tillers with leaf and leaf sheath injury produced larger panicles, up to 39. 5 % and 21. 0 % heavier than uninjured tillers, when injury occurred at 3 rd tiller stage and at panicle differentiation, respectively. A 2 -year field cage experiment was conducted to determine the biological control potential of Cotesia flavipes (Cameron) against the sugarcane borer on rice. The effective search rate was 49 cm 2 ground area (2. 2 tillers) parasitoid- 1 day- 1. A cohortbased age-structured model was developed to simulate the population dynamics and economic value of the sugarcane borer and C. flavipes in rice, as affected by overwintering larval density, timing and rate of parasitoid aerial release, and year-to-year climate (temperature and rainfall). The results suggest C. flavipes was most effective when released during the 1 st sugarcane borer generation. The maximum simulated economic benefit ($ 112. 05 ha- 1) was ca. 7. 8 % of that provided by insecticide-based control. The inability of C. flavipes to provide economic control in temperate-subtropical areas is due to its high <b>rearing</b> <b>cost,</b> a low effective search rate, a low maximum rate of parasitism per female, and both spatial and temporal asynchrony of parasitoid emergence with the larval hosts. The biocontrol capability of Trichogramma galloi Zucchi was also simulated. The maximum economic benefit provided by T. galloi was $ 1128. 75 ha- 1, ca. 79. 0 % of that provided by insecticide-based control. Theoretical {{analyses were conducted to}} estimate the effectiveness of augmentative releases, using data from previous studies of parasitism of lepidopteran pests by hymenopteran parasitoids with host and parasitoid density as factors. The maximum daily parasitism per female was highest for parasitoids that attack exposed larvae, followed by parasitoids that attack eggs, semi-exposed larvae, and concealed larvae. Simulation analyses were conducted to estimate the population dynamics and economic value of D. saccharalis, herein used as a model host, and each of 5 parasitoid categories (solitary parasitoids that attack eggs, exposed larvae, and semi-exposed larvae, gregarious parasitoids that attack eggs and concealed larvae) in rice, as affected by overwintering larval density, timing of parasitoid release, and year-to-year climate. Among the 13, 500 simulations that were conducted, 480 (3. 6 %) provided a greater economic value than insecticide-based control. All 480 simulations were obtained using solitary parasitoids that attack exposed or semi-exposed larvae. Solitary egg parasitoids provided an average of 42. 2 % of the economic value provided by insecticide-based control when released 30 days after planting. Gregarious parasitoids that attack eggs or concealed larvae provided almost no positive economic benefit. For parasitoid species that do not overwinter successfully in areas where they are released or that exhibit temporal or spatial asynchrony with their host early in the spring, our results suggest augmentative biological control is only effective for solitary parasitoids that attack either exposed or semi-exposed larvae, with current rearing, shipping and release costs...|$|E

Linear production functions in the labor input and standard <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> are also considered. First, we study under which conditions the successive cohorts will be given the same consumption per capita. We show that this egalitarian rule is optimal whatever the degree of altruism when life spans are infinite. However, when life spans are finite, this rule can only be optimal in the Benthamite case, i. e. when the degree of altruism is maximal. Second, we prove that under finite life spans the Millian welfare function leads to optimal extinction at finite time whatever the lifetime. In contrast, the Benthamite case is much more involved: for isoelastic utility functions, it gives rise to two threshold lifetime values, say T 0 Optimal population size, Benthamite Vs Millian criterion, finite lives, optimal extinction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{economic}} feasibility of water buffalo rearing under rough wet grassland conditions in Germany. Our analysis was based mainly on data from one of Germany's largest water buffalo herds, which was kept by the landscape preservation farm »Gut Darß«. To check a variety of cost-benefit constellations, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation. The overall <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> per cow totalled 1 039 € a- 1. The direct marketing yields per bull ranged from 3 797 € to 5 298 €. The costs of direct marketing were not generally taken into account because of the high degree of variation and specificity of this position. Reproductive performance, e. g. calf-to-calf interval, was found to have the highest impact on overall economic performance. Our results suggest that water buffalo rearing in Germany has the potential to be economically feasible, at least if direct marketing. Additionally, we conclude that reproductive performance has a major impact on the feasibility of th...|$|R
40|$|Results of rearing upriver bright fall {{chinook salmon}} juveniles in net pens and a barrier net {{enclosure}} in two backwater areas and a pond along the Columbia River {{were compared with}} traditional hatchery methods. Growth, smoltification, and general condition of pen-reared fish receiving supplemental feeding were better than those of fish reared using traditional methods. Juvenile fish receiving no supplemental feeding were generally in poor condition resulting in {{a net loss of}} production. <b>Rearing</b> <b>costs</b> using pens were generally lower than in the hatchery. However, low adult returns resulted in greater cost per adult recovery than fish reared and released using traditional methods. Much of the differences in recovery rates may have been due to differences in rearing locations, as study sites were as much as 128 mi upstream from the hatcheries and study fish may have incurred higher mortality associated with downstream migration than control fish. Fish reared using these methods could be a cost-effective method of enhancing salmon production in the Columbia River Basin...|$|R
40|$|Kid rearing {{strategies}} {{are a key}} to continuous supply of milk to Dairies and reduction of kid <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> that will also optimize farmer’s income by increasing by-products and maintaining the beautiful cultural landscape in Norway. Traditionally goats are bred for kidding around February and supply milk to Dairies according to quota. As a result of concentrated kidding, there is uneven supply to Dairies. In addition, farmers prioritize kid rearing of replacement stock and lay off the others kid at birth. Therefore, study I evaluated dam kid rearing methods on natural pasture, and also assessed the effect of increasing the grazing hours on milk yield, kid growth and milk composition. Goat behavior and feed selection pattern of dam {{in each of the}} grazing systems were also studied. To offer alternative kid rearing system, automatic suckling machines were also evaluated to increase milk supplies for goats kidding in periods of short milk supplies in study II. Unlike focusing only on kid growth, kid rearing methods need to focus on farmer’s available milk. Traditional kid suckling methods used by dairy goat farmers in Tanzania were also evaluated in Study III for farmers’ available milk and kid growth. Traditional methods of one teat milking and one teat suckling twice a day; and once milking and whole day kid suckling were evaluated along with twice milking and kid bottle feeding. Though household milk utilization is the driving force for promotion of goat milk interventions for human nutrition, goat milk utilization is a challenge for goat milk interventions. Study IV was conducted on Likoma Island which has a tradition of milking local goats in Malawi to identify the missing link for goat milk utilization in goat milk interventions. In experiment I, none suckling goats gave 42 % more milk than suckling does in year 1 and 38 % more in year two. Kid growth rates were similar for one and two kids reared by the dam in year two (162 g/day vs 158 g/day) and (172 g/day vs 162 g/day) in year one. While in experiment II, day and night grazing gave 14 % more and higher kid growth rates. In experiment III, pre-weaning kid growth rates were higher for dam reared kids but automatic suckling gave comparable post weaning kid growth rates on pasture. In experiment IV, twice milking and bottle feeding resulted in loss of 55 % of farmer’s milk as compared to one teat milking and one teat suckling twice a days and 47 % loss compared to once milking and suckling whole day in year one. Similar losses were observed in year two, at 49 % and 64 % as compared to one teat milking and one teat suckling; and once a day milking and suckling kid whole day respectively. Finally, experiment V, showed that goat milking found its niche in a cultural context where the tea culture expresses both local identity and social motivation. Goat milk in tea enhances both the social – and nutritional – value of the tea and the cultural values within the community. It is therefore concluded that dam kid rearing is profitable for better quality milk delivery to Dairies and labor saving on kid rearing which can offer extra income from sales of goat kids. March kidding also ensures even supply of milk to Dairies. Moreover, adopting day and night grazing for dam kid rearing on mountain pasture would optimize utilization, allow for better kid growth rates and offers high milk yield. Where farmers have lactating goats in winter, automatic suckling machine offers alternative rearing method of replacement stock which allow for high milk supplies when prices are high. In support of dairy improvement programs in the tropics, traditional suckling regimes of once a day milking offers high amounts of farmer’s available milk. Where fresh supplies of milk are required for household use, one teat milking and one teat suckling is beneficial. The study also highlights the significance of cultural, social and environmental context of dairy goat interventions for sustainability and utilization of livestock interventions...|$|E

40|$|Progress {{over the}} past 30 years has {{revealed}} many strengths of the rainbow trout as an alternative model for environmental carcinogenesis research. These include low <b>rearing</b> <b>costs,</b> an early life-stage ultrasensitive bioassay, sensitivity to many classes of carcinogen, a well-described tumor pathology, responsiveness to tumor promoters and inhibitors, and a mechanistically informative nonmammalian comparative status. Low-cost husbandry, for example, has permitted statistically challenging tumor study designs with up to 10, 000 trout to investigate the quantitative interrelationships among carcinogen dose, anticarcinogen dose, DNA adduct formation, and final tumor outcome. The basic elements of the trout carcinogen bioassay include multiple exposure routes, carcinogen response, husbandry requirements, and pathology. The principal known neoplasms occur in liver (mixed hepatocellular/cholangiocellular adenoma and carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma), kidney (nephroblastoma), swim bladder (adenopapilloma), and stomach (adenopapilloma). Trout possess a complex but incompletely characterized array of cytochromes P 450, transferases, and other enzymic systems for phase and phase 11 procarcinogen metabolism. In general, trout exhibit only limited capacity for DNA repair, especially for removal of bulky DNA adducts. This factor, together with a high capacity for P 450 bioactivation and negligibl...|$|R

40|$|Fibrolytic {{bacteria}} {{were isolated}} from the rumen of North American moose (Alces alces), which eat a high-fiber diet of woody browse. It was hypothesized that fibrolytic bacteria iso-lated from the moose rumen {{could be used as}} probiotics to improve fiber degradation and animal production. Thirty-one isolates (Bacillus, n = 26; Paenibacillus, n = 1; and Staphylo-coccus, n = 4) were cultured from moose rumen digesta samples collected in Vermont. Using Sanger sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene, culturing techniques, and optical densi-ties, isolates were identified and screened for biochemical properties important to plant car-bohydrate degradation. Five isolates were selected as candidates for use as a probiotic, which was administered daily to neonate lambs for 9 weeks. It was hypothesized that regu-lar administration of a probiotic to improve fibrolysis to neonate animals through weaning would increase the developing rumen bacterial diversity, increase animal production, and allow for long-term colonization of the probiotic species. Neither weight gain nor wool quality was improved in lambs given a probiotic, however, dietary efficiency was increased as evi-denced by the reduced feed intake (and <b>rearing</b> <b>costs)</b> without a loss to weight gain.
