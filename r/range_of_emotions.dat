Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media {{as one of the most}} talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> on screen.|$|E

She {{published}} about 20 essays, 100 poems, and a book of her collected poems, from 1855 to 1868 (the book was published posthumously). Early work was devoted to family and after her marriage, her poetry and essays featured Jewish themes.

Her collection Infelicia went through several editions and was in print until 1902. In the late nineteenth century, critics were hard on women writers, and Menken's public notoriety caused even more critical scrutiny of her poems. Later critics (such as A. R. Lloyd in his book, 'The Great Prize Fight' and Graham Gordon in his book 'Master of the Ring') generally dismiss her work as being devoid of talent. However, admirers included Christina Rossetti and Joaquin Miller.|$|E
25|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} would later reprise {{their roles in}} The Simpsons. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Abraham Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show. In the shorts, his voice is a loose impression of Walter Matthau, whereas it is more robust and humorous on the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions.</b> Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta as well as Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge, rather than hire more actors. Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith performed the voices of Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson respectively.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, the Lakers {{beat the}} Warriors 118–116, but Bryant {{left with a}} torn Achilles tendon that ended his season and was {{expected}} to sideline him for six to nine months. Bryant had injured both of his knees after collisions with the Warriors' Festus Ezeli in the third quarter, but he played every minute before leaving with 3:06 left in the game. He finished with 34 points, and Gasol had 26 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for his sixth career triple-double. Howard had 28 points, making 14 of 22 free throws. Bryant's injury came while he was playing seven consecutive quarters and at least 40 minutes for seven consecutive games. He was averaging his most minutes (38.6) in six years, and only Portland rookie Damian Lillard was averaging more minutes. Kupchak had spoken to Bryant about his extensive playing time 10 days earlier, but Bryant insisted the minutes needed to continue given the Lakers' playoff push. Frustrated by his injury, Bryant expressed a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions</b> while ranting on Facebook {{in the middle of}} the night.|$|E
50|$|Love, {{sexual desire}} and {{attachment}} are each described as separate constructs, and each is aptly associated with particular behaviours, hormonal influences and brain regions.

Despite {{the fact that she}} can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her dropping her usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration classroom to practice for tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. She promises Harry she would do everything in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an auror, and she keeps her promise. Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotions,</b> which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.|$|E
