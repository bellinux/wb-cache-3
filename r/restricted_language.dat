Possible {{combinations}} of these phonological segments include: V, CV, VC, and CVC (where V = vowel and C = consonant). Ura’s root-initial segments can contain up to two vowels in a row, with the first vowel being a non-high vowel (/e/, /o/, and /a/), and the second vowel being a high vowel (/i/ and /u/) to make the following combinations: /ei/, /eu/, /oi/, /ou/, /ai/, and /au/. /y/ and /w/ can be followed {{by any of the}} five syllables, with the exception of /wu/. In addition, the majority of non-verbal roots begin with consonants, while most verbal roots begin with vowels, with the majority of these being high vowels. On the other hand, root-final segments exclude /v/, /f/, /h/, and /γ/ fricatives as well as consonant clusters from the root-final position. These rules are an example of how Ura is a more <b>restricted</b> <b>language</b> than Sye (Crowley, 1999).|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged, among present-day corpus linguists working on registers and genres, {{that the notion}} of register has Firthian sources and more generally that it originates from British contextualism regarded as « the only tradition that suggests this kind of direct correlation between the functional organization of meaning in language and the organization of context. » (Eggins et Martin 1997 : 239). In particular, one of Firth’s (1890 - 1960) papers «Personality and language in society » proposing categories for analyzing contextually situated language events, has been often invoked. American ethnographs of communication and sociolinguists, such as Hymes and Gumperz (1972), inspired by Firth’s notions of context of situation and speech community, also claimed their affiliation to this text. However, it can be shown that there is a second Firthian source, the notion of <b>restricted</b> <b>languages,</b> which has hardly been mentioned 2. Apart from Mitchell (1957), Halliday (b. 1925) is the only Neo-Firthian to include <b>restricted</b> <b>languages</b> in his sociosemiotic approach where he mentions them as closed registers or specialized languages (see for example Halliday et. al 1964; Halliday 1978; Halliday 1991).

40|$|Current transactifying compilers for {{unmanaged}} environments (e. g., {{systems software}} written in C/C++) target only word-based software transactional memories (STMs) because the compiler can-not easily infer {{whether it is}} safe to transform a transactional access to a certain memory location in an object-based way. To use object-based STMs in these environments, programmers must use explicit calls to the STM or use a <b>restricted</b> <b>language</b> dialect, both of which are not practical. In this paper, we show how an existing pointer analysis can be used to let a transactifying compiler for C/C++ use object-based accesses whenever this is possible and safe, while falling back to word-based accesses otherwise. Programmers do not need to provide any annotations and do not have to use a <b>restricted</b> <b>language.</b> Our evaluation also shows that an object-based STM can be significantly faster than a word-based STM with an otherwise identical design and implementation, even if the parameters of the latter have been tuned. 1...|$|E
