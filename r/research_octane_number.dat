In the agricultural year 2007 – 2008, one conducted several researches on sugar beet fermentation process {{in order to obtain}} bioethanol, using sugar beet as main biological raw material. The biotechnology for obtaining alcohol out of sugar beet was developed on three stages:- sugar beet preparation for fermentation;- yeast cultures obtaining;- sugar beet leaven fermentation. The ethanol samples obtained from each of the experimental lots of the experimental field have been analyzed in the Environmental Analysis Laboratory from the Research Institute for Analytical Instrumentation Cluj-Napoca. Therefore, one has determined all the characteristics of each bioethanol sample, according to the requirements of SR EN 15376 standard, in terms of using the bioethanol obtained during the carried out research as a component of automobile fuel, according to SR EN 228 : 2008 standard; one has also determined the superior caloric power, as well as the Motor and <b>Research</b> <b>Octane</b> <b>Numbers.</b> For an efficient alcoholic fermentation, one must comply with several conditions, such as: proper root grooming, before crushing, a temperature of the dilution water of 80 – 85 oC,as well as a temperature around 30 oC inside the fermentation instalation.

40|$|Extents of {{reactant}} consumption {{have been}} measured {{during the course}} of spontaneous ignition following rapid compression of N-pentane and N-heptane and also of PRF 60 (N-heptane = i-octane, 2. 2. 4 trimethylpentane) in stoichiometric mixtures with air. Compressed gas temperatures of 720 - 750 K and 845 - 875 K were studied at reactant densities of 131 mol m{sup minus 3 }. At the lower gas temperature {{there was no evidence of}} reactant consumption {{during the course of}} the compression stroke. Two-stage ignition occurred at these temperatures, but only modest proportions of n-pentane were consumed during the first stage (< 15 %) whereas about 40 % of proportions of n- heptane reacted under the same conditions. At the higher compressed gas temperature the oxidation of n-pentane began only after the piston had stopped, whereas more than 30 % of the n-heptane had already been consumed in the final stage of the compression stroke. The behavior of the PRF 60 mixture differed somewhat from that of N- pentane despite the similarly of the <b>research</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> Although there was a preferential oxidation of n-heptane at T{sub c} = 850 K, which persisted throughout the early development of spontaneous ignition during the post-compression period, oxidation of both components of the PRF 60 mixture began before the piston had stopped.

40|$|International audienceThe {{low-temperature}} oxidation of {{the five}} hexane isomers (n-hexane, 2 -methyl-pentane, 3 -methyl-pentane, 2, 2 -dimethyl-butane, and 2, 3 -dimethyl-butane) was studied in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) at atmospheric pressure under stoichiometric conditions between 550 and 1000 K. The evolution of reactant and product mole fraction profiles were recorded {{as a function of}} the temperature using two analytical methods: gas chromatography and synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). Experimental data obtained with both methods were in good agreement for the five fuels. These data were used to compare the reactivity and the nature of the reaction products and their distribution. At low temperature (below 800 K), n-hexane was the most reactive isomer. The two methyl-pentane isomers have about the same reactivity, which was lower than that of n-hexane. 2, 2 -Dimethyl-butane was less reactive than the two methyl-pentane isomers, and 2, 3 -dimethyl-butane was the least reactive isomer. These observations are in good agreement with <b>research</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> given in the literature. Cyclic ethers with rings including 3, 4, 5, and 6 atoms have been identified and quantified for the five fuels. While the cyclic ether distribution was notably more detailed than in other literature of JSR studies of branched alkane oxidation, some oxiranes were missing among the cyclic ethers expected from methyl-pentanes. Using SVUV-PIMS, the formation of C 2 -C 3 monocarboxylic acids, ketohydroperoxides, and species with two carbonyl groups have also been observed, supporting their possible formation from branched reactants. This is in line with what was previously experimentally demonstrated from linear fuels. Possible structures and ways of decomposition of the most probable ketohydroperoxides were discussed. Above 800 K, all five isomers have about the same reactivity, with a larger formation from branched alkanes of some unsaturated species, such as allene and propyne, which are known to be soot precursors...|$|R

40|$|The air {{pollution}} that is occurring currently is main by {{caused by the}} use of motor vehicle that consequently it lead to the increasing fuel consumptions as the main source enrgy for transportation equipment. The fuel that is used in the vehicle comes in several types. In the market its differences show by the <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> that can contribute different effect to the environment due to their combustion processes. The road conditions through which the vehicles move are the major factors that can trigger the growth of pollution to the surrounding. It is predicted that about 70 % of the {{air pollution}}s is caused by the motor vehicle emissions. This research was fully conducted in the laboratorium. Three types of fuel with different <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> were used in this <b>research.</b> Premium with <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> 88, Pertamax with <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> 92, and Biopertamax with <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> 91. The engine speeds were also varied from 500 rpm, 1000 rpm, 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm, 2500 rpm, 3000 rpm, 3500 rpm, to 4000 rpm. For every type of fuel, the engine was run five times for every engine speed in order to obtain the exhausted gas characteristics from the vehicles to the environment. The result of the research shows that at engine speed of 2500 rpm the CO emission for each type of fuel : Premium with <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> 88 is 0, 415 %, Pertamax with <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> 92 is 0, 556 %, and Biopertamax with <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> 91 is 0, 273 %.

In comparisan to with the vehicle speed on the road from secondary data to represent the engine speed in the laboratorium, and assuming that the traffic density is identical to a factor that determining engine speed, it can be concluded that the air pollution by CO emission due to the characteristics of the road has negative influence.

40|$|A new {{two-step process}} of the sulfuric acid catalyzed {{alkylation}} of isobutane with butenes was investigated. A sealed batch reactor and feed charging system was employed to produce the intermediates and to {{study the effects of}} the various process variables. Process variables investigated include the molar acid-to-olefin ratio (A/O), isobutane-to-olefin ratio (I/O), temperature, agitation, and acid composition. The properties of conjunct polymers, acid-soluble hydrocarbons produced via olefin polymerization reactions, were studied for three different sulfuric acid catalysts. ^ In the first step of the sequence, the desired reactions are between H 2 SO 4 and n-butene to form s-butyl sulfates; equilibrium mixtures containing di-s-butyl sulfate (DBS), s-butyl hydrogen sulfate (MBS), n-butene, and H 2 SO 4 resulted. In the second step, the desired reactions are between the s-butyl sulfates produced in the first step, sulfuric acid, and isobutane to form trimethylpentanes. The alkylates produced were of exceptionally high qualities, <b>research</b> <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> (RON) of up to 101. Isobutylene polymerized during first-step reactions, resulting in mostly C 12, C 16, and C 20 unsaturated hydrocarbons. These unsaturated hydrocarbons in the second step formed a relatively low quality alkylate with a RON of about 90. ^ The DBS and MBS intermediates were produced at A/O ratios of 0. 15 to 0. 75 and were identified using proton magnetic resonance, infrared absorption, hydrolyses, and mass balances. At A/O ratios up to 0. 75, the intermediate products were stable at temperatures up to at least 30 ∘C. The composition of the mixtures were strongly dependent on the A/O ratios and on the water content of the phases. Other variables affecting first-step reactions were temperature and I/O ratio; DBS is soluble in isobutane. ^ In the second step (A/O ratios of 5 to 10), the quality of the alkylate was strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. At - 20 to - 15 ∘C, alkylates were produced with RON 2 ̆ 7 s of 100 to 101. At higher temperatures, however, some of the s-butyl sulfates decomposed, resulting in alkylates with lower qualities. ^ Several commercial applications of the results are proposed. These proposals will reduce both the energy requirements and acid consumption for the new alkylation process. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> by the two laboratory methods requires a standard engine, and the test procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming. The standard engine required for the test {{may not always be}} available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories.

Such methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers (ASTM D-2885) and others. Deriving an equation {{that can be used for}} calculating the octane quality would also serve the same purpose with added advantages. The term Octane Index is often used to refer to the calculated octane quality in contradistinction to the (measured) <b>research</b> or motor <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> The <b>octane</b> index can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, cracked gasoline etc. These different grades are considered as one group when blending to meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their anti-knock quality. The ability to predict the octane quality of the blends prior to blending is essential, something for which the calculated octane index is specially suited.|$|R

This work explores the oxidation behavior of two oxygenated certification gasoline fuels and the variation of fuel reactivity with molecular composition. Ignition delay times of Haltermann (RON =[*] 91) and Coryton (RON =[*] 97. 5) gasolines have been measured in a high-pressure shock tube and in a rapid compression machine at three pressures of 10, 20 and 40  bar, at equivalence ratios of φ[*]=[*] 0. 45, 0. 9 and 1. 8, and in the temperature range of 650 – 1250  K.

To simulate the reactivity of these gasolines, three kinds of surrogates, consisting of three, four and eight components, are proposed and compared with the gasoline ignition delay times. It is shown that more complex surrogate mixtures are needed to emulate the reactivity of gasoline with higher octane sensitivity (S = RON–MON).

40|$|The {{functional}} relationship of autoignition delay time with temperature and pressure is employed to derive the propagation velocities of autoignitive reaction fronts for particular reactivity gradients, once autoignition has been initiated. In {{the present study}} {{of a variety of}} premixtures, with different {{functional relationship}}s, such gradients comprise fixed initial temperature gradients. The smaller is the ratio of the acoustic speed through the mixture to the localised velocity of the autoignitive front, the greater are the amplitude and frequency of the induced pressure wave. This might lead to damaging engine knock. At higher values of the ratio, the autoignition can be benign with only small over-pressures.

The subsection on engine management looks at possible methods of altering and eliminating autoignition. Chapter Four details the equipment used to obtain data and measurements, as well as the signal conditioning of the spark and injector signal. Chapter Five {{discusses the}} actual results obtained during summer testing of the different methods of altering and eliminating autoignition in an internal combustion engine, as derived from the theories presented in Chapter Three. The summer tests finally verified the new application level and showed that only a reduction in the quantity of fuel injected can eliminate autoignition. However, a slight decrease in heat release does cause an increase in start time. In Chapter Six, based on the test results, a simulation model which calculates the probability of autoignition in a 1. 4 l (Econo) engine during hot start conditions in Matlab/Simulink was developed. This simulation model satisfactorily verified test result...|$|R
40|$|Dimerization {{of linear}} olefins {{represents}} an attractive route {{for the production}} of high <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> blending components. The oligomerization needs not only to be high conversion and to produce mainly dimers but also to be selective within the dimer range, as only certain isomers have advantageous blending <b>octane</b> <b>numbers.</b> Moreover, the <b>octane</b> <b>numbers</b> of these dimers blend in a highly nonlinear fashion. Normally the focus for such gasoline polymerization processes is on maximizing branching; however, in this study we seek to maximize the fraction of allylic hydrogens, because we have shown that these are directly linked to the blending <b>octane</b> <b>number</b> of the species. 1 -Butene and 2 -butene produce different quality dimer gasoline. This unexpected result can be explained from a consideration of the isomerization kinetics between the butene monomers...|$|R
