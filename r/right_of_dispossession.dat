40|$|Dispossession {{has long}} been a concept {{pervasive}} in the work of scholars and activistsseeking to describe, analyse and challenge racial capitalism. To be dispossessed of one’s home, land, territory, means of subsistence, history, language, and sense of self has been a defining experience of much of the world’s population in the modern era. The global reaches of imperialism have not been relegated to a distant past, but are a networked legacy that is instrumental in shaping contemporary forms of modernity.  Yet the acceleration <b>of</b> <b>dispossession,</b> and the extension of its grasp in contemporary late capitalism has produced its own cultural logics, affects and ways of being, which we refer to as ‘cultures of dispossession’. By cultures <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> we seek to highlight the normalized practices <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> that cannot be singly located in an economic, social or legal register. Cultural forms and formations <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> reflect the uneven impact of several hundred years of capitalist accumulation, centralised through the agent of the possessive individual and its corollary, the subject (always-already) ontologically and politically dispossessed of the capacity to appropriate and own, to be self-determining. The racialised and gendered formations that constitute the primary focus of the essays herein, are not contingent but are constitutive <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> – as it unfolds across material, social, psychic and juridical fields.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to advance a {{theoretical}} framework for the comparative study <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> by explaining how the political economy <b>of</b> land <b>dispossession</b> has transformed from state-led developmentalism to neoliberalism in India. The dissertation compares the archetypical forms <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> in each period and argues that they constitute different regimes <b>of</b> <b>dispossession.</b> A regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> is an institutionalized way of expropriating landed assets from their current owners or users. Each regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> is distinguished by: 1) a set of purposes for which a state is willing to dispossess land and 2) a way of producing compliance to that dispossession. Under different regimes, dispossession facilitates different kinds of accumulation with variable developmental consequences. These consequences crucially effect the long-term political stability of a regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession.</b> Between independence in 1947 and economic liberalization in the early 1990 s, India operated under a developmentalist regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession.</b> Under this regime, the Indian state dispossessed land for state-led industrial and infrastructural projects, ensuring compliance through coercion and powerful ideological appeals to national development. This dispossession facilitated productive agrarian and industrial accumulation that disproportionately benefited the industrial bourgeoisie, big farmers, and the public sector elite, but also delivered some benefits to other classes. This development was, however, based on the impoverishment of {{tens of millions of}} people that it dispossessed. For many decades, this regime was able to convince a wide public that such dispossession constituted a necessary sacrifice for "the nation. " Social movements in the 1970 s and 1980 s challenged this view, but they could not substantially impede dispossession before the developmentalist regime gave way to economic liberalization. Economic liberalization in the early 1990 s generated a transition to a new neoliberal regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> in which state governments restructured themselves as land brokers for private capital. No longer just dispossessing land for state-led industrial and infrastructural projects, states turned to dispossessing peasants for private real estate. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are the archetype of this regime. Based on 19 months of ethnographic research on one of the first large SEZs in North India, this dissertation illustrates the character and consequences of this neoliberal regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession.</b> First, it argues that dispossessing land for SEZs lacks legitimacy, fuelling "land wars"; however, states may be able to generate material compliance among some farmers by absorbing them into real estate markets. Second, it argues that dispossessing land for SEZs facilitates real estate and knowledge-intensive accumulation that benefits a narrow set of class interests, while disaccumulating agrarian assets and marginalizing rural labor. Third, it argues that the major economic effect of this accumulation is real estate speculation, which generates unequal and involutionary agrarian change that leaves the majority of the dispossessed impoverished. The result is "dispossession without development. " The dissertation concludes that India's neoliberal regime <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> will remain politically tenuous. It ends by outlining a comparative research program on the sociology <b>of</b> <b>dispossession.</b> By integrating land <b>dispossession</b> into theories <b>of</b> capitalist development, the theory <b>of</b> regimes <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> fills an absence in development sociology and reconstructs Marxist theories of "primitive accumulation," enhancing our understanding of states, economic development, agrarian change, and rural politics...|$|R

It examines how {{the changes in}} land tenure, access and rights to land {{as a consequence of}} HIV/AIDS are affecting agricultural productivity, food security and poverty, with a specific focus on women who have lost their husbands to HIV/AIDS in Zvimba. Zvimba is a village community located in Zvimba District in the Mashonaland West Province of Zimbabwe. The study also discusses policy responses designed to cushion the impact of HIV/AIDS on local communities especially women living with HIV/AIDS. The study highlights the vulnerability of widows to land rights violations, mainly inflicted by relatives but sometimes by the wider community. The main form of abuse encountered included the use of abusive language, threats of evictions and at times, beatings. The legal route for seeking redress was rarely used. Fear of witchcraft, low educational levels and fear of causing conflict between children and their paternal relatives also led widows to abandon the fight for their rights. The study further reveals that widows are heavily exposed to <b>dispossession</b> <b>of</b> their land <b>rights.</b> HIV/AIDS has increased the vulnerability of widows and other women to threats and <b>dispossession</b> <b>of</b> their land and other property <b>rights.</b> <b>Dispossession</b> <b>of</b> arable fields was observed in the four wards. The dispossessions and threats to livelihoods were directly related to the HIV positive status of the widows.

Having as a benchmark psychoanalytical theories, it is noticed that the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis caused in Puga a feeling <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> <b>of</b> the body, which is reinforced when she finds difficult to communicate or express her suffering. Focusing on the process of writing, it is shown that while in the first entries Puga depicts herself as a passive and silent character, such conception changes as she continues writing about her experience of pain. At the end of the book, Puga represents herself not only as a writer in pain, but of pain. The aim is to demonstrate that, in Diary of Pain, although the feeling <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> leads to an explicit figuration of a disembodied subject, María Luisa Puga does embody her writing through her own literary voice...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} postcrisis geographies in Southern Europe are intrinsically {{related to}} debt and dispossession. In Spain, mortgage homeownership and indebtedness led to housing dispossessions, while in Greece, skyrocketing private indebtedness is eventually arranged through housing foreclosures. Building upon the notion <b>of</b> accumulation by <b>dispossession,</b> i. e., {{on the way}} capital accumulates wealth {{in the era of}} neoliberal globalization, this article elaborates two novel concepts to understand the housing crises in both countries. The perception <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> by odious taxation describes the process of wealth extraction facilitated by financial mechanisms in Greece, and dispossession by political fraud is conceived as a characterization of fraudulent political arrangements and financial tools used for orchestrating housing stealth in Spain. This nurtures the perception that a comparative insight on the processes <b>of</b> <b>dispossession</b> in the Spanish and Greek housing markets may facilitate a nuanced understanding over the interrelated processes of contemporary housing restructuring...|$|R

3000|$|The {{introduction}} of taxes gave greater impetus to {{the integration of}} pastoralists and the Borana into the colonial economy. In colonial Kenya, direct taxation of Africans began in 1901. Pastoral societies paid taxes in kind (Tignor 1976). 78 The Northern Frontier District Annual report of 1925 indicates that pastoralists, including the Borana, paid 30 head of cattle and 50 sheep annually. This system was, however, replaced in 1928 by a hut and poll tax in which each man aged 16 and over was required to pay a prescribed tax in cash annually. To meet this requirement, Borana had begun to trade livestock {{between the north and}} central Kenya by the 1930 s (Colonial Report 1930). 79 However, the codification of males aged 16 and over is telling of the gender designation of men as heads of households who had ability to pay taxes and not women. It has often been argued {{that in the case of}} northern Kenya and pastoralists, the tax policies encouraged trade in livestock, introducing the cash economy in the north. Integration of men, though peripherally, into the colonial cash economy gradually replaced women’s control over milk and other dairy products and gave men exclusive <b>rights</b> to <b>dispossession</b> <b>of</b> livestock (Sobania 1979; Hodgson 2001). 80 [...]...|$|R
