40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} which {{allows one to}} solve nonlinear <b>transonic</b> <b>flow</b> problems by analyzing a sequence of linear equations. The small disturbance formulation of steady <b>transonic</b> <b>flow</b> over airfoils is linearized by considering the perturbations due to small changes in airfoil thickness ratio and angle of attack. Repeatedly incrementing those parameters results {{in a series of}} nonlinear solutions and cumulatively determines the effects of large changes in airfoil geometry. Successive line overrelaxation is used to solve the associated linear equations and is coupled with predictor-corrector methods to yield series of nonlinear solutions. Computed pressure distributions on biconvex airfoils show good agreement with experimental data and other transonic prediction methods. Possible extensions to unsteady and/or three-dimensional <b>transonic</b> <b>flow</b> problems are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{mathematical}} solution of 2 D and 3 D <b>transonic</b> <b>flows</b> using the finite volume and finite difference TVD and ENO schemes. The <b>transonic</b> <b>flows</b> are characterized by shock waves (i [...] e. discontinuities in the flow feld) which cause difficulties with the numerical solution using classical methods. For such problems one should use TVD or ENO methods which were developed especially for the cases with shock waves. The main goal of this thesis was to analyze properties of TVD and ENO schemes and to develop a numerical method for the solution of <b>transonic</b> <b>flows</b> in turbomachinery and for the shock-vortex interaction. The TVD and ENO schemes were studied from the mathematical point of view and then used for numerical solution of <b>transonic</b> <b>flow</b> problems. We solved some test problems such as the <b>transonic</b> <b>flow</b> in a channel and also some industrial cases such as the two-dimensional viscous or inviscid flow through turbine cascades and three-dimensional inviscid flow through a real turbine cascade. The results were generally in good agreement with the results obtained by other authors or with the measurements of IT CAS. Next we investigated numerically the properties of the shock-vortex interaction. We used a special type of vortex satisfying a general polytropic law in order to model different phenomenas Using the special vortex we demonstrated two qualitatively different kinds of interaction.
