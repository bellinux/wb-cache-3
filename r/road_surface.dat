5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch with the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal {{to the plane}} of the contact patch.|$|E

40|$|Subproject F of the SILENCE {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the role of <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the generation of road traffic noise. The project focuses especially on noise abatement in urban areas, and consequently urban <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> and their noise emission properties are the main interest of subproject F. Within the subproject, work package F 4 plays the important part of providing tools for other work packages to assess the success of new types of <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> or the maintenance of existing pavements. This document is the output of the work in task F 4. 2 and deals with the measurement methods suitable to assess the noise emission of urban <b>road</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The aim of this document is to - Discuss new and existing methods for determining the influence of <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> on <b>road</b> traffic noise emission - Point out the restrictions and special considerations that result from the application in urban surroundings - Provide a guideline for measuring the noise emission characteristics of urban <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> to the partners in SILENCE and for future use...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} phase of this {{research}} emphasis is laid on the characteristics of <b>road</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Research is done on special constructed <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> with a great variety in the macro-roughness and the micro-roughness. On these <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> measurements are done for four types of tyres, two tyre treads and three kinds of speed. Results show the possibility to describe the coefficient of friction in a mathematical relation dependent of the surface characteristics and speed...|$|R
25|$|In some areas, chert is {{ubiquitous}} as stream {{gravel and}} fieldstone {{and is currently}} used as construction material and <b>road</b> <b>surfacing.</b> Part of chert's popularity in <b>road</b> <b>surfacing</b> or driveway construction is that rain tends to firm and compact chert while other fill often gets muddy when wet.|$|R
5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying <b>road</b> <b>surface,</b> or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} winter {{service vehicles}} were snow rollers, designed {{to maintain a}} smooth, even <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> for sleds, although horse-drawn snowplows and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862. The increase in motor car traffic and aviation in the early 20th century {{led to the development}} and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The gorge is {{susceptible}} to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down the gorge, damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave and washing away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the gorge, was closed for several weeks following damage to the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> during extensive flooding.|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} approach to road lane marking extraction from high-resolution aerial images is proposed, which can automatically detect the <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{in rural areas}} based on hierarchical image analysis. The procedure is facilitated by the road centrelines obtained from low-resolution images. The lane markings are further extracted on the generated <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> with 2 D Gabor filters. The proposed method is applied on the aerial images of the Bruce Highway around Gympie, Queensland. Evaluation of the generated <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> and lane markings using four representative test fields has validated the proposed method...|$|R

5|$|Cycling groups voiced safety {{concerns}} after {{people were injured}} as their bicycle wheels became caught in the track. They reported the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> around the tracks was crumbling, raising further safety problems. In response, TiE promised to carry out repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund special training for cyclists., but the repairs were insufficient: in 2017, a woman was crushed to death by a passing bus when her bicycle wheel {{was caught in the}} tracks. Further {{safety concerns}} were raised by residents along the routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, and some property owners refused permission for cables to be attached.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of low-speed corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public <b>road</b> <b>surface,</b> the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's low-speed corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>road</b> <b>surface,</b> vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

5|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} extending the M54 westward to Shrewsbury, thereby placing the county town on the UK motorway map for the first time. Currently traffic has to continue onto the dual carriageway A5 when the M54 ends at Wellington although the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> or speed limits do not change at all but the road. It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys {{would need to be}} removed and a hard shoulder would also need to be built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E
5|$|The early Provincial Highway 14 in {{the east}} and Provincial Highway 5 to the west were built and driven on the square. In 1957, the Trans-Canada Highway opened, and soon after, the Yellowhead became {{eligible}} for federal funding. The opening ceremonies for the Yellowhead were held in 1962, and the highway was finished in 1965. Provincial highway 14 was widened in 1957. The route was straightened bypassing Plunkett and Viscount. The 1957 road specifications were a right of way of 150′ and a <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> of 38′. The centre 22′ of this road was oiled, leaving 8′ gravel shoulders on each side.|$|E
5|$|The roadway {{is part of}} the Forest Highway System that {{is funded}} and {{administered}} by the USFS and the Federal Highway Administration; the system was created by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. An earthen roadway was present through the area by 1936. In the beginning of 1937, the easternmost section around Point Iroquois was improved to a gravel road. Two years later, the westernmost section from Naomikong Point to the junction with M-123 was improved to gravel. The entire <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> was improved to gravel by 1945. Paving started on the road in the mid-1950s on the eastern end.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{outcomes of}} {{an investigation into the}} quality of stormwater from urban surfaces. Mathematical replication equations were developed for pollutant build-up and wash-off for <b>road</b> and roof <b>surfaces.</b> Based on the replication equations, pollutant loads from <b>road</b> and roof <b>surfaces</b> from three residential urban catchments were modelled. It was noted that the contribution from roof surfaces is significantly higher when compared to <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> for relatively smaller intensity rain events. This could be attributed to the relatively smoother surface texture and higher slopes when compared to <b>road</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This highlights the significance of roof surfaces as an urban water pollutant source...|$|R
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester works best when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{conditions}} typically {{vary greatly}} depending on altitude; hot countries can experience heavy snowfall in mountainous regions yet receive {{very little in}} low-lying areas, increasing the accident rate among drivers inexperienced in winter driving. In addition, <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> temperatures can fall rapidly at higher altitudes, precipitating rapid frost formation. As a result, gritting and plowing runs are often prioritised in favour of clearing these mountain roads, especially at the start {{and end of the}} snow season. The hazardous roads through mountain passes pose additional problems for the large winter service vehicles. The heavy metal frame and bulky grit makes hill climbing demanding for the vehicle, so vehicles have extremely high torque transmission systems to provide enough power to make the climb. Furthermore, because the tight hairpin turns found on mountain slopes are difficult for long vehicles to navigate, winter service vehicles for use in mountainous areas are shortened, usually from six wheels to four.|$|E

5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of both Manchester and Salford was about 94,000. By 1861 this had risen to about 460,000, and so {{in the same year}} John Greenwood Jr. made an application to Salford Borough Council and to the Pendleton Turnpike Trust, to build a tramway from Pendleton to Albert Bridge in Salford. The system was innovative in that the rails were designed to be 'flush' with the <b>road</b> <b>surface,</b> with a third central rail to accommodate a perambulator wheel attached to the front axle of the omnibus. Approval was granted and work commenced immediately, with the horse-pulled tramway finished in September 1861. It remained in use for a further eleven years when the condition of the track had deteriorated such that the council ordered it removed. The Tramways Act 1870 allowed councils to construct their own tramways, and on 17 May 1877 the 'Manchester and Salford Tramways' opened for business. The network of lines was largely complete by September 1880, the company changed its name to the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, and the system reached its peak in the 1890s. A steam tramway was opened on 12 April 1883 from Bury to Higher Broughton. The vehicles provoked letters of complaints from residents about the associated noise, dirt, and grease, and by 1888 the route was eventually curtailed to Besses o' th' Barn.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{objections}} to {{the interpretation of the}} structure as being a road at all, including the fact that several burial cists along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m, highly unusual for a <b>road</b> <b>surface.</b> Since 1997, authorities including English Heritage have accepted the possibility that the structure may not be a road. Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner suggested in 1997 that the structure may be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a Neolithic or Bronze Age boundary wall or dyke. There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including boundary dikes, although Knight et al. report that the later Neolithic is very poorly represented archaeologically in the North York Moors area and neolithic use of the moors was likely very limited in extent. Bronze Age presence in the moors, including earthworks, is well represented generally in the archaeology of the area, and therefore is a more plausible origin. Evidence against the identification of the causeway as an early Neolithic structure includes the statement by Elgee in 1912 that the causeway had been identified as cutting across an earlier British earthwork just north of Julian Park, suggesting that it must post-date it. One possibility that could explain several of the anomalies in trying to definitively identify the site is the suggestion by Knight et al. that it was commonly observed practice in the area for dykes to be reused as trackways.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nineteenth- and to {{a lesser}} extent twentieth-century attitudes often {{suggested}} that any well-constructed pre-modern <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> must be Roman, late twentieth-century archaeologists were more open to evaluating the structure within the context of a wider span of historical periods. After an early allowance by Phillips in 1853 that the causeway could be British rather than Roman there was little further investigation of such a possibility. In 1994, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England began a review of the date or origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor from the camps to which it is historically related, and the causeway does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network. Several writers around the turn of the millennium began to express doubt about the established narrative for the structure as a Roman road. Twenty-first century archaeologists then found several exemplars of other cambered, metalled roads that pre-date the Roman presence in Britain, and hence set precedence for the possibility of a pre-Roman origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Several sources from the mid-1990s onwards have suggested that the structure may be a pre-Roman (Iron Age) road of uncertain route or purpose.|$|E
