40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} a joint project carried out by Glencore Ulan Surface Operations and Orica, to reduce total mine cost by optimising overburden blasts. Typical overburden blasts are 60 m wide and 1000 m long with the blasts designed to cast. Ulan Surface operations has a Marion 8050 dragline operating using the traditional Key-Low wall combinations, High Wall Chopping and Extended Bench according with spoil profile balance with a dragline production rate of 2000 bcm/hr. The objectives of the project were to: optimise post blast muckpile profile to improve dragline advance; improve cast percentage (%); reduce coal roof damage and edge loss; and control blast emissions {{and their impact on}} neighbours. The aim of these objectives is to reduce the total cost of mining. The use of Orica’s advanced blast modelling software, Distinct Motion Code (DMC), was essential in this as it allowed the analysis of alternative blast designs using the results from previous blasts in Strip 5 as the baseline. The results of the modelling indicated that there was scope to improve the cast % from a baseline of 23 % to a range of 25 - 35 % to final. In addition, the coal model was validated using touch coal and gamma logging data for each strip. From this information the blastholes were designed to stand-off from the coal seam and QA/QC approaches in the backfill and <b>redrill</b> tolerances were implemented.

The particular {{application of this}} project is in portions of Fault Blocks IV and V of the Wilmington Oil Field, in Long Beach, California, but the approach is widely applicable in slope and basin reservoirs. Transferring technology {{so that it can}} be applied in other sections of the Wilmington Field and by operators in other slope and basin reservoirs is a primary component of the project. This project used advanced reservoir characterization tools, including the pulsed acoustic cased-hole logging tool, geologic three-dimensional (3 -D) modeling software, and commercially available reservoir management software to identify sands with remaining high oil saturation following waterflood. Production from the identified high oil saturated sands was stimulated by recompleting existing production and injection wells in these sands using conventional means as well as a short radius <b>redrill</b> candidate. Although these reservoirs have been waterflooded over 40 years, researchers have found areas of remaining oil saturation. Areas such as the top sand in the Upper Terminal Zone Fault Block V, the western fault slivers of Upper Terminal Zone Fault Block V, the bottom sands of the Tar Zone Fault Block V, and the eastern edge of Fault Block IV in both the Upper Terminal and Lower Terminal Zones all show significant remaining oil saturation. Each area of interest was uncovered emphasizing a different type of reservoir characterization technique or practice.

50|$|The 1920s was {{a period}} of intense oil {{exploration}} in California, with increasing interest in natural gas as its use came to replace manufactured gas. During this time, the large Ellwood Oil Field several miles west of the site was discovered and developed, as well as the small Mesa Oil Field near downtown Santa Barbara. Drillers prospecting for oil or gas drilled an exploratory well into the La Goleta field in 1929, but the well hit a high-pressure gas reservoir around 4,500 feet deep and blew out spectacularly, spewing gas at a rate of 60 million cubic feet of gas per day. The operator, General Petroleum Corp. of California, <b>redrilled</b> the well in 1932, bringing it into production. Peak production was in 1934, and the reservoir declined rapidly after that, being exhausted by the late 1930s. Total production through 1937 was 14 billion cubic feet of gas.|$|R
5000|$|A {{government}} bore {{was completed}} on 16 July 1886. It was 400 feet deep and the artesian water rose 15 {{feet into the}} air from the bore. [...] The salty water from the Great Artesian Basin had quickly corroded the bore head and bore casing and so by the 1920s millions of gallons of water flowed without control over the dry gibber plains, creating a wetland. A large pool formed where water bubbled from the corroded bore and was popular with railway passengers, crew, residents and locals alike. The bore was <b>redrilled</b> and relined in 1993 by the South Australian government and the flow rate was controlled and reduced. The current owners built the ‘natural spa’ to imitate the old pool. The water now flows from the rehabilitated bore through the ‘natural spa’ and into the wetland. The wetland has created its own dynamics and now is an oasis providing water and food, shelter and breeding areas {{for a wide range of}} wildlife. So far 99 plant species, 126 bird species and numerous small native mammals, reptiles, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates have been recorded here.|$|R
40|$|Geotechnical Engineering is {{classified}} by many mining companies {{as the highest}} corporate, investor and operational risk associated with the development and successful exploitation of a mineral resource. Given the shift in culture towards geotechnical engineering and the influx of new exploration projects, the quantity and complexity of geotechnical data is increasing at exponential rates. Unfortunately, in some cases, data management techniques have lagged behind data capture processes, resulting in relatively primitive technologies to store highly sensitive and costly data. Under these primitive systems, there is no quantifiable handling on the quantity or quality of geotechnical data. The rollover effects of poor data management standards are significant and in severe cases, areas require <b>redrilling</b> or revaluation to capture lost data. The aim of this project was to capture, extract and upload geotechnical data into an easily accessible, single source geotechnical database. Using Rio Tinto Coal Australia (RTCA) as a case study, the project formed a framework for future database implementations by outlining the systematic project progression from data extraction to population and application of the database. By providing a single source database, frequent engineering tasks at RTCA were automated which significantly increased engineering efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, comprehensive Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QAQC) checks improved overall data integrity, resulting in enhanced data confidence...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the potential role {{of policy and}} management analyses at early stages of technology development as exemplified by the case of hot, dry rock (HDR) geothermal energy resources used for electricity generation. Management issues concerning initial drilling depths, power plant design, <b>redrilling</b> strategies and periodic choices for well-flow rates are analyzed {{as they relate to}} R and D policies concerning first, the staging of R and D within the HDR R and D program and, second, priorities for the HDR research program relative to other R and D programs. Results reported here suggest that commercially attractive HDR systems do not require the development of new, very high temperature drilling technology (> 275 °C). Priorities for research concerning reservoir renewal and completion methods and baseload dimensions of an HDR system are emphasized. The desirability of periodic variations in well-flow rates as a means to reduce reservoir cooling is shown to be questionable. The commercial potential of HDR-produced electricity is assessed using calculations of the busbar cost of electricity from optimally-managed HDR geothermal systems. Busbar costs for a plausible set of base case conditions were found to vary between 26 [...] 76 mills kWh (1978 dollars) as geothermal gradients varied between 30 [...] 60 °C per kilometer of vertical depth. Commercial feasibility for HDR-produced electricity then involves a comparison of these costs with one's expectations for future busbar costs for electricity produced with other fuel sources. energy, research and development: project selection, technology...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} result of an experi-mental study of the High Energy Gas Fracturing (HEGF) {{technique}} for geothermal well stimulation. These experiments demon-strated that multiple fractures could be created to link a water-filled borehole with other fractures. The resulting frac-ture network and fracture interconnections were characterized by flow tests as well as mine back. Commercial oil field fracturing tools were used successfully in these experiments. INTRODUCTIOM Drilling is often a substantial fraction of the overall cost of a geothermal well. It may, therefore, be more economical to stimulate an under-productive well instead of <b>redrilling</b> a new well. Sandia National Laboratories, with funding from the U. S. Department of Energy has conducted studies on the use of High Energy Gas Fracturing (HEGF) techniques for geothermal well stimulation. By HEGF, we refer to any of the experimental and conunercial techniques for inducing multiple. radial fractures in a wellbore using rapid pressure loading with propellants or explosives. A HECF tool was originally developed at Sandia as a well stimulation technique for gas wells [2. 31. The geothermal applications represent an extension of this technology from gas filled to water filled boreholes. Uost HEGF techniques use propellants to pressurize a wellbore. With the right pressurization rate, they can produce multiple radial fractures emanating from a wellbore with typical fracture length up to 10 meters. Radial fractures in the non-hy-draulic-fracture directions are most desir-able for geothermal well stimulation since they are most likely to intersect the exis-ting production fractures which typically This work was supported by the U.

40|$|Using the {{conventional}} well cements {{consisting of the}} calcium silicate hydrates (CaO-SiO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O system) and calcium aluminum silicate hydrates (CaO-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-SiO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O system) for the integrity of geothermal wells, the serious concern confronting the cementing industries was their poor performance in mechanically supporting the metallic well casing pipes and in mitigating the pipe's corrosion in very harsh geothermal reservoirs. These difficulties are particularly acute in two geological regions: One is the deep hot downhole area ({approx} 1700 m depth at temperatures of {approx} 320 C) that contains hyper saline water with high concentrations of CO{sub 2 } (> 40, 000 ppm) in conjunction with {approx} 100 ppm H{sub 2 }S at a mild acid of pH {approx} 5. 0; {{the other is the}} upper well region between the well's surface and {approx} 1000 m depth at temperatures up to 200 C. The specific environment of the latter region is characterized by highly concentrated H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } (pH < 1. 5) brine containing at least 5000 ppm CO{sub 2 }. When these conventional cements are emplaced in these harsh environments, their major shortcoming is their susceptibility to reactions with hot CO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }SO 4, thereby causing their deterioration brought about by CO{sub 2 }-catalyzed carbonation and acid-initiated erosion. Such degradation not only reduced rapidly the strength of cements, lowering the mechanical support of casing pipes, but also increased the extent of permeability of the brine through the cement layer, promoting the rate of the pipe's corrosion. Severely carbonated and acid eroded cements often impaired the integrity of a well in less than one year; in the worst cases, casings have collapsed within three months, leading to the need for costly and time-consuming repairs or <b>redrilling</b> operations. These were the reasons why the geothermal well drilling and cementing industries were concerned about using conventional well cements, and further their deterioration was a major impediment in expediting the development of geothermal energy resources...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a 10 -year DOE-funded project to design, characterize {{and create an}} Engineered Geothermal System (EGS) {{through a combination of}} hydraulic, thermal and chemical stimulation techniques. Volume 1 {{describes a}} four-year Phase 1 campaign, which focused on the east compartment of the Coso geothermal field. It includes a description of the geomechanical, geophysical, hydraulic, and geochemical studies that were conducted to characterize the reservoir in anticipation of the hydraulic stimulation experiment. Phase 1 ended prematurely when the drill bit intersected a very permeable fault zone during the <b>redrilling</b> of target stimulation well 34 - 9 RD 2. A hydraulic stimulation was inadvertently achieved, however, since the flow of drill mud from the well into the formation created an earthquake swarm near the wellbore that was recorded, located, analyzed and interpreted by project seismologists. Upon completion of Phase 1, the project shifted focus to a new target well, which was located within the southwest compartment of the Coso geothermal field. Volume 2 describes the Phase 2 studies on the geomechanical, geophysical, hydraulic, and geochemical aspects of the reservoir in and around target-stimulation well 46 A- 19 RD, which is the deepest and hottest well ever drilled at Coso. Its total measured depth exceeding 12, 000 ft. It spite of its great depth, this well is largely impermeable below a depth of about 9, 000 ft, thus providing an excellent target for stimulation. In order to prepare 46 A- 19 RD for stimulation, however, it was necessary to pull the slotted liner. This proved to be unachievable under the budget allocated by the Coso Operating Company partners, and this aspect of the project was abandoned, ending the program at Coso. The program then shifted to the EGS project at Desert Peak, which had a goal similar to the one at Coso of creating an EGS on the periphery of an existing geothermal reservoir. Volume 3 describes the activities that the Coso team contributed to the Desert Peak project, focusing largely on a geomechanical investigation of the Desert Peak reservoir, tracer testing between injectors 21 - 2 and 22 - 22 and the fieldÃ¢ÂÂs main producers, and the chemical stimulation of target well 27 - 15...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} list of HDR objectives is provided in Reference 10, and is tabulated below in Tables 1 and 2 for the reader's convenience. The primary, level 1, objective for HDR is ''to improve the technology {{to the point where}} electricity could be produced commercially from a substantial number of known HDR resource sites in a cost range of 5 to 8 cents/kWh by 1997 ''. A critically important milestone in attaining this cost target is the level II objective: ''Evaluate the performance of the Fenton Hill Phase II reservoir''. To appreciate the significance of this objective, a brief background is helpful. During the past 14 years the US DOE has invested $ 123 million to develop the technology required to make Hot Dry Rock geothermal energy commercially useful. The Governments of Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany have contributed an additional $ 32 million to the US program. The initial objectives of the program were met by the successful development and long-term operation of a heat-extraction loop in hydraulically-fractured hot dry rock. This Phase I reservoir produced pressurized hot water at temperatures and flow rates suitable for many commercial uses such as space heating and food processing. It operated {{for more than a year}} with no major problems or detectable environmental effect. With this accomplished and the technical feasibility of HDR energy systems demonstrated, the program undertook the more difficult task of developing a larger, deeper, hotter reservoir, called ''Phase II'', capable of supporting pilot-plant-scale operation of a commercial electricity-generating power plant. As described earlier in ''History of Research'', such a system was created and operated successfully in a preliminary 30 -day flow test. However, to justify capital investment in HDR geothermal technology, industry now requires assurance that the reservoir can be operated for a long time without major problems or a significant decrease in the rate and quality of energy production. Industrial advisors to the HDR Program have concluded that, while a longer testing period would certainly be desirable, a successful and well-documented flow test of this high-temperature, Phase II reservoir lasting at least one year should convince industry that HDR geothermal energy merits their investment in its commercial development. This test is called the Long Term Flow Test (LTFT), and its completion will be a major milestone in attaining the Level 1 objective. However, before the LTFT could be initiated, well EE- 2 had to be repaired, as also briefly described in the ''History of Research''. During this repair operation, superb progress was made toward satisfying the next most critically important Level II objective: Improve the Performance of HDR Drilling and Completion Technology. During the repair of EE- 2, Los Alamos sidetracked by drilling out of the damaged well at 2. 96 km (9700 ft), and then completed drilling a new-wellbore (EE- 2 A) to a total depth of 3. 78 km (12, 360 ft). As a consequence of this drilling experience, Los Alamos believes that if the original wells were <b>redrilled</b> today their combined cost would be only $ 8 million rather than the $ 18. 8 million actually spent (a 60 % cost saving). Further details, particularly of the completion of the well, can be found in the major section, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, but it can be seen that the second, Level II objective is already nearing attainment...|$|R
40|$|The geochemical {{effects of}} injecting fluids into {{geothermal}} reservoirs are poorly understood {{and may be}} significantly underestimated. Decreased performance of injection wells has been observed in several geothermal fields {{after only a few}} years of service, but the reasons for these declines has not been established. This study had three primary objectives: 1) determine the cause(s) of the loss of injectivity; 2) utilize these observations to constrain numerical models of water-rock interactions; and 3) develop injection strategies for mitigating and reversing the potential effects of these interactions. In this study rock samples from original and <b>redrilled</b> injection wells at Coso and the Salton Sea geothermal fields, CA, were used to characterize the mineral and geochemical changes that occurred as a result of injection. The study documented the presence of mineral scales and at both fields in the reservoir rocks adjacent to the injection wells. At the Salton Sea, the scales consist of alternating layers of fluorite and barite, accompanied by minor anhydrite, amorphous silica and copper arsenic sulfides. Amorphous silica and traces of calcite were deposited at Coso. The formation of silica scale at Coso provides an example of the effects of untreated (unacidified) injectate on the reservoir rocks. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry were used to characterize the scale deposits. The silica scale in the reservoir rocks at Coso was initially deposited as spheres of opal-A 1 - 2 micrometers in diameter. As the deposits matured, the spheres coalesced to form larger spheres up to 10 micrometer in diameter. Further maturation and infilling of the spaces between spheres resulted in the formation of plates and sheets that substantially reduce the original porosity and permeability of the fractures. Peripheral to the silica deposits, fluid inclusions with high water/gas ratios provide a subtle record of interactions between the injectate and reservoir rocks. In contrast, fluid inclusions trapped prior to injection are relatively gas rich. These results suggest that the rocks undergo extensive microfracturing during injection and that the composition of the fluid inclusions will be biased toward the youngest event. Interactions between the reservoir rocks and injectate were modeled using the non-isothermal reactive geochemical transport code TOUGHREACT. Changes in fluid pH, fracture porosity, fracture permeability, fluid temperature, and mineral abundances were monitored. The simulations predict that amorphous silica will precipitate primarily within a few meters of the injection well and that mineral deposition will lead to rapid declines in fracture porosity and permeability, consistent with field observations. In support of Enhanced Geothermal System development, petrologic studies of Coso well 46 A- 19 RD were conducted to determine the regions that are most likely to fail when stimulated. These studies indicate that the most intensely brecciated and altered rocks in the zone targeted for stimulation (below 10, 000 ft (3048 m)) occur between 11, 200 and 11, 350 ft (3414 and 3459 m). This zone is interpreted as a shear zone that initially juxtaposed quartz diorite against granodiorite. Strong pervasive alteration and veining within the brecciated quartz diorite and granodiorite suggest this shear zone was permeable in the past. This zone of weakness was subsequently exploited by a granophyre dike whose top occurs at 11, 350 ft (3459 m). The dike is unaltered. We anticipate, based on analysis of the well samples that failure during stimulation will most likely occur on this shear zone...|$|R
