5|$|The first Australian {{fighting}} patrol into Kalimantan began on 24 May with two platoons, 5 and 11 Platoons, from B Company and a forward observation party, departing the company base at Bukit Knuckle {{under the command}} of Major William Broderick. The patrol—designated Operation Article—involved an ambush patrol along the bank of the Sungei Koemba river. After several days of careful and laborious movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale. The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a <b>re-entrant</b> below, talking loudly and firing random shots, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland {{brought forward}} the 13th and 62nd {{to extend his}} first and second lines. At the same time, two squadrons of Kingston's Horse were brought forward to cover the right flank. These were then joined by two troops of Cobham's 10th Dragoons. While this was taking place, Hawley began making {{his way through the}} Culwhiniac Parks {{intending}} to outflank the Jacobite right wing. Anticipating this, the two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's regiment had lined the wall. However, since the government dragoons stayed out of range, and the Jacobites were partly in dead ground they moved back and formed up on a <b>re-entrant</b> at Culchunaig, facing south and covering the army's rear. Once Hawley had led the dragoons through the Parks he deployed them in two lines beneath the Jacobite guarded <b>re-entrant.</b> By this time the Jacobites were guarding the <b>re-entrant</b> from above with four battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's and Lord Ogilvy's regiments, and the combined squadron of Fitzjames's Horse and Elcho's Lifeguards. Unable to see behind the Jacobites above him, Hawley had his men stand and face the enemy.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} foreign market re-entry after exit, demonstrating with empirical evidence that exit {{is not an}} irreversible, win or lose process characterised by location and asset specificity. Organisations repeatedly attempt to return to once failed internationalisation projects. Drawing upon insights from organisational learning and institutional perspectives, this {{study examines}} the changes (if any) in commitment mode between exit and re-entry, the timing of re-entry, and whether developed and emerging market <b>re-entrants</b> differ in their re-entry choices. The highlights of this research are as follows; 1) for some <b>re-entrants,</b> re-entry carries with it learning inertia in that (both developed and emerging market) firms tend to re-enter via the same commitment modes {{in which they were}} operating prior to exit irrespective of prior knowledge and experience accumulated over time; 2) favourable host institutional changes, in turn, lead to commitment escalation; 3) early re-entries are motivated by the quality of host institutional environments, the choice to imitate the behaviour of other foreign (re) entrants to gain legitimacy, and the <b>re-entrant’s</b> strategic intent; and 4) how firms interpret exit {{plays a key role in}} their re-entry commitment and timing decisions, together with institutional pressures for legitimacy. Contrary to prior studies on de novo foreign market entry, this study proposes that it is not just the experience accumulated over time that influences the effectiveness and applicability of organisational learning. For <b>re-entrants,</b> prior experience does not necessarily lead to learning and more relevant tend to be institutional changes and pressures for legitimacy, how <b>re-entrants</b> interpret the market exit process and the <b>re-entrant’s</b> strategic objectives concerning the previously abandoned market. From a practitioner’s viewpoint, there may be significant consequences of not being able to transform prior knowledge and experience into learning and routines in the short term, and subsequently, leverage the lessons learned when making re-entry decisions...|$|R
40|$|Home country {{re-entry}} from cross-cultural {{missionary work}} abroad {{may be associated}} with psychological distress. <b>Re-entrants</b> experience multiple losses including loss of identity which {{may be associated with}} personal/relational identity gaps and depersonalization/dehumanization. However, research suggests that some <b>re-entrants</b> are resilient with good mental health, while others are fragile with poor mental health. The aims of this paper are to explore the nature and frequency of re-entering missionaries’ identity gaps and their depersonalization/dehumanization in resilient and fragile <b>re-entrants.</b> Fifteen re-entering adult Australian cross-cultural missionary workers from four interdenominational Australian mission organizations completed semi-structured interviews. Results were analysed using modified Consensual Qualitative Research methods. Links were established between personal/relational identity gaps, depersonalization/dehumanization and resilience on re-entry.

25|$|Secondary {{consciousness}} {{is seen in}} animals with semantic capabilities, such as the four great apes. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex language made up of syntax and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of reptiles into mammals and then into birds, the embryological development {{of large numbers of}} new reciprocal connections allowed rich <b>re-entrant</b> activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory. The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further <b>re-entrant</b> circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual memory systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.|$|E
25|$|In a {{heart with}} AF, the {{increased}} calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum and increased calcium sensitivity {{can lead to}} accumulation of intra-cellular calcium and causes down regulation of L-type calcium channels. This reduces the duration of action potential and refractory period, thus favourable for the conduction of <b>re-entrant</b> waves. Increased expression of inward-rectifier potassium ion channels can cause a reduced atrial refractory period and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of gap junction proteins such as GJA1 (also known as Connexin 43), and GJA5 (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing arrhythmia.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe study {{investigated}} the influence of cultural practices and social settings on young women's aspirations for schooling. A survey was conducted on <b>re-entrants</b> and non <b>re-entrants,</b> followed by life histories. Central tendency values on personal characteristics, schooling history, family background and home-school environment were compared, and {{variables found to be}} significant included: working status; class of study at leaving; extra years in class/school; reasons for leaving school; socioeconomic status; parents’ marital status; mother's qualification; mother's occupation; father's occupation; rural/urban environment and quality of school attended. Findings suggest that coming from a low socioeconomic status family and rural environment reduced the women's chances of re- entering school. Teacher training programmes should equip teachers with skills on handling children from different cultural settings...|$|R
25|$|Around 1800, {{a mutual}} {{interchange}} between the mandora and the guitar took place. The guitar, which {{had so far}} been tuned in <b>re-entrant</b> tuning (e' - b - g - d' - a), took over the 6th course and the tuning of the mandora (e' - b - g - d - A - G, later also e' - b - g - d - A - E), whereas the mandora took over the stringing with single strings instead of courses, as had been introduced to the guitar. The so-called wandervogellaute has been a late heir to that development.|$|E
25|$|The medal is a {{modified}} cross pattée {{one and a}} half inches wide. The ends of its arms are rounded whereas a conventional cross patée has arms that are straight on the end. There are four laurel leaves with berries in each of the <b>re-entrant</b> arms of the cross. In the center of the cross a sailing vessel is depicted on waves, sailing to the viewer's left. The vessel is a symbolic caravel of the type used between 1480 and 1500. Fraser selected the caravel because it was a symbol often used by the Naval Academy and because it represented both naval service and the tradition of the sea. The laurel leaves with berries refer to achievement.|$|E
25|$|The French {{fortified}} a loop in the Pasłęka {{that formed}} a <b>re-entrant</b> {{toward the west}} bank of the stream. By closing off the east end of the loop with a central redoubt connected by earthworks to the river banks on each side, the French held a well-protected east bank bridgehead. A second redoubt near the bridge provided a back up position. Villatte deployed the 27th Light in the bridgehead, with the 63rd Line and 17th Dragoons in direct support on the west bank. His second brigade under General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Girard held the line of the Pasłęka farther north with the 94th and 95th Line Infantry Regiments. The 18th, 19th, and 20th Dragoon Regiments were with Girard.|$|E

25|$|Lying to {{the east}} of Dunduff Farm on a rocky knoll, this tower castle was built to an L-shaped plan, with a square three floored stair-tower in the <b>re-entrant</b> angle on the south. Three barrel-vaulted {{chambers}} are on the ground floor and these were accessed via the lobby of the tower. A private chamber on the first floor was accessed by a corridor that ran the length of the main block. A fireplace in the wing heated the hall, with its splayed window embrasure. An intermediate floor once existed, as indicated by joist sockets. Window and door features of the original ruin suggest construction in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the AGR was such that the final steam {{conditions}} at the boiler stop valve were identical to that of conventional coal-fired power stations, thus the same design of turbo-generator plant could be used.

In order to obtain these high temperatures, yet ensure useful graphite core life (graphite oxidises readily in CO2 at high temperature) a <b>re-entrant</b> flow of coolant at the lower boiler outlet temperature of 278°C is utilised to cool the graphite, ensuring that the graphite core temperatures do not vary too much from those seen in a Magnox station.

25|$|Geochemical modelers {{commonly}} create {{reaction path}} models {{to understand how}} systems respond to changes in composition, temperature, or pressure. By configuring {{the manner in which}} mass and heat transfer are specified (i.e., open or closed systems), models can be used to represent a variety of geochemical processes. Reaction paths can assume chemical equilibrium, or they can incorporate kinetic rate laws to calculate the timing of reactions. In order to predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath, geochemical models are increasingly being coupled with hydrologic models of mass and heat transport to form reactive transport models. Specialized geochemical modeling programs that are designed as cross-linkable <b>re-entrant</b> software objects enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.|$|E

2500|$|As the Allies advanced, they {{encountered}} increasingly difficult terrain: the Apennine Mountains form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of Abruzzo, {{more than half}} the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over [...] that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and <b>re-entrants</b> to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance.

60|$|During the 22nd and 23rd {{the troops}} held the {{positions}} they had won, and the infantry {{were subjected to}} a harassing shell fire from the Boer guns, which, playing from either flank, searched the <b>re-entrants</b> in which the battalions sheltered, and which, though they did not cause a greater loss than forty men on the 22nd and twenty-five on the 23rd, nevertheless made their position extremely uncomfortable. It was quite evident that the troops could not be fairly required to endure this bombardment, against {{which there was no}} protection, indefinitely.

25|$|In 1932, J. E. Edmonds the British {{official}} historian, {{wrote that}} III Corps neglected {{the south side}} of Nab Valley, which made the neglect of the north side by X Corps worse, because the trenches in the Nab Valley <b>re-entrant</b> faced a large area of no man's land, from which enfilade machine-gun fire began as soon as the attack commenced. Edmonds wrote that it had been an unfortunate mistake to put the inter-corps boundary along such a valley. Reserve Infantry Regiment 99 reported that the defensive success on 1 July, was mainly due to their machine-guns, all of which were operational when the attack began. The 3rd Company of Infantry Regiment 180 in Leipzig Redoubt was annihilated in hand-to-hand fighting but the garrison of Thiepval to the north was protected by the shelters beneath the village. Reinforcements were only needed against the 36th Division to the north.|$|E
25|$|The 6809 {{design team}} {{believed}} that future system integrators would look to off-the-shelf code in ROMs to handle common tasks. Motorola's official programming manual contains the full listing of assist09, a so-called monitor, a miniature operating system {{intended to be}} burned in ROM. Another example of ROM code might be binary floating point arithmetic, which is a common requirement in many systems. In order to speed time to market, common code modules would be purchased, rather than developed in-house, and integrated into systems with code from other manufacturers. Since a CPU designer could hardly guarantee where this code would be located in a future system, the 6809 design focused heavily on support of position-independent, reentrant code that could be freely located anywhere in the memory map. This expectation was, in reality, never quite met: Motorola's only released example of a ROM'd software module was the MC6839 floating-point ROM. However, the decisions made by the design team made for a very powerful processor and made possible advanced operating systems like OS-9 and UniFlex, which {{took advantage of the}} position-independent, <b>re-entrant</b> nature of the 6809 to create multi-user multitasking operating systems.|$|E
25|$|Theorbos were {{developed}} during the late sixteenth century in Italy, inspired by the demand for extended bass range instruments for use in opera developed by the Florentine Camerata and new musical works utilising basso continuo, such as Giulio Caccini's two collections, Le nuove musiche (1602 and 1614). For his 1607 opera L'Orfeo, Claudio Monteverdi lists duoi (two) chitaroni among the instruments required for performing the work. Musicians originally used large bass lutes (c. 80+ cm string length) and a higher <b>re-entrant</b> tuning; but soon created neck extensions with secondary pegboxes to accommodate extra open (i.e. unfretted) longer bass strings, called diapasons or bourdons, for improvements in tonal clarity and an increased range of available notes. Although the words chitarrone and tiorba were both {{used to describe the}} instrument, they have different organological and etymological origins; chitarrone being in Italian an augmentation of (and literally meaning large) chitarra – Italian for guitar. The round-backed chitarra was still in use, often referred to as chitarra Italiana to distinguish it from chitarra alla spagnola in its new flat-backed Spanish incarnation. The etymology of tiorba is still obscure; it is hypothesized the origin may be in Slavic or Turkish torba, meaning 'bag' or 'turban'.|$|E
40|$|Girls' {{schooling}} {{has received}} considerable attention internationally, {{particularly since the}} early 1990 s. Although there is progress towards gender parity in enrolment at the primary level, very little has been achieved at the secondary one especially in subSaharan Africa including Uganda. The Ugandan government has, through the National Strategy for Girls' Education put up several measures to enhance girls' participation in schooling but no significant results have been recorded mainly due to limited coordination, monitoring and geographical coverage. The {{purpose of the study}} was to find out the obstacles and challenges to women's re-entry in secondary schools. It aimed at exploring the influence of different social and cultural settings on young women's aspirations for re-entering school. The theoretical framework for the study is based on Sociocultural and Activity Theory which considers processes by which social, cultural, and historical factors shape human functioning, and psychological tools through which individuals learn to make meanings when they interact with others. Data used in the study were collected by both quantitative and qualitative methods. An initial survey was conducted through structured interviews to obtain information on a number of re-entrants' and non re-entrants' socio-demographic characteristics. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the characteristics of the young women. Crosstabulations were then used to determine the significance of these characteristics on the women's schooling. Logistic regression analysis was then used to predict the likelihood of secondary school re-entry basing on the significant variables. Life history interviews were carried out with selected <b>re-entrants,</b> non <b>re-entrants</b> and their mothers. Data from the in-depth interviews was analysed by identifying concepts, comparing and contrasting them, categorising, and then classifying them. The main determinants of school re-entry were found to be socioeconomic, sociocultural and individual circumstances. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

However, the post-Dearing changes in the funding of higher education have initially been associated with a significant fall in applications from this group of entrants. This paper, by providing an economic assessment of mature female entrants to higher education, allows a preliminary evaluation of those funding changes. It critically appraises the limited empirical work in this area, identifying fundamental methodological weaknesses. The assessment addresses the issue of re-entry into employment and relates mature females' entry into HE to the wider i ssue of gender inequality in the labour market.
