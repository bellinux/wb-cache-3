50|$|Cesáreo Fernández Duro wrote {{more than}} 400 {{publications}} including books, monographs, reports and memoirs, particularly on three subjects: {{the history of}} the Spanish Navy, the conquest of America and {{the history of the}} province of Zamora. On this last topic he wrote a collection of news-biographical literature relating to Zamora or materials for its history (Madrid: Manuel Tello, 1891), which was awarded in 1876. The book is divided into three sections: a <b>regional</b> <b>bibliography</b> of works dealing with Zamora, a bibliography of works {{on the history of the}} press in Zamora and a bio-bibliography of famous Zamoran persons. As for his work on the history of the Spanish Navy, his History of the Spanish Armada from the Union of Castile and Aragon (1895-1903) in nine volumes, and his Nautical Disquisitions (1876-1881) in six, remain unsurpassed in their field today.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{principal}} tasks of a public municipal library is the conservation and diffusion of the patrimony and the local culture, specially in the fund or local section. In the latter years, the regions have seen how the local studies have been proliferating increasingly. The libraries {{have to answer to}} the needs of information of their users with the own instruments. And one of the the most basic and more useful is the elaboration of bibliographies, indispensable for the investigator who has many difficulties to know a minimal part of all that is published on his area of knowledge, in a certain place. Due to the great quantity of information that is published in the Vall d'Albaida (department of Valencia Community –Spain-), it has been made the <b>regional</b> <b>bibliography</b> of the Vall d'Albaida. This bibliography integrates all material published on the region, with the purpose of spreading it to the whole community.

This paper analyses family farming, by making comparisons in regional terms and by groups of producers using high, medium and low technology. It also calculates the productive inequality index (Gini coefficient of gross income) of the north, north-east, centre-west, south-east and south regions. In view of the regional differentiation, the size of enterprises and the various levels of technological growth, public policies should focus on reducing the disparities that hamper the dissemination of new knowledge and productivity growth among economic agents, leading to greater productive inclusion...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the {{monograph}} publications on Croats in Vojvodina from 1990 to 2008. The paper presents a list of 137 monographs published in the above period that are thematically related to {{the social and cultural}} life of Croats in Vojvodina. These works are of heterogenic nature by a series of features - ranging from their volume through the complexity and scope of the theme to their scientific relevance; nevertheless, what brings them all together is the same topic. The list of publications on Vojvodina Croats is published in a sequence that follows the classification in accordance with the Universal Decimal Classification and the alphabetic list of authors. Anonymous publications and publications with multiple authors are listed at the beginning. In addition, the paper contains a brief analysis of the place of publishing and the place of the author’s activity, the language of publication and the field of science and the topics they cover. The contribution of the paper lies in the compilation of a time-defined <b>regional</b> <b>bibliography</b> that has presented for the first time all the known monographs on Vojvodina Croats in the mentioned period...|$|E
40|$|The fauna, special {{features}} on the geographical spread of the ground half-stiff-wing insects in the natural Siberia's regions have been investigated. 698 species from 263 genuses and 24 ground families have been shown; the new 17 species and 2 subspecies have been described. The typology of the areas counting 3 overgroups, 8 groups and 62 types with prevalence of the Euro-Siberian and North-Thetys-Siberian areas has been given. The specific endemism has been expressed weakly. The regularities on the landscape-zonal and statial distribution of the species have been specified. On base of the cluster analysis of 20 subregions the schema of the faunistic Siberia's division into districts has been developed; the separation {{of a number of}} the new territorial divisions in the Euro-Siberian taiga subregion has been substantiated. The hypothesis about probabilistic ways of the fauna genesis from Neogene to Holocene has been proposed. The illustrated determinants of the Siberia and Yakutia with inclusion of a number of the species from adjoint regions into the tables have been drawn up; the economic-significant species have been shown. The total <b>regional</b> <b>bibliography</b> of the fundamental and applied literature on the bugs has been specified.

5000|$|In the 1990s Larramendi co-founded and was {{the moving}} spirit behind Fundación Histórica Tavera, {{operating}} an institute {{of the same name}} and dedicated to protection of bibliographic and documentary patrimony of Spain, Portugal and Iberoamerica. The foundation embarked mostly on a number of digitalization projects, programs supporting bibliographical and referential initiatives, cataloging and co-operation in archival efforts targeting various civil and ecclesiastic institutions. Instituto published also a few digital series under common title Clasicós Tavera, each one covering a single historical topic like Iberoamerica, <b>regional</b> histories, <b>bibliographies</b> etc., activity transferred further on to Centro de Referencias REFMAP and Centro de Publicaciones Digitales, later renamed to Digibis.Another thread of Larramendi’s patronage activity was related to Carlism. He contributed financially to a number of Carlism-flavored publishing initiatives, especially Aportes. In honor of his father in 1986 he set up Fundación Hernando de Larramendi, currently operating as Fundación Ignacio Larramendi; its declared mission is to promote [...] "caridad en las relaciones sociales" [...] in line with the Catholic teaching, to act as independent think-tank, to study history of Carlism and to support non-commercial scientific research. Most visible initiatives of the Foundation are related to dissemination of Carlist thought and promotion of Carlist studies. It keeps releasing digitalized collections of Traditionalist theorists, publishes mostly scholarly though at times also literary works within a Colección Luis Hernando de Larramendi series and awards Premio Internacional de Historia del Carlismo Luis Hernando de Larramendi, with the objective to [...] "apoyar a los libros que aportan conocimientos objetivos para la verdad, no la verdad falsificada, no la verdad sectaria, sino la verdad a secas". The Foundation also keeps running a website with a number of digitalized works and press cuttings available.|$|R

NRR/ 96 - 21 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Regionalization constitutes fundamental structural and institutional {{change in the way}} water and wastewater utility services are provided. Regionalization reflects structural change in terms of consolidating water utility ownership, operations, or management within a politically geographic or hydrogeologic area. Regionalization reflects institutional change in terms of establishing public policy and resource planning frameworks that encompass <b>regional</b> considerations. This <b>bibliography</b> provides a contemporary, broad-based, and multidisciplinary collection of works on regionalization in the water sector. Those contemplating regionalization for the first time may be impressed by the extent to which others have contemplated this issue as well. This report provides a brief literature review and a lengthy annotated bibliography on the subject of regionalization in the water and wastewater utility industries. A comprehensive and iterative approach was taken in developing the literature database, which consists of books, reports, articles, and conference papers. Many important contributions to the literature are highlighted in the bibliography, which is organized into seven general areas...|$|R

The present document focuses on the productive dimension of integration and the way this can contribute to the strategy of structural change for equality that ECLAC has been advocating since 2010. This is a return, then, to a subject that has traditionally been at the centre of ECLAC thinking about integration and development. Another aim is to contribute to the current debate about the role of integration in Latin America and the Caribbean {{in the light of the}} significant shifts taking place in the global economy. These include rapid technological change, the growing economic weight of Asia and emerging economies generally, the rise of global value chains and the trend towards the creation of integrated macroregions.
