As germinated spores lose their <b>resistance</b> <b>capacities</b> instantaneously, efficient germination prior to a cleaning in place treatment could aid to the disinfecting effect of such a treatment.

A mixture of l-alanine and inosine initiated germination of adhered spores efficiently, resulting in 3. 2 decimal logarithms of germination. Notably, implementation of a germination-inducing step prior to a representative cleaning in place procedure reduced the number of survivors with over 3 decimal log units, while an alkali treatment alone, as part of the cleaning in place procedure, did not show any effect on B. cereus spore viability.

To demonstrate {{the application of the}} suggested method, a pre-stressed concrete-I (PSC-I) type girder was selected as a sample bridge. An analytical procedure was developed to quantitatively evaluate the performance degradation of a PSC-I girder bridge considering the traffic conditions, corrosive environment, and crack damage. The bridge performance was evaluated by considering traffic conditions, including the annual average daily traffic volume, heavy vehicle volume, and corrosive environment (mild, normal, and severe). To calculate the <b>resistance</b> <b>capacity,</b> all variables regarding the materials and sections were considered through probabilistic variances, Monte Carlo simulation, and the statistical characteristics of the resistance. The results showed that the performance degradation is sensitive to the important parameters of the traffic conditions and corrosive environment, which may decrease the structural reliability and lead to bridge failure. Cracks in a PSC-I girder may accelerate the performance degradation and affect the reliability level of the bridge. Therefore, a maintenance plan should be rationally considered depending on the site environment...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method is}} presented for predicting the uplift resistance of deep piles with enlarged bases. The piles are {{deeply embedded in}} soil, so that an axisymmetric logarithmic-spiral (or 'peach-shaped') slip surface in the soil around the pile is buried underground throughout the uplifting process. The uplift resistance {{is considered to be}} equal to the sum of the pile shaft and base uplift resistance as well as the pile weight. The pile shaft and base uplift resistance were derived from the unit skin frictional resistance model and the peachshaped slip surface model in the soil around the base. The equations associated with the proposed theoretical method are analytically formulated using the classical limit equilibrium method and the axisymmetric pile uplift model. Three base uplift <b>resistance</b> <b>capacity</b> factors, Nc, Nq and Nγ, were obtained, corresponding to the effects of cohesion, surcharge and self-weight respectively. Charts of these three factors are presented at the serviceability failure limit (defined as pile upward displacement equal to 10 % of the pile shaft diameter). The proposed theoretical method is then validated with results from full-scale field tests. It is shown that the proposed theoretical method can effectively estimate the uplift <b>resistance</b> <b>capacity</b> at the serviceability failure limit for deep piles with enlarged bases in various soils. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
