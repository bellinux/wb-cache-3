The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus <b>replicon,</b> replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural replicase genes intact.

Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells and are only transiently expressed. Alphavirus replicase genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it {{may be due to the}} high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.|$|E

2500|$|Alphaviruses are of {{interest}} to gene therapy researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses. [...] Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to integrate the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations {{to the use of}} alphaviruses in the field of gene therapy due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death. [...] The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create <b>replicon</b> vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.|$|E

Despite the conservation of core DNA replication proteins, little is known about replication programs in plants. We used flow cytometry and tiling microarrays to profile DNA replication of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 4 (chr 4) during early, mid, and late S phase. Replication profiles for early and mid S phase were similar and encompassed the majority of the euchromatin. Late S phase exhibited a distinctly different profile that includes the remaining euchromatin and essentially all of the heterochromatin. Termination zones were consistent between experiments, allowing us to define 163 putative <b>replicons</b> on chr 4 that clustered into larger domains of predominately early or late replication.

40|$|International audienceObjective: Toward the {{characterization}} of of bacterial <b>replicons,</b> {{we are working on}} analytical methodologies able to represent functional and evolutionary relationships between <b>replicons</b> and relative to a certain set of annoted genes. The genome of bacteria is classically separated into the essential, stable and slow evolving chromosomes and the accessory, mobile and rapidly evolving plasmids. Recently, a new class of genomic elements, in between chromosomes and plasmids, has been highlighted. Named "megaplasmids", "secondary chromosomes" or "chromids", the true nature and evolution of these genomic elements are yet to be determined. Methodology: Using databases of genes functionally related to genetic information transmission systems (GITS) as inputs, we performed a global comparative genomic analysis on all available bacterial genomes with the following methodology: I) Identification and assession of functional homologs in all bacterial genome. II) Construction of clusters of proteins linking the bacterial <b>replicons</b> by their GITS, relative to the shared functions and sequences homologies. III) Unsuperivsed (Visualisation, clustering) and supervised (classification, regression) analyses of the <b>replicons.</b> The comparison and the biological assessment of the obtained results was performed using external criteria based on the taxonomy and structure of <b>replicons</b> and internal criterion based on stability measurements. Result: Bipartite graphs were useful tools to represent meaningfully the <b>replicons</b> according to their GITS proteins. Additionally, community detection algorithms (INFOMAP) gives results with the best performances in term of stability and relative to the bacterial taxonomy compared to traditional clustering methodologies. Based on these results we were able to characterize the third class of <b>replicons</b> relative to chromosomes and plasmids. Conclusion: With a specific representation of the genomic dataset and using a particular methodology, we were able to produce results with strong biological implications. Moreover this study provides the material for supplementary analyses (workflow improvement/enrichment, classifications [...] .) in order to highlight some of the driving forces of the genomes evolution...|$|R

The dispensability of viral SP {{has allowed}} construction of noninfectious viral expression vectors and <b>replicons</b> from viruses of the Alphavirus and Rubivirus genera. Nevertheless, in this study, {{we found that}} the SP of rubella virus (RUB) could enhance expression of reporter genes from RUB <b>replicons</b> in trans. SP enhancement required capsid protein (CP) expression and was not due to RNA-RNA recombination. Accumulation of minus- and plus-strand RNAs from <b>replicons</b> was observed in the presence of SP, suggesting that SP specifically affects RNA synthesis. By using <b>replicons</b> containing an antibiotic resistance gene, we found 2 - to 50 -fold increases in the number of cells surviving selection in the presence of SP. The increases depended significantly on the amount of transfected RNA. Small amounts of RNA or templates that replicated inefficiently showed more enhancement. The infectivity of infectious RNA was increased by at least 10 -fold in cells expressing CP. Moreover, virus infectivity was greatly enhanced in such cells. In other cells that expressed higher levels of CP, RNA replication of <b>replicons</b> was inhibited. Thus, depending on conditions, CP can markedly enhance or inhibit RUB RNA replication...|$|R

The genome of R. solananearum GMI 1000 is organised into two <b>replicons</b> (a 3. 7 -Mb chromosome and a 2. 1 -Mb megaplasmid) and this bipartite genome structure is characteristic for most R. solanacearum strains. To determine whether the megaplasmid was acquired via recent horizontal gene transfer or {{is part of an}} ancestral single chromosome, we compared the abundance, distribution and compositon of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) between both <b>replicons</b> and also compared the respective compositional biases. Results Our data show that both <b>replicons</b> are very similar in respect to distribution and composition of SSRs and presence of compositional biases. Minor variations in SSR and compositional biases observed may be attributable to minor differences in gene expression and regulation of gene expression or {{can be attributed to the}} small sample numbers observed. Conclusions The observed similarities indicate that both <b>replicons</b> have shared a similar evolutionary history and thus suggest that the megaplasmid was not recently acquired from other organisms by lateral gene transfer but is a part of an ancestral R. solanacearum chromosome. </p...|$|R
