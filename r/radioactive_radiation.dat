He then took part in {{creation}} of the first Soviet cyclotron (under the guidance of [...] and jointly with Igor Kurchatov and George Gamov). In 1934, Alikhanov began research on radioactivity and <b>radioactive</b> <b>radiation.</b> In 1934, with A. I. Alikhanian and. M. S. Kozodaev, he discovered and studied {{the phenomenon of the}} emission of electron-positron pairs by excited nuclei. In 1935, with Alikhanian, he established the dependence of β-spectra on the atomic number of an element. In 1936, working with Alikhanian and L. A. Artsimovich, he experimentally corroborated the law of conservation of momentum in pair annihilation. The research initiated by Alikhanov, Alikhanian, and S. Ia. Nikitin led to the discovery in 1939 of a stream of fast protons in cosmic rays. In 1949 Alikhanov founded the first nuclear reactor in the USSR. In 1961, with V. V. Vladimirskii and others, he built the first accelerator in the USSR with strong focusing and an energy of 7GeV (1 GeV = 1 billion eV). Under Alikhanov’s direction, a plan was drawn up and construction begun on an accelerator with a capacity of 70GeV. He received the State Prize of the USSR in 1941, 1948, and 1953. In 1954 he was designated a Hero of Socialist Labor. He was awarded two Orders of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Technology) Cape Technikon, 1988 Radioactivity and <b>radioactive</b> <b>radiation</b> are two {{scientific}} phenomena which man {{has always}} approached with great caution, if not fear. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>radiation</b> cannot be sensed {{by any of}} the human senses and experience has proved just how hazardous it can be to the human body. This caution is therefore by no means unfounded and through the years a set of standards has been derived as to what can be regarded as a safe dose to the human body. At the National Accelerator Centre radioisotopes are being produced by a chemical recovery process from targets which have been irradiated by a high energy proton beam. Targets are prepared by compressing salts, containing the elements to become radioisotopes, into tablets. The high energy protons collide with particles in the targets which give off <b>radioactive</b> <b>radiation.</b> The targets in their turn become radioactive and the isotopes that are produced from these targets are radioactive. The level of <b>radioactive</b> <b>radiation</b> is extremely hazardous and it is therefore impossible for any human being to come into close contact with any of the targets or isotopes. It is for these reasons that an electrical rail transport system was installed at the National Accelerator Centre to transport highly radioactive sources. The transport system links the two irradiation vaults to the two rows of hot cells, where the chemical recovery takes place, and to a well shielded storage area for storage of isotopes and radioactive waste. A transport system, performing tasks of this nature, must be, above all, extremely reliable. Secondly, commands entered by an operator to control the system, must be simple and straight forward. This thesis describes the control of the transport system at the National Accelerator Centre, including alI of its features, advantages and disadvantages...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently {{peaceful}} {{use of the}} nuclear energy and radioactive nuclides has increased the radiation pollution factor {{in the world and}} radiation safety problems have become actual ones. The development of the nuclear power engineering, protection and processing of radioactive wastes of nuclear reactors, the use of radioactive isotopes in national economy, nuclear explosion, industrial wastes and etc. may cause the radioactive pollution of the environment. In the case of such pollution the environment as well as living organisms are exposed to <b>radioactive</b> <b>radiation</b> (-, -, γ- etc.). Radioactive substances emit radioactive rays and as their decay time varies for natural and artificial radioactive substances the time of their environmental effect ranges from some years to million years. In consequence of radiation effect new specific properties – ecological, psycological, biological and so on are observed. It’s necessary to determine the harmful effect of radioactive pollution areas on the environment as well as human life and radiation dose {{in order to protect the}} area, foods and people from this effect.
