5000|$|Unlike the <b>repurchase</b> or <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase,</b> {{there is}} no clear intent by the {{government}} to reverse the action of their selling/buying of monetary securities. Thus, this transaction creates a more permanent effect on our monetary supply.

It is noteworthy that there was a decrease in lending to individuals, especially from smaller banks.

40|$|Monetary policy {{measures}} {{taken by the}} Federal Reserve {{as a response to}} the 2007 - 09 financial crisis and subsequent economic conditions led to a large increase in the level of outstanding reserves. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a range of tools to control short-term market rates in this situation. We study several of these tools, namely, interest on excess reserves (IOER), <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreements (RRPs), and the term deposit facility (TDF). We find that overnight RRPs (ON RRPs) may provide a better floor on rates than term RRPs because they are available to absorb daily liquidity shocks. Whether the TDF or RRPs best support equilibrium rates depends on the intensity of interbank monitoring costs versus balance sheet costs, respectively, that banks face. In our model, using the RRP and TDF concurrently may most effectively stabilize short-term rates close to the IOER rate when such costs are rapidly increasing...|$|R

40|$|We review {{recent changes}} in {{monetary}} policy {{that have led to}} development and testing of an overnight <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreement (ON RRP) facility, an innovative tool for implementing monetary policy during the normalization process. Making ON RRPs available to a broad set of investors, including nonbank institutions that are significant lenders in money markets, could complement the use of the interest on excess reserves (IOER) and help control short-term interest rates. We examine some potentially important secondary effects of an ON RRP facility, both positive and negative, including impacts on the structure of short-term funding markets and financial stability. We also investigate design features of an ON RRP facility that could mitigate secondary effects deemed undesirable. Finally, we discuss tradeoffs that policymakers may face in designing an ON RRP facility, as they seek to balance the objectives of setting an effective floor on money market rates during the normalization process and limiting any adverse secondary effects...|$|R
5000|$|A dollar roll {{is similar}} to a <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> {{agreement}} and provides a form of collateralized short-term financing with mortgage-backed securities comprising the collateral. [...] The investor sells a mortgage-backed security for settlement on one date and buys it back for settlement at a later date. The investor gives up the principal and interest payments during the roll period, but can invest the proceeds and usually is able to buy back the mortgage for a lower price than the sale price. The difference in the prices is called the drop. The value of the drop plus interest earned on the proceeds of the sale less the forgone interest and principal payments on the mortgage is considered the roll specialness or financing advantage. With repurchase agreements exactly the same security is returned to the investor, while with dollar rolls the investor buys a substantially similar—but not necessarily identical—security. This difference produces complex results under certain areas of the United States Internal Revenue Code.|$|R
50|$|Rehypothecation can be {{involved}} in repurchase agreements, commonly called repos. In a two-party repurchase agreement, one party sells to the other a security at a price with a commitment to buy the security back {{at a later date}} for another price. Overnight repurchase agreements, the most commonly used form of this arrangement, comprise a sale which takes place the first day and a <b>repurchase</b> that <b>reverses</b> the transaction the next day. Term repurchase agreements, less commonly used, extend for a fixed period of time that may be as long as three months. Open-ended term repurchase agreements are also possible. A so-called reverse repo is not actually any different to a repo; it merely describes {{the opposite side of the}} transaction. The seller of the security who later repurchases it is entering into a repurchase agreement; the purchaser who later re-sells the security enters into a <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> agreement. Notwithstanding its nominal form as a sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, the economic effect of a repurchase agreement is that of a secured loan.|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{whether the}} {{inclusion}} of the output gap in the central bank's estimated reaction function would improve the conduct of inflation targeting in the Philippines. A reduced-form vector autoregression model was constructed using exchange rate, output gap, inflation, and interest rate as the relevant variables. The authors use two measures for the short-term interest rate: the <b>reverse</b> <b>repurchase</b> rate and the T-bill rate. Results from counterfactual simulations show that the adoption of a Taylor-type rule, which involves the use of the output gap, minimizes the deviations of inflation from its target. Based on the empirical results of this study, {{the inclusion of}} the output gap is significant in terms of its contribution to maintaining inflation at a level that is nearer to the desired target. It is recommended that further studies consider the use of output gap estimates derived from other procedures, especially those that employ Markov-regime switching techniques, which could account for shocks in the economy. In addition, the use of alternative model-representations for the Philippine economy within which counterfactual simulations may be performed is recommended as an area for future research. inflation, inflation targeting, monetary policy...|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fed, the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright. The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in <b>reverse</b> transactions: <b>repurchase</b> agreements, or collateralised loans. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature.

While it brings stabilizing effects to the individual lender we argue that it may exacerbate systemic risk through margin call activation. We show how a liquidity shock to the cash lender may propagate as a solvency shock via liquidity hoarding even if the cash lender remains solvent in all states of nature. Albeit a cost-effective response of the cash lender to a liquidity shock, liquidity hoarding may lead to the bankruptcy of its repo counterparties triggering contagion across asset classes.

40|$|In {{response}} to the current global crisis, the U. S. Federal Reserve and other central banks {{around the world have}} implemented diverse policy measures, including purchasing a wide range of securities, lending to financial institutions, intervening in foreign exchange markets, and paying interest on reserves. Some central banks have also reduced monetary policy interest rates to minimum levels (reaching a lower bound) and have announced an explicit commitment to keep interest rates there for a prolonged period. This set of instruments contrasts with a conventional view—embedded in the predominant monetary policy models—in which a central bank controls only a short-term interest rate, such as the Federal Funds rate. Some of the previous actions may be classified as responses to increasing demand for liquidity in a context of enormous financial uncertainty. Examples of this liquidity provisioning by central banks are the <b>repurchase</b> <b>operations</b> initiated in many economies to provide U. S. dollar liquidity during the period surrounding the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Other actions may be sorted into those attempting to deal with malfunctioning financial markets (insufficient lending to nonfinancial firms or high lending spreads) and those attempting to enhance the monetary policy stimulus under the lower-bound constraint [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Both the {{objective}} and {{the powers of}} the central bank are clearly specified in its legal framework. In this respect, its aims and activities are transparent and explicit. Monetary policy influences the monetary aggregates through market instruments, sending clear signals to economic agents regarding the direction and objectives pursued. Despite major changes in monetary policy management, policy implementation still encounters problems. The main problems are: • A modest quantity of money: total liquidity (including deposits in local and foreign currency), i. e. the quantity of money in circulation in the economy, is equal to just over 180 / 0 of GDP {{with a high degree of}} dollarisation (almost 75 0 / 0 of total deposits is in foreign currency). The persistently low level of local currency means that seasonal liquidity flows, generated for example by tax payments, can become quite large in relative terms. • The central bank’s capacity to buy foreign exchange is restricted by the cost of sterilisation. This may induce a rise in interest rates, in turn attracting larger foreign capital inflows and leading to an appreciation of the exchange rate. • The dealing room’s intervention strategy has improved; however, it is still restricted to buy dollars, while maintaining a passive stance when the market requires a larger dollar supply. • Financial market segmentation: the financial market is made up of groups of institutions of widely different size and performance. Interinstitutional behaviour is therefore not homogeneous. Market segmentation creates situations in which the system as a whole can show a liquidity surplus, while on an individual basis some banks are encountering liquidity problems. Institutions with liquidity problems do not have access to interbank loans, owing either to the market’s inefficiency or to the institution’s specific situation. This creates a need for collateralised credits, bringing about an increase in the monetary base, despite the excess reserves in the system as a whole. As these entities’ demand for central bank CDs is usually small, the scope for <b>repurchase</b> <b>operations</b> as a source of funds is limited. ...|$|R
