The increase in growth <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> 50 per cent from 1971 to 1981 is due to the city's upgrade to a municipal corporation in 1974 and the subsequent inclusion of 13 Panchayats into the corporation limits. The decline in the population growth rate between 1981 and 2001 is due to the bifurcation of Madurai district into two, Madurai and Dindigul in 1984, and the subsequently of part of the city into the Theni district in 1997.

5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages, the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{widening}} the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved {{the construction of}} a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this solution would cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was designed to look largely the same as the original.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Beat-transfer <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> a 5 cm {{diameter}} dry ice spbere for Macb numbers 1. 86, 2. 87, and 4. 25 {{were determined}} from ablation experiments.

Beat-transfer <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> the subliming model calculated from mass ablation <b>rates</b> were found <b>to</b> be {{two to three times}} as great as heat-transfer <b>rates</b> <b>to</b> non-evaporative models when only convection was considered. This report shows tbat beat conduction effects internal to tbe dry ice model are significant, especially at tbe highest Mach number tested, where tbe greatest change in environmental pressure occurred. Other factors contribu-ting to tbe large heat-transfer rates in the subliming models are: (1) change in model shape during blow; (2) increase in surface roughness during blow; and (3) loss of mass witbout beat transfer through fragmentation.
