5|$|Apical abscesses {{can spread}} to involve {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E

5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth.

40|$|Objective. In this study, {{presence}} of dentin infection in <b>root</b> <b>canals,</b> obturated with 4 techniques {{submitted to the}} bacterial leakage test, was evaluated using histologic methods. Study design. The <b>canals</b> of palatal <b>roots</b> of 160 molars were instrumented and divided into different groups, according to the obturation technique used (lateral condensation, MicroSeal system, Touch `n Heat + Ultrafil, and Tagger`s hybrid technique) and extent of the remaining obturation material (5 mm and 10 mm). Ten additional roots were used as control samples. The roots were sterilized in ethylene oxide and mounted on a device for evaluation of bacterial leakage using the bacteria Enterococcus faecalis for 120 days. After the leakage test, roots were microscopically analyzed for the {{presence of}} dentin infection in the <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> and dentinal tubules. Results. A total of 154 specimens were analyzed using both methodologies in the experimental groups; 50 <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> (32. 4 %) showed bacterial leakage {{at the end of the}} experimental period, and 118 (76. 6 %) showed the presence of bacteria in the <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> using the histologic criteria.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the frequency of <b>roots,</b> <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> and apical foramina in human permanent teeth using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). CBCT images of 1, 400 teeth from database previously evaluated were used to determine the frequency of number of <b>roots,</b> <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> and apical foramina. All teeth were evaluated by preview of the planes sagittal, axial, and coronal. Navigation in axial slices of 0. 1 mm/ 0. 1 mm followed the coronal to apical direction, as well as the apical to coronal direction. Two examiners assessed all CBCT images. Statistical data were analyzed including frequency distribution and cross-tabulation. The highest frequency of four <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> and four apical foramina was found in maxillary first molars (76 %, 33 %, respectively), followed by maxillary second molars (41 %, 25 %, respectively). The frequency of four <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> in mandibular first molars was 51 %. Mandibular first premolars had two <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> and two apical foramina in 29 % and 20 % of the cases, respectively.

The best drug for immobilizing a tiger is CI 744, but a few tigers, white ones in particular, undergo a re-sedation effect 24–36 hours later.

25|$|Preventive dental {{treatment}} {{is also necessary}} (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence, phenotype, and genotype of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from saliva and <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> in patients with endodontic treatment failure. Methods: Samples were collected from 32 adults undergoing retreatment for periapical lesions after endodontic treatment performed at least 2 years previously. Isolates that were presumed to be E. faecalis were identified by both API 20 Strep kits and 16 S rRNA sequencing. Phenotypic tests for hemolysin and gelatinase production and antibiotic susceptibility were performed. Genotype analysis comprised virulence gene detection and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: The prevalence of E. faecalis was 18. 8 % in saliva and 40. 6 % in <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> (P =. 666, Fisher exact test).

25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
500|$|Dental caries, if left untreated, {{follows a}} {{predictable}} natural history as it nears the pulp of the tooth. [...] First it causes reversible pulpitis, which transitions to irreversible pulpitis, then to necrosis, then to necrosis with periapical periodontitis and, finally, to necrosis with periapical abscess. [...] Reversible pulpitis can be stopped by {{removal of the}} cavity and the placement of a sedative dressing of {{any part of the}} cavity that is near the pulp chamber. [...] Irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis are treated with either <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy or extraction. [...] Infection of the periapical tissue will generally resolve with the treatment of the pulp, unless it has expanded to cellulitis or a radicular cyst. [...] The success rate of restorative treatment and sedative dressings in reversible pulpitis, depends on the extent of the disease, as well as several technical factors, such as the sedative agent used and whether a rubber dam was used. [...] The success rate of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment also depends on the degree of disease (<b>root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy for irreversible pulpitis has a generally higher success rate than necrosis with periapical abscess) and many other technical factors.|$|E
500|$|In pulpitis, an {{important}} distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp {{to return to a}} state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. [...] Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of regenerative endodontics is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatments have lower success rates.|$|E
