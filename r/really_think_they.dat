500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning praised 30 Rock {{for putting}} {{it all together}} [...] "so seamlessly" [...] and [...] "so brilliantly balanced" [...] in [...] "Señor Macho Solo". Canning enjoyed Tracy's story, observing {{that it was a}} [...] "fantastic Tracy Jordan moment." [...] He complimented Sherri Shepherd's guest spot, writing that it was a great way to bring her back [...] "into the mix". He also liked that this episode [...] "delivered some great work" [...] from Alec Baldwin. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.3 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger appreciated Jenna's subplot as it was [...] "the first really work-centric one in a while." [...] He complimented Peter Dinklage's appearance, but was less enthusiastic about Salma Hayek being a love interest for Baldwin's Jack, citing that he did not buy her in the Elisa role. Kona Gallagher of AOL's TV Squad said that Dinklage, Hayek, and Shepherd [...] "fit into the episode, instead of feeling like the episode was written around them." [...] Gallagher noted that Dinklage was [...] "pretty awesome" [...] as Tina Fey's love interest, [...] "and I would have loved to see more of them together. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> could have done more with this storyline." [...] According to Gallagher, the only part of [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] that she was not [...] "crazy about" [...] was Jenna playing Janis Joplin.|$|E

60|$|I {{have turned}} this chapter into {{something}} like a defence of interviewers, because I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are made to bear {{too much of the}} burden of the bad developments of modern journalism. But I am very far from meaning to suggest that those bad developments are not very bad. So far from wishing to minimise the evil, I would in a real sense rather magnify it. I would suggest that the evil itself is a much larger and more fundamental thing; and that to deal with it by abusing poor journalists, doing their particular and perhaps peculiar duty, is like dealing with a pestilence by rubbing at one of the spots. What is wrong with the modern world will not be righted by attributing the whole disease to each of its symptoms in turn; first to the tavern and then to the cinema and then to the reporter's room. The evil of journalism is not in the journalists. It is not in the poor men on the lower level of the profession, but in the rich men {{at the top of the}} profession; or rather in the rich men who are too much on top of the profession even to belong to it. The trouble with newspapers is the Newspaper Trust, as the trouble might be with a Wheat Trust, without involving a vilification of all the people who grow wheat. It is the American plutocracy and not the American press. What is the matter with the modern world is not modern headlines or modern films or modern machinery. What is the matter with the modern world is the modern world; and the cure will come from another.|$|E

6000|$|... "But don't you think," [...] said Pheasant, [...] "that {{a certain}} fixed dress, marking the unworldly {{character}} of a religious order, is desirable? Now, I have said before that I am very fond of dress. I {{have a passion for}} beauty and completeness in it; and as long as I am in the world and obliged to dress as the world does, it constantly haunts me, and tempts me to give more time, more thought, more money, to these things than I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are worth. But I can conceive of giving up this thing altogether as being much easier than regulating it to the precise point. I never read of a nun's taking the veil without a certain thrill of sympathy. To cut off one's hair, to take off and cast from her, one by one, all one's trinkets and jewels, to lie down and have the pall thrown over one, and feel one's self once for all dead to the world,--I cannot help feeling as if this were real, thorough, noble renunciation, and as if one might rise up from it with a grand, calm consciousness of having risen to a higher and purer atmosphere, and got above all the littlenesses and distractions that beset us here. So I have heard charming young Quaker girls, who in more thoughtless days indulged in what for them was a slight shading of worldly conformity, say that it was to them a blessed rest when they put on the strict, plain dress, and felt that they really had taken up the cross and turned their backs on the world. I can conceive of doing this, much more easily than I can of striking the exact line between worldly conformity and noble aspiration, in the life I live now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 28. Well, but I {{must answer}} this letter of our MD's. Saturday approaches, and I han't written down this side. O, faith, Presto {{has been a}} sort of a lazy fellow: but Presto will remove to town this day se'ennight; the Secretary has {{commanded}} me to do so; and I believe he and I shall go for some days to Windsor, where he will have leisure to mind some business we have together. To-day, our Society (it must not be called a Club) dined at Mr. Secretary's: we were but eight; the rest sent excuses, or were out of town. We sat till eight, and made some laws and settlements; and then I went to take leave of Lady Ashburnham, who goes out of town to-morrow, as a great many of my acquaintance are already, and left the town very thin. I shall make but short journeys this summer, and not be long out of London. The days are grown sensibly short already, all our fruit blasted. Your Duke of Ormond is still at Chester; and perhaps this letter will be with you as soon as he. Sterne's business is quite blown up: they stand to it to send him back to the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland for a reference, and all my credit could not alter it, though I almost fell out with the secretary of the Treasury,(12) who is my Lord Treasurer's cousin-germain, and my very good friend. It seems every step he has hitherto taken hath been wrong; at least they say so, and that is the same thing. I am heartily sorry for it; and I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are in the wrong, and use him hardly; but I can do no more.|$|E
60|$|For {{some months}} the {{relatives}} and friends, and I myself, felt sad misgivings on my poor mistress's account. We doubted {{if it was}} possible, with such a quick, sensitive nature as hers, that she could support the shock which had been inflicted on her. But our powers of endurance are, as I have learned to believe, more often equal to the burdens laid upon us than we are apt to imagine. I have seen many surprising recoveries from illness after all hope had been lost, and I have lived to see my mistress recover from the grief and terror which we once thought would prove fatal to her. It was long before she began to hold up her head again; but care and kindness, and time and change wrought their effect on her at last. She is not now, {{and never will be}} again, the woman she was once; her manner is altered, and she looks older by many a year than she really is. But her health causes us no anxiety now; her spirits are calm and equal, and I have good hope that many quiet years of service in her house are left for me still. I myself have married during the long interval of time which I am now passing over in a few words. This change in my life is, perhaps, not worth mentioning, but I am reminded of my two little children when I speak of my mistress in her present position. I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> make the great happiness, and interest, and amusement of her life, and prevent her from feeling lonely and dried up at heart. It is a pleasant reflection to me to remember this, and perhaps it may be the same to you, for which reason only I speak of it.|$|E

60|$|This {{is one of}} the points, I think, {{on which}} {{something}} might really be said for Lord Roberts and his rather vague ideas which vary between rifle clubs and conscription. Whatever may be the advantages or disadvantages otherwise of the idea, it is at least an idea of procuring equality and a sort of average in the athletic capacity of the people; it might conceivably act as a corrective to our mere tendency to see ourselves in certain exceptional athletes. As it is, there are millions of Englishmen who <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> are a muscular race because C.B. Fry is an Englishman.
