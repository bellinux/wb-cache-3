25|$|Despite its simplicity, {{the system}} {{achieves}} an impressive diversity of behavior, fluctuating between apparent randomness and order. One {{of the most}} apparent features of the Game of Life is the frequent occurrence of gliders, arrangements of cells that essentially move themselves across the grid. It is possible to arrange the automaton so that the gliders interact to perform computations, and after much effort {{it has been shown}} that the Game of Life can emulate a universal Turing machine. It was viewed as a largely recreational topic, and little follow-up work was done outside of investigating the particularities of the Game of Life and a few <b>related</b> <b>rules</b> in the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|When Seligman {{inquired about}} the Waruge {{divisions}} of the Vedar, most of them did not remember their clan origins. Of those who remembered, most self-identified as Ura Waruge. Others mentioned clans such as Ogatam, Kavatam, Umatam, Aembalaneduwe and Aembale. They also had memories of other clans such as Morana and Unapana. [...] By the 1980s the Vedar {{had no knowledge of}} any word Waruge, although they vaguely used the Tamil term Vamisam (family origin) to indicate some division amongst them. Some had come up with a two-fold division of the Vedars based on the Kuti or matrilineal descent system popular in the East coast. These Kutis were supposed to have descended from former local chiefs called Vanniyar, who had ruled feudal divisions called Vannimai. But these clan divisions and <b>related</b> <b>rules</b> of endogamy were not totally followed by all Vedar, and there no practical prohibitions from marrying from each Kuti.|$|E

40|$|The current set {{of studies}} aimed to examine reward related {{learning}} on the Iowa gambling task (IGT) in {{younger and older}} healthy adults as well as patients with brain injury. The studies look at the relationship of reward-based learning, non-reward <b>related</b> <b>rule</b> learning, emotion processes, and executive function abilities. The investigations also examine neural correlates of reward-based learning using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with brain-injured patients and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) method with younger healthy adults. No significant age related effects were found on IGT performance. A significant positive association was found for IGT performance and classification of positive valence pictures while controlling for apathy scale scores. Mapping of grey matter correlates of early learning for reward-based learning (IGT) and non-reward <b>related</b> <b>rule</b> learning (BRFS) revealed a similar left frontal pole neural correlate for both tasks and the differential right caudate association for reward-based learning on the IGT. For the fMRI investigation, general decision-making on the IGT in healthy younger adults involved left orbitofrontal cortex, right anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal gyrus. Learning in the IGT involved the right cerebellum, left frontal pole, and left caudate. Amygdala involvement was also found...|$|R
