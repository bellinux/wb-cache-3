50|$|Louis Désiré Auguste Rustin (1880-1954) was a French cyclist and {{repairer}} of tyres in Paris {{who invented}} the <b>puncture</b> <b>patch.</b> Car and bicycle tyres had until then been complicated to mend after the inner tube, which held the air, had been penetrated through the outer tyre by a flint or other sharp object. Rustine’s solution was a small disc of thin rubber {{to stick to the}} inner tube over the hole. He patented his invention in 1921 and presented it {{at a meeting of the}} Touring Club de France in 1922. <b>Puncture</b> <b>patches</b> are still commonly known in France as rustines.|$|R
5000|$|Rustin {{expanded}} {{into other areas}} of the rubber industry in the 1950s and still makes <b>puncture</b> <b>patches</b> today. It is run by Rustin's descendants and it has kept the original marketing slogan: “ Joined for life ” ...|$|R
50|$|Rustin’s {{business}} employed 90 {{people at}} Clichy, {{where he had}} three workshops. It was making 28 million <b>puncture</b> <b>patches</b> a month by 1933. It moved to a larger factory in the Loir valley between Tours and Le Mans. Work stopped during the German occupation of France between 1940 and 1944. Work restarted and production increased rapidly from 1947, the company employing up to 250 people.|$|R
50|$|The {{repair of}} inner tubes may be {{necessary}} on the road. Several methods exist to locate a small puncture, including submersion in water with dish soap, but without a bowl of water available, the simplest method may be to inflate the tube until air can be felt escaping from the puncture. Once located, the puncture is cleaned, and a patch applied (see Louis Rustin for {{the invention of the}} <b>puncture</b> <b>patch).</b> Note that tire valves may also become damaged. In this case, repair of the inner tube will not be possible, and the tube should be replaced.|$|R
50|$|Rustin {{developed}} his ideas from 1908 with his colleague, Jean Larroque, registering a first patent, number 397 424, on December 15, 1908. Research {{ended with the}} start of World War I in 1914. Rustin fought in the army, {{then returned to the}} tyre industry after demobilisation, opening a workshop at 16 rue du Bois in Clichy (now the rue Henri Barbusse). It was there that he made the first modern <b>puncture</b> <b>patch,</b> a thin circular patch of flexible rubber that was already coated with a gum that {{did not need to be}} heated. He patented his invention, offering “ instant repair of inner tubes without solutions, without petrol, without anything ” The patent covered the patch, the dry fixative attached to it, and the protective bands which kept the patch clean until they were removed just before the repair.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{practical}} {{pneumatic tire}} {{was made by}} John Boyd Dunlop in 1887 for his son's bicycle, {{in an effort to}} prevent the headaches his son had while riding on rough roads. (Dunlop's patent was later declared invalid because of prior art by fellow Scot Robert William Thomson.) Dunlop is credited with [...] "realizing rubber could withstand the wear and tear of being a tire while retaining its resilience". This led to the founding of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd in 1889. By 1890, it began adding a tough canvas layer to the <b>rubber</b> to reduce <b>punctures.</b> Racers quickly adopted the pneumatic tire for the increase in speed it enabled.|$|R
40|$|The species {{described}} in this Note and dedicated to the late Dr. E. Candèze of Glain near Liege is very interesting necessitating {{the establishment of a}} new section in my Synopsis of the species of this genus 1). It belongs to the division I (base of elytra coloured as the apex), A (elytra with four convex flavous spots), b (pronotum finely and evenly <b>punctured,</b> without raised <b>patches),</b> but it has the prosternum neither entirely fulvous (α), nor fulvous in the middle with the lateral portions metallic green (β) : in the new species the prosternum is entirely of a dark metallic green colour...|$|R
2500|$|Vacutainer needle are double ended, {{with one}} side being {{encased in a}} thin rubber coating for safety. When the needle is screwed into the {{translucent}} plastic needle holder, the rubber needle is inside the holder, and the exposed needle will be inserted into the vein. When a Vacutainer tube is inserted into the holder, its <b>rubber</b> cap is <b>punctured</b> by the inner needle and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing.|$|R
5000|$|When Krapp’s mother died, he was {{throwing}} a ball {{for a little}} white dog. He says he will keep it forever: [...] "But I gave it away to the dog." [...] Significantly the ball is black to contrast with {{the white of the}} dog. In All Strange Away a [...] "small grey <b>punctured</b> <b>rubber</b> ball" [...] is the last object contemplated before Fancy dies. The ball had already appeared in All That Fall: Jerry returns [...] "a kind of ball" [...] to Mr. Rooney. Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant motif of childhood grief for Beckett though none of his biographers propose that the presence of the dog is anything more than artistic license.|$|R
50|$|Air bag or air strut {{failure is}} usually caused by wet rust, due to old age, or {{moisture}} within the air system that damages {{it from the}} inside. Air ride suspension parts may fail because <b>rubber</b> dries out. <b>Punctures</b> to the air bag may be caused from debris on the road. With custom applications, improper installation may cause the air bags to rub against the vehicle's frame or other surrounding parts, damaging it. The over-extension of an airspring which is not sufficiently constrained by other suspension components, such as a shock absorber, may also lead to the premature failure of an airspring through the tearing of the flexible layers. Failure of an airspring may also result in complete immobilization of the vehicle, since the vehicle will rub against the ground or be too high to move. However, most modern automotive systems have overcome many of these problems.|$|R
50|$|Dudukalo {{started on}} pole {{position}} for a race which would be known for its multiple tyre issues. Both Dudukalo and his Lukoil Racing Team team mate Tarquini had to pit for fresh <b>rubber</b> due to <b>punctures</b> and Tiago Monteiro retired following a left-front puncture. After this, the three Chevrolets led until Menu went into the gravel on lap eight with a puncture. Shortly after, race one independent winner MacDowall also had a puncture and stopped in the gravel next to Menu's stranded car. The remaining Chevrolets of Muller and Huff comfortably led the BMW pair of Coronel and D'Aste until the final lap when Muller went off at turn 10 with a puncture and Huff suffered a puncture at the final corner. Coronel tried to go up the inside of Huff without success, allowing D'Aste to overtake the pair of them and take the win. Huff held off Coronel despite his puncture to take second.|$|R
40|$|Postdural {{puncture}} headache (PDPH) {{has been}} a problem for patients, following dural puncture, since August Bier reported the first case in 1898. His paper discussed the pathophysiology of low-pressure headache resulting from leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid to the epidural space. Clinical and laboratory research over the last 30 years has shown that use of small-gauge needles, particularly of the pencil-point design, is associated with a lower risk of PDPH than traditional cutting point needle tips (Quincke-point needle). A careful history can rule out other causes of headache. A postural component of headache is {{the sine qua non of}} PDPH. In high-risk patients, for example, age < 50 years, postpartum, large-gauge needle <b>puncture,</b> epidural blood <b>patch</b> should be performed within 24 – 48 [*]h of dural puncture. The optimum volume of blood has been shown to be 12 – 20 [*]mL for adult patients. Complications of AEBP are rare...|$|R
40|$|Reuse of {{improperly}} sterilized steel hypodermic needles is {{a leading}} factor in cross infection of diseases between people in specific groups such as patients in developing countries and drug addicts. Disablement after single use is a potential strategy to reduce disease spreading, but disablement of expensive steel needles requires specialized equipment and is a concern in developing countries. Needles made using micromolded polymer are {{examined in this study}} as a potential replacement for steel needles. Instead of using specialized tip cutting instruments for steel needles, soft polymer needles can be easily disabled. Material cost and processing temperature of polymer needles are lower than steel. However, further reduction of cost is limited due to the low production rate in conventional micro-molding. In this study, we analyzed the flow behavior of polymer in the micro-molding process using FEM and determined that runner length limits the production throughput. On the basis of the FEM results, we developed a high throughput, hot embossing production method with multi-parallel material delivery. This process allows multiple molding of needles in a single operation. Standard 22 gauge acetal polymer needles were successfully fabricated. Puncture and buckling tests were conducted to examine the mechanical behavior of the polymer needles on silicone <b>rubber.</b> The <b>puncture</b> load ranged between 1 – 1. 5 N. While this puncture load is higher than that required for commercial steel needles, it is below the critical buckling load of the polymer needles and is within the range of load suited for human administration. We conducted puncture tests using polymer needles and achieved 8 mm needle penetration in silicone rubber, which is the working range of hypodermic injections. The successful development of a high throughput fabrication method is demonstrated in this study and polymeric needles are shown to be suitable for use as a potentially low cost replacement for steel needles...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Rebound {{intracranial}} hypertension is a complication of epidural blood patching {{for treatment of}} intracranial hypotension characterized by increased intracranial pressure, resulting in potentially severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. Because the symptoms of rebound {{intracranial hypertension}} may bear some similarity to those of intracranial hypotension and literature reports of rebound intracranial hypertension are limited, it may be mistaken for refractory intracranial hypotension, leading to inappropriate management. This clinical report of 9 patients with confirmed rebound intracranial hypertension reviews the clinical characteristics of patients with this condition, emphasizing factors that {{can be helpful in}} discriminating rebound intracranial hypertension from refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and discusses treatment. ABBREVIATIONS: SIH spontaneous intracranial hypotension; RIH rebound intracranial hypertension; EBP epidural blood patching; LP lumbar <b>puncture</b> Epidural blood <b>patching</b> (EBP) is considered by many authorsto be the treatment of choice in cases of spontaneous intracra-nial hypotension (SIH). 1 - 3 Prior investigations have predomi-nantly focused on the diagnostic evaluation of spontaneous intra-cranial hypotension, optimal methods for localizing the CSF leak, and various approaches to performing epidural blood patching. Relatively less attention has been paid, however, to the postpro...|$|R
40|$|Efficacy of Compound 1080 LP Collars was studied under pen {{and field}} conditions. Coyotes {{poisoned}} themselves by attacking collared sheep and biting the collars. In 54 pen tests where 1 or 2 captive coyotes had opportunity to attack 1 collared lamb, 41 lambs were attacked and 26 collars were punctured. Of 25 different coyotes offered lambs with collars containing 5 or 10 mg sodium fluoroacetate (FAC) /ml, 23 coyotes attacked and 21 died after collars were punctured {{in their first}} (n = 17), second (n = 3), or fifth (n = 1) test. For 11 captive coyotes that <b>punctured</b> <b>rubber</b> collars, the average time to death was 217 min (range 115 to 436 min). Collars were placed on approximately 3 percent of the sheep on 4 Idaho and 7 Montana sheep ranches. Coyotes attacked 67 uncollared and 68 collared sheep, punctured 32 collars, and may have punctured 2 other collars that were not found. Documented rates of collar puncture were 48 % for all attacks on collared sheep and 64 % for neck-throat attacks. Eight collars were punctured on fences, thorns or brush. All coyotes that punctured collars probably died, but only 3 dead coyotes were found. Adverse impacts on humans, domestic animals, and nontarget wildlife were not seen. The LP Collar is a safe, effective, and selective technique for removing coyotes that attack sheep...|$|R
40|$|No reports exist {{concerning}} in vivo {{optical coherence tomography}} {{visualization of}} the epidural space and the blood patch process in the epidural space. In this study, we produced real-time two-dimensional and reconstructed three-dimensional images of the epidural space by using optical coherence tomography in a porcine model. We also aimed to produce three-dimensional optical coherence tomography images of the dura <b>puncture</b> and blood <b>patch</b> process. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional optical coherence tomography images were obtained using a swept source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) system. Four laboratory pigs were intubated and ventilated after the induction of general anesthesia. An 18 -gauge Tuohy needle {{was used as a}} tunnel for the optical coherence tomography probe to the epidural space. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional reconstruction optical coherence tomography images of the epidural space were acquired in four stages. In stage 1, real-time two-dimensional and reconstructed three-dimensional optical coherence tomography of the lumbar and thoracic epidural space were successfully acquired. In stage 2, the epidural catheter in the epidural space was successfully traced in the 3 D optical coherence tomography images. In stage 3, water injection and lumbar puncture were successfully monitored in all study animals. In stage 4, 10 mL of fresh blood was injected into the epidural space and two-dimensional and three-dimensional optical coherence tomography images were successfully acquired. These animal experiments suggest the potential capability of using an optical coherence tomography-based imaging needle in the directed two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization of the epidural space. More investigations involving humans are required before optical coherence tomography can be recommended for routine use. However, three-dimensional optical coherence tomography may provide a novel, minimally invasive, and safe way to observe the spinal epidural space, epidural catheter, lumbar puncture hole, and blood patch...|$|R
