Unfortunately, the problem of connectivity loss, which may occur when a network suffers from natural disasters or human sabotages, may cause failure in data aggregation.

However, all of them assume that either the landforms of target areas are flat or there are sufficient <b>relay</b> <b>devices.</b> In real scenarios, such assumptions are not realistic.

Calhoun acquires a newly charged power cell from the lab's sub-basement and delivers it to Rosenberg and the others. Dr. Rosenberg then initiates the system and brings it online. They all narrowly avoid the military's invasion of the prototype labs, teleporting to the safety of an unnoticed access tunnel. They get into an SUV and leave Black Mesa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The 60 GHz {{technology}} {{has a great}} potential to provide wireless communication at multi-gigabit rates in future home networks. To maintain the network connectivity with 60 GHz links, which are highly susceptible to propagation and penetration losses, is a major challenge. The quality and the robustness of the 60 GHz links can be improved by employing relay nodes in the network. In this paper, the contribution of relaying to the connectivity {{and the quality of}} the 60 GHz radio links is studied by modeling three indoor scenarios. It is analytically and through simulations shown that having a relay node in a 60 GHz network decreases the average free-space path loss 33 % in the worst case scenario. The effects of <b>relay</b> <b>device</b> position and the obstacle density on the improvement of the average received signal level are investigated with a verified 3 D ray tracing tool. A comparative simulation study on the performance of different relay configurations under various network conditions is conducted. The results yield that even a single <b>relay</b> <b>device</b> positioned at the height of other nodes can improve 50 % of the links in considerable levels in a 60 GHz indoor network. It is also shown that additional relay nodes do not contribute to 60 GHz indoor connectivity significantly, if there are two properly positioned relay devices in a network which is moderately populated...|$|E
