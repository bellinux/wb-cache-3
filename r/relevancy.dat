With a semantic layer {{on the top of the}} existing data pools, TMs provide information interpretation and organization. However, user interaction with technology is still undeveloped and too explicit. This paper introduces SocioTM model; an extension of TM paradigm that includes <b>relevancies,</b> collaboration, and socio-knowledge (user-specific knowledge / behaviors). Paper goes through <b>relevancies</b> implementation in SocioTM; <b>relevancies</b> building and population; <b>relevancies</b> interpretation, presentation; and navigation through SocioTM. <b>Relevancies</b> are introduced both on topic/ontology level and information (occurrences) level. Paper concludes with collaboration involvement in SocioTM building and with migration of socio-knowledge...|$|R

30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{can provide}} valuable information {{for a lot}} of measurement, tracking, surveillance, automation, and general-purpose monitoring applications. Information as humidity, temperature, pressure, infrared images, and noises will be sensed and packetized for distribution over the network, but corruption during transmission may compromise the accuracy of the retrieved information and even put people in danger. In fact, the sensed data may have different <b>relevancies</b> for the applications, altering the impact of packet corruptions. We propose a relevance-based partially reliable transmission approach to provide data delivery with different reliability guaranties, exploiting the <b>relevancies</b> of transmitted data when choosing the proper error recovery service. In this context, some error scenarios are investigated, considering different configurations of error bursts. We expect that the proposed partially reliable transmission mechanism can save energy over the network while assuring acceptable quality for sensing monitoring.|$|R

25|$|Although analogies {{have been}} drawn between Buddhism and Christianity, there are {{differences}} between the two religions beginning with monotheism's place at the core of Christianity, and Buddhism's orientation towards non-theism (the lack of <b>relevancy</b> of the existence of a creator deity) which runs counter to teachings about God in Christianity; and extending to the importance of grace in Christianity against the rejection of interference with karma in Theravada Buddhism, etc. Another difference between the two traditions is the Christian belief in the centrality of the crucifixion of Jesus as a single event that some believe acts as the atonement of sins, and its direct contrast to Buddhist teachings.|$|E
30|$|In this context, {{we propose}} a {{partially}} reliable transmission approach for improved energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks. The <b>relevancies</b> of sensed {{information for the}} application will be considered when providing the appropriate transmission service. However, {{in a different way}} of [29], the proposed approach is generic and suitable for any kind of WSN and not only wireless image sensor networks. In our previous work [31], sensed data is classified into two different levels of relevance, where full-reliable transmission is only required for critical data while the remaining data is transmitted under a semi-reliable service. In a different way, we propose herein different transmission mechanisms for three classes of data <b>relevancies.</b> Moreover, we define the concept of error zones and investigate the performance of semi-reliable retransmission and packet-level redundancy over different configurations. As we are providing a relevance-based partially reliable transmission service, we expect to outperform retransmission approaches based only on full-reliable data delivery, as in [12 – 14, 19], when applications can tolerate some lower relevance packet losses for higher energy efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, such approach has not been proposed before.|$|R
30|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} optimize WSN operation {{is to consider}} different <b>relevancies</b> for the transmitted data. And data packets with different <b>relevancies</b> can be transmitted under different transmission services, with optimized reliability, availability, timeliness, and security. Some of those approaches differentiate transmitted data by the potential of source nodes to provide relevant information for the applications. In [27], a methodology for source prioritization is proposed to differentiate source nodes in five groups of relevance. In such case, packets transmitted from high-relevance source nodes may be transmitted under a full-reliable service. A similar approach is discussed in [28]. On the other hand, sometimes we can prioritize {{the nature of the}} transmitted data for any packets' origins. In [29], a semi-reliable retransmission mechanism is proposed exploiting the relevance of packets' payloads, considering discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coding over image snapshots. In that approach, only DWT subbands that are highly required to reconstruct original images are transmitted under a full-reliable transmission service. In a different way, the work in [30] proposes reliability by redundancy with correction codes, optimizing transmission when the relevance of video frames for the reconstruction of the original data is considered when defining the expected level of reliability.|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{relevance}} determination (ARD) {{was applied}} to two-channel EOG recordings for microsleep event (MSE) recognition. 10 s immediately before MSE and also before counterexamples of fatigued, but attentive driving were analysed. Two type of signal features were extracted: the maximum cross correlation (MaxCC) and logarithmic power spectral densities (PSD) averaged in spectral bands of 0. 5 Hz width ranging between 0 and 8 Hz. Generalised learn-ing vector quantisation (GRLVQ) was used as ARD method to show the potential of feature reduction. This is compared to support-vector machines (SVM), in which the feature reduction plays a much smaller role. Cross validation yielded mean normalised <b>relevancies</b> of PSD features {{in the range of}} 1. 6 - 4. 9 % and 1. 9 - 10. 4 % for horizontal and vertical EOG, respectively. MaxCC <b>relevancies</b> were 0. 002 - 0. 006 % and 0. 002 - 0. 06 %, respectively. This shows that PSD features of vertical EOG are indispensable, whereas MaxCC can be neglected. Mean classification accuracies were estimated at 86. 6 ±b 1. 3 % and 92. 3 ±b 0. 2 % for GRLVQ and SVM, respec-tively. GRLVQ permits objective feature reduction by inclu-sion of all processing stages, but is not as accurate as SVM...|$|R
25|$|Although trial {{judges have}} always had the {{authority}} to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to Daubert, trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides. Once certain evidence has been excluded by a Daubert motion because it fails to meet the <b>relevancy</b> and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a Daubert motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under Daubert would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Some {{changes made}} to Internet search engines {{included}} that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google {{began to run}} a new system where the Google search became personalized.

Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using online advertising. A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests <b>relevancy</b> that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E
25|$|Human 15-LOX-1 prefers {{linoleic}} acid over arachidonic acid as its primary substrate, oxygenating it at carbon 13 to form 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecaenoic acid (13-HpODE or 13(S)-HpODE) which may then be reduce to the corresponding hydroxy derivative, 13(S)-HODE or 13-HODE (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid).

30|$|Active source nodes must {{properly}} classify each {{data packet}} before transmission. In this point, two important aspects must be remarked. First, some approach {{must be used}} to indicate the relevance of data packets, {{in order to allow}} the network to provide the expected transmission service. A reasonable approach for that is making every transmitted packet to use a special 2 -bit field to be included into the packets' headers. Such data relevance (DR) field would incur in very small additional overhead in most cases, and adding control information into data packets is already a common approach in wireless sensor networks [11, 35]. Second, source nodes must know the relevance of the information that is being transmitted by them. In fact, the relevance of the transmitted information depends on the application monitoring requirements, and thus, sensors may be previously configured in initial stages of the network lifetime. Other possibility is the use of dynamical mechanisms to compute the <b>relevancies</b> associated to the transmission flows, according to the interpretation of the packets received by the sink. As the monitoring requirements may change along the network operation, so may data <b>relevancies.</b> For such cases, centralized mechanisms as proposed in [27] could be employed.|$|R
