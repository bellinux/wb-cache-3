5|$|In 2006, Lexus {{incorporated}} the first production eight-speed automatic transmission {{in an automobile}} with the LS 460, and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. Continuously variable transmissions, <b>regenerative</b> <b>brakes,</b> and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models. In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains, catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance. Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED headlamps.|$|E
5|$|The MX3000 {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical innovations to the metro. <b>Regenerative</b> <b>brakes</b> allow the dynamic brakes to feed the braking energy back to the power system via the third rail. The passengers also have air conditioning. The driver's cabs are more ergonomic than in the older models, and the mirrors to monitor the platforms have been replaced with cameras and screens. The trains' livery is white with gray detailing, instead of the former models' red with blue detailing. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and <b>regenerative</b> <b>brakes).</b> Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{advantages}} of the electric motor such as fast and precise torque response, the performance of the electric vehicle (EV) can be improved. During braking or driving on the cornering, the vehicle will over steer or under steer if a car turns by more or less than the amount commanded by the driver. To improve the stability of the small EV with four in-wheel motors, the differential <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> torque control is proposed. In this system, the <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> torque at each wheel will be controlled individually based on the value of slip ratio. If the slip ratio is greater than the optimum value, the <b>regenerative</b> <b>brake</b> will turn off. In this situation, the electric motor will not produce the <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> torque. Conversely, if the slip ratio lower than the optimum value, the <b>regenerative</b> <b>brake</b> will turn on and the electric motor will generate the <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> torque. In the numerical analysis, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the road condition is set to an icy road on the left tire and dry asphalt on the right tire. From the simulation results, the differential <b>regenerative</b> <b>braking</b> torque control can prevent the tire from lock-up and avoid the vehicle from skidding...|$|R
