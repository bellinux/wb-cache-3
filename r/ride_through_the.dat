5|$|On 12 January 2016, Alton Towers {{announced}} that Air would be re-themed as Galactica for the 2016 season and would include on-ride virtual reality headsets simulating a <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cosmos. The {{announcement was made}} at an event held at the Science Museum. Each seat on the roller coaster is fitted with a Samsung Gear VR headset and pouch. The virtual reality experience is optional, as guests can choose to ride without using the headsets. A promotional website was also released explaining {{more information about the}} ride and its new storyline. In late February 2016, the park {{announced that}} the official opening date would be 24 March 2016.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Muhammad Hassan (managed by Daivari). During Hassan's entrance, men in masks {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} ring to represent his Arabic culture. The masked men proceeded to interfered in the match, but Undertaker retaliated and removed all of the masked men from the ring. Midway through the match, Undertaker attempted to use a Tombstone piledriver on Hassan, but Hassan escaped the move and attempted a Clothesline. The Undertaker countered by chokeslamming Hassan and scored the pinfall on Hassan to win the match. Following this, Undertaker executed a Last <b>Ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> stage floor on Hassan, writing him out of storylines.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pilot remained unaired, {{although some}} footage {{from the original}} pilot {{was used in the}} first aired episode. This includes Sansa's scenes with Catelyn (Michelle Fairley's footage as Catelyn was inserted over Jennifer Ehle's performance), Will's <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods (retained though also portrayed by a different actor), most of the feast at Winterfell, and Ned and Robert's scene in the crypt.

5|$|The coaster's seven trains {{double the}} {{capacity}} of the traditional El Loco ride from 4 seats per train to 8 seats per train. The trains are articulated {{in such a way that}} the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the head rest. These speakers are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are harnessed to the <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> use of lap bars. The front of each car features a pulsing LED Green Lantern logo while the back of each car features the Green Lantern oath. All of these operational and thematic characteristics are new for this type of ride and were developed specifically for this coaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1260s, John {{returned}} to Europe, {{and there is}} evidence of his activity in Macedonia and Thessaly. He had estates in the valley of the river Strymon in Macedonia, and is attested in documents concerning the properties of monasteries in eastern Thessaly, which the Byzantines had probably recovered by that time, following the death of Michael II of Epirus in 1267/1268. John Doukas of Thessaly, however, remained one of the Empire's chief opponents, and Michael Palaiologos organized a campaign (variously dated to 1272/1273 or 1274/1275) to finally subdue him. It was a large-scale undertaking: an army of some 30,000 men, mostly mercenaries, was placed under the command of John Palaiologos and Alexios Kaballarios, while the land forces were to be aided by a fleet of over 70 vessels under Alexios Philanthropenos. The campaign was initially crowned with success, as the Byzantine army advanced quickly through Thessaly and besieged John Doukas at his capital Neopatras. The latter, however, was able to escape in secret, procure aid from the Duchy of Athens, and utterly defeat the besieging Byzantine army at the Battle of Neopatras. With his forces scattered, John Palaiologos retreated to the north; on his way, he learned of an attack by the Latin fleet on the Byzantine navy at Demetrias. Assembling whatever men he could find, the despotes led his troops in a forty-mile <b>ride,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> night, towards Demetrias. There they encountered the battle in full swing, and the Latins having the advantage. The arrival of fresh troops, however, tilted the balance, and the battle ended in a crushing Byzantine victory.|$|E

25|$|The evil {{side was}} to be {{dominated}} by Dragon Tower, a ruined castle home to a greedy fire-breathing dragon who hoarded a fabulous treasure in the tower chamber. The castle was also inhabited by bats who planned to rob the dragon of his riches. They were to enlist the guests' help in their scheme and whisk them off on a thrilling suspended roller coaster <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> castle ruins. The climax of the ride {{was to be}} an encounter with the evil dragon himself, resulting in a nearly barbecued train of guests.|$|E

He returned the Australian Mounted Division from EEF GHQ reserve and ordered Barrow's force consisting of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, the Yeomanry Mounted Division, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and Imperial Camel Brigades, part of the 2nd Australian Machine Gun Squadron and the light armoured car batteries, to hold their positions in the hills north of Beersheba.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the popular}} story, Godiva took pity {{on the people of}} Coventry, who were {{suffering}} grievously under her husband's oppressive taxation. She appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to remit the tolls. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of the town. Godiva took him at his word and, after issuing a proclamation that all persons should keep within doors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her long hair. In the end, Godiva's husband keeps his word and abolishes the onerous taxes. However, known facts do not corroborate the legend.|$|E

25|$|The shutdown, however, {{was not for}} long. Tourism to Alaska {{began to}} increase, with many cruise ships {{stopping}} at Skagway. The scenery of the White Pass route sounded like a great tourist draw; and the rails of the White Pass & Yukon Route were laid {{right down to the}} docks, even along them, for the former freight and cruise ship traffic. Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not even have to walk far.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} improved, so {{also did}} {{the kinds of}} innovative performances Tibbits {{was able to put}} on stage. Such obscure technologies as cinematoscopes and luminere cinematographs offered the promise of displaying moving pictures. Kleine's Lumiere Cinematograph promised families the chance to see their sons in the Spanish–American War march toward the camera. Thomas Edison's Magniscope never reached Coldwater because it exploded en route, but his Animotoscope did. Eventually the Lyman H. Howe Company offered genuine moving pictures with its Vivograph Graphophone, which depicted a train <b>ride</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Rocy Mountain's Frazer River Canyon. While such technologies had much to be desired in terms of quality, they were nonetheless important steps in the march toward the modern cinema.|$|E

25|$|Tralee Bay Wetlands and Nature Reserve: Tralee Bay Nature Reserve is {{a site of}} {{considerable}} international importance. It covers some 2,500 ha (8,000 acres) and stretches from Tralee town westwards to Fenit Harbour and Cloghane, encompassing Tralee Bay, Brandon Bay and the Magharees Peninsula. It includes extensive mudflats at the eastern end, the beaches of Derrymore Island, the sand dunes and lagoons of the Magharees Peninsula. Both the River Lee and Brandon (Owenmore) estuaries feature wide expanses of sheltered intertidal flats, often fringed with saltmarsh vegetation. The Wetlands Centre which opened in 2012 is designed as {{a microcosm of the}} wild nature reserve where visitors are introduced to the fresh and saltwater habitats.

Tweedside Gifts is located adjacent to the train station. Heatherdowns is also home to the Highland Stables featuring Scottish Blackface sheep, Border Collies, and Clydesdales. Guests can interact with the animals and see them in action as they demonstrate their skills during daily demonstrations. Guests can also have pictures with the Clydesdales. Prior to 2010, the stables were home to several of the Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales until the theme park unit of Anheuser-Busch was sold in 2009.
