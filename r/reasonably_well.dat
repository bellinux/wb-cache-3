5|$|His mother {{played the}} piano <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him {{assimilate}} into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein {{is said to have}} begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside preparatory {{school in}} Surrey as his elder {{brothers}} had done. For {{a child with}} no interest in sport he acquitted himself <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in cricket and rugby for the school. In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at classics, and excelled at English and divinity. Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice.|$|E
5|$|Skinner is {{a former}} Marine and a Vietnam War veteran. In the war he once killed a boy at a very short distance, an {{experience}} which has scarred him for life. He is married to Sharon Skinner. He has been treated at a sleep disorder clinic, suffering from recurring dreams of an old woman, which may either be a hallucination arising from drug use during Vietnam or a succubus. Skinner's hobbies include jogging and boxing, the latter {{of which has been}} shown in his ability to outfight Fox Mulder and X and to defend himself <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> when he was attacked by Alex Krycek and his men.|$|E
5|$|Stela 5 is <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> {{preserved}} and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> used, it was unpopular {{with the}} public, who objected to being obliged to pay tolls to use it. On 4 July 1857, {{almost a year}} before the bridge's opening, a {{demonstration}} against the tolls attracted 6,000 residents. Concerns were raised in Parliament that poorer industrial workers in Chelsea, which had no large parks of its own, would be unable to afford to use the new park in Battersea. Bowing to public pressure, shortly after the bridge opened Parliament declared it free to use for pedestrians on Sundays, and in 1875 it was also made toll-free on public holidays. Additionally, because the main lights were only turned on when Queen Victoria was staying in London, it was poorly used at night. Despite this, the new Battersea Park was extremely popular, particularly the sporting facilities; on 9 January 1864 the park staged the world's first official game of association football.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> established in the named organisms.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging and partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the gumball bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded Gumball title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ fared {{much better}} than the BZÖ in polls {{following}} the 2005 split, with the first tests in regional elections in Styria and Burgenland. On 23 April 2005 Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as new chairman of the FPÖ, taking over from interim leader Hilmar Kabas. As most of the party's office-seeking elite had gone over to the BZÖ, the FPÖ was again free from responsibility. Under Strache the party's ideology grew more radical, and it returned to its primary goal of vote-maximising. The FPÖ did <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in October's Vienna election, in which Strache was the leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a 14.9% share, while the BZÖ won just 1.2%.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss did {{not accept}} these resolutions of the Imperial Diet, and they {{explicitly}} refused to pay the common penny. They had no interest whatsoever in sending troops to serve in an army under Habsburg authority, nor in paying taxes, nor would they accept any foreign court's jurisdiction; and they had succeeded in securing public peace within their territories <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> by themselves. They simply considered the whole proposal a curtailing of their freedom. The Swiss were by far not the only members of the empire who {{refused to accept the}} resolutions, but Maximilian would use their refusal later as a pretext to place the Swiss Confederacy under an imperial ban (Reichsacht).|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War cost Brown his peak years, which he spent in the Royal Australian Air Force. Cricket resumed in 1945–46 and Brown, in Bradman's absence, captained an Australian eleven in a match that was retrospectively awarded Test status. Brown missed {{the entirety of the}} following season because of injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes. Selected for the Invincibles tour, he performed <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he batted out of position in the middle order during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, never to return. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland {{until the end of the}} 1949–50 season.|$|E
5|$|Wakefield's {{replacement}} as resident {{agent in}} Nelson for the New Zealand Company, William Fox, was a keen advocate of expansion for {{settlement in the}} area around Nelson. Fox authorised Heaphy and a surveyor to scout south-west to the Buller River in November 1843. In December 1843, Heaphy and two Māori trekked to what is now known as Golden Bay, and returned to Motueka via the coast, a journey which he regarded as the most difficult he had undertaken. Both expeditions failed to locate suitable land for settlement as did an expedition back to the Buller River in March 1845. Heaphy was <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> compensated for his exploration efforts and for additional funds, he undertook art commissions for Nelson's more wealthy residents.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{years of}} service, Eichelberger retired with {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} general on 31 December 1948. In 1950, he moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where {{he lived with his}} wife Em {{for the rest of his}} life. He suffered from a number of health problems, including hypertension and diabetes, and had his gall bladder removed. His name appeared in a series of articles for the Saturday Evening Post on his campaigns in the Southwest Pacific, actually written by ghostwriter Milton MacKaye. They subsequently expanded the articles into a book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo. The book sold <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> and Harry Truman and Omar Bradley requested autographed copies. In 1951 he traveled to Hollywood, where he served as technical consultant on Francis Goes to West Point (1952) and The Day the Band Played (1952), but he was not altogether happy with the results. He turned his hand to writing articles about the Far East for Newsweek, but gave this away in 1954. He then worked on the lecture circuit, giving speeches about his experiences, but gave this up too in 1955. He campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past, respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had {{input into the}} content and packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, was active in promoting his album. Shaved Fish and Blast from Your Past sold <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his production work for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a discount. The situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America {{it opened}} <b>reasonably</b> <b>well.</b> In Australia {{it was the}} highest-earning film in its opening weekend of October 9–12, 2008 with $2,104,319, ahead of Pixar Animation's Wall-E, which fell to second place, while Beverly Hills Chihuahua held third. In the United Kingdom, the film's {{earnings}} were the second-highest behind Quantum of Solace during November 21–23, its opening weekend. It earned £991,939 from 393 screens. Overall, while the film grossed only $40 million at the North American box office, it has grossed $115,097,286 worldwide. In the United States, contemporary war films have performed relatively poorly. Warner Bros. had hoped the large budget and Scott's direction could better them, but the film performed relatively poorly compared to his others; analysts attributed this to the film's Middle East setting and exploration of terrorism. Brandon Gray pointed out that people read these themes {{in the news media}} already, and there is a perception that Hollywood films are biased.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two Tests, Hutton shared three {{consecutive}} century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced {{the impression that he}} was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. The Sydney Morning Herald criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsillitis, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. Wisden noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself <b>reasonably</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{log-normal}} distribution has no negative values, can cover {{a wide range}} of values, and fits many observed size distributions <b>reasonably</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|In human languages, word {{frequencies}} {{have a very}} heavy-tailed distribution, and {{can therefore}} be modeled <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> by a Zipf distribution with an s close to 1.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the Fokker Stangensteuerung gear, {{which had}} worked <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> for {{synchronizing}} a single gun, firing at a modest cyclic rate through a two bladed propeller {{driven by a}} rotary engine, was becoming obsolete.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} class career of 45 matches he scored 1700 runs {{at an average}} of 22.66. Although he {{performed}} <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in domestic cricket his performances for the West Indian teams were poor. He died 2 March 1918 in St. Vincent.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} the Polo was a mixed success in the United Kingdom. It sold <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> (though not {{as well as some}} earlier Polos) but several {{customer}} satisfaction surveys by high-profile motoring magazines such as Top Gear gave the Polo a very low rating.|$|E
25|$|The CPVA {{soldier was}} <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> clothed, {{in keeping with}} the PLA's guerrilla origin and egalitarian attitudes. All ranks wore a cotton or woolen green or khaki shirt and {{trousers}} combination with leaders' uniforms being different in cut and with red piping and collar tabs.|$|E
25|$|The parish is <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> {{served with}} public footpaths, {{particularly}} in the north–south direction. The most frequently used are the Crewe and Nantwich Circular Walk and the towpath of the Shropshire Union Canal, both broadly north–south, and an east–west path that connects Acton village with Swanley.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years after}} leaving Pat, Pete married Kathy, {{although}} there was strong opposition from Lou, who would not condone her son's divorce. A year later they had their only son Ian (Adam Woodyatt). The family did <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> financially and enjoyed a more luxurious lifestyle than Pete's extended family.|$|E
25|$|The Elite Ice Hockey League is <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> {{recognised}} {{around the}} ice hockey world, {{highlighted by the}} 2010 visit of the Boston Bruins of the NHL who took on the Belfast Giants at the Giants Odyssey Arena in Belfast, Northern Ireland, winning 5-1 over the Elite League All-Stars.|$|E

25|$|During {{times of}} maximum cultivation, sugar cane fields {{stretched}} from the coastline of Nevis {{up to an}} altitude at which the mountain slopes were too steep and rocky to farm. Nonetheless, once the sugar industry was finally abandoned, vegetation on the leeward {{side of the island}} regrew <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> as scrub and secondary forest.|$|E
25|$|The {{accompanying}} {{audio recording}} informed {{participants in the}} neutral condition that the date went <b>reasonably</b> <b>well,</b> while participants in the emotional condition heard that, as the evening wore on, the man displayed some increasingly unpleasant traits of a type that was derogatory to women, and the embrace {{at the end of}} the evening was described as an attempt to sexually assault the woman.|$|E
25|$|Sales {{picked up}} {{substantially}} during 2000, {{and it was}} Britain's fifth most popular new car {{in the month of}} April of that year. It was still selling <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> at the time of MG Rover's bankruptcy in April 2005, and a small number of unsold 75s were still in stock as of early 2007, as Nanjing Automobile was preparing to re-open Longbridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{first group}} of prisoners was treated <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> under the circumstances, despite the {{inadequacy}} of the grounds, barracks, and sewer and water systems. Sewers were not authorized until June 1863 for the camp, and took time to be completed. Initially the prisoners received enough to eat, with cooking stoves and utensils to aid in preparation, and clothing. A good sutler store was set up.|$|E
25|$|Rob's {{friend and}} co-worker, Joe Doman {{is one of}} the few people who gets along <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> with Bucky and has pet-sat Bucky and Satchel a few times. Although Joe was {{frequently}} seen in the strips early years, this has decreased since taking a job in France. Joe is also a fan of rugby, having worn a jersey of the Scottish national team on a golf outing.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{performed}} <b>reasonably</b> <b>well</b> in {{the early}} tour games, the highlight being Allan Border scoring four centuries in consecutive first class games. Jeff Thomson leapt into test consideration after taking eight wickets against Somerset. David Boon, Greg Ritchie and Wayne Phillips also scored well in early games, and Bob Holland took a number of wickets. Simon O'Donnell's century against the MCC saw him come into consideration as an all rounder.|$|E
