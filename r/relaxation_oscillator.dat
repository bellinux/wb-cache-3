25|$|Once {{avalanche}} breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, {{irrespective of the}} gate voltage, until: (a) the potential VAK is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence VG can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a UJT <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{comparator}} {{can be used}} {{to build}} a <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillator.</b> It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a Schmitt trigger configuration. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Relaxation {{oscillators}} arise {{frequently in}} physics, electronics, mathematics, and biology. Their mathematical definitions possess {{a high degree}} of flexibility in the sense that through appropriate parameter choices <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> can be made to exhibit qualitatively different kinds of oscillations. We study numerically four different classes of <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> through their synchronization rates in one-dimensional chains with a Heaviside step function interaction and obtain the following results. <b>Relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the sinusoidal and relaxation regime both exhibit an average time to synchrony,, where is the chain length. <b>Relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the singular limit exhibit, where is a numerically obtained value less than 0. 5. <b>Relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the singular limit with parameters modified so that they resemble spike oscillations exhibit ��� @ A in chains and ��� @ A in two-dimensional square networks of length. Finally, using a sigmoid interaction results in P, for <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the sinusoidal and relaxation regimes, indicating that the form of the coupling is a controlling factor in the synchronization rate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{geometric}} method, based on singular perturbations, to approximate isochrones of <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> and predict the qualitative shape of their (finite) phase response curve. This approach complements the infinitesimal phase response curve approach to <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> and overcomes its limitations near the singular limit. We illustrate the power of the methodology by deriving semi-analytic formula for the (finite) phase response curve of generic planar <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> to impulses and square pulses of finite duration and verify its goodness numerically on the FitzHugh-Nagumo model...|$|R

We use the Malkin theorem {{to derive}} phase {{equations}} for networks of weakly con-nected <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators.</b> We find an explicit formula for the connection functions when the oscillators have one-dimensional slow variables. The functions are discontinuous in the relaxation limit µ → 0, {{which provides a}} simple alternative illustration to the major conclusion of the fast threshold modulation (FTM) theory by Somers and Kopell [Biological Cybernetics, 68 (1993), pp. 393 – 407] that synchronization of <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> has properties that are quite {{different from those of}} smooth (nonrelaxation) oscillators.

2500|$|While {{in general}} {{comparators}} are [...] "fast," [...] their circuits {{are not immune}} to the classic speed-power tradeoff. High speed comparators use transistors with larger aspect ratios and hence also consume more power. Depending on the application, select either a comparator with high speed or one that saves power. For example, nano-powered comparators in space-saving chip-scale packages (UCSP), DFN or SC70 packages such as , , , [...] and [...] are ideal for ultra-low-power, portable applications. Likewise if a comparator is needed to implement a <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillator</b> circuit to create a high speed clock signal then comparators having few nano seconds of propagation delay may be suitable. [...] (CML output), [...] (LVDS Output), [...] (CMOS output / TTL output), [...] (CMOS output / TTL output), [...] (TTL output), and [...] (PECL output) are examples of some good high speed comparators.|$|E
50|$|Another {{use of the}} {{thyratron}} was in <b>relaxation</b> <b>oscillators.</b> Since {{the plate}} turn-on voltage {{is much higher than}} the turn-off voltage the tube has hysteresis and with a capacitor across it could function as a sawtooth oscillator.

[...] They are also used in voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters, and in function generators to produce square and triangle waves. <b>Relaxation</b> <b>oscillators</b> are widely used because they are easier to design than linear oscillators, are easier to fabricate on integrated circuit chips because they do not require inductors like LC oscillators, [...] and can be tuned over a wide frequency range.
