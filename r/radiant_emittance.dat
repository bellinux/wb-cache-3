50|$|The typical {{observed}} <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> {{of biological}} tissues in the visible and ultraviolet frequencies ranges from 10−17 to 10−23 W/cm2 with a photon count {{from a few}} to nearly 1000 photons per cm2 {{in the range of}} 200 nm to 800 nm.|$|E

By means of numerical calculation, the influences of <b>radiant</b> tube <b>emittance</b> to the indoor temperature and workspace air temperature {{as well as the}} heat radiation flux were studied.

40|$|The TIROS IV Meteorological Satellite {{contains}} a medium resolution scanning radiometer. Two of the channels of this instrument {{are sensitive to}} reflected solar radiation and the remaining two respond to emitted thermal radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. The two thermal channels are calibrated in terms of equivalent blackbody temperatures, and the reflected solar radiation channels in terms of effective <b>radiant</b> <b>emittances.</b> The calibration data, along with orbital and attitude data and the radiation data from the satellite, were incorporated in a computer program for an IBM 7090 which was used to produce, in binary form, the "Final Meteorological Radiation Tape" which is the basic repository of all radiation data. After launch, the radiometer displaye d the same degradation of response characteristics as did its predecessors in TIROS II and TIROS III. The onset of degradation results in a departure of {{the data from the}} prelaunch laboratory calibration. The cause of degradation has not been determined, and the matter is still being studied at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Before work with the TIROS IV radiation data is attempted, an understanding of the radiometer, its calibration, and the problems encountered in the experiment, especially from response degradation, is essential. The instrumentation design, development work, and the calibrations herein described were performed by the Goddard Space Flight Center Staff, whereas the computer and programming efforts were carried out jointly by the staffs of the National Weather Satellite Center, U. S. Weather Bureau, and the Goddard Space Flight Center. In this Catalog-Manual, the radiometer an d its calibration, data processing, the "Final Meteorological Radiation Tape", the observed degradation patterns, and possible corrections for degradation are discussed. The Catalog-Manual also includes, in two forms, documentation of each orbit of successfully reduced radiation data acquired by TIROS IV. One method of presentation is the Index of Final Meteorological Radiation Tapes and the other is a Subpoint Track, Summary of Available Radiation Data in diagrammatic form...|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{emittance}} or thermal emissivity is {{the ratio}} of the <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> of heat of a specific object or surface to that of a standard black body. Emissivity and emittivity are both dimensionless quantities given in the range of 0 to 1, but emissivity refers to a material property (of a homogeneous material), while emittivity refers to specific samples or objects.|$|E
5000|$|The Stefan-Boltzmann law {{describes}} the power radiated {{from a black}} body {{in terms of its}} temperature. Specifically, the Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time (also known as the black-body <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> or radiant exitance), , is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature T: ...|$|E
5000|$|In spectroscopy, {{spectral}} {{flux density}} is the quantity {{that describes the}} rate at which energy is transferred by electromagnetic radiation through a real or virtual surface, per unit surface area and per unit wavelength. It is a radiometric measure, as distinct from measures that characterize light in terms of the electromagnetic field or photons. In SI units it is measured in W m−3, although it can be more practical to use W m−2 nm−1 (1 W m−2 nm−1 = 1 GW m−3 [...] = 1 W mm−3) or W m−2 μm−1 (1 W m−2 μm−1 = 1 MW m−3), W·m−2·Hz−1, Jansky or solar flux units. The terms irradiance, radiant exitance, <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance,</b> and radiosity are closely related to spectral flux density.|$|E
5000|$|In general, the {{luminous}} intensity {{of a point}} on a surface varies by direction; for a Lambertian surface, that distribution {{is defined by the}} cosine law, with peak luminous intensity in the normal direction. Thus when the Lambertian assumption holds, we can calculate the total luminous flux, , from the peak luminous intensity, , by integrating the cosine law:and sowhere [...] is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix for the unit sphere, and realizing that [...] is luminous flux per steradian. Similarly, the peak intensity will be [...] of the total radiated luminous flux. For Lambertian surfaces, the same factor of [...] relates luminance to luminous emittance, radiant intensity to radiant flux, and radiance to <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance.</b> Radians and steradians are, of course, dimensionless and so [...] "rad" [...] and [...] "sr" [...] are included only for clarity.|$|E
5000|$|In radiometry, radiant {{exitance}} or <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> is the radiant flux emitted by a surface per unit area, whereas spectral exitance or spectral emittance is the {{radiant exitance}} of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, {{depending on whether}} the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. This is the emitted component of radiosity. The SI unit of radiant exitance is the watt per square metre (...) , while that of spectral exitance in frequency is the watt per square metre per hertz (W·m−2·Hz−1) and that of spectral exitance in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre (W·m−3)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre (...) [...] The CGS unit erg per square centimeter per second (...) is often used in astronomy. Radiant exitance is often called [...] "intensity" [...] in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> of dimers and {{ensembles}} {{of particles}} consisting of gold, graphite and silica glass nanoparticles in vacuum is studied numerically {{based on the}} fluctuation-electromagnetic theory. The presence of neighboring particles of the same temperature causes an oscillating character of <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> (per one particle) depending on the particle size, interparticle distance and temperature. We conclude that an ensemble of particles could {{be a much more}} intense source of thermal radiation than an equivalent solid body with the same outer surface area. Alternatively, when the neighboring particles create a significant screening effect (silica), an ensemble of particles could be a very good heat protector. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figure...|$|E

The solution depends on a special idealization of the scattering phase function of the aerosols. The equations developed are subsequently applied to analyze quantitatively the enhancement of the surface irradiation and the enhancement of the scattered <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> as seen from above the atmosphere, caused by the surface reflectance and atmospheric back scattering. An order of magnitude error analysis is presented...|$|E

40|$|Multiband radiometric {{data from}} an {{airborne}} imaging thermal scanner are being studied {{for use in}} finding buried gravel deposits. The techniques are based on measuring relative differences in the thermal properties between gravel-laden targets and the surrounding gravelless background. These properties are determined from modeling the spectral <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> recorded over both types of surfaces in conjunction with ground measurements {{of the most significant}} heat flows above and below the surface. Thermodynamic properties of sampled materials from control sites are determined, and diurnal and annual subsurface heat waves are recorded.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) {{to shell}} textures {{in the context}} of rendering microgeometry. PRT is a method which allows static objects to have global illumination effects such as self shadowing and soft shadows while being rendered in real-time. This is done by representing the object’s spherical ’light transfer function,’ which captures how the object translates irradiance into <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance,</b> in a spherical/zonal har-monic basis in order to allow approximate illumination in arbitrary lighting environments. Shell textures is a technique for rendering complex surface geometry in real-time through the use of concentric 3 D rings or shells around a model. The shells are transparent every-where except at the intersection of the shell and the microgeometry that is being rendered. We novelly combine these two techniques to render realistic microgeometry with globa...|$|E
40|$|A {{scheme was}} {{developed}} which divides the earth-atmosphere system into 2060 elemental areas. The regions previously described are {{defined in terms}} of these elemental areas which are fixed in size and position as the satellite moves. One method, termed the instantaneous technique, yields values of the <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> (We) and the radiant reflectance (Wr) which the regions have during the time interval of a single satellite pass. The number of observations matches the number of regions under study and a unique solution is obtained using matrix inversion. The other method (termed the best fit technique), yields time averages of We and Wr for large time intervals (e. g., months, seasons). The number of observations in this technique is much greater than the number of regions considered, and an approximate solution is obtained by the method of least squares...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe established concept of temperature determination from dual spectra band radiometric measurement is analyzed {{for the case}} that the measurement device is sensitive to total photon emittance rather than <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance.</b> A temperature dependent ratio of measurements is calculated for two distinct spectral bands using a black body distribution. it is shown that, if the bands are not self contained, then there exists a one-to-one correspondence between temperature and ratio. A prototype algorithm is proposed and tested which demonstrates the feasibility of extracting both the temperature and range by using three distinct spectral band measurements. The model assumes nonhomogeneous, wavelength-dependent atmospheric attenuation. The target and sensor system each have an arbitrary location in a vertical plane relative to the earth.

40|$|Currently {{available}} cochlear implants {{are based}} on electrical stimulation of the spiral ganglion neurons. Optical stimulation with arrays of micro-sized light-emitting diodes (µLEDs) promises {{to increase the number}} of distinguishable frequencies. Here, the development of a flexible GaN-based micro-LED array as an optical cochlear implant is reported for application in a mouse model. The fabrication of 15 µm thin and highly flexible devices is enabled by a laser-based layer transfer process of the GaN-LEDs from sapphire to a polyimide-on-silicon carrier wafer. The fabricated 50 × 50 µm(2) LEDs are contacted via conducting paths on both pand n-sides of the LEDs. Up to three separate channels could be addressed. The probes, composed of a linear array of the said µLEDs bonded to the flexible polyimide substrate, are peeled off the carrier wafer and attached to flexible printed circuit boards. Probes with four µLEDs and a width of 230 µm are successfully implanted in the mouse cochlea both in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for rendering translucent materials that combines photon tracing with diffusion. This combination {{makes it possible}} to efficiently render highly scattering translucent materials while accounting for internal blockers, complex geometry, translucent inter-scattering, and transmission and refraction of light at the boundary causing internal caustics. These effects cannot be accounted for with previous rendering approaches using the dipole or multipole diffusion approximations that only sample the incident illumination at the surface of the material. Instead of sampling lighting at the surface we trace photons into the material and store them volumetrically at their first scattering interaction with the material. We hierarchically integrate the diffusion of light from the photons to compute the <b>radiant</b> <b>emittance</b> at points {{on the surface of the}} material. For increased accuracy we use the incidence plane of the photon and the viewpoint on the surface to blend between three analytic diffusion approximations that best describe the geometric configuration between the photon and the shading point. For this purpose we introduce a new quadpole diffusion approximation that models diffusion at right angled edges, and an attenuation kernel to more accurately model multiple scattering near a light source. The photon diffusion approach is as efficient as previous Monte Carlo sampling approaches based on the dipole or multipole diffusion approximations, and our results demonstrate that it is more accurate and capable of capturing several illumination effects previously ignored when simulating the diffusion of light in translucent materials...|$|E
