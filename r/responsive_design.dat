The goals {{of this research}} were to define what <b>responsive</b> web <b>design</b> is, determine its importance in building modern websites and describe a workflow for <b>responsive</b> web <b>design</b> projects. <b>Responsive</b> web <b>design</b> is a paradigm to create adaptive websites, which respond to {{the properties of the}} media that is used to render them. The three key elements of <b>responsive</b> web <b>design</b> are fluid layout, flexible media and media queries. As the numbers of mobile device users are constantly increasing, <b>responsive</b> web <b>design</b> has become an important method to improve mobile device user experience and accessibility in browsing the web. The workflow to build responsive websites consists of eight cumulative and iterative steps, which are discovery, planning, content design, sketching, prototyping, visual design, testing and discussion. As each web design project is unique and has different content, audience and goals, it is difficult to create a perfect workflow model. The <b>responsive</b> web <b>design</b> workflow described in this thesis is a recommendation and a collection of best practices for building responsive websites...|$|R

To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014 (although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre-relaunch design).|$|E

Between September 2011 and March 2014, the Globe gradually withdrew stories written by Globe journalists from Boston.com, making the sites more and more separated. BostonGlobe.com was designed to emphasize a premium experience focusing on content and emulating the visual appearance of The Boston Globe newspaper; the site was {{one of the first}} major websites to use a <b>responsive</b> <b>design</b> which automatically adapts its layout to a device's screen size. Boston.com followed suit in 2014. The two sites are aimed towards different readers; while Boston.com became targeted towards [...] "casual" [...] readers and local content, the new Boston Globe website is targeted towards the audience of the paper itself.|$|E
