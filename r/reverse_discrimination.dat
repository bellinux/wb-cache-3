40|$|International audienceThe {{striatum}} and the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) {{are the two}} main cortical inputs to the basal ganglia. Both structures are involved in motor and cognitive functions, particularly executive functions, known to rely mainly on fronto-basal ganglia circuits. The present work investigated the respective role of the dorsal part of the striatum (dST) and the STN by studying their involvement in learning and memory processes in two separate experiments. In a first experiment, rats with lesions to the STN or to the dST were trained in a light-tone discrimination task. When the learning criterion was reached, rats were then trained to the <b>reversed</b> <b>discrimination.</b> In a second experiment, surgery was done when the learning criterion had been reached. Three weeks after surgery, animals were then subjected to two relearning sessions and then to either a reversal learning or a working memory task. When surgery was done before learning, dysfunction of the dorsal striatum induced slight difficulties in acquisition, whereas dysfunction of the STN induced no difficulties during the initial learning but induced a more rapid inhibition of responses to the first lever press following {{the presentation of the}} tone during the <b>reversed</b> <b>discrimination.</b> In the second experiment, dST-lesioned rats showed long-term memory deficit in contrast to STN-lesioned rats which showed no difficulties during relearning but deficits in working memory. These results indicate a clear dissociation in cognitive functions in which STN and dorsal striatum are involved, suggesting that the fronto-striatal circuit and the fronto-STN circuit support, at least in part, different cognitive functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The recent {{surge of}} {{lawsuits}} against companies for the discrimination of employees under 40, {{as well as}} the lack of literature regarding the subject of legal age discrimination warranted this study regarding the effects of ageism on affective commitment. The study explores the concept of the similar-to-my-children effect in regards to workplace commitment and age discrimination. A 25 item questionnaire was distributed to a convenient sample of workers. Evidence of self reported legal age discrimination experiences were found among workers whose age category fell outside the protected age group marked by the ADEA. No relationship was found between experiences of <b>reverse</b> age <b>discrimination</b> and affective commitment. The respondents who reported that they had been told by their supervisors or co-workers that they reminded the supervisor or coworker of their children or younger siblings reported substantially more <b>reverse</b> age <b>discrimination</b> than their peers who had not experienced the comparison.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{was developed to}} study the repeated acquisition of conditional discriminations. Using a discrete trial procedure, pigeons were required to learn during each session a different two-member chain of conditional discriminations. Key color and geometric forms were used as stimuli. After the pigeons had reached a steady state of relearning (40 to 60 sessions), the technique was used to investigate variables that have previously been shown to affect the repeated acquisition of response sequences. Various (0 to 90 seconds) durations of timeout for errors were investigated in Experiment I. The stimulus change associated with a timeout, rather than its duration, {{was found to be}} the critical variable in acquisition of the discrimination. Extended training on a single chain was found to reduce total errors across sessions in Experiment II. Extended training (three sessions) did not, however, change the pattern of within-session error reduction. In some cases, extended training facilitated acquisition of a partially <b>reversed</b> <b>discrimination.</b> In Experiment III, color rather than chain position was found to control behavior, for three of the four birds, as the second stimulus dimension in the conditional situation. The results of these experiments replicate and extend previous findings concerning some of the variables that affect the repeated acquisition of response sequences...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{factors that affect}} temporal averaging in rats when discriminative stimuli are compounded following separate training indicating the availability of reward after different fixed intervals (FI) on a peak procedure. One group of rats, Group Differential, learned that a flashing light stimulus signaled that one type of food pellet reward could be earned for lever pressing after an FI 5 s interval and that a second type of food pellet reward could be earned after an FI 20 s interval {{in the presence of}} a tone stimulus. A second group of rats, Group Non-Differential, was similarly trained except that both types of rewards were scheduled across flash and tone trials. When given non-reinforced flash + tone compound test trials the interval containing the maximal response rate was no different than on flash alone test trials, although some responding also appeared near the long FI time. After these FI contingencies were reversed (flash signaled FI 20 s and tone signaled FI 5 s), however, further compound test trials more clearly revealed a temporal averaging pattern in both groups. The peak interval was shifted to the right of the FI 5 stimulus. Moreover, Group Differential rats acquired the <b>reversed</b> <b>discrimination</b> somewhat more rapidly than Group Non-Differential rats, and in a final selective satiation test Group Differential rats responded less in later intervals after they had been sated on the FI 20 s reward. These data suggest that temporal averaging in stimulus compound tests occurs even when the stimuli being combined signal qualitatively different rewards, but that decreasing the value of one of those rewards can shift responding away from the relevant time interval in a selective satiation test. However, when an especially salient stimulus (e. g., flashing light) signals a short FI, rats tend to process the compound stimulus more in terms of its individual elements...|$|R

Negative stereotypes and incorrect assumptions presented in society (e. g. media, educational system, and justice system) perpetuate inferiority in comparison to White Americans. In the context of a school environment, Latino children begin to realize they are different. When non-native English speakers enter the classroom, immediate differences in language, cultural values, and peer interactions impact identity development and negatively influence self-perceptions. The Two-Way Immersion (TWI) approach to teaching will allow Latinos to develop their ethnic identity without interference from the dominant American culture through an integrative language approach of English and Spanish instruction. These are the beginning steps for creating stronger ethnic identity, biculturalism, and potential method to <b>reverse</b> institutionalized <b>discrimination</b> through education...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine what it means to be an ethnic {{community}} member and be told that you “sound white”. This was done by interviewing members of the African-American community. The information from personal interviews and focus groups was analyzed using thematic analysis. Multiple themes were revealed regarding the definition of “sounding white”, emotional and social consequences, and acceptance into the African-American community. Although multiple definitions of what it means to “sound white” were revealed in this exploratory research, it can be concluded that to sound “white” means to speak “proper” English, talk in an educated manner, or overly formal. These findings suggest that <b>reverse</b> language <b>discrimination</b> exists within the African-American community amongst non-AAVE [African American Vernacular English] speakers.

40|$|More {{than four}} {{thousand}} stories could be {{told about the}} remarkable individuals who received fellowships under the Ford Foundation International Fellowships Program (IFP) between 2001 and 2010. Over the decade, the program enabled 4, 314 emerging social justice leaders from Asia, Russia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America to pursue advanced degrees at more than 600 universities in almost 50 countries. By April 2013, nearly 4, 000 Fellows had completed their fellowships, receiving degrees in development-related fields ranging from social and environmental science to the arts. A survey done in early 2012 showed that 82 percent of more than 3, 300 former Fellows were working {{in their home countries}} to improve the lives and livelihoods of those around them, while many of the rest were studying for additional advanced degrees or working in international organizations. The final group of Fellows enrolled in universities around the world will complete their fellowships by the end of 2013. In 2001, the Ford Foundation funded IFP with a $ 280 million grant, the largest single donation in the Foundation's history. The program was intended to provide graduate fellowships to individuals in countries outside the United States where the Foundation had grant-making programs. In 2006, the Foundation pledged up to $ 75 million in additional funds, allowing IFP to award more than 800 fellowships beyond its original projections. As extraordinary as the level and duration of funding, though, was IFP's singular premise: that extending higher education opportunities to leaders from marginalized communities would help further social justice in some of the world's poorest and most unequal countries. If successful, IFP would advance the Ford Foundation's mission to strengthen democratic values, reduce poverty and injustice, promote international cooperation and advance human achievement. It would decisively demonstrate that an international scholarship program could help build leadership for social justice and thus contribute to broader social change. In striving toward its ambitious goals, the program would transform a traditional mechanism [...] an individual fellowship program for graduate degree study [...] into a powerful tool for <b>reversing</b> <b>discrimination</b> and reducing long-standing inequalities in higher education and in societies at large.

Awarded {{the first}} edition (for year 2012) of the European Law Faculties Association (ELFA) prize for {{outstanding}} Doctoral Thesis on European Law, on 16 May 2013 at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Abuses of Union law {{can be defined as}} undesirable choices of law made by Union citizens. The treatment of choices of law by Union citizens has proved inconsistent under Union law, being alternatively endorsed (Centros) or sanctioned (Cadbury Schweppes) by Union institutions. This inconsistent treatment of choices of law is a manifestation of a broader dialectic between two conceptions of economic integration, designated as the paradigms of Regulatory Neutrality and Regulatory Competition. If economic integration is conceived as competition among Member States (Regulatory Competition), artificial choices of law ought to be endorsed as a legitimate process of regulatory arbitrage, by which Union citizens elect their favourite national law. Conversely, if the objective of economic integration is to avoid the competition among private businesses being distorted by national laws (Regulatory Neutrality), artificial choices of law ought to be sanctioned as abuses of law. Accordingly, ‘regulatory arbitrage’ and ‘abuse of law’ are two masks covering one phenomenon: the election of a more favourable national law by Union citizens. More generally, this dialectic between two conceptions of economic integration pervades our perception of the internal market, and therefore accounts for long-established contradictions of internal market law. Social dumping and <b>reverse</b> <b>discriminations</b> distort the competition among private businesses, but represent the ordinary functioning of the competition among Member States. Union harmonisation is desirable under Regulatory Neutrality, whereas Regulatory Competition requires regulatory diversity. In the context of the freedoms of movement, Regulatory Neutrality promotes Host equality (equal treatment of migrant citizens with Host society), while Regulatory Competition endorses Home equality (equal treatment with Home society). State aids should be prohibited under Regulatory Neutrality, but allowed under Regulatory Competition. In sum, one (internal market) law is assigned the contradictory mission of ensuring the proper functioning of two competitive processes: the competition among private businesses (Regulatory Neutrality) and among Member States (Regulatory Competition) ...|$|R

However, APC neurons failed to reverse cue selectivity when the associated outcome was changed, and the cue-selective population did not include neurons that were active prior to outcome delivery. Thus, although representations in APC are substantially more associative than expected in a purely sensory region, they do appear to be somewhat more constrained by the sensory features of the odor cues than representations in downstream areas of OFC...|$|R
