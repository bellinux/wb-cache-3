The petition read in part, [...] "Hamas cannot be allowed to <b>rain</b> <b>rockets</b> on Israeli cities, nor can it be allowed to hold its own people hostage. Hospitals are for healing, not for hiding weapons. Schools are for learning, not for launching missiles. Children are our hope, not our human shields." [...] However, The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles suggested signing this petition [...] "should not be confused with courage," [...] adding [...] "From the peaceful remove of (Jewish) privilege in Los Angeles, it asks little of one's conscience to sign a letter with 200 colleagues." ...|$|R

50|$|Sappers {{have built}} {{large numbers of}} presurveyed and {{prepared}} launching positions for rockets to use in wartime. A skeleton crew quickly moves rockets into position and fires them singly or in bulk with minimal logistical support. Some rockets are hidden underground with pneumatic lifts to raise and fire them or launched from trucks. Although Israel can target the launch sites within minutes of a launch, the IDF in 2006 could generally not destroy launch sites before use and therefore could not stop the <b>rain</b> of <b>rocket</b> attacks.|$|R

50|$|On 25 March, after {{a three-day}} battle, Huế fell. As {{resistance}} in Huế collapsed, North Vietnamese <b>rockets</b> <b>rained</b> down on Da Nang and its airport. By 28 March 35,000 VPA troops were poised {{to attack the}} suburbs. By 30 March 100,000 leaderless ARVN troops surrendered as the NVA marched victoriously through Da Nang.

2500|$|HRW {{rejected}} Hamas's claim: Hamas' {{claim that}} rockets {{were intended to}} hit Israeli military targets and only accidentally harmed civilians is belied by the facts. Civilians were the target, deliberately targeting civilians is a war crime.

[...] The Associated Press noted, [...] "Hamas fired hundreds of rockets toward Israeli towns and cities during the fighting, killing three Israeli civilians." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a reward}} they would win his daughter’s hand in marriage.

5|$|The {{aspiration}} {{to control}} the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 <b>rain</b> dispersal <b>rockets</b> from 21 sites {{in the city of}} Beijing {{in an effort to keep}} rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing's Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.|$|R
50|$|On 13 January 1968, the 148th Regiment menaced the RLA headquarters. General Bounchanh {{believed}} the Nam Bac Valley had already {{fallen to the}} communists; he hastily fled southwards, to be plucked from the jungle via helicopter two days later. With no leadership or central node of communication organizing the defense, the RLA strongpoint disintegrated. Within a day, the troopers belonging to three of the regiments—Groupement Mobile 11, Groupement Mobile 12, and Groupement Mobile 25—had abandoned their positions and drifted south toward Luang Prabang. That left only Groupement Mobile 15 and the 99th Bataillon Parachutistes facing the communist attack. The PAVN 316th Division now unleashed a weapon previously unknown in Laos, when they <b>rained</b> 122mm DKZ <b>rockets</b> on Groupement Mobile 15. The RLA regiment withdrew without notifying the 99th Bataillon Parachutistes. The latter were left by themselves to try to withstand the overwhelming communist onslaught. Only 13 of the paratroopers survived the battle, the rest being killed in action or captured. By the 14th of January, the siege had been broken and the Royal Lao Army routed. American helicopters began plucking fleeing Lao troops from the jungle.|$|R
