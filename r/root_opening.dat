40|$|The {{dimensional}} {{differences in}} steel bridge manufacturing caused by weld deformation often occur for butt joints of thin plates. The problems of distortion, residual stresses and reduced strength of structure {{in and around}} a welded joint are of major concern in the shipbuilding industry and other similar manufacturing industries. The various distortions induced by welding process and restriction of these distortions may lead to higher residual stresses. The prediction of distortions in ship panels are of great importance {{from the point of}} view of dimensional control. In view of this, it has been investigated the effect of <b>root</b> <b>opening</b> on the transverse shrinkage, longitudinal shrinkage and angular distortions of butt joints.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of fiberglass and ceramic fiber cylinders as root-pass weld backing for a double-V groove in 16 mm-thick carbon steel. Three different cylinder diameters were tested: 4. 8, 9. 5 mm (fiberglass) and 6. 4 mm (ceramic fiber). The welding process used was GMAW. The welding technique and the following process variables were investigated: <b>root</b> <b>opening,</b> current and travel speed. The results show that cylindrical fiberglass and ceramic fiber backings not only have excellent refractory properties, but also seal the <b>root</b> <b>opening</b> and contain the weld pool sufficiently to produce a root bead free of discontinuities and with a satisfactory shape and geometry. Working points were defined, together with a possible operating range for the welding parameters. It was concluded that cylindrical fiberglass and ceramic fiber weld backings hold great promise for use in root-pass welds in double-V grooves in applications in the naval and metallurgical industry...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{method for}} {{detecting}} flaws in automatic, constant-voltage {{gas metal arc}} welding using the process cur-rent and voltage signals was developed. Seven algorithms process the current and voltage signals to give quality para-meters. A defect-detection algorithm processes the quality parameters and flags welds that are different from a base-line. The baseline is constructed from the recorded quality parameters of pre-viously made, defect-free welds. Two se-ries of tests were conducted to test the sensitivity of the algorithms for defects and to test the entire sensor system in production. In the first series, on a 3 -mm lap joint, the algorithms detected a lack of shielding gas, oily parts and melt-through from inadequate part cross sec-tion, but could not detect off-joint weld-ing. The algorithms showed a mixed sensitivity to melt-through from large <b>root</b> <b>openings.</b> In production tests, 520 welds were monitored.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} limit loads {{are important for}} defect assessment and are strongly related with strength mismatch and weld geometry. Previous closed form solutions of mis-match limit loads were proposed by J-S Kim et al.

Present work reports mis-match limit loads for V-groove welded pipe for a circumferential crack via detailed 2 D and 3 D FE analysis. Fully-circumferential surface crack and part-through surface crack are considered and are located at the centre of the welds with various groove angles. With regards to loading condition, axial (longitudinal) tension is applied for all cases. For the parent and weld metal, elastic-perfectly plastic materials are varied systemically to analyze under-matching and over-matching conditions in plasticity. To integrate the effect of groove angles on mis-match limit loads, one geometry-related slenderness parameter was modified by relevant geometric parameters including groove angle, crack depth, crack width and <b>root</b> <b>opening,</b> based on plastic deformation patterns in theory of plasticity...|$|E

The relationship of all variables is explained. The neural model can be used to test initial welding conditions of voltage, amperage and travel speed.

40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) —Universidade de Brasília, Faculdade de Tecnologia, Departamento de Engenharia Mecânica, 2016. Neste trabalho se apresenta uma metodologia para união de tubos pelo processo de soldagem com a deposição do passe de raiz. Na realização da soldagem de topo, externa e sem abertura de raiz, a altura da face de raiz é um fator {{fundamental}} para obter penetração total. Em alguns casos, mata-juntas (podem ser de cobre o de materiais cerâmicos) são usadas para evitar vazamentos de solda. Porém, o cobre pode ocasionar inclusões e corrosão, além de trazer muitas dificuldades no momento de instalação e gerar grandes custos em campo. Assim sendo, realizou-se uma análise do efeito da penetração utilizando-se o método de fase de nariz decrescente na soldagem de passe de raiz sem uso de cobre-junta nem abertura de raiz, para as seguintes posições críticas de soldagem: plana, vertical e sobrecabeça. A análise foi feita utilizando o processo de soldagem MIG/MAG por curto-circuito derivativo, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding - Cold Metal Transfer), com arame AWS ER 70 S- 6 (1, 2 mm) e o gás de proteção Ar+ 25 %CO 2. O Planejamento Composto Central foi utilizado como ferramenta para a melhor organização dos testes e para análise dos resultados fez-se uma otimização utilizando a teoria de Desirability para múltiplas respostas, usando chapas planas de aço 1020 com chanfro estreito em U. Logo, valida-se esta metodologia de penetração completa em soldagem orbital de meia volta descendente em um tubo ASTM 106 por meio do processo de soldagem curto-circuito convencional com a ajuda da potência de soldagem mesurada. Os testes foram realizados com arames consumíveis de diâmetros 0, 9 e 1, 2 mm. Ensaios de macrografia mostraram os passes de raiz com bom aspecto visual e sem defeitos internos, sugerindo assim a possibilidade de execução da soldagem com penetração total. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIn {{this manuscript}} is presented a methodology {{to realize the}} pipe union by the welding process with the deposition of the root pass. In the butt welding execution external without open root, {{the height of the}} root face is a key factor for getting full penetration. Sometimes, copper-joints are used to prevent leaks. Though, copper can cause inclusions and corrosion, producing many troubles during the installation and generating large costs in the work area. Therefore, it was performed a penetration effect analysis using the slanted nose phase, method in root pass welding without the use of copper-joint or <b>root</b> <b>opening,</b> for the following critical welding positions: flat, vertical and overhead. The analysis was performed using the welding process MIG/MAG by derivative short circuit, GMAW-CMT (Gas Metal Arc Welding – Cold Metal Transfer), with AWS ER 70 S- 6 wires (1. 2 mm) a with Ar+ 25 %CO 2, as shielding gas. The Central Composite Design (CCD) was used as a tool for a better organization of the tests, whereas to analyze the results it was made an optimization based on the Desirability theory for multiple responses, employing flat sheets of 1020 steel with a narrow-gap in U-shape. Then, this full penetration methodology in orbital welding turned down was validated in a ASTM 106 pipe through the conventional short-circuit welding process, with the joint established in the previous stages. The tests were performed with wires of 0. 9 and 1. 2 mm in order to evaluate the welding power. Macrography tests showed root pass with an acceptable visual appearance and without internal defects, thereby suggesting the possibility of welding execution with full penetration...|$|E

Para tanto, 48 MS e 54 MI foram divididos em seis grupos distintos de acordo com a idade do dente, tomando como idade zero aquela 3 anos após sua erupção: 0 – 15 anos (20 MS e 20 MI), 16 – 30 anos (17 MS e 17 MI) e mais de 30 anos (11 MS e 17 MI). As raízes dos dentes foram seccionadas e mensuradas com limas K – file em 4 pontos distintos: embocadura do canal, no terço da bifurcação das raízes no terço médio e a 1 mm do ápice radicular. A primeira lima que entrou de forma justa nos pontos referidos representou o diâmetro do canal, sendo que a lima de calibre consecutivo já não mais penetrou no mesmo. Os resultados mostraram que existe um decréscimo, não homogêneo, do diâmetro dos canais no sentido cérvico-apical, com exceção do canal DV dos MS do grupo 1, que apresentou menor diâmetro na embocadura do canal do que na altura da trifurcação radicular. Em todos os canais analisados, o ponto 4, ou seja, a 1 mm da saída foraminal, o diâmetro anatômico foi inferior, em valor absoluto, aos pontos 1, 2 e 3. Nos molares superiores, o diâmetro da maioria dos canais, com exceção do canal P do grupo 1 e 3, no ponto 1, foi menor, em valores absolutos, do que no ponto 2. Este fato, apesar de não estatisticamente significante, é clinicamente relevante. O aumento da idade levou a uma diminuição estatisticamente significante no diâmetro na embocadura do canal dos molares inferiores, fato não percebido nos molares superiores. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diameter of mesiobuccal, distobuccal and palatine canals and the mesiobuccal, mesiolingual and distal root canals in human extracted upper and lowers molars, respectively, measured in specific sites along the root and considering tooth age. Forty eight upper molars and fifty four lower molars were separated into six different groups according to tooth age. The age was considered zero three years after erupting, thus from 0 – 15 years old (20 upper molars and 20 lower molars), 16 – 30 years old (17 upper molars and 17 lower molars) and over 30 years old (11 upper molars and 17 lower molars). The roots were sectioned and measured using K-type files in four different areas: root canal opening, root bifurcation, middle third and at 1 mm from the apex. The first file to fit adequately the specific sites represented the canal diameter whereas the following consecutive file did not enter into the canal. The results showed a non homogeneous reduction of the canal diameter towards the cervical-apical direction, except for the distobuccal canal of upper molars from group 1, which showed a smaller diameter at the <b>root</b> <b>opening</b> when compared to the diameter at the root trifurcation. In all analysed canals, point 4, i. e., at 1 mm from the apex, the anatomic diameter was smaller, in absolute values, when compared to points 1, 2 and 3. Most diameter canals in upper molars, at point 1, except for palatine canals from group 1 and 3, were smaller, in absolute values, when compared to point 2.

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{silencing}} vectors {{based on}} Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) are used extensively in cereals to study gene function, but nearly all {{studies have been}} limited to genes expressed in leaves of barley and wheat. However since many important aspects of plant biology are based on root-expressed genes we wanted to explore the potential of BSMV for silencing genes in root tissues. Furthermore, the newly completed genome sequence of the emerging cereal model species Brachypodium distachyon {{as well as the}} increasing amount of EST sequence information available for oat (Avena species) have created a need for tools to study gene function in these species. Results Here we demonstrate the successful BSMV-mediated virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) of three different genes in barley roots, i. e. the barley homologues of the IPS 1, PHR 1, and PHO 2 genes known to participate in Pi uptake and reallocation in Arabidopsis. Attempts to silence two other genes, the Pi transporter gene HvPht 1; 1 and the endo-β- 1, 4 -glucanase gene HvCel 1, in barley roots were unsuccessful, probably due to instability of the plant gene inserts in the viral vector. In B. distachyon leaves, significant silencing of the PHYTOENE DESATURASE (BdPDS) gene was obtained as shown by photobleaching as well as quantitative RT-PCR analysis. On the other hand, only very limited silencing of the oat AsPDS gene was observed in both hexaploid (A. sativa) and diploid (A. strigosa) oat. Finally, two modifications of the BSMV vector are presented, allowing ligation-free cloning of DNA fragments into the BSMV-γ component. Conclusions Our results show that BSMV {{can be used as a}} vector for gene silencing in barley roots and in B. distachyon leaves and possibly <b>roots,</b> <b>opening</b> up possibilities for using VIGS to study cereal root biology and to exploit the wealth of genome information in the new cereal model plant B. distachyon. On the other hand, the silencing induced by BSMV in oat seemed too weak to be of practical use.

Recently, we have proposed {{the following two}} epochs/stages model of EQ generation: (i) The final kHz part is triggered by the fracture of high strength and large asperities that are distributed along the activated fault and sustain the system. (ii) The initial MHz part {{is thought to be}} due to the fracture of highly heterogeneous system that surrounds the family of asperities. Interestingly, the MHz EM time-series can be described in analogy with a thermal second order phase transition. Herein we focus on the MHz pre-seismic activity, and especially on the naturally arising question: what is the physical mechanism that organizes the heterogeneous system in its critical state? Combining ideas of Levy and Tsallis statistics and criticality with features hidden in the precursory MHz time-series we argue that a Levy walk type mechanism can organize the heterogeneous system to criticality. Based on a numerically produced truncated Levy walk, we propose a way to estimate in the stage of critical fluctuations: (i) the associated Levy index- a, which describes quantitatively the underlying Levy dynamics, and (ii) the range of values where the nonextesitive Tsallis index q is restricted. We also show that the kHz EM activity could not be described by a truncated Levy mechanism. This result further indicates an abrupt sweep of the population of asperities that sustain the system...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth filled with a resin-based obturation material using two different chelating agents. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty extracted single-canal human teeth were prepared, instrumented, and randomly divided into three groups: Group 1 (n= 15) received a final flush with 10 ml of neutralized 17 % EDTA, followed by 10 ml of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), then obturated using lateral condensation with RealSeal. Group 2 (n= 15) received a final flush of BioPure MTAD, followed by 10 ml of NaOCl, then obturated using lateral condensation with RealSeal. Group 3, the control group (n= 10), was instrumented but not obturated, then the <b>root</b> canal <b>opening</b> was sealed with a temporary filling material. The specimens were stored in 100 % humidity for 10 days, mounted in polyester resin, and loaded to failure. RESULTS: The ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the control group and the experimental groups, although there was no statistically significant difference between Group 1 and Group 2 (p= 0. 05). The MTAD group displayed higher mean fracture load values than the EDTA group. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that filling the root canals with RealSeal increased the in vitro resistance to fracture of single-canal extracted human teeth when compared to instrumented and unobturated teeth. Teeth treated with MTAD demonstrated high fracture-resistance values when compared to teeth treated with 17 % EDTA, but they were not statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract. The {{characterization}} of the root-signal set of a nonlinear operator {{has proved to be}} a crucial step in understanding the utility and usefulness of the operator. The set of root signals constitutes the passband of the nonlinear operator, and the complement of this set represents the stopband of the operator. Knowledge of these two sets for all operators determines which one must be used for any particular task. In this paper we investigate the root signals of the basic morphological filters, we study the properties of these signals, and we derive a system of equations to compute the number of binary-root signals for these morphological filters with structuring element of width k and signals of length n. The derivation is based on the state description for these root signals.

The arc control on the contacts is critical for successful current interruption (103 104 A) in low voltage (250 V) devices. Previous work has shown how arc root commutation from the contact region into the arc chamber is affected by arc chamber materials, contact materials and the gap behind the moving contact for contact velocities between 1 ms 1 and 10 ms 1. This work is extended using a commercially available piezoelectric actuator to open the contacts. Contact opening speeds are assessed and the arc root mobility is characterized under this operating regime. A flexible test apparatus and solid-state high-speed arc imaging system are used to gather data on the arc <b>root</b> during the <b>opening</b> of the contacts. New experimental results are presented on the anode and cathode root velocity and arc root motion in an arc chamber with piezoelectrically actuated contact opening. These results {{can be used to}} improve the design of high current low voltage circuit breakers suitable for piezoelectric actuation. Index Terms—Circuit breakers, piezoelectric actuator. I...|$|R
40|$|Discovery of {{a foreign}} object in the root canal is unusual and rare. Forceful {{lodgement}} or impaction of the foreign object in the pulp chamber or root canal is usually accidental. It is seen more often among children with habits of chewing and placing various objects in the oral cavity. Despite new advances and a large understanding about the root canal morphology, retrieval of foreign objects from the root canal is still a challenging procedure to the endodontists. Exposed pulp chamber due to trauma or tooth left open for drainage after <b>root</b> canal access <b>opening</b> are predisposing factors to foreign body lodgement. The impacted foreign objects in root canals may act as a source in causation of discomfort, pain, infection, and swelling. An attempt to retrieve any foreign body from the root canal may increase the chances of its further apical displacement and firm lodgement in the apical third of the root invariably risking the prognosis of the tooth involved. The present case report describes an inadvertently broken sewing needle in the root canal of the permanent maxillary left central incisor with periapical abscess and its successful retrieval by non-surgical orthograde endodontic treatment...|$|R
5000|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Honey", was {{released}} on December 11, 2007. It reached number 88 on the US Billboard Hot 100, on which it spent three weeks. On the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, it charted for 17 weeks and peaked at number 22. A music video for the song was directed by Badu and Chris Robinson, and released on January 28, 2008. Badu wanted {{to pay homage to}} classic records with the video, which is set in a small business record store and follows a customer as she looks through vintage R&B, hip hop, and rock LPs, whose album covers are depicted as moving images with Badu cast in them. In January 2008, Badu also previewed songs from the album as a headlining act at the Barbados Jazz Festival. On April 23, she released [...] "Soldier" [...] as the album's second single and announced The Vortex World Tour, a supporting tour to promote the album. The tour's 42 concert dates included shows in the United States, Canada, and Aruba, spanned from May to June, and featured hip hop band The <b>Roots</b> as Badu's <b>opening</b> act. She later toured in Europe during June and July.|$|R
