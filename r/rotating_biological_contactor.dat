50|$|A <b>rotating</b> <b>{{biological}}</b> <b>contactor</b> or RBC is {{a biological}} treatment process {{used in the}} treatment of wastewater following primary treatment. The primary treatment process means protection by removal of grit and sand and course material through a screening process, followed by a removal process of sediment by settling. The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove pollutants in the wastewater before discharge of the treated wastewater to the environment, usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> <b>contactor</b> is a type of secondary (Biological) treatment process. It consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water. Microorganisms grow {{on the surface of the}} discs where biological degradation of the wastewater pollutants takes place.|$|E

5000|$|The MBBR {{system is}} {{considered}} a biofilm process. Other conventional biofilm processes for wastewater treatment are called trickling filter, <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> <b>contactor</b> (RBC) and biological aerated filter (BAF). Biofilm processes in general require less space than activated sludge systems because the biomass is more concentrated, and {{the efficiency of the}} system is less dependent on the final sludge separation. A disadvantage with other biofilm processes is that they experience bioclogging and build-up of headloss.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{pilot project}} for {{small-scale}} reuse of treated wastewater in rural areas in Outapi in Northern Namibia {{as part of the}} CuveWaters research project. The wastewater of 1,500 people is collected in vacuum sewers and treated {{in such a way that}} pathogens are removed, but nutrients remain to a large extent in the water. The technology is relatively sophisticated for a rural area in a developing country, using upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion followed by aerobic treatment using a <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> <b>contactor,</b> a microsieve and ultraviolet disinfection. The water is then used to irrigate vegetables for the local market. Community members have been trained in how to operate the facilities and a tariff and billing system has been introduced to recover the operating costs of the plant from users.|$|E
50|$|Fixed film systems use a porous medium which {{provides}} a bed to support the biomass film that digests the waste material in the wastewater. Designs for fixed film systems vary widely, but fall into two basic categories (though some systems may combine both methods). The first is a system where the media is moved relative to the wastewater, alternately immersing the film and exposing it to air, while the second uses a stationary media, and varies the wastewater flow so the film is alternately submerged and exposed to air. In both cases, the biomass must be exposed to both wastewater and air for the aerobic digestion to occur. The film itself may be made of any suitable porous material, such as formed plastic or peat moss. Simple systems use stationary media, and rely on intermittent, gravity driven wastewater flow to provide periodic exposure to air and wastewater. A common moving media system is the <b>rotating</b> <b>biological</b> <b>contactor</b> (RBC), which uses disks rotating slowly on a horizontal shaft. Approximately 40 percent of the disks are submerged at any given time, and the shaft rotates {{at a rate of}} one or two revolutions per minute.|$|E

The fixed-film principle has further developed into Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBR) and Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) processes.

As far as the denitrification process is concerned, the RBC with a completely submersed biofilm was more efficient than the other but had a longer delay in start-up.

50|$|Rotating Cell Biofilm Reactor (RCBR) is a {{new type}} of {{biological}} process based on biofilm active sludge used in wastewaters treatment. RCBR reactors represent an evolution of <b>Rotating</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>Contactors</b> plants: in fact, they are able to develop about ten times the <b>biological</b> surface of <b>Rotating</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>Contactors</b> plants, considering the same biological reactors volume (made of the set of disks). Such a result is obtained using - instead of a set of disks fixed on the central structured tree - many tridimensional plastic elements as carriers. These carriers are used to furnish the necessary biological surface for the cohesion of the bacterial film, responsible of the depuration process. These plastic elements are contained in a cilindric permeable cell, which is like the shape of the reactor cell of a traditional rotating RBC plant.
