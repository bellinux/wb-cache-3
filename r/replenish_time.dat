40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} numerical simulation of three-dimensional transient distributions of velocity and temperature of liquid oxygen (LOX) in the LOX Dewar tank of Vendenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). The present analyses cover the <b>replenish</b> <b>time</b> period only. Four test {{cases have been}} considered. For all four cases, the input boundary conditions are comprised of LOX facility heat loads, drain flow rates, recirculation flow rates and dewar heating. All the quantities are prescribed as functions of time. The first two test cases considered sensitivity of results to the computational grid. In Case 3, system heat load was changed, while in Case 4, a lower LOX level was specified. Cases 1 and 2 showed that the temperatures were not sensitive to the grid refinement. This provided a basic check on the numerical model. Cases 3 and 4 showed that the thermal boundary layer motion near the tank surface becomes more significant at the late time, e. g., 5 1 / 2 hours from replenish start. Comparison between results of Cases 3 and 4 showed, as expected, that the smaller initial LOX volume given in Case 4, results in higher temperature level.

40|$|Abstract. Deletion of the synapsin I genes, {{encoding}} one of {{the major}} groups of proteins on synaptic vesicles, in mice causes late onset epileptic seizures and enhanced experimental temporal lobe epilepsy. However, mice lacking synapsin I maintain normal excitatory synaptic transmission and modulation but for an enhancement of paired-pulse facilitation. To elucidate the cellular basis for epilepsy in mutants, we examined whether the inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus from mutant mice are intact by electrophysiological and morphological means. In the cultured hippocampal synapses from mutant mice, repeated application of a hypertonic solution significantly suppressed the subsequent transmitter release, associated with an accelerated vesicle <b>replenishing</b> <b>time</b> at the inhibitory synapses...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an inventory {{system in which}} the demands occur according to a Markovian arrival process (MAP). The items in the inventory have shelf times that are assumed to follow an exponential distribution. The inventory is replenished according to an (s, S) policy and the <b>replenishing</b> <b>times</b> are assumed to follow a phase type distribution. Back orders of demands are allowed up to a certain level. Using matrix analytic methods we perform the steady state analysis of the inventory model. We also show that the reorder process can be modelled as a MAP. An optimization problem is proposed and several interesting numerical examples are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|In {{a single}} stage system, the {{optimality}} of base stock policy, optimal base stock levels, and optimal demand lead time {{have also been}} discussed. Gallego and Özer (2001) consider a single stage inventory system with exogenous demand, under periodic review and stochastic finite demand lead <b>time,</b> and when <b>replenishing</b> <b>time</b> {{is greater than the}} maximum of possible demand lead time, it is proven that the order base stock policy is optimal. Buzacott and Shanthikumar (1993, 1994) discuss the continuous review of one stage production inventory system with deterministic lead time and finite capacity, where the processing times have an exponential distribution. They show that in this system, optimal demand lead time and costs decreases in the number of base stocks.|$|R

In the mutants, morphologically identifiable synaptic vesicles failed to accumulate after application of a hypertonic solution at the inhibitory preterminals but not at the excitatory preterminals. In the CA 3 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from mutant mice, inhibitory postsynaptic currents evoked by direct electrical stimulation of the interneuron in the striatum oriens were characterized by reduced quantal content compared with those in wild type. We conclude that synapsin I contributes to the anchoring of synaptic vesicles, thereby minimizing transmitter depletion at the inhibitory synapses. This may explain, at least in part, the epileptic seizures occurring in the synapsin I mutant mice...|$|R

30|$|However, in MONs, the {{implementation}} of designing an effective message transmission method still has many challenges [17]. Firstly, the energy of nodes, that {{is the power of}} mobile devices, is usually limited.

Thus, the message transmission capability of nodes is limited, and then, the lifetime of the whole network is affected as well. Obviously, when the energy of nodes cannot be <b>replenished</b> in <b>time,</b> energy would become a very precious resource and the effective utilization of energy is also crucial.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a perishable stochastic inventory system under continuous review at a service facility {{consisting of two}} parallel queues with jockeying. Each server has its own queue, and jockeying among the queues is permitted. The capacity of each queue is of finite size L. The inventory is replenished according to an (s; S) inventory policy and the <b>replenishing</b> <b>times</b> {{are assumed to be}} exponentially distributed. The individual customer is issued a demanded item after a random service time, which is distributed as negative exponential. The life time of each item is assumed to be exponential. Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and on arrival; they join the shortest feasible queue. Moreover, if the inventory level is more than one and one queue is empty while in the other queue, more than one customer are waiting, then the customer who has to be received after the customer being served in that queue is transferred to the empty queue. This will prevent one server from being idle while the customers are waiting in the other queue. The waiting customer independently reneges the system after an exponentially distributed amount of time. The joint probability distribution of the inventory level, the number of customers in both queues, and the status of the server are obtained in the steady state. Some important system performance measures in the steady state are derived, so as the long-run total expected cost rate...|$|R
