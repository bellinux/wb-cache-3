The concept selected is a cartridge compactor fecal collection subsystem which utilizes an airflow collection mode combined with a mechanical compaction and vacuum drying mode that satisfies the shuttle requirements with respect to size, weight, interfaces, and crew comments. A follow-on development program is recommended which is to result in flight test hardware <b>retrofitable</b> on a shuttle vehicle.

40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} {{in the engine}} compartment is a challenging design problem for all transportation means particularly in the automotive industry to attain better ride quality, improved road handling, and longer engine/parts life. Given {{the emergence of new}} vehicles with more stringent performance characteristics, engine vibration isolation has become a more demanding issue. This thesis focuses on the modelling, development, and experimental analysis of two active and semi-active engine mounts designed specifically to address the isolation problem of Variable Displacement Engines (VDE). It has been shown, however, that the designed mounts are flexible enough to fulfil the isolation requirements of other engine types as well. Both proposed mounts are made by adding <b>retrofitable</b> parts to the conventionally available hydraulic engine mounts. The promising performance of the fabricated mounts, in addition to their minimal cost, fail safety, and low energy consumption, makes them appealing solutions for the auto industry...|$|E
40|$|The vast data {{collected}} since {{the enforcement of}} building energy labelling in Italy has provided valuable information that is useful for planning the future of building energy efficiency. However, the indicators provided through energy certificates are not suitable to support decisions, which target building energy retrofit in a regional scale. Considering the bias of the energy performance index toward a building's shape, decisions based on this index will favor buildings with a specific geometric characteristics. This study tends to overcome this issue by introducing a new indicator, tailored to rank buildings based on <b>retrofitable</b> characteristics. The proposed framework is validated by a case study, in which a large dataset of office buildings are assigned with the new index. Results indicate that the proposed indicator succeeds to extract a single index, which is representative of all building characteristics subject to energy retrofit. A new labeling procedure is also compared with the conventional classification of buildings. It is observed that the proposed labels properly partitions the dataset, according to buildingsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 potential to undergo energy retrofit...|$|E
40|$|A new <b>retrofitable,</b> wastefree acid-rain control {{concept was}} pilot-tested at Ohio Edison`s high-sulfur {{coal-fired}} R. E. Burger generating {{station at the}} 2 -MWe level. During the project, moistened {open_quotes}supported{close_quotes} sorbents, made {{from a combination of}} lime and vermiculite or perlite, were injected into a humidified 6, 500 -acfm flue-gas slipstream. After the sorbents reacted with the sulfur dioxide in the flue gas, they were removed from ductwork with a cyclone and baghouse. The $ 1. 0 million project was co-funded by Sorbent Technologies Corporation, the Ohio Edison Company, and the Ohio Coal Development Office. The project included a preliminary bench-scale testing phase, construction of the pilot plant, parametric studies, numerous series of recycle tests, and a long-term run. The project proceeded as anticipated and achieved its expected results. This duct injection technology successfully demonstrated SO{sub 2 }-removal rates of 80 to 90 % using reasonable stoichiometric injection ratios (2 : 1 Ca:S) and approach temperatures (20 - 25 F). Under similar conditions, dry injection of hydrated lime alone typically only achieves 40 to 50 % SO{sub 2 } removal. During the testing, no difficulties were encountered with deposits in the ductwork or with particulate control, which have been problems in tests of other duct-injection schemes...|$|E

The results will be specifically applicable to fielded weapon systems, and will provide dual-use fire suppression technologies for preserving both life and operational assets. [1] The fire suppression principles observed and derived {{as a result of}} the many years of research of the Next Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program (NGP) have culminated into an effort (denoted as Project 6 -E of the NGP) to quantify and test those principles in the context of a full-scale, or “real scale ” engine nacelle environment (such experiments have been performed in 2005 and early 2006 in the Aircraft Engine Nacelle Test Facility (AEN) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base). The principles observed in cup, counter-flow and turbulent spray burners, as well as a myriad of other “bench top ” or comparably-scaled specialty intermediate-scale experimental apparati, have isolated the effects of particle or droplet size, chemical and thermal effects, and mixing behavior, amongst many other parameters in a series of controlled, well defined experiments.

40|$|The project {{entitled}} 'Scaleable Clean Aluminum Melting Systems' was a Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Secat Inc. The three-year {{project was}} initially funded {{for the first}} year and was then canceled due to funding cuts at the DOE headquarters. The limited funds allowed the research team to visit industrial sites and investigate the status of using immersion heaters for aluminum melting applications. Primary concepts were proposed on the design of furnaces using immersion heaters for melting. The proposed project can continue if the funding agency resumes the funds to this research. The objective of this project was to develop and demonstrate integrated, <b>retrofitable</b> technologies for clean melting systems for aluminum in both the Metal Casting and integrated aluminum processing industries. The scope focused on immersion heating coupled with metal circulation systems that provide significant opportunity for energy savings as well as reduction of melt loss in the form of dross. The project aimed at the development and integration of technologies that would enable significant reduction in the energy consumption and environmental impacts of melting aluminum through substitution of immersion heating for the conventional radiant burner methods used in reverberatory furnaces. Specifically, the program would couple heater improvements with furnace modeling that would enable cost-effective retrofits to a range of existing furnace sizes, reducing the economic barrier to application...|$|E
40|$|Flooding is an {{increasingly}} global challenge due {{to climate change}} and development practices. It can also be devastating to those affected. In the United Kingdom, it is projected {{that the number of}} people at high risk of flooding could rise from 1. 5 to 3. 5 million by 2080. Currently 400, 000 homes and 75, 000 businesses in England have an annual chance of flooding. Therefore, the Environment Agency provides useful information on flood risks for a given location. This information is supported with different guides by the local Councils on how to prepare for, and get help during flooding. What remains unclear and easy to access are customisable retrofit actions based on local flood risks, necessary for an individual or household to implement anticipatory retrofit actions, thereby improving the resilience of their homes. With this in mind, and knowing that studies about flood impacts focuses more on new construction or infrastructure solutions, this study aims to provide a tangible solution to raise the awareness of people living in a flood area about the level of risk they are exposed to, and to aid decision-making about effective preventive solutions specifically designed for their house, in an autonomous way. The output is a decision-support tool developed to consolidate information about flood risks and present customised retrofit measures. The tool refers to the notions of damage and vulnerability of private housing to inform its operational diagnostic methodology. The output is a “to do list” of <b>retrofitable</b> work to increase resilience of the house against flood. 40 potential users evaluated and delivered positive feedback on the usefulness and functionality of the tool to raise awareness and improve resilience action.

40|$|During the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSM) HPFtP/AT {{development}} program, engine hot fire testing {{resulted in}} turbine blade fatigue cracks. The cracks were noted {{after only a}} few tests and a several hundred seconds versus the design goal of 60 tests and > 30, 000 seconds. Subsequent investigation attributed the distress to excessive steady and dynamic loads. To address these excessive turbine blade loads, Pratt & Whitney Liquid Space Propulsion engineers designed and developed <b>retrofitable</b> turbine blade to blade platform featherseal dampers. Since incorporation of these dampers, along with other turbine blade system improvements, there has been no observed SSME HPFTP/AT turbine blade fatigue cracking. The high time HPFTP/AT blade now has accumulated 32 starts and 19, 200 seconds hot fire test time. Figure # 1 illustrates the HPFTP/AT turbine blade platform featherseal dampers. The approached selected was to improve the turbine blade structural capability while simultaneously reducing loads. To achieve this goal, the featherseal dampers were designed to seal the blade to blade platform gap and damp the dynamic motions. Sealing improves the steady stress margins by increasing turbine efficiency and improving turbine blade attachment thermal conditioning. Load reduction was achieved through damping. Thin Haynes 188 sheet metal was selected based on its material properties (hydrogen resistance, elongation, tensile strengths, etc.). The 36, 000 rpm wheel speed of the rotor result in a normal load of 120 #/blade. The featherseals then act as micro-slip dampers during actual SSME operation. After initial design and analysis (prior to full engine testing), the featherseal dampers were tested in P&W's spin rig facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. Both dynamic strain gages and turbine blade tip displacement measurements were utilized to quantify the featherseal damper effectiveness. Full speed (36, 000 rpm), room temperature rig testing verified the elimination of fundamental mode (i. e, modes 1 & 2) resonant response. The reduction in turbine blade dynamic response is shown for a typical turbine blade. This paper discusses the design and verification of these dampers. The numerous benefits associated with this design concept warrants consideration in existing and future turbomachinery applications...|$|E
40|$|Materials {{which are}} both lighter and {{stronger}} have faced an increased demand {{over the past}} decades to fulfil the requirements {{across a range of}} industrial applications. More specifically, demands for titanium alloys have increased significantly due to its high strength to weight ratio which is particularly attractive for increasing fuel efficiency in aircrafts and cars and is also used in biomedical implants. Despite the increasing demand for titanium made products, machining titanium alloys remains a significant challenge. High material strength and hardness lead to excessive heat generation at the cutting zone which accumulates and results in high cutting temperatures due to the poor thermal conductivity. The high cutting temperatures together with inherent material properties of titanium are responsible for short tool life and poor surface finish. Despite the environmental and health drawbacks, a generous amount of cutting fluids is commonly used to control the cutting temperature in machining titanium alloys. However, conventional cutting fluids evaporate at high cutting temperatures which isolate the cutting zone by forming a vapour cushion resulting in further increases in cutting temperatures. This research investigates the effects of cryogenic cooling on machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy in CNC milling as compared to conventional dry and wet machining environments. Two literature reviews were conducted and a methodology has been developed and implemented consisting of three experimental stages of i) design and manufacture of a cryogenic cooling system, ii) comparative study of cryogenic cooling with dry and wet machining and iii) optimisation of cutting parameters for cryogenic machining. The major contribution of this research can be summarised as design, realisation and assessment of a novel cryogenic cooling system for CNC milling, termed cryogenic shower, which is <b>retrofitable</b> to an existing CNC machining centre. In addition, the research provides a thorough study on the effects of cryogenic cooling on machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy in comparison with dry and wet machining. The studies range from power consumption and tool wear through to surface topography and surface integrity. Furthermore, the optimum cutting parameters for cryogenic machining are identified. The research demonstrates that using the cryogenic shower has significantly improved machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V through realisation of higher material removal rates, reduced tool wear and improved surface finish, surface topography and surface integrity...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program was to develop low-emissions, {{efficient}} fuel-flexible combustion technology which enables operation of a given gas turbine on {{a wider range of}} opportunity fuels that lie outside of current natural gas-centered fuel specifications. The program encompasses a selection of important, representative fuels of opportunity for gas turbines with widely varying fundamental properties of combustion. The research program covers conceptual and detailed combustor design, fabrication, and testing of <b>retrofitable</b> and/or novel fuel-flexible gas turbine combustor hardware, specifically advanced fuel nozzle technology, at full-scale gas turbine combustor conditions. This project was performed over the period of October 2008 through September 2011 under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 08 NT 05868 for the U. S. Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory (USDOE/NETL) entitled "Fuel Flexible Combustion Systems for High-Efficiency Utilization of Opportunity Fuels in Gas Turbines". The overall objective of this program was met with great success. GE was able to successfully demonstrate the operability of two fuel-flexible combustion nozzles over a wide range of opportunity fuels at heavy-duty gas turbine conditions while meeting emissions goals. The GE MS 6000 B (" 6 B") gas turbine engine was chosen as the target platform for new fuel-flexible premixer development. Comprehensive conceptual design and analysis of new fuel-flexible premixing nozzles were undertaken. Gas turbine cycle models and detailed flow network models of the combustor provide the premixer conditions (temperature, pressure, pressure drops, velocities, and air flow splits) and illustrate the impact of widely varying fuel flow rates on the combustor. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms were employed to compare some fundamental combustion characteristics of the target fuels, including flame speeds and lean blow-out behavior. Perfectly premixed combustion experiments were conducted to provide experimental combustion data of our target fuels at gas turbine conditions. Based on an initial assessment of premixer design requirements and challenges, the most promising sub-scale premixer concepts were evaluated both experimentally and computationally. After comprehensive screening tests, two best performing concepts were scaled up for further development. High pressure single nozzle tests were performed with the scaled premixer concepts at target gas turbine conditions with opportunity fuels. Single-digit NOx emissions were demonstrated for syngas fuels. Plasma-assisted pilot technology was demonstrated to enhance ignition capability and provide additional flame stability margin to a standard premixing fuel nozzle. However, the impact of plasma on NOx emissions was observed to be unacceptable given the goals of this program and difficult to avoid...|$|E
40|$|Because {{more than}} 90 percent of U. S. {{coal-fired}} utility boilers {{are equipped with}} electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), <b>retrofitable</b> ESP technologies represent a logical approach towards achieving the Department of Energy's (DOE) goal of a major reduction in fine particulate and mercury emissions (air toxics) from coal based power systems. EPA's recent issuance of significantly tightened ambient air standards for particles smaller than 2. 5 {micro}m (PM{sub 2. 5 }) creates a new urgency for developing cost-effective means to control fine particulate emissions. This challenge {{is compounded by the}} on-going switch in the utility industry to low-sulfur Powder River Basin (PRB) coals, that generate higher resistivity and difficult-to-collect fly ash. Particulate emissions can increase by a factor of ten when a utility switches to a low-sulfur coal. Numerous power plants are presently limited in operation by the inability of their ESPs to control opacity at high loads. In Phase I of this program, ABB investigated five technologies to improve the collection of fine particulate and trace metals in ESPs. These included: (1) flue-gas cooling, (2) flue-gas humidification, (3) pulsed energization, (4) wet ESP and precharger modules, and (5) sorbent injection for mercury control. Tests were conducted with an Eastern bituminous coal and a Powder River Basin sub-bituminous low-sulfur coal in an integrated pilot-scale combustor and ESP test facility. The impacts of the different retrofit technologies on ESP performance, individually and in combination, were evaluated indepth through advanced sampling and measurement techniques. In Phase II, the most promising concepts identified from Phase I testing, flue-gas cooling and humidification, pulsed energization, and sorbent injection at low flue-gas temperatures for mercury control, were integrated into a commercially oriented sub-scale system for field testing at Commonwealth Edison's Waukegan Unit No. 8. The main objective of the proposed Phase II testing was to determine longer term ESP performance and mercury capture improvements with the above enhancements for a range of low-sulfur coals currently fired by utilities. Unanticipated cost growth in readying the Pilot Plant for shipment and during slipstream construction at the utility host site resulted in the issuance of a preemptive stop work order from ABB until a detailed technical and budgetary review of the project could be completed. Four program recovery scenarios were developed and presented to the DOE. After careful review of these options, it was decided to terminate the program and although the Pilot Plant installation was essentially completed, no testing was performed. The Pilot Plant was subsequently decommissioned and the host site returned to its preprogram condition...|$|E
