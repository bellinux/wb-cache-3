5|$|As well as Thunderhawks, Anderson {{developed}} {{other ideas}} for a remake. A 1976 concept, Inter-Galactic Rescue 4, {{was to have}} featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, T-Force, which at first could not be pursued owing {{to a lack of}} funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled GFI, using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed with the <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> production was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable <b>results,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure, the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes. When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified (e.g. tonic-clonic) and in the underlying disease being identified (e.g. hippocampal sclerosis). The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> applied definitions and classifications (of seizures and epilepsies) and its respective terminology.|$|E

5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall <b>results</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E
5|$|Strom also {{resisted}} calling {{an early}} election {{to give his}} government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action. He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party, including the computerization of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling <b>results)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising. The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.|$|E
5|$|The IOC {{awarded the}} 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley, United States. Since the village had no facilities, {{there was a}} rush to {{construct}} infrastructure and sports facilities including an ice arena, speed-skating track, and a ski-jump hill. The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney. The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate <b>results,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first to feature female speed skating events. The bobsleigh events were absent for the only time due to the cost of building a bobsleigh run.|$|E

5|$|The {{reports of}} bin Laden's death on May 2, 2011, are not universally {{accepted}} despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity, bin Laden's twelve-year-old daughter witnessing his death, and a May 6, 2011, al-Qaeda statement confirming his death. The swift burial of bin Laden's body at sea, {{the speed of}} the DNA <b>results,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid. Some Internet blogs suggested that the U.S. government feigned the raid, and some Internet forums hosted debates over the alleged hoax.|$|E

5|$|Unusual eating {{behavior}} {{occurs in}} {{about three-quarters of}} children with ASD, {{to the extent that}} it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in malnutrition. Although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting <b>results,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.|$|E
