The rail industry has attempted to address flange wear using lubricants. The choice of <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant is currently not based on a standards approach. Measuring <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance in a laboratory environment can address this information shortfall and reduce wear in rail rolling stock and infrastructure. The equipment used to measure <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance consists of two dissimilar disks, of matching contact profile, rotating in contact with one another. The outcome from the modifications was the ability to quantify <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance using three performance criteria and to measure the changes in apparent viscosity with respect to accumulated strain damage.

40|$|A tribologist’s {{dream is}} to predict {{the point at which}} a {{lubricant}} film will fail. The precursor to this ideal situation is to predict the decay behaviour of a lubricant film prior to failure. The performance decay of lubricants is of interest to the rail industry for two reasons; first, to predict reapplication rates, and second, to predict the lubricated distance from a lubricant application point. The work discussed in this paper investigated the failure of lubricant films in a simulated <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> environment. Three <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants were tested under traction-limited rolling sliding conditions. New methods for measurement of <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance were developed and one method, the half life of lubricant is discussed and results presented here. Lubricant half life in this work represents the reduction of sliding performance over time at a defined shear stress level or the time taken for a lubricant to lose half of its sliding performance. Decay of lubricant performance was measured for three different <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants under simulated conditions. The rail/wheel simulator used in this research consists o...|$|R
40|$|Wear of {{railroad}} rolling stock and rails costs {{millions of dollars}} annually in all rail systems throughout the world. The rail industry has attempted to address flange wear using <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants and presently {{use a variety of}} lubricants and lubricant applicators. The choice of lubricant and applicator is currently based on considerations that do not address the wear problem directly. This research quantified <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance through laboratory simulation. The effects of lubricants in the wheel/rail contact were investigated. <b>Rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance was measured with a laboratory rail/wheel simulator for the purpose of optimising the choice of lubricant. New methods for measurement of <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance have been presented. These performance measurements are total absorbed energy, the energy absorbed in the lubricant film instead of being utilised for wear processes; total distance slid, the sliding distance or accumulated strain achieved prior to development of a set tractive force limit; half life of lubricant, the time taken for a lubricant to lose half of its sliding performance; and apparent viscosity, a measure of the lubricity presented with respect to accumulated strain. The rail/wheel simulator used in this research consists of two dissimilar wheels (disks) rotating in contact with one another simulating a conformal gauge corner contact. The first wheel, a simulated rail, is driven by an electric motor which then drives the second wheel, a simulated railroad wheel, through the contact. Hydraulic braking on the railroad wheel is used to simulate the rolling/sliding conditions. The variables of the simulated contact that are controlled with this equipment are normal force, input wheel speed, slip ratio between samples, sample geometries and material properties, and lubricant types. <b>Rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants were laboratory tested to define their properties using the ASTM and other appropriate standards. The performance differences measured using ASTM standards based tests were susceptible to repeatability problems and did not represent the contact as accurately as the rail/wheel simulator. This laboratory simulator was used to gather data in lubricated and unlubricated conditions for the purpose of providing lubricant performance measurements. These measurements were presented and the tested lubricants were ranked conclusively using three industrially relevant performance criteria. Total sliding distance and total absorbed energy measurements of the <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants displayed clear differences in lubricant performance for both of these criteria. Total sliding distance is equivalent to the number of axles in the field situation, while total absorbed energy is the energy unavailable for wear processes of rails and wheels. Lubricants designed using these measurements will increase lubricant performance with respect to these performance criteria which in turn will reduce wear to both rails and wheels. Measurement of the apparent viscosity of <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants, using the rail/wheel simulator, displayed changes in rheological characteristics with respect to accumulated strain. Apparent viscosity {{is a measure of the}} shear stress transmitted from the wheels to the rails. Designing a <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant after analysing measurements taken from the rail/wheel simulator will assist in identifying lubricant properties to reduce the wear producing shear stresses generated in a rail wheel contact. Decay of lubricant performance was measured for three different <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricants under simulated conditions. The research found appreciable and quantifiable differences between lubricants. Industrial application of the findings will improve positioning of lubrication systems, improve choice of lubricants and predict effective lubrication distance from the lubricant application point. Using the new methods of lubricant performance measurement developed in this thesis, the objective of this research, to quantify <b>rail</b> <b>curve</b> lubricant performance through laboratory simulation, has been achieved...|$|R

Some <b>curved</b> <b>sections</b> of urban motorways have a comparatively high frequency of accident occurrence.
