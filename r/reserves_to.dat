5|$|No such attack came. The Germans brought fresh <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> {{cover the}} gap (Menen–Ypres). This nearly cut the Belgians {{off from the}} British. The 2nd, 6th and 10th Cavalry Divisions {{frustrated}} German attempts to exploit the gap in depth but the situation was still critical.|$|E
5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E

5|$|In Pennsylvania, then-governor Dick Thornburgh {{allocated}} $1million {{in emergency}} {{aid for the}} disaster areas, and activated 600National Guardsmen to help with clean up. After nine water plants were closed, the companies relied on <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> provide water supply to local residents while also encouraging cutting back on usage. About 2,900people in Washington County lost access to clean water.|$|E
5|$|The German side reacted by {{deploying}} their <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> {{the region}} throughout the night. One improvised battle group consisting of five battalions from the 96th Infantry Division, supported by artillery and four Tiger tanks moved to Gorodok No. 2 {{to reinforce the}} 170th Infantry Division to the west. Another similar battle group using battalions from the 96th Infantry Division was sent to Workers Settlement No. 1 to support the 227th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{dispute about}} whether this new {{military}} structure was put into place under the Emperor Diocletian or Constantine since both reorganised the Roman Army in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries to some degree. Both Diocletian and even his predecessor of thirty years Gallienus may already have controlled mobile strategic <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> assist the empire's border forces; either Diocletian or Constantine expanded this nascent force into permanent field armies.|$|E

5|$|With {{the newly}} added power {{generation}} capacity, Tripura has with enough capacity to supply all seven sister states of northeast India, as well export power to neighbouring {{countries such as}} Bangladesh. With recent discoveries, the state has abundant natural gas <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> support many more power generation plants, but lacks pipeline and transport infrastructure to deliver the fuel or electricity to India's national grid.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> the rear of the border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} {{the most urgent}} needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known as}} the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5000|$|The Boucle du Baoulé National Park lies {{in western}} Mali, in Kayes Region and Koulikoro Region, {{set up in}} 1982. It has an area of 25,330 km² but has little large wildlife.

5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E
5|$|Due to its erratic motion, the Mexican {{government}} {{issued a}} Tropical Storm Warning and a Hurricane Watch early in Larry's lifetime from Veracruz to Campeche. The watches and warnings were extended westward to Tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to Ciudad del Carmen on October 5. Due {{to the threat}} of the storm, officials closed three Pemex oil ports. The company used its <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> make sure profits weren't disrupted. In addition, the storm closed shipping ports in Dos Bocas in Tabasco, Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz, and Cayo Arcas in Campeche. The Mexican government placed six coastal states on maximum alert, while authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1,500people. Because of the storm, the government declared much of eastern Mexico a state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|General Friedrich Fromm, {{commander-in-chief}} of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (Ersatzheer) and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one {{of those}} implicated in the conspiracy. Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named Himmler as his successor. Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed Hans Jüttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men. By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department with that of the Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.|$|E

The Monza's race was valid for the second, both in 1976 and 1977.|$|R
2500|$|In United States {{constitutional}} law, {{police power}} is {{the capacity of the}} states to regulate behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their inhabitants. [...] Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are <b>reserved</b> <b>to</b> the states or to the people.

50|$|According to the Code of Canon Law of 1917, the excommunications <b>{{reserved}}</b> <b>to</b> the Apostolic See {{were grouped}} in three categories, those reserved 1. simply, 2. {{in a special}} manner, 3. in a most special manner (each solvable by the Pope and by those priests the Pope had delegated the faculty to absolve for precisely that degree); and below the excommunications <b>reserved</b> <b>to</b> the bishop (which is now principally true of every excommunication), there was yet a category of excommunications <b>reserved</b> <b>to</b> noone (i. e., that could be solved by any confessor).|$|R
5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E
5|$|Newton Heath {{initially}} {{played on}} a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. Although attendances were not recorded {{for many of the}} earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.|$|E

5|$|Union troops retreated in {{different}} states of order. The brigades on Seminary Ridge {{were said to}} move deliberately and slowly, keeping in control, although Col. Wainwright's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone. When Wainwright realized his situation, he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk, not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout. As pressure eventually increased, Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street, three abreast. A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> {{the pursuit of the}} Seminary defenders, a great missed opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} that the Prussian army {{was able to}} support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment, across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these <b>reserves</b> <b>to</b> build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
