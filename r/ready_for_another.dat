5|$|The {{world premiere}} for Up in the Air {{occurred}} at 2009's Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) which ran from September 10 to 19, 2009. The press showing was on Friday September 11, 2009. Public screenings were on September 12, 13, and 19. Reitman originally did {{not plan to}} debut the film at TIFF, since it was not scheduled to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> three months.

5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; {{at the top of the}} list was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E

25|$|Political {{commentators}} {{speculated that}} Huckabee might be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> presidential run in 2016. He was limited {{by a lack}} of money in 2008 but with changes to federal election law allowing SuperPACs to pour large sums of money into a race he might be better positioned to stay in the race. Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013, which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{upon arrival}} the Washington was <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> voyage. On May 2, {{days after the}} British ship Iphigenia set off northward to trade for furs, Gray took the Washington north as well. On {{the way out of}} Nootka Sound Gray {{encountered}} the Princesa, under Spanish naval officer Esteban José Martínez, who had come to take possession of Nootka Sound for Spain. Martínez informed the officers of the Washington that they were trespassing in Spanish waters and demanded to know their business. Gray and his officers showed him a passport and made weak excuses for being on the Northwest Coast. Martínez knew they were dissembling but let them go, knowing that the command ship Columbia was trapped in Nootka Sound.|$|R

25|$|Wilson {{acted as}} chief of staff for the BEF when Murray visited the War Office in October. Like many senior Allied officers, Wilson {{believed}} that the war would be won by the following spring, especially if the Russians won the Battle of Lodz then in progress, and felt that Kitchener was jeopardising the chances of victory by withholding trained officers and NCOs in Britain to build up what Wilson called his ”shadow armies” which would not be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> two years. Wilson at this stage did not envisage British troops fighting under French command and (4 November 1914) opposed Foch’s request that Allenby and 2 battalions take part in a French attack. Murray (4–5 November) complained and threatened to resign when Wilson amended one of his orders without telling him.|$|E
25|$|The station's forebuildings {{were opened}} to {{passengers}} without any formal ceremony on 17 January 1904, although {{next day the}} Evening News reported that the platforms were still {{in a state of}} chaos and these were not expected to be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> nine months. However it did consider that ‘the result promises to be the provision for Nottingham {{of one of the most}} commodious and most convenient passenger stations in the country’. The day began with the closure of the booking offices in the old station after the last tickets were issued for the 5:25am London train and the new booking offices were opened in time to issue tickets for the 6:25am Erewash Valley train. No attempt was made to exclude the public from the building and many took the opportunity to view the new station buildings. The Evening News commented on the public’s admiration of the style and elegance of the station approaches and booking hall and went on to describe the day’s events.|$|E

In late 2003, Beyoncé planned to release a follow-up album that would comprise left-over songs from Dangerously in Love. The move was prompted when a P.

These design features, i. e., reusability and cargo flexibility, were incorporated to satisfy the objective of providing a transportation system which will {{lower the cost of}} delivering a variety of payloads to the earth orbit. The Space Shuttle System consists of a reusable manned Orbiter containing three main engines, two reusable Solid Rocket Boosters, and an expendable External Tank containing propellant for the Orbiter main engines. On a typical Space Shuttle mission, the Orbiter will remain in orbit for up to 7 days conducting on-orbit observations and operations, return to earth with personnel and payload, land horizontally on a runway, and be <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> flight in as few as 14 days.

Aguinaldo and his {{men were}} {{convinced}} that the Spaniards would never give {{the rest of the money}} promised to them as a condition of surrender. Furthermore, they believed that Spain reneged on her promise of amnesty. The Filipino patriots renewed their commitment for complete independence. They purchased more arms and ammunition to <b>ready</b> themselves <b>for</b> <b>another</b> siege.|$|R
500|$|After {{four years}} on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats. Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Frederick William of Prussia {{initially}} promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began. A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would {{run out of money}} by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized. Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called [...] "peace party", {{he did not want to}} see the army demobilized either. On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, King again {{tried and}} failed to {{circumnavigate}} in Galway Blazer II. In 1970, he was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> attempt, again using Galway Blazer II. Ill-health and hull damage forced him to put ashore at Australia. After departing on 12 December 1971, a large sea creature (a whale or shark) damaged his boat about [...] southwest of Fremantle. [...] "Only his skill and heroic efforts were able to keep the vessel afloat until jury repairs could be made". King was below deck when he heard a shattering sound and saw the hull below the water line bulge inward and splinter. He rushed upstairs and heeled the boat so that the hole was lifted out of the water. He had to hang over the side and submerge himself to carry out emergency repairs with material that included thirteen ropes, sticky tape, collision covers, sheet copper, and sponge rubber. Then he had to fix the inside of the hull as well. After three days of work, he was able to return to Fremantle, [...] "barely able to limp into port".|$|E
500|$|Austria sought another {{confrontation}} with France to avenge the recent defeats, and the developments in Spain only encouraged its attitudes. Austria could {{not count on}} Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain, Sweden (which meant Austria could not count on Swedish support either), and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Some {{in the government of}} Frederick William III of Prussia initially wanted to help Austria, but their hopes were dashed when Stein's correspondence with Austria, planning such a move, was intercepted by the French and resulted in Prussia being compelled to sign the crushing Convention of September 1808. The British had been at war with the French Empire for six years. A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by mid-1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilised. Although Charles warned that the Austrians were not <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him amidst the so-called [...] "peace party", {{he did not want to}} see the army demobilised.

50|$|A {{reconstruction}} of the murder gave investigators {{the idea that the}} murderer perhaps entered Bauerdorf's apartment by passkey and lay in wait downstairs until she got <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> bed. <b>Another</b> possibility is he rang the doorbell after she retired.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth {{favorite of the}} show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, [...] "by next week, we'll be {{back to where we}} started from, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> wacky adventure." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had [...] "some great existential musings" [...] from Lisa. They added that it also [...] "contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "I always remembered [...] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson." [...] DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade, claiming the [...] "rather large dose of sentimentality" [...] and [...] "fewer moments of absurdity" [...] in the episode gave it [...] "the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E
500|$|By June 1813 Belgrano {{set up a}} base in Potosí with an army of 2,500 men, {{to prepare}} an attack on Upper Peru. Goyeneche moved to Oruro and resigned, being {{replaced}} by Joaquín de la Pezuela. Belgrano administrated the zone and tried to revert the bad impression left by the previous campaign of Juan José Castelli. Belgrano initiated {{good relations with the}} natives as well. Belgrano's plan was to attack the royalists from the front and the sides, with the aid of the armies of Cárdenas and Zelaya. Both armies were near 3,500 men. However, the royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating Cárdenas and getting possession of his papers, which gave them insight into the patriotic plans. Belgrano was taken by surprise at Vilcapugio on 1 October, and initially gained the upper hand against the royalist troops, who started to flee. However, when Pezuela saw that the patriotic armies were not following, he reorganised his forces, returned to the battle, and won. There were barely 400 survivors. Belgrano said: [...] "Soldiers: we have lost the battle after so much fighting. Victory has betrayed us by going to the enemy ranks during our triumph. It does not matter! The flag of the nation still swings in our hands!". After gathering his army at Macha, where he received reinforcements from Cochabamba, Belgrano was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> engagement with Pezuela, whose troops were not in a better situation. On 14 November, Belgrano was again vanquished by the royalists at Ayohuma, and was forced to withdraw the remains of his army towards Potosí and from there to Jujuy.|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} 2010–11 team roster was the arrival of Tyson Chandler via trade. Nowitzki was injured {{in the middle of}} the season, during which the Mavericks recorded their worst losing streak in over a decade. Nowitzki finished the regular season with averages of 23 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 assists. Despite missing 9 games, Nowitzki was selected to the 2011 All-Star Game, his tenth appearance. The Mavericks concluded the regular season with 57 wins, seeding third behind the Spurs and Lakers for the 2011 NBA Playoffs. During the playoffs, despite their seeding, many predicted that Dallas would lose in the first round to Portland, and after blowing a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in Game 4 to even the series at 2–2, the Mavericks appeared <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> postseason collapse. However, Dallas won the final two games to advance. They then swept the two-time defending champion Lakers in the semifinals in Phil Jackson's final year as an NBA coach. In the Conference Finals, they faced the Oklahoma City Thunder and their All-NBA duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. In Game 1, Nowitzki scored 48 points while shooting 12/15 from the field while setting an NBA record of 24 consecutive free throws made in a game as well as most free throws in a game without a miss. In Game 4, with Dallas up, 2–1, Nowitzki scored 40 points to rally his team from a 99–84 deficit in the fourth quarter with 5 minutes left and eventually win, 112–105, in OT to take a 3–1 series lead. Dallas overcame another fourth-quarter deficit in Game 5 to win the Western Conference Title. In the 2011 NBA Finals, Dallas once again faced the Heat, which had acquired All-Stars LeBron James and Chris Bosh before the season began. During the Game 1 loss in Miami, he tore a tendon in his left middle finger; however, MRIs were negative, and Nowitzki vowed that the injury would not be a factor. In Game 2, he led a Dallas rally from an 88–73 fourth-quarter deficit, capped by a driving left-handed layup over Bosh to tie the series at 1. Miami took a 2–1 series lead after Nowitzki missed a potential game-tying shot at the end of Game 3. Despite carrying a 101°F fever in Game 4, he hit the winning basket to tie the series yet again at 2, evoking comparisons to Michael Jordan's [...] "Flu Game" [...] against Utah in the 1997 NBA Finals. Dallas went on to win the next two games, with Nowitzki scoring 10 fourth-quarter points in the series-clinching game in Miami, bringing the first championship to the franchise. In the series, Nowitzki scored 62 points total in the six fourth quarters, equaling the combined fourth-quarter output of James and Wade. He was named Finals MVP, joining a list of 10 other players to have been an NBA champion, NBA Finals MVP, an NBA regular season MVP, and a ten-time All-Star. For the 2011 playoffs, Nowitzki averaged 27.7 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 2.5 assists in 21 games.|$|E
50|$|Several rearguard {{actions were}} fought during the retreat. As the Gazelle Force {{threatened}} to outflank and encircle the retreating Italian forces, the Amhara Cavalry, under Lieutenant Amedeo Guillet, {{was ordered to}} slow down the Allied advance of at least 24 hours, temporarily stopping the Commonwealth forces in the plain between Aicota and Barentu, Eritrea. Guillet's cavalry covertly circumvented the Anglo-Indian forces, then launched a surprise cavalry charge from their rear, at dawn on 21 January. The initial charge created much disarray between the Commonwealth lines, but as Guillet <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> charged, the Allied force re-organized and opened fire on the Amhara cavalry, while some armoured units tried to encircle them. Lieutenant Renato Togni, Guillet’s second-in-command, charged a column of Matilda tanks with his platoon of 30 colonial soldiers; Togni and his men were all killed, but this allowed the remainder of Guillet's force to disengage. The charge had costed the Amhara cavalry some 800 killed or wounded, but succeeded in slowing the Allied advance enough to allow the main Italian force to reach the fortifications in Agordat.|$|R
