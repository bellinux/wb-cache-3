They are typically very simple, often eschewing bridges between the <b>rear</b> <b>stays.</b> Compact geometry frames with sloping top tubes are less common than on road bicycles due {{to the need to}} carry the bicycle easily on the shoulder. Top tube (rather than bottom bracket) routed derailleur cables help combat the build-up of mud. Some specialist cyclo-cross bikes also have a higher bottom bracket to aid clearance over rough ground; extra clearance could prevent toe clips from dragging while re-mounting after an obstacle.

50|$|Since the 1980s, while Colnago {{continued}} to produce high-end steel bikes, {{they began to}} produce bike frames using material other than steel including titanium, aluminum, carbon and mixed material frames. One unique frame from this period, the Bititan, has a dual titanium down tube. Crimped and oversize tubes appeared on the Tecnosone of the lightest production steel bikes produced, and the same oversize tubes and crimping were used on the aluminum Dream frame. In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pistaa full monocoque carbon fiber bike with disc wheels that was shown at the Milan bike show. Subsequently, Colnago worked with Ferrari in developing new carbon fiber technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago's innovative Precisa straight-bladed steel fork (1987). Colnago also experimented with multi-material frames, including the CT-1 and CT-2 constructed with titanium main tubes, carbon fiber forks and <b>rear</b> <b>stays,</b> and a similarly constructed (although short-lived) Master frame constructed with steel main tubes, carbon forks and stays.|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands three {{conformation}} {{traits are}} scored {{to improve the}} quality of legs&feet: two linear scores, for rear legs set side view and claw diagonal and one descriptive score for legs&feet, in which the locomotion of an animal is strongly weighted. Claw diagonal is a more valuable trait to score than claw angle, because it has a higher heritability (0. 50 vs. 0. 14), a higher economic value per genetic standard deviation (Dfl 8. 63 vs. Dfl 2. 21) and a higher repeatability when scoring the trait. The relation of phenotypic scores and breeding values for legs&feet traits with herdlife was studied using data of 500. 000 cows. The descriptive score legs&feet, with locomotion included, had the strongest relation with herdlife, followed by claw diagonal and rear legs set. Herdlife of improved with higher score and a higher breeding value for legs&feet. For claw diagonal and rear legs set a phenotypic optimum level was found. On breeding value level, cows with shorter claws and straighter <b>rear</b> legs <b>stayed</b> longer in the herd. In conclusions, the descriptive legs&feet score is a better predictor for herdlife than claw diagonal and rear legs set, because in the Dutch descriptive legs&feet score locomotion is taken into account...|$|R

40|$|The adapted {{recumbent}} {{project was}} to redesign a disabled veteran’s recumbent bicycle. The main areas of concern were the crank pedal, chain tension, braking and steering system, and ergonomics. Since the customer is an avid biker, this bike will be used often, so the design {{is based on the}} ease of repair and replacement. The crank system was redesigned to a lightweight, adjustable part with chain clearance and high strength. The chain tension was improved by replacing the existing single idler wheel/chain tube system with a dual idler wheel system. The dual idler has a titanium sprocket in one of the wheels and a smooth low friction surface for the other wheel. A rear mechanical disc brake was added with a locking brake lever. The locking brake was added {{to make it easier for}} the user to get in and out of the seat. A weld was made on the <b>rear</b> seat <b>stay</b> in order to place a bracket for the rear brake calipers. The front hydraulic brakes were replaced with two mechanical disc brakes with mechanical lines routed to a single dual pull lever. Additional custom seat padding was made specifically for this recumbent tricycle.

40|$|Chronic methamphetamine (MA) abuse {{results in}} an acute {{psychosis}} indistinguishable from paranoid schizophrenia. However, less is known {{of the interaction between}} MA use and environmental insults, and how this contributes to late-onset psychopathology. Using social isolation rearing (SIR), a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia, we investigated the association between changes in corticostriatal mono-amines and putative behaviours related to MA-induced psychosis in isolation and group-housed rats following chronic MA or saline exposure. Weaned male offspring of MA-naive female Wistar rats, either group- or isolation-housed from postnatal day (PND) + 21, received saline (2 ml/kg s. c. b. i. d.) or an escalating dose of MA (0. 2 - 6 mg/kg s. c. b. i. d.) for 16 days from PND + 35 to + 50. On PND + 78, offspring were tested for deficits in social interactive behaviour (SIB) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, with frontal cortex and striatum harvested for the assessment of mono-amine concentrations. SIR significantly reduced <b>rearing</b> time, <b>staying</b> together, approaching and anogenital sniffing (outward-directed SIB), but increased self-grooming and locomotor activity (self-directed SIB), and also induced profound deficits in PPI. Pubertal MA exposure in group-housed animals also induced similar alterations in outward- and self-directed SIB and reduced PPI. Combined MA + SIR exposure evoked a similarly intense behavioural response as SIR or MA separately, with no exacerbation evident. Neither treatment separately nor together affected corticostriatal serotonin or noradrenaline levels, although frontal cortical dopamine (DA) levels were significantly increased in SIR and MA + group-housed animals. A trend towards further elevated frontal cortical DA was noted in the MA + SIR treatment group. Striatal DA was unaltered by all treatments. This study provides the first evidence that chronic pubertal MA exposure evokes postpubertal psychosis-like behaviours in rats of similar intensity to that induced by a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia (SIR). Moreover, the study is unique in that these behavioural changes occur together with associated changes in frontal cortical but not striatal DA, without affecting other mono-amines, and strongly implicates frontal cortical DA changes in the psychotogenic effects of early-life MA exposure or environmental insult. Although MA exposure in animals with a history of environmental insult (i. e. MA + SIR) has similar effects, combined exposure was not additive with regard to behavioural or neurochemical changes. We conclude that a ceiling effect or compensatory mechanisms prevent more pronounced neurobehavioural deficits occurring following MA + SIR treatment, at least under the current study condition[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The common {{marmoset}} is {{the most}} frequently used New World primate in laboratory research and testing. In the UK, their use is strictly controlled by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, which is underpinned by the principles of humane science: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. Despite their use, {{there are a number of}} problems associated with the breeding of marmosets, including low dam longevity and increasing litter sizes. Large litters have led to high infant mortality and the need for human intervention to improve infant survival, which involves removal from the family for substantial periods of time. Previous research in a range of primate species shows that early life family separation is associated with numerous adverse behavioural and physiological effects. This project therefore sought to systematically investigate the effects of breeding and infant rearing practices, integrating a number of measures to assess the welfare of laboratory- housed marmosets. 	Potential predictors of dam longevity and litter size were first identified in three captive UK colonies, over four decades. Dam longevity was found to be approximately 6 years, with heavier dams living longer, but overall there was no consistent improvement in longevity over the decades. As longevity varied widely between colonies and over time, environment may be one of the most important factors. Approximately half of all births at each colony were litters larger than two, and these larger litters had greater infant mortality. Only dam weight at conception was useful in predicting litter size, with heavier dams producing larger litters. 	The consequences of large litters and early separation from the family for supplementary feeding were then investigated. Although twins had lower body weight than 2 stays (two infants remaining with the family after death of the other littermate/s) and supplementary fed triplets, they also had the fewest health problems. There was also some evidence that animals from larger litters were more at risk of suffering from extreme low weight. Some minor differences were found in behavioural development between litter sizes. Singleton infants received more rejective <b>rearing,</b> while 2 <b>stays</b> received more protective rearing, perhaps following the loss of an infant. While twin infants gained independence earlier than singletons or 2 stays, they did not appear to cope better with stress in adulthood, displaying more significant increases in stress-related behaviour following the routine stressor of capture and weighing, compared to 2 stays and supplementary fed triplets. While overall cortisol unexpectedly decreased from baseline to post capture, there were only significant fluctuations in 2 stay marmosets. Instead, there were some increases in positive behaviour in supplementary fed triplets following the stressor, suggesting enhanced coping ability. However, in another group of supplementary fed triplets, there were subtle increases in depressive-like symptoms, measured using cognitive bias and preference tests, suggesting a reduced expectation of and interest in rewards. There were however no differences between family-reared and supplementary fed marmosets in time to learn a visual discrimination task, or in responses to temperament tests. Therefore, while it was hypothesised that early family separation would have adverse developmental consequences, there were actually very little differences between marmosets of different litter sizes and rearing backgrounds, across the range of measures. Results suggest that the current supplementary feeding programme, along with a regular human socialisation programme, minimises any potential negative effects. However, we should always be finding ways to improve the lives of animals in our care. Possible Refinements include reducing dam weight to increase twin births and improve infant survival, and training to allow supplementary feeding on the carrier’s back, to prevent infant separation and reduce disruption to the family. These Refinements could reduce fear and allow monkeys to become more resilient to the laboratory environment...|$|R
