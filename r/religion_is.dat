5|$|According to the 2011 census, 91.36% of Croatians {{identify}} as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics {{make up the}} largest group, accounting for 86.28% of the population, after which follows Eastern Orthodoxy (4.44%), Protestantism (0.34%) and other Christianity (0.30%). Second largest <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> Islam (1.47%). 4.57% of the population describes themselves as non-religious.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has no {{official}} religion. Freedom of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> a right {{defined by the}} Constitution which also defines all religious communities as equal {{in front of the}} law and separated from the state.|$|E

5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{does not}} have a state religion, but the {{principal}} <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> Christianity. As recorded in the 2013 census, about 49percent of the population identified themselves as Christians, although regular church attendance is estimated at 15percent. Another 41.9percent indicated that they had no religion (up from 34.7percent in 2006) and around 6percent affiliated with other religions.|$|E
2500|$|Indian religions, {{sometimes}} also termed as Dharmic faiths or <b>religions,</b> <b>are</b> the <b>religions</b> {{that originated}} in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.

Although Indian <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> connected through the history of India, they constitute {{a wide range of}} religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent.|$|R
50|$|The modern Indonesian {{state is}} founded on the {{principles}} of pancasila, which requires the belief in 'one and only God', the practice of either Protestantism, Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism or Hinduism, one of which must be entered on an individual's KTP. Traditional <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak <b>religion</b> <b>are</b> still practised alongside Christianity.|$|R
50|$|Each {{community}} {{is different from}} another from its particularities, culture, language and <b>religion.</b> It <b>is</b> the reason why so many distinct <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> spoken throughout the island. The four most developed <b>religions</b> <b>are</b> Hinduism, Islam, Catholicism and Buddhism. They are mostly practiced respectively by Hindus, Muslims, the General Population and Sino-Mauritians.|$|R
5|$|<b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} as a comfort, a solace, a necessity to the soul's welfare; and whichever form of religion furnishes the greatest comfort, the greatest solace, it is the form which should be adopted be its name what it will.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|According to Gandhi, <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> {{not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's {{relationship}} to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was also}} {{an era in which}} {{religion}} and the state were one unified entity. ... no Jew, Christian, Zoroastrian, or Muslim of this time would have considered his or her <b>religion</b> to <b>be</b> rooted in the personal confessional experiences of individuals. ... Your <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> your ethnicity, your culture, and your social identity... your <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> your citizenship.|$|R

50|$|The anti-religious press {{continuously}} produced primitive blasphemies of God, Christ and the Saints {{in their}} pages designed to insult the religious feelings of believers. <b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> equated with immorality, drunkenness and money-grabbing. <b>Religion</b> <b>was</b> blamed {{for failing to}} differentiate between the working classes and capitalists.|$|R
5|$|According to The Malaysian Census 2010, Kuala Terengganu has a {{population}} of 406,317. The city population mainly consists of Malays with {{a population}} of 319,813. Chinese residents are the second biggest ethnic (11,617). Other residents include non-Malaysian citizens (4,326), other Bumiputras (643), Indians (867) and others (287). The same census shows that the population of Kuala Terengganu by <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> 96.9% Muslim, 2.5% Buddhist, 0.2% Hindu, 0.2% Christian, and 0.2% follower of other religions, Sikhs or non-religious. All Malays are Muslim. The Chinese of Kuala Terengganu are made up of Hokkien and they practised either Buddhism, Taoism or Christianity. A small number of Hindus and Sikhs also exist.|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> limited: {{an image of the}} Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E
40|$|Are {{religious}} views relevant to our {{judgments about the}} common good, or should <b>religion</b> <b>be</b> expelled from public life? The impulses that constitute <b>religion</b> <b>are</b> deeply rooted in human nature. Whatev-er the difficulties of combining rights to equality with freedom, the one cannot just trump the other. <b>Religion</b> cannot <b>be</b> ignored, and freedom of religion needs a firmer base than just the state's religious neutrality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the pre-Islamic Turkish approach to {{religion and the}} Gok Tengri religion, which the Chinese defined as Turkish religion. Because Turks in general were far away from religious bigotry compared to other nations, pre-Islamic Turks changed their religions more easily. Nevertheless, Gok Tengri <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> the most common religion among the pre-Islamic Turkic groups. Some earlier studies on the Gok Tengri <b>religion</b> <b>were</b> insufficient to describe this religion and they caused misinterpretations. This article argues that the Gok Tengri <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> a monotheist belief...|$|R

5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|The Kanaks {{were known}} to worship their ancestors. This worship was {{embodied}} in the sepulchre, sacred stones, and devotional hearths where they offered sacrifices. Today, most Kanaks are Christians. <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> {{an important aspect of}} Kanaks' life. Kanaks attend the Catholic Church in Noum√©a. and they form nearly 50% of the population of Catholics in New Caledonia, next only to the Europeans. Also, the majority of Protestants are Kanaks. However, there are a few who follow traditional beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean pantheon already {{included}} many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, {{although it is}} difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> also reflected in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.|$|E
40|$|An {{introduction}} to the theology of religions. A biblical theology of <b>religions</b> <b>is</b> developed, {{against the background of}} extensive study of current models of approach.

5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what <b>religion</b> <b>is,</b> stating that {{religious}} thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bah√°'√≠ teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, the unity of religion, and the unity of humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} that <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> significant {{because it offers}} a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore {{believed that}} religious language is confessional‚Äì a confession of what someone feels and believes‚Äì rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E

50|$|People {{continued}} {{to convert to}} religion to the frustration of the government, and it tenaciously remained widespread among the Soviet population.
