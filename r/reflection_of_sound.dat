The article proposes adapting OFDM modulation and adaptive equalization based on Kalman filtration techniques for use in underwater communications system.

Predictions of various boundary models of impedance surfaces in shear flow are tested by comparing their predicted reflection coefficient.

40|$|The {{shapes of}} the head and ears of mammals are {{asymmetrical}} top-to-bottom and front-to-back. <b>Reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> from these structures differ with the angle of incidence, producing cues for monaural sound localization in the spectra of the stimuli at the eardrum. Neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) respond specifically to spectral cues and integrate them with somatosensory, vestibular and higher-level auditory information through parallel fiber inputs in a cerebellum-like circuit. Synapses between parallel fibers and their targets show long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), whereas those between auditory nerve fibers and their targets do not.

5000|$|An {{anechoic}} chamber ("an-echoic" [...] meaning non-reflective, non-echoing or echo-free) is a room designed to completely absorb <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> either <b>sound</b> or electromagnetic waves. They are also often isolated from waves entering from their surroundings. This combination {{means that a}} person or detector exclusively hears direct sounds (no reverberant sounds), in effect simulating being inside an infinitely large room.|$|R
5000|$|Reflection is {{the change}} in {{direction}} of a wavefront at an [...] between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> light, <b>sound</b> and water waves. The law <b>of</b> <b>reflection</b> says that for specular reflection the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. Mirrors exhibit specular reflection.|$|R
50|$|As an {{ultrasonic}} systems {{relies on}} the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> waves, the system may not detect flat objects or object insufficiently large to reflect sound — e.g., a narrow pole or a longitudinal object pointed directly at the vehicle or near an object. Objects with flat surfaces angled from the vertical may deflect return sound waves away from the sensors, hindering detection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> at {{a target}} whose {{dimensions}} are large {{compared with the}} acoustic wavelength depends on its size and shape {{as well as the}} impedance of the target relative to that of water. Formulae have been developed for the target strength of various simple shapes as a function of angle of sound incidence. More complex shapes may be approximated by combining these simple ones.|$|E
50|$|In {{audio signal}} {{processing}} and acoustics, echo is a <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> that {{arrives at the}} listener with a delay after the direct sound. The delay {{is proportional to the}} distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener. Typical examples are the echo produced by the bottom of a well, by a building, or by the walls of an enclosed room and an empty room. A true echo is a single reflection of the sound source.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{efficient}} algorithm for simulating diffuse <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in a static scene. Our approach {{is built on}} the latest advances in precomputed light transport techniques for visual rendering and uses them to develop an improved acoustic radiance transfer technique. We precompute a direct-to-indirect acoustic transfer operator for the scene, {{and use it to}} map direct sound incident on the surfaces of the scene to multibounce diffuse indirect sound, which is then gathered at the listener to compute the final impulse response. Our algorithm decouples the transfer operator from the source position so we can efficiently update the acoustic response at the listener when the source moves. We highlight its performance on various benchmarks and observe significant speedups over prior methods based on acoustic radiance transfer.

5000|$|Ultrasonic: An {{ultrasonic}} wave (sound at a frequency {{higher than a}} human ear can hear) is emitted and reflections from nearby objects are received. Exactly as in Doppler radar, heterodyne detection of the received field indicates motion. The detected doppler shift is also at low audio frequencies (for walking speeds) since the {{ultrasonic wave}}length of around a centimeter {{is similar to the}} wavelengths used in microwave motion detectors. One potential drawback of ultrasonic sensors is that the sensor can be sensitive to motion in areas where coverage is undesired, for instance, due to <b>reflections</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> waves around corners. Such extended coverage may be desirable for lighting control, where the goal is detection of any occupancy in an area. But for opening an automatic door, for example, a sensor selective to traffic in the path toward the door is superior.|$|R

From {{the point of}} training for building designer, ability of spatial recognition based on only environmental information, i. e., thermal comfort, wind speed, and outdoor sounds, {{are more important than}} mastering the usage of those softwares. In this paper outdoor sounds were focused on, and some trials were performed as follows; Students listened some digital sounds recorded in urban areas, and tried to draw urban forms that might have surrounded the recorded points without any information about urban forms. Direct <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> car traffic etc. from the right or from the left direction lead right answers, but in some cases <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> on brick walls etc. were disturbed to lead right answers. And also it’s clarified that the long term repeats of these trials raised the percentage of right recognition of urban forms...|$|R
50|$|In 1927, P. G. A. H. Voigt {{patented}} a {{horn loudspeaker}} design {{based on the}} assumption that a wave front traveling through the horn is spherical of a constant radius. The idea is to minimize distortion caused by internal <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> within the horn. The resulting shape is the surface of revolution of a tractrix.An important application is in the forming technology for sheet metal. In particular a tractrix profile is used for the corner of the die on which the sheet metal is bent during deep drawing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which anechoic chambers minimize the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> waves impinging onto their walls is as follows: In the included figure, an incident sound wave I is about to impinge onto a wall of an anechoic chamber. This wall is composed {{of a series of}} wedges W with height H. After the impingement, the incident wave I is reflected as a series of waves R which in turn [...] "bounce up-and-down" [...] in the gap of air A (bounded by dotted lines) between the wedges W. Such bouncing may produce (at least temporarily) a standing wave pattern in A. During this process, the acoustic energy of the waves R gets dissipated via the air's molecular viscosity, in particular near the corner C. [...] In addition, with the use of foam materials to fabricate the wedges, another dissipation mechanism happens during the wave/wall interactions. As a result, the component of the reflected waves R along the direction of I that escapes the gaps A (and goes back to the source of sound), denoted R', is notably reduced. Even though this explanation is two-dimensional, it is representative and applicable to the actual three-dimensional wedge structures used in anechoic chambers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sinking of}} [...] in 1912 spurred the Canadian {{inventor}} Reginald Fessenden (1866-1932) {{to begin work}} on a long-distance underwater sound transmission and reception system that could detect hazards {{in the path of}} a ship. This led to the invention of the Fessenden oscillator, an electro-acoustic transducer which by 1914 had a proven ability to transmit and receive sound at a distance of 31 miles across Massachusetts Bay and to detect an iceberg ahead of a ship at a range of two miles by bouncing sound off it and detecting the echo, as well as an occasional ability to detect the <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> off the ocean bottom. Further impetus to developing practical applications of underwater acoustics came from World War I, which prompted the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and United States Army Coast Artillery Corps to experiment with sound as a means of detecting submerged submarines. In postwar experiments, the Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section conducted experiments in shallow water in Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts in which it detonated explosive charges underwater at the ends of established baselines and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive at hydrophones at the other ends of the baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water. And in 1923, the Submarine Signal Company improved upon its underwater signaling devices by equipping them with radio transmitters that sent signals both to identify the particular device and to indicate to approaching ships that it would generate an acoustic signal at a specific time interval after it sent the radio signal, allowing ships to identify the specific navigational aid they were approaching and {{to take advantage of a}} one-way ranging capability that let their crews determine their direction and distance from the navigational aid.|$|E
