Comments can be posted through CCR Online. Although research on algorithms and communication pro-tocols in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has yielded a tremendous effort so far, most of these protocols are hardly used in real deployments nowadays. Several reasons have been put forward in recent publications. In this paper, we further investigate this trend from a Medium Access Control (MAC) perspective by analyzing both the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> deployments and {{the characteristics of the}} MAC layers proposed in the literature. The effort allocated to de-velop suitable protocols from scratch every new deployment could however be minimized by using already existing con-tributions which provide code reuse and adaptive protocols. Though we advocate their use for nowadays deployments, we have identified several shortcomings in foreseen scenarios for which we provide guidelines for future researches...|$|R
40|$|South Africa, {{emerging}} from the yoke of colonialism and imperialism embarked on an ambitious land reform programme during the 1990 ’s. It was anticipated that land reform would take place effectively and sustainably. However, evidence to date revealed that land reform has been a failure and the cause thereof {{can be attributed to}} the lack of post settlement support. The focus of the research was to find out whether post-settlement support is the <b>reason</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> projects and if so to highlight the necessity of post-settlement support in land reform projects. The methodology used was through review of literature, legislations and policies on land reform and analysis of case studies. Outcome of the research indicates an intricate relationship between land reform and post-settlement support. The transfer of land to land reform beneficiaries must go hand in hand with the effective provision of post-settlement support for projects to be success and sustainable. College of LawLL. ...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{organizational}} effectiveness literature hasfocused on resource acquisition {{as well as}} effective resource use, {{there have been few}} attempts to study the relationship between these two measures. An understanding of this is particularly critical for not-for-profit organizations because there is some doubt as to whether the strong input-output the suggested by open systems theorists applies. This study examines the relationship among a group of locally monitored human service agencies. major focus of the literature on organizational effectiveness has been resource acquisition (Campbell, 1977; Steers, 1977). This perspective has been strongly influenced by Yuchtman and Seashore (1967 : 898) who have argued that effectiveness is &dquo;the ability of the organ-ization, in either absolute or relative terms, to exploit the environment in the acquisition of scarce and valued resources. &dquo; This system resource approach has proved attractive to researchers in their empirical studies of effectiveness, partly because of the relative ease by which resource acquisition can be measured, but also because of the importance of resource acquisition for survival.

40|$|The American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus, is a {{well-established}} invasive species {{found throughout the}} world. While means and implications of introduction are well studied, <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> establishment of invasive bullfrogs are not well known. In order to address whether a release from natural enemies may be <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> bullfrog invasion, we examined parasite species abundance and diversity of bullfrog populations. A dataset of bullfrog parasites from 22 locations was compiled through (i) firsthand collection from bullfrog dissections and (ii) a literature review. We {{examined the effects of}} latitude, host range (native versus invasive), and distance from the native range as site level predictors for the variance in parasite richness (number of different species represented) per site and sum prevalence (total percentage of the individual parasite species observed), respectively. While parasite richness was not significantly different between the native and invasive ranges, GLM analysis demonstrated that the biogeographic factors latitude and distance from the native range together predicted variability in parasite species richness, but not sum prevalence. Parasite species richness increased with increased latitude and decrease with increased distance from the native range. Difference in abundance of direct and complex life cycle parasites (infecting a single species versus infecting more than one host species) between ranges was marginally significant. Since the success of invasive bullfrogs may be related to a release from natural parasite enemies, understanding patterns of species diversity and the influence of biogeographic factors on parasite richness could help predict the probability and intensity of bullfrog invasions...|$|R
30|$|Radiolabeled {{antibody}} {{therapy for}} solid tumor {{has been less}} successful as compared to hematological tumors.

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to the Common Pool Resources debate by describing and analysinginstitutions that currently structure governance of community-based forest management inSanta Mónica and Palestina, within the Monte Verde region, Bolivia. It explores theinterplay between innovative communal and central-authority institutional features, theway they work and how they enable forest conservation. The method is narratology andanalysis of institutions and documents produced by this governance system through thelens of Elinor Ostrom’s institutional framework for the ‘alternative solution’ to thecommons problem. The results reveal that local communal rules and central-authorityrules are complementary rather than competitive. The local communities and the centralauthorityshare power to devise and enforce institutions for communal forestmanagement, which enable the local communities to exclude external actors, known as‘timber pirates’, who illegally harvest timber in this region. The central-authorityestablishes guidelines that are sensitive to local cultural contexts. Local governancedevelops rules conforming to these guidelines. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> forestconservation in Monte Verde lie {{on the fact that}} a healthy forest {{is in the interest of}} localcommunities due to its contribution to economic development. Ecosystem services suchas traditional forest produce, profits from timber sales and related employment are vitalcontributors to the local economy. Governmental institutions and internationalconservation principles support this local interest and, therefore, this collaborative relationis successful. This case study also explores an innovative approach for dealing with theproblem of free-riding.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{experiences}} of ABC users and non-ABC users within the food and beverage industry in the Netherlands and in the US. Unlike other surveys we chose to study a specific sector, expecting to find more similarities between companies in terms of market and technological aspects. Both aspects give reason to expect that product costing is increasingly important. The food and beverage market is strongly competitive: large retail organizations stimulate price competition and frequent on time delivery, while consumers demand a larger array of differentiated products. Production technology provides food producers the means to offer a wider array of products and packing alternatives. This in turn leads to more complex production and distribution systems. Complexity of production and logistic systems, combined {{with a large number}} of differentiated products are considered suitable situations for the application of Activity-Based Costing. A US survey of 96 food producing companies and a Dutch survey of 117 food producing companies provide information on the use of ABC in the food sector, on the organizational and production related characteristics of ABC using food companies and on experiences with designing and implementing ABC systems. Given the specifics of the food sector, we try to draw some conclusions on the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> or unsuccessful adoption of ABC. The availability of similar statistics from US and Dutch food companies also provides the opportunity to see if national circumstances have their influence on the acceptance of ABC, the process of ABC implementation and the use of ABC information. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 42). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is {{the most}} prevalent blood-borne disease in the world, infecting {{more people in the}} United States than HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that injection drug users (IDUs) face the highest risk of HCV transmission due to their unsafe injection behaviors. With the CDC's recently released recommendation for persons born from 1945 to 1965 to be tested for HCV, it is important for public health leaders to know if HCV antibody testing is readily available and accessible for all populations, especially for IDUs. Considering the current lack of data and programs targeting this group, however, factors associated with and barriers to HCV antibody testing must be identified in order to make any necessary changes to health policy and practices regarding IDUs. From 2009 - 2010, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Study to Assess Hepatitis C Risk (STAHR) recruited young adult IDUs in San Diego to complete a risk assessment interview. This secondary analysis of UCSD STAHR data used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with prior HCV antibody testing among IDUs within the following four domains: sociodemographic factors, utilization of health services, knowledge and risk perception of hepatitis C, and risky injection behaviors. Among 480 current IDUs who met inclusion criteria, 48 % had been tested for HCV antibody prior to their participation in UCSD STAHR. Prior HCV antibody testing was significantly associated with utilization of health services, specifically with having an HIV test and getting hepatitis B vaccinations. Findings from this study suggest a need for greater availability and accessibility of HCV testing services in locations that already offer HIV testing and hepatitis B vaccination services. Future studies are needed to assess the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> HCV antibody testing among this high-risk population...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} stylistic transformations of Chinese Chan {{painting}} to Japanese Zen painting through the artwork of Muqi, who is the most important Chinese painter in Japanese ink-painting history. In the first chapter, by comparing social backgrounds in China and Japan, I concluded that Muqi’s popularity in Japan was a choice made by the ruling class, and ink painting was promoted to legitimize those new rulers’ reign, while in China, conversely, the change of reign impeded the development of Chan painting but allowed literati painting to flourish. In the second chapter, I propose that Muqi’s style was influenced by literati painters. I also explain the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the <b>successful</b> Japanese adoption of Muqi’s painting; namely, by associating it with Japanese anesthetics. In the third chapter, by comparing Muqi’s paintings with Japanese paintings composed under their influence, I discovered that although those Japanese painters were not able to resemble the spiritual likeness of Muqi’s painting, they succeeded in simplifying Muqi’s style and freed it from the restriction of traditional Chinese paintings. ...|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} has focused on desertification and land degradation assessments without putting sufficient emphasis on prevention and mitigation, although the concept of sustainable land management (SLM) is increasingly being acknowledged. A variety of SLM measures have already been applied at the local level, but they are rarely adequately recognised, evaluated, shared or used for decision support. WOCAT (World Overview of Technologies and Approaches) has developed an internationally recognised, standardised methodology to document and evaluate SLM technologies and approaches, including spatial distribution, allowing the sharing of SLM knowledge worldwide. The recent methodological integration into a participatory process allows now analysing and using this knowledge for decision support at the local and national level. The use of the WOCAT tools stimulates evaluation (self-evaluation as well as learning from comparing experiences) within SLM initiatives where all too often there is not only insufficient monitoring but also a lack of critical analysis. The comprehensive questionnaires and database system facilitate to document, evaluate and disseminate local experiences of SLM technologies and their implementation approaches. This evaluation process - in a team of experts and together with land users - greatly enhances understanding of the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> <b>successful</b> (or failed) local practices. It has now been integrated into a new methodology for appraising and selecting SLM options. The methodology combines a local collective learning and decision approach {{with the use of the}} evaluated global best practices from WOCAT in a concise three step process: i) identifying land degradation and locally applied solutions in a stakeholder learning workshop; ii) assessing local solutions with the standardised WOCAT tool; iii) jointly selecting promising strategies for implementation with the help of a decision support tool. The methodology has been implemented in various countries and study sites around the world mainly within the FAO LADA (Land Degradation Assessment Project) and the EU-funded DESIRE project. Investments in SLM must be carefully assessed and planned on the basis of properly documented experiences and evaluated impacts and benefits: concerted efforts are needed and sufficient resources must be mobilised to tap the wealth of knowledge and learn from SLM successes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdvanced {{manufacturing}} techniques make {{it possible}} to attain large deformation of material in order to obtain required shape of a product. However, one of the main <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> their <b>successful</b> implementation is having an optimum combination of strength and formability of a material. The enduring challenge of increasing these two contradictory properties simulta- neously is achieved through the invention of Advanced High Strength Steels. Advanced high strength steels cover a vast range of applications, more specifically in aerospace, automotive, and oil industry where large deformation of a material is desired to attain a specified shape and geometry of the product. Austenite based twinning induced plasticity steel lies in the sec- ond generation and has excellent strength and formability among the group of advanced high strength steels. The stress assisted phase transformation from austenite to martensite, which is known as twinning, found to be principal <b>reason</b> <b>behind</b> an enhancement of these properties. This work is aimed to investigate an elastic-plastic behavior of an austenite based steel, which undergoes slip and mechanical twinning modes of deformation. Initially, a micromechanical model of twining induced plasticity is developed using crystal plasticity theory. Then, the developed model is numerically implemented into finite element software ABAQUS through a user-defined material subroutine. Finally, finite element simulations are done for single and polycrystal austenite subjected to combined load. This replicates the complex loading condi- tion which exists in material forming processes like pipe expansion, extrusion, rolling, etc. The variation in stress-strain response, magnitude of shear strain, and volume fraction of twinned martensite are plotted and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{large number}} of rural {{electrification}} projects being implemented in developing countries, there are few published in-depth evaluations of the effects of these projects on sustainable development. There is also no generally accepted method for assessment of such effects that includes all relevant aspects of sustainability. This report presents a manual for field based evaluation of rural electrification projects. The manual consists of a method for sustainability evaluation based on the use of 39 indicators. The proposed indicators cover the five dimensions of sustainability: technical, economical, social/ethical, environmental and institutional sustainability. The manual presents the indicators and gives detailed instruction on the procedure to calculate the indicators based on information that can realistically be collected in field studies. Lastly, SWOT-analyses have been made based on information received from discussions with stakeholders. The SWOT-analysis is seen as a simple and useful complement to the evaluation method that can bring additional information to the evaluation, which will not be covered by the selected indicators. The manual is a result from a PhD study. The aim of the study has been to investigate the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> successful/less <b>successful</b> implementation of rural electrification, with the overall objective to facilitate for decision-makers to improve their basis for future decisions and measures on rural electrification activities...|$|R
40|$|Export {{diversification}} is {{an important}} lever for the economic growth due to its pivotal role in avoiding the shortfalls in export concentration. For instance, the sensitivity of export revenues to any shock may occur to a certain sector leading to underinvestment when investors avoid the risks. Thus, diversifying export items into different products within different sectors rather than concentrating on certain products in one sector may achieve the sustainability of export earnings. The role of export diversification can be proved {{in the light of}} success of East Asian "Tigers " such as South Korea, where the export diversification has been adopted over the last five decades with fruitful economic returns. However, some Central American countries, such as Costa Rica, applied different diversification programs in the early of 1970 s and lately 1990 s without attaining the stability in their export earnings. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the <b>reasons</b> <b>behind</b> the <b>successful</b> implementation of export diversification policy in South Korea by exploring the determinants of export diversification at all margins through developing a composite index of both export product and geographical diversification using the most common measurement, Hir-schmann-Herfindahl index, and Vector Error Correction Model in order to analysis the time series data over the period (1970 - 2010) based on Eviews 7. 0...|$|R
40|$|Peering {{into the}} field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) the {{outsider}} realizes {{that many of the}} therapeutic strategies tested (in animal models) have been successful.

This article aims to review the current approaches to combat AD, and to open a debate on common mechanisms of cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. In short, either the rodent models are not good and should be discontinued, or we should extract only the most useful information from those models. An example of a question that may be debated for the advancement in AD therapy is: In addition to reducing amyloid and tau pathologies, would it be necessary to boost synaptic strength and cognition? The debate would provide helpful information that could turn around the current negative output in generating effective drugs for patients. Furthermore, discovery of biomarkers in human body fluids, and a clear distinction between cognitive enhancers and disease modifying strategies, should be instrumental for advancing in anti-AD drug discovery...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} decades, the European Union (EU) {{has succeeded in}} integrating new member countries, in economic and in political respects. Three main <b>reasons</b> lie <b>behind</b> this <b>successful</b> integration process: First, the solidarity of richer EU members with their poorer counterparts, second, {{the effectiveness of the}} integration policies conducted by the EU, and third, the willingness of new member countries to arouse and accomplish an economic catch-up process towards EU average levels.

Four cut and four uncut stands were selected, and each sampled using a single large plot (0. 25 ha). Results indicated that, on the one hand, B. albosinensis recruitment was scarce (average of 48 stems ha 21) in the uncut stands, relative to the mature population (average of 259 stems ha 21), suggesting a failure of recruitment. On the other hand, the subsequent regeneration approximately 50 years after the strip clearcutting showed that the density of the target species seedlings and saplings has increased significantly, and the current average density of seedlings and saplings was 156 stems ha 21. The clumped spatial pattern of B. albosinensis suggested that their regeneration was highly dependent on canopy disturbance. However, recruitment remained poor in the uncut stands because most gaps were small in scale. The successful regeneration of sunlight-loving B. albosinensis after strip clearcutting was attributed to the exposed land and availability of more sunlight. Bamboo density did not influence B. albosinensis recruitment in the uncut stands. However, stand regeneration was impeded after strip clearcutting; thus, removing bamboo is essential in improving the competitive status of B. albosinensis at the later stage of forest regeneration after clearcutting. The moderate severity of disturbance resulting from strip clearcutting reversed th...|$|R
