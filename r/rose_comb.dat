25|$|At the outset, it {{was only}} {{intended}} for the breed to be white in color; white birds are preferred for commercial meat production in the West, as they produce a particularly clean-looking carcass. In the 1930s, the Partridge Chantecler was generated by crossing Partridge Wyandottes, Partridge Cochins, Dark Cornishes, and the <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> type of Brown Leghorns to produce a chicken more adapted to free range conditions. This variant {{was admitted to the}} Standard in 1935. There has also been a Buff variety present since the 1950s, but it has never been admitted to show standards.|$|E
500|$|All Sebrights have plumage that is laced {{around the}} edges evenly with black, on a base of either dark gold or whitish silver. Sebrights have unfeathered legs with slateblue skin, and their beaks are ideally a dark horn color. Sebright roosters carry a <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> covered with fine points, and a small spike that sweeps back from the head (called a leader). Combs, earlobes and wattles were {{originally}} a purple colour {{referred to in the}} fancy as mulberry, but today are often bright red though mulberry is still desired according to the standards in most countries. [...] Some breeders consider hen feathering to have an adverse effect on the fertility of male Sebrights, and may use roosters that don't carry the trait for breeding purposes, despite their automatic disqualification in shows.|$|E

Passing {{on to the}} wicket-gate he shook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and {{expressed}} his last thanks to them for their attentions; after which {{there was a moment}} of silence before they had moved off. It was interrupted by the crowing of a cock. The white one with the <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> had come and settled on the palings in front of the house, within a few yards of them, and his notes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like echoes down a valley of rocks.|$|E

50|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{solely for}} appearance has produced birds with striking appearances, but poor egg laying ability, carcasses unsuitable for eating, and some reproductive problems. Due to a genetic trait tied to <b>rose</b> <b>combed</b> chickens, roosters may have low fertility. Hens rarely {{are inclined to}} brood their own clutches, and chicks have high mortality rates. However, adult birds are generally hardy and active. Unlike the majority of chickens, Rosecombs are good fliers. They are also usually friendly birds, but cocks may be aggressive.|$|R
50|$|In Italy, {{where the}} Livorno breed {{standard}} is recent, ten colour varieties are recognised. There {{is a separate}} Italian standard for the German Leghorn variety, the Italiana (German: Italiener). The Fédération française des volailles (the French poultry federation) divides the breed into four types: the American white, the English white, the old type (golden-salmon) and the modern type, for which seventeen colour variants are listed for full-size birds, and fourteen for bantams; it also recognises an autosexing variety, the Cream Legbar. Both the American Poultry Association and the American Bantam Association (ABA) recognize a number of Leghorn varieties including white, red, black-tailed red, light brown, dark brown, black, buff, Columbian, buff Columbian, barred, and silver. In Britain, the Leghorn Club recognises eighteen colours: golden duckwing, silver duckwing, partridge, brown, buff, exchequer, Columbian, pyle, white, black, blue, mottled, cuckoo, blue-red, lavender, red, crele and buff Columbian. Most Leghorns have single combs; <b>rose</b> <b>combs</b> are permitted in some countries, but not in Italy. The legs are bright yellow, and the ear-lobes white.|$|R
60|$|A cock with {{a regular}} <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> derived either from the {{spangled}} or pencilled silver Hamburgh was likewise at first quite black; but {{in less than a}} year the neck-hackles, as in the last case, became whitish, whilst those on the loins assumed a decided reddish-yellow tint; and here we see the first symptom of reversion; this likewise occurred with some other young cocks, which need not here be described. It has also been recorded (7/29. 'Journal of Horticulture' January 14, 1862 page 325.) by a breeder, that he crossed two silver-pencilled Hamburgh hens with a Spanish cock, and reared a number of chickens, all of which were black, the cocks having GOLDEN and the hens brownish hackles; so that in this instance likewise there was a clear tendency to reversion.|$|E
50|$|The Leghorn was {{included}} in the American Standard of Perfection in 1874, with three colours: black, white and brown (light and dark). <b>Rose</b> <b>comb</b> light and dark brown were added in 1883, and <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> white in 1886. Single comb buff and silver followed in 1894, and red, black-tailed red, and Columbian in 1929. In 1981 <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> black, buff, silver, and golden duckwing were added.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Combs</b> <b>rose</b> to {{national}} prominence by representing Margaret and Alan McSurely, two civil rights advocates. The McSurelys {{were part of}} an organization known as the Southern Conference Educational Fund, which advocated that the area's poor citizens band together to oust the incumbent political leaders and elect a [...] "people's government." [...] On August 11, 1967, Commonwealth's Attorney Thomas Ratliff and sheriff's deputies raided the couple's home in Pike County and arrested them on charges of sedition. The papers and other property seized in the raid was used by Arkansas Senator John Little McClellan in his investigations of civil disturbances {{in the wake of the}} Civil Rights Movement.|$|R
500|$|<b>Combs</b> <b>rose</b> {{from poverty}} {{in his native}} Clay County to obtain {{a law degree from}} the University of Kentucky and open a law {{practice}} in Prestonsburg. He was decorated for prosecuting Japanese war criminals before military tribunals following World War II, then returned to Kentucky and his law practice. In 1951, Governor Lawrence Wetherby appointed him to fill a vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Later that year, he was elected to a full term on the court, defeating former governor and judge Simeon S. Willis. Kentucky's Democratic Party had split into two factions by 1955 when Earle C. Clements, the leader of one faction, chose Combs to challenge former governor and U.S. Senator A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler, who headed the other, in the upcoming gubernatorial primary.|$|R
25|$|<b>Combs</b> <b>rose</b> to {{national}} prominence by successfully defending Appalachian Volunteers Margaret and Alan McSurely against charges of sedition {{in a case}} that took 15 years to fully adjudicate. After a long legal career, Combs unseated incumbent Elijah M. Hogge for a seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals. In 1989, he challenged incumbent James B. Stephenson for his seat on the Kentucky Supreme Court. During the campaign, he attacked some of Stephenson's previous opinions in violation of a state judicial code that forbade judicial candidates from stating opinions related to cases they might later be asked to rule on. After the election, which Combs won, he was suspended for three months for violating the code, but the suspension was not carried out because Combs appealed the constitutionality of the code and eventually succeeded in overturning it.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the variations in physical characters and immunocompetence among scavenging local chicken ecotypes in Tanzania. Eighty-four adult scavenging local chickens from four eco-climatic regions of Tanzania were studied. Measurements of adult body weight, body length, shank length and egg weight and observations of plumage colour and pattern, earlobe colour, skin colour and the shape of the comb were conducted. The antibody response to sheep red blood cells, serum haemolytic complement and the cutaneous response to phytohaemagglutinin-P were assessed. Five ecotypes were identified nd named Mbeya, Morogoro-medium, Ching'wekwe, Kuchi and Singamagazi. Singamagazi and Kuchi were significantly heavier, with longer shanks and heavier eggs than the other ecotypes. The average adult body weight for males ranged from 1621 g (Mbeya) to 2915 g (Singamagazi). Average female weights ranged from 1108 g (Morogoro-medium) to 2020 g (Singamagazi). Mean egg weights ranged from 37. 65 g (Ching'wekwe) to 45. 61 (Singamagazi). The Kuchi had mostly <b>rose</b> and walnut <b>combs,</b> while the other ecotypes were mostly single combed. In each ecotype there were chickens with a high or low antibody response to red blood cells, but {{there was a significant difference}} between the ecotypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenotypic}} characteristics, {{level of}} production, management system and {{contribution of the}} local chickens to household studied in the north central Namibia. The study involved both qualitative and quantitative methods to gather the data. The questionnaire was used for survey while phenotypic characteristics and egg production forms were used to collect the actual data. The findings revealed that farmers {{in the study area}} regarded chicken production as their primary source of domestic animal protein, with the domestic fowl being the most widely kept poultry species. Other uses are participation in socio-cultural ceremonies, selling for money and gifts. The average number of eggs per clutch ranged from 10 to 15. The hatchability ranged between 50 % and 60 %). Phenotypic characteristics measures revealed the absence of pure white plumage colour that can be associated with the introduction of White Leghorn to the flock. Generally, normal feather cover was the main feather morphology of local chicken populations in north central Namibia. However, features like crested heads, naked necked, frizzling, and feathered shanks occurred sporadically among local chickens in the study area. Fifty-seven percentages of chickens in the surveyed region had single comb, while 29. 6 % and 13. 8 % had <b>rose</b> and pea <b>combs</b> respectively. The most frequent shank colour was black followed by yellow, whitish, orange, and reddish shank. The wing span had positive correlation with body weight and chest circumference at (r = 0. 994). Other researchers discover the strong correlation of chest circumference with length shank at (r = 0. 827). The current study attained the mean body weight of 1. 7 to 2. 1 kg of both sexes combined which falls within the range of 1. 6 to 2. 18 kg reported by (Alabi et al. 2012). In conclusion, the current study revealed large variation of phenotypical characteristics with poor correlation to their productivity due to lack of record keeping although production forms were made available to the farmers. The part of productivity according to their identified phenotypic characteristics is not accepted nor rejected due to poor records, but recommended for further study with training on record keeping by farmersCollege of Agriculture and Environmental SciencesM.

50|$|Rhode Island Whites are a dual-purpose fowl {{suitable}} for both meat and egg production. Males weigh 8.5 pounds (3.9 kilos) and hens weigh 6.5 pounds (3 kilos). They {{have a single}} variety, with pure white plumage, red wattles and earlobes, and a medium size <b>rose</b> <b>comb.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bantams are {{classified}} {{according to their}} appearance. The six classes are as follows: Modern Game; Game; Single Comb, Clean Legged; <b>Rose</b> <b>Comb,</b> Clean Legged; Feather Legged; and All Other Comb, Clean Legged. The American Bantam Association's (ABA) classifications occasionally differ from the American Poultry Association's. Some breeds are in multiple classes.|$|E
5000|$|Dominiques {{are quite}} {{distinctive}} in appearance. They have a <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> {{and a heavy}} plumage of irregularly striped dark grey and light grey feathers (a pattern called [...] "barring" [...] or sometimes [...] "hawk coloring"). This dark/light grey striping is often mistaken for black and white striping. The breed matures quickly, producing eggs at about six months of age.|$|E
50|$|The Barbu d'Anvers is a {{diminutive}} bird with a large, round breast that juts forward, and an arching tail. As its name implies, {{it has a}} profuse beard of feathers that covers the earlobes. It has a small <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> and small or non-existent wattles. In Belgium 29 colour varieties of plumage are recognised; in Germany there are six more.|$|E
50|$|The {{legs are}} yellow mottled with black, the beak yellow with some black {{markings}} {{on the upper}} mandible, and the eye orange-red. The skin is yellow, the ear-lobes white or cream-coloured. The comb is of medium size, with five well-marked points; in hens it should fall gracefully to one side. In the United Kingdom and in the United States, but not in Italy, a <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> is permitted.|$|E
50|$|The Siciliana is {{an ancient}} breed of chicken from the Italian island of Sicily. It is notable for its unusual double or <b>rose</b> <b>comb,</b> for the early age at which birds reach maturity, and for the unusual shape of the eggs.

50|$|The breed has two varieties, {{differentiated}} by comb type; {{the single}} comb Nankin {{has a large}} comb with five points, and the <b>rose</b> <b>comb</b> has a medium size one ending in a single point. All Nankins come in a single colour, with buff on the body and black tails. The golden hue is deeper and more lustrous in males, {{and they have the}} longer sickle feathers common in cocks. Their beaks are a light horn colour, and legs are slate blue.|$|E
50|$|Rosecombs {{are almost}} {{exclusively}} kept for competitive poultry showing, and their characteristics reflect this. Males generally weigh 570 - 620 g and females 450 - 510 g. The breed's eponymous trait is its <b>rose</b> <b>comb,</b> which is large compared to its overall body size. They also sport relatively substantial white earlobes, prodigious tails, and a compact body shape. In {{addition to these}} general characteristics, Rosecombs appear in 25 different colour variations, though black, blue, and white are the most common.|$|E
5000|$|The Hamburg is a {{small or}} {{medium-sized}} breed. Cocks weigh [...] and hens about , with slender legs and a neat <b>rose</b> <b>comb.</b> Ring size is [...] for cocks and [...] for hens.
