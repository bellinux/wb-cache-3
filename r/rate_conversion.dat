25|$|After {{passing through}} WASAPI, all {{host-based}} audio processing, including custom audio processing, {{can take place}} (sample <b>rate</b> <b>conversion,</b> mixing, effects). Host-based processing modules {{are referred to as}} Audio Processing Objects, or APOs. All these components operate in user mode. The only portion of this architecture that runs in kernel mode is the audio driver (which contains the Port Class driver, the vendor Miniport driver and the vendor HAL).|$|E
25|$|Windows 98 {{introduced}} WDM Audio and the Kernel Audio Mixer driver (KMixer), {{which enabled}} digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams {{with a higher}} quality sample <b>rate</b> <b>conversion</b> as well as kernel streaming. Under WDM, DirectSound sends data to the software-based KMixer. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware buffering, DirectSound3D hardware abstraction, KMixer sample-rate conversion (SRC) for capture streams, multichannel audio support and introduction of DirectMusic. If the audio hardware supports hardware mixing (also known as hardware buffering or DirectSound hardware acceleration), DirectSound buffers directly to the rendering device. If DirectSound streams use hardware mixing, KMixer and its latency delay are bypassed. On Windows 98 and Windows Me, WDM audio drivers were preferred but compatibility with VxD driver model was preserved.|$|E

2500|$|A {{fault in}} the MME WaveIn/WaveOut {{emulation}} {{was introduced in}} Windows Vista: if sample <b>rate</b> <b>conversion</b> is needed, audible noise is sometimes introduced, such as when playing audio in a web browser that uses these APIs. This is because the internal resampler, which is no longer configurable, defaults to linear interpolation, which was the lowest-quality conversion mode that could be set in previous versions of Windows. The resampler can be set to a high-quality mode via [...] for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 only.|$|E
2500|$|DirectShow Editing Services (DES), {{introduced}} in DirectX 8.0/Windows XP is an API targeted at video editing tasks and built {{on top of}} the core DirectShow architecture. DirectShow Editing Services was introduced for Microsoft's Windows Movie Maker. [...] It includes APIs for timeline and switching services, resizing, cropping, video and audio effects, as well as transitions, keying, automatic frame rate and sample <b>rate</b> <b>conversion</b> and such other features which are used in non-linear video editing allowing creation of composite media out of a number of source audio and video streams. DirectShow Editing Services allow higher-level run-time compositing, seeking support, and graph management, while still allowing applications to access lower-level DirectShow functions.|$|E

5000|$|Analog {{broadcasting}} systems—PAL/SECAM and NTSC—were historically {{limited in}} the set of moving image formats they could transmit and present. PAL/SECAM can transmit 25 Hz and 50 Hz material, and NTSC can only transmit 30 Hz and 60 Hz material (later replaced by 30/1.001 and 60/1.001 Hz). Both systems were also limited to an aspect ratio of 4:3 and fixed resolution (limited by the available bandwidth). While the wider aspect ratios were relatively straightforward to adapt to 4:3 frame (for instance by letterboxing), the frame <b>rate</b> <b>conversion</b> is not straightforward, {{and in many cases}} degrades the [...] "fluidity" [...] of motion, or quality of individual frames (especially when either the source or the target of the frame <b>rate</b> <b>conversion</b> is interlaced or inter-frame mixing is involved in the <b>rate</b> <b>conversion).</b>|$|E

30|$|Visco et al. [15] studied <b>rates</b> of <b>conversion</b> to {{laparotomy}} {{in a large}} population-based administrative {{database to}} determine whether conversion decreased with increasing surgeon experience with LAVH. Of the total cases, 2, 998 (80 %) represented the first 20 LAVHs for the surgeon. Overall, there was a 12.1 % surgical complication rate. Damage to the urinary tract was reported in 2.6 % of LAVHs. Injury to the gastrointestinal tract, including direct injury and obstruction, was reported in 1.7 % of procedures. The overall <b>rate</b> of <b>conversion</b> to laparotomy was 21 %; the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> significantly decreased with increasing surgeon experience. Ferrari et al. [16] reported a 27 % <b>rate</b> of <b>conversion</b> to laparotomy in women undergoing LAVH.

This surprisingly high <b>rate</b> of <b>conversion</b> is probably more representative of the reality, without the bias of a specialised centre.
