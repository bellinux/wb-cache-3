25|$|Somewhere in {{the middle}} Sixties, I first came upon the 56-page letter which Kelly {{attempted}} to have printed when the gang robbed the bank in Jerilderie in 1879. It is an extraordinary document, the passionate voice {{of a man who}} is writing to explain his life, save his life, his reputation … And all the time there is this original voice - uneducated but intelligent, funny and then angry, and with a line of Irish invective that would have made Paul Keating envious. His language came in a great, furious rush that could not but <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> far more literary Irish writers.|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} edible, but {{opinions}} about its palatibility are mixed: one author says the fruit bodies are [...] "coarse {{and do not}} taste good"; another mentions the [...] "thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile;" [...] yet another says [...] "The yellow cap may <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> chicken fat; it has a wonderfully savory mushroom flavor." [...] The slimy texture of the mushroom {{has been compared to}} okra. One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads, for use on bread or as a dip; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use, and concentrate the flavor. The odor and taste are mild; one field guide suggests it has a [...] "distinctive lemony tang". The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption.|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "cartoon-like, diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in Australia with the Marlboro Man". Similarly, Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to [...] "bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'". Alicia Lu of Bustle wrote: Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice for branding, but he's a cowboy. Look at his regal cowboy hat, his spiffy red cowboy boots, and the way that cigarette nonchalantly dangles from his lips – doesn't Jeff <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> a figure from days of yore? If you squint, I swear you'll see the Marlboro Man.|$|E

500|$|In a {{reference}} to the role that earned Irons an Academy Award, Claus von Bülow in Reversal of Fortune (1990), the writers gave Scar one of von Bülow's lines, [...] "You have no idea," [...] which is uttered by Irons in a similar tone. According to author Rachel Stein of New Perspectives on Environmental Justice: Gender, Sexuality, and Activism, Irons relies [...] "on his history of playing sexually perverse, socially dangerous male characters to animate his depiction of Scar." [...] On the contrary, Irons revealed to Connect Savannah that the similarities between the voices of Scar and von Bülow were largely unintentional, explaining, [...] "Whatever voice came was arrived at by looking at the initial sketches, and from the freedom the directors gave me to try anything." [...] Irons concluded, [...] "The fact that he may occasionally <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> Claus, {{comes from the fact that}} they both share the same voice box." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{technical}} aspects of the game were also praised. Although {{by the time of}} its release in late 1999, Planescape: Torment's default 640x480 resolution was not considered particularly advanced, reviewers were pleased with the art design and color of the environments. The game's sound and music were described as [...] "well above the norm" [...] and [...] "superb", and one reviewer stated that his only complaint about the music was that [...] "there wasn't enough of it". Another reviewer stated that Planescape: Torment had [...] "just about the best sound" [...] they had heard in a video game. GamePro stated, [...] "... the characters talk with the talent of real professional voice actors during crucial bits of dialog". The game's graphics were moderately well received, with incite PC Gaming saying that [...] " [...] can be a little lackluster, although some of the spell effects certainly look very good", a statement echoed in NextGen which stated that [...] "mind-blowing spell effects ... will <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> a two-dimensional Final Fantasy game." ...|$|E

Then, she returns home, where she recovers from her {{hangover}} and prepares for another night of partying while trying on numerous outfits. She meets with her friends and goes to a club, where she gets drunk and starts to make out with them. Subsequently, she goes to the bathroom stall alone and starts to cry. After that, she returns home and collapses into her bed. Scenes interspersed through the main plot of the visual display Lo staring at the camera while lip syncing the lyrics of the song. Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "clever" [...] video that [...] "showcases Lo's artfully complicated party-girl image as she recreates some of the debauchery in her lyrics, {{as well as some of}} its after-effects". Caitlin White of Noisey said that the [...] "new video for 'Habits' shows the darker side of coping with a lost love" [...] and that it [...] "may <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> Janis Joplin a bit".

500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. [...] "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," [...] Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to [...] "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you.

[...] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with [...] "now take care of my baby". [...] Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you want to go and listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E

Sure, they haven't re-invented the wheel musically, yet they prove in style that they've already left a considerable legacy of entertainment." [...] Vicki Kellaway (Liverpool Echo) gave the band a 10 out 10 remarking, [...] "They are utterly shameless. You might think four men {{with an average age}} of 32 (I’m sorry to <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> that) would feel they are beyond the baggy jeans, printed hoodies, huge trainers and exaggerated ‘running man’ dance moves.

2500|$|The fleur-de-lis is {{the main}} element in the logo of most Scouting organizations. The symbol was first used by Sir Robert Baden-Powell as an arm-badge for {{soldiers}} who qualified as scouts (reconnaissance specialists) in the 5th Dragoon Guards, which he commanded {{at the end of}} the 19th century; it was later used in cavalry regiments throughout the British Army until 1921. In 1907, Baden-Powell made brass fleur-de-lis badges for the boys attending his first experimental [...] "Boy Scout" [...] camp at Brownsea Island. In his seminal book Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell referred to the motif as [...] "the arrowhead which shows the North on a map or a compass" [...] and continued; [...] "It is the Badge of the Scout because it points in the right direction and upward... The three points <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> the three points of the Scout Promise", being duty to God and country, helping others and keeping the Scout Law. The World Scout Emblem of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, has elements which are used by most national Scout organizations. The stars stand for truth and knowledge, the encircling rope for unity, and its reef knot or square knot, service.|$|E
2500|$|Williams's work is {{identified}} with the noir fiction subgenre of [...] "hardboiled" [...] crime writing. His 1953 novel Hell Hath No Fury—- published by the defining pulp crime fiction company, Gold Medal Books—- was the first paperback original to merit a review from renowned critic Anthony Boucher of The New York Times. Boucher relates Williams {{to two of the}} most famous noir fiction writers: [...] "The striking suspense technique...may <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> [...] Woolrich; the basic story, with its bitter blend of sex and criminality, may recall James M. Cain. But Mr. Williams is individually himself in his sharp but unmannered prose style and in his refusal to indulge in sentimental compromises." [...] Ed Gorman's description of a characteristic Williams novel, Man on the Run (1958), outlines the essential elements that associate it with the noir fiction category: [...] "a) a falsely accused man trying to elude police, b) a lonely woman as desperate in her way as the man on the run, c) enough atmospherics (night, rain, fog) to enshroud a hundred films noir." [...] Cultural critic Geoffrey O'Brien further details Williams's [...] "chief characteristics": ...|$|E
2500|$|Jesus {{told his}} apostles that {{after his death}} and resurrection he would send them the [...] "Advocate" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ), the [...] "Holy Spirit", who [...] "will teach you {{everything}} and <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> all that I told you". In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells his disciples [...] "If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!" [...] The Nicene Creed states that the Holy Spirit is one with God the Father and God the Son (Jesus); thus, for Catholics, receiving the Holy Spirit is receiving God, {{the source of all}} that is good. Catholics formally ask for and receive the Holy Spirit through the sacrament of Confirmation (Chrismation). Sometimes called the sacrament of Christian maturity, Confirmation is believed to bring an increase and deepening of the grace received at Baptism. Spiritual graces or gifts of the Holy Spirit can include wisdom to see and follow God's plan, right judgment, love for others, courage in witnessing the faith, knowledge, reverence, and rejoicing in the presence of God. The corresponding fruits of the Holy Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. To be validly confirmed, a person must be in a state of grace, which means that they cannot be conscious of having committed a mortal sin. They must also have prepared spiritually for the sacrament, chosen a sponsor or godparent for spiritual support, and selected a saint to be their special patron and intercessor.|$|E
