[...] means that the records are of fixed length, specified via the [...] parameter, and [...] specifies a variable-length record. V records when stored on media are prefixed by a Record Descriptor Word (RDW) containing the integer length of the record in bytes. With [...] and , multiple logical records are grouped together into a single physical block on tape or disk. FB and VB are , and , respectively. The [...] parameter specifies the maximum length of the block. [...] could be also specified, meaning , meaning all the blocks except the last one were required to be in full [...] length. , or , means a logical record could be spanned across two or more blocks, with flags in the RDW indicating whether a <b>record</b> <b>segment</b> is continued into the next block and/or was continued from the previous one.|$|E
40|$|The {{tables that}} follow map the logical {{attributes}} and relationships of the “metadata ” entities (<b>record,</b> <b>segment,</b> field, and data element) {{defined in the}} fourth segment of the extended model (Appendix D) to data elements contained in the MARC format. The mapping {{is part of a}} functional analysis of the MARC format that is intended to serve as a means of establishing a frame of reference for future development of the format. More specifically, the analysis in this segment is intended to facilitate a review of data in the MARC record that is designed to support data management, as distinct from simple information exchange. Scope The tables list the entities, attributes, and relationships defined in the fourth segment of the extended model and the corresponding data elements defined in the MARC bibliographic and holdings formats. The “metadata ” entities are listed in the order in which they are presented in the extended model. Under each entity, attributes pertaining to the entity that is the primary entity (i. e., the record itself, or the field itself) are listed first, followed by relationships to other entities of the same type and attributes of those related entities...|$|E

40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) is {{a valuable}} treatment option in Barrett's esophagus resulting in eradication of dysplasia and conversion of all Barrett's epithelium into normal squamous epithelium. In Barrett's esophagus, esophageal impedance monitoring is hampered by low baseline impedance values. Whether these low baselines are caused by an intrinsically low impedance of cylindrical epithelium or by the excessive reflux itself is hitherto unknown. Data on esophageal motility after RFA are scarce. Our aim {{was to examine the}} effect of RFA on esophageal motility and esophageal baseline impedance in patients with Barrett's esophagus. In 10 patients, conventional esophageal manometry and 24 -h pH-impedance measurements were performed before and after RFA. The number and type of reflux episodes were assessed and baseline impedance values were measured in all <b>recording</b> <b>segments.</b> In another five patients, high-resolution manometry was performed before and after RFA. Complete regression of all Barrett's epithelium was achieved in all 15 patients after 3 ± 1 RFA sessions. Overall, no significant motility changes were found after RFA. Patients had excessive acid exposure times before and after RFA [25 (17 - 42) and 16 (9 - 24) %, respectively]. Baseline esophageal impedance values were low, with the lowest values in the distal <b>recording</b> <b>segments.</b> RFA increased baseline impedance in all <b>recording</b> <b>segments</b> in the upright position; in the supine position, the effect just failed to reach statistically significant levels. RFA did not alter esophageal motility significantly. Low esophageal baseline impedance levels in patients with Barrett's esophagus reflect, at least in part, intrinsic impedance properties of cylindrical epithelium, as baselines increased after conversion into neosquamous epitheliu...|$|R
