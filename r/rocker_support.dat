40|$|Push rod type {{valve train}} is still widely used for low and medium speed engines. This paper {{describes}} the methodology followed for design of valve train for new 6 cylinder turbocharged dies el engine for generating set and industrial applications. Advanced prediction tools like GT power and Matlab program {{were used to}} optimize the design. Air requirement was calculated considering air fuel ratio and thermal efficiency. Inlet valve size was finalized based on gulp factor for optimum volumetric efficiency. Valve timing was optimized to get best fuel economy and optimum emission levels using GT power model. Poly dyne cam was used for minimizing vibrations and valve jump. Ramp height is calculated using cold valve clearance and static deflection of pushrod, rocker lever, rocker shaft, <b>rocker</b> <b>support</b> and cylinder head. Valve spring was designed {{to take care of}} valve jump. Finally camshaft was designed considering torque and bending load from valve train...|$|E
25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table and rocked back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving <b>rocker</b> <b>supports.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On February 8, 2008 {{the bridge}} was closed for {{inspection}} after a motorist called 911 when the deck dropped several inches.

On September 8, 2008, the northbound deck fully reopened and northbound traffic was relocated to it. The inner lane of the southbound deck remained closed, and southbound trucks were still barred from the span.|$|R

"Dreamline" [...] and [...] "Roll the Bones" [...] {{were popular}} radio staples {{of the early}} 90s, with the former {{reaching}} No.1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart, while [...] "Where's My Thing?" [...] became the band's third instrumental and was their second song to be nominated for a Grammy, in 1991, losing to Eric Johnson's [...] "Cliffs of Dover". Coincidentally, Johnson went on to provide support for the Roll the Bones tour in fall of 1991; alternative <b>rockers,</b> The Beyond <b>supported</b> them in Europe in 1992. The musical style of Roll the Bones {{paved the way for}} the [...] "alternative" [...] style of 1993â€™s Counterparts.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the intake}} rocker arms are marked {{so they are}} {{correctly}} placed on the rocker shaft when servicing. An IN1 or IN2 will be embossed on each rocker arm. As viewed {{from the front of}} the engine the Number 1 intake valve of each cylinder and the number 2 intake valve have an IN1 marked and IN2 marked rocker arm that mates with it. New IN1 rocker arms can also be identified by a Green painted mark on the top of the rocker arm. The IN2 rocker arms have a white mark. Proper positioning is maintained through the use of a wave washer located between the rocker shaft arm and <b>rocker</b> arm shaft <b>support.</b>|$|R
