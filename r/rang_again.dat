25|$|On July 15, 1801, Napoleon {{signed a}} Concordat with the Pope, which allowed the thirty-five {{surviving}} parish churches and two hundred chapels {{and other religious}} institutions of Paris to reopen. The 289 priests remaining in Paris were again allowed to wear their clerical costumes in the street, and the church bells of Paris (those which had not been melted down) <b>rang</b> <b>again</b> {{for the first time}} since the Revolution. However, the buildings and property which had been seized from the church was not returned, and the Parisian clergy were kept under the close supervision of the government; the bishop of Paris was nominated by the Emperor, and confirmed by the Pope.|$|E
25|$|Words {{were not}} scored by length. Instead, the {{position}} of the word's first letter was added to the number of the line it was on to determine a team's score. For instance, a word that started in the first position of the first line (line one, position one) would be worth two points, whereas a word on the same line but with the first letter in the eighth position (line one, position eight) would be worth nine points. Halfway through the round, a bell would ring and the teammates would switch seats. This occurred after six questions had been asked; after another six were asked, the bell <b>rang</b> <b>again</b> and the team that was in the lead when it rang the second time won the Elimination Round.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 May, {{they heard}} that the Belgian army was surrendering. [...] General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and {{emphasised}} the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted {{her to come to}} Paris before he flew to London. [...] She resisted – how could she leave her unit at a time like this? [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears <b>rang</b> <b>again</b> – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me out of his eyes. [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E
