40|$|Abstract — Auditing {{the changes}} to a {{database}} is critical for identifying malicious behavior, maintaining data quality, and improving system performance.

In this paper, we provide a framework for auditing {{the changes to}} a database system while respecting data <b>retention</b> <b>policies.</b> Our framework includes a historical data model that supports flexible audit queries, along with a language for <b>retention</b> <b>policies</b> that hide individual attribute values or remove entire tuples from history.

Arthur Andersen believed the instructions given to the jury were not proper. The jury was reportedly told [...] "even if petitioner honestly and sincerely believed its conduct was lawful, the jury could convict". This is not true, held the Supreme Court. The statute they were being charged under used the language [...] "knowingly ... corruptly persuade". Arthur Andersen managers did instruct their employees to delete Enron-related files, but those actions were within their document <b>retention</b> <b>policy.</b> If the document <b>retention</b> <b>policy</b> was constructed to keep certain information private, even from the government, Arthur Andersen was still not corruptly persuading their employees to keep said information private.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{understand}} the retention issue, which is very critical to the human resource management in the organization. Companies which retain valuable employees actually retain the asset of intelligence. Organizations have to bear massive costs associated with turnover, which may conduct directly or indirectly to the management reporting or budget system. The volunteer turnover rate {{is one of the}} scales to evaluate the success of company’s <b>retention</b> <b>policies.</b> To understand <b>retention,</b> one needs to understand its relation to many factors which may affect the retention. So in this project, we develop a framework which reflects the relationship between employee turnover rate and firm performance. The framework is built from both employee’s side and company’s side on the basis of literature review and survey conducted to the ETM students. Then we implement the model in the Google case study to see what Google achieves its <b>retention</b> <b>policies.</b> The results in this study could help the technology companies better understand their retention issue, and the technology companies could use the results for possible strategic decisions. In addition, the human resource department could use the results to modify the current <b>retention</b> <b>policies</b> for retaining valuable employees.
