50|$|The {{design and}} colour scheme for the {{majority}} of the Dalek props was very similar that used for the television versions at the time, having large, black, bases and predominantly silver paintwork, with grey shoulders, natural aluminium collars and slats and blue hemispheres. Three Daleks leaders are also shown. A gold Dalek appears to be in overall command of the invasion force, a black Dalek controls the Bedfordshire mining operation and bomb detonation, and a red Dalek is in charge of the Dalek spaceship and operations to capture human slaves, <b>robotise</b> prisoners and wipe-out any resistance. As with the first film, the props were fitted with larger dome light than their TV counterparts, and some were equipped with a mechanical claw in place of the standard plunger.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} musical {{instruments}} in playing conditions requires a highly controllable and repeatable excitatory mechanism. This mechanism {{has to be}} able to reproduce as closely as possible the human gesture in order to be representative of a playing technique. In the paper, we describe the development of a new string plucking device for the concert harp. This system, called DROPIC (Doigt <b>RObotisé</b> PInceur de Cordes), is a position-controlled two-degrees of freedom robot with a configurable silicone fingertip. In order to compare the plucking performed by DROPIC and by a harpist, trajectories are captured by a high-speed camera and the soundboard's vibrations are measured with an accelerometer. A set of features extracted from these data shows that the DROPIC plucking is comparable to the harpist one with a better repeatability. In addition to classical vibration and acoustic sensors, DROPIC can now be used to pluck a string and allows us to measure temporal features as well as spectro-temporal features in a repeatable and controllable playing context, thus creating an alternative to classical frequency-domain measurements of string instruments...|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the model}} two {{transmission}} {{are available on the}} GranTurismo and GranCabrio: a conventional torque converter 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed <b>robotised</b> gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Panda MultiEco is {{equipped}} with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine - future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix - combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic <b>robotised</b> gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The 2S35 is not {{a classic}} SPG, but rather a highly <b>robotised</b> system, {{with a high degree}} of automation. The 2S35 has a unified command-and-control system with which all actions are displayed. The system can {{automatically}} select the appropriate shell type for a task and the amount of charge required.|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the revolting, rebellious {{nature of the}} works by the contemporary Lithuanian writers M. Ivaškevičius, S. Parulskis, H. Kunčius, R. Šerelytė, J. Fomina, which were published in 2004. Combining V. Kubilius’s insights and J. Kristeva’s ideas developed in her book Sens et non-sens de la révolte, a certain literature {{is seen as a}} culturerevolt, able to save us in contemporary <b>robotising</b> world. One form of the revolt is anamnesis, i. e., the narration, repetition, and transformation of the traumatic, untold, and suppressed experience either of the narrator (in the texts by S. Parulskis, R. Šerelytė, J. Kunčinas, R. Gavelis) or the nation (M. Ivaškevičius). Anamnesis is based on the displacement. Analysing Ivaškevičius’s play Madagascar the revolutionary nature of a minor literature {{in the heart of the}} canonical literature and its characteristics as developed by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari are also discussed: in minor literature language is deteritorialised, everything is political and takes a collective value. Finally, when postcolonial aspects of the contemporary Lithuanian writing are taken into account, the differences between three generations of writers (born in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s, and 1980 ’s) can be marked...|$|R
50|$|Sweden, like {{countries}} around the globe, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973-74 and 1978-79. In the 1980s pillars of Swedish industry were massively restructured. Shipbuilding was discontinued, wood pulp was integrated into modernised paper production, the steel industry was concentrated and specialised, and mechanical engineering was <b>robotised.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The FIRE (for [...] "Fully Integrated <b>Robotised</b> Engine") is {{a series}} of {{automobile}} engines from Fiat Powertrain Technologies, built in FCA's Termoli, Betim and also in Dundee (only in 1.4 Multiair versions) plants. It was designed by Italian design firm Rodolfo Bonetto. [...] It is constructed by robot assembly plants ("Robogate") to reduce costs.|$|E
5000|$|The Fiat Idea {{engines are}} all Euro 4 compliant. The petrol engine is the 1.4-litre 16 valve , {{available}} with five- and six-speed gearboxes, and the diesel 1.3-litre 16 valve MultiJet units, with [...] or [...] All of these engines can be matched with a clutchless 5-speed sequential manual shift with a selectable, fully automatic mode [...] - [...] as <b>robotised</b> manual gearbox marketed as Duologic.|$|E
50|$|The {{most famous}} Autobianchi models include the A112 {{released}} in 1969, a small hatchback {{very popular in}} Italy for racing, and which ceased production in 1986; {{as well as the}} Y10, which was the first car to use Fiat's new FIRE (Fully Integrated <b>Robotised</b> Engine). The Primula was the car with which Fiat introduced the particular front-wheel drive arrangement of engine, transmission and differential (final drive) that has become prevalent in its cars today.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fleet of}} red Austin Ambassadors was shown on a {{production}} {{line in a}} 1982 Not the Nine O'Clock News skit - all the actor employees on the line were known as Bob. The end of the skit proclaimed [...] "The BL Ambassador - Hand Built by Roberts". This was a parody of the current Fiat ad campaign for the Strada which owing to the <b>robotised</b> production line proclaimed it was [...] "hand built by robots".|$|E
50|$|Cars {{built in}} Germany were {{assembled}} in {{a brand new}} (at the time) plant at Wolfsburg in Assembly Hall 54. The plant was heavily <b>robotised</b> {{in an effort to}} make build quality more consistent. New innovations on the second generation included an optional trip computer (referred to as the MFA, German Multi-Funktions-Anzeige), as well as silicone dampened engine and transmission mounts to reduce noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In 1988, a more advanced fully electronic fuel injection system became available. This arrangement is known as the Digifant engine management system.|$|E
50|$|Appearing {{briefly in}} the comic strip Emperor of the Daleks (1993), written by John Freeman and Paul Cornell, Psyche Daleks are {{depicted}} with a large mass of green brain tissue contained within a transparent sphere that sits {{on top of the}} shoulder section in place of the normal neck bin and dome. In the story a Psyche Dalek is used to control a small group of partially <b>robotised</b> prisoners through a remote device mounted on its arm in place of a plunger. The comic strip was drawn by Lee Sullivan.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Fiat {{invested}} heavily in robot automation throughout its factories, to both improve product quality and to reduce labour costs. The new Fully Integrated <b>Robotised</b> Engine was developed as part of this, to replace the previous range of small Fiat engines. Although taking the opportunity to update performance and emissions from Fiat's venerable 903cc pushrod engine, {{the primary goal of}} this new design was for easy assembly by robots. Key to this was the 'layer cake' construction of the new engine, held together by its long through bolts.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Ryder Report, which {{prioritized}} the ADO88/LC8 project, Longbridge {{would be}} expanded in 1978 with a £200m <b>robotised</b> {{body assembly line}} (known as the [...] "New West Works") to enable it to produce the new model which it was hoped would sell 100,000 or more units a year in Britain alone; production of the smaller Mini and larger Allegro was also pruned back to enable the plant to produce as many units of the Metro as possible, with the Allegro finally being axed in 1982 {{to make way for}} the Maestro.|$|E
5000|$|Robotics: Pioneering work in {{robotics}} {{research in}} Belgium, and in Europe; work includes: active force feedback; methodology for model-based task-specification {{and control of}} [...] "compliant motion" [...] tasks; universal three-finger gripper; LOLA, an off-line robot programming language with structured data base; KARMEN, a general analysis and design program for the inverse and direct kinematics and dynamics of 3D -mechanisms; multi-component force-torque sensors and a tactile sensor array; robotic force-controlled deburring; Service robotics: LiAS, an autonomous mobile manipulator; intelligent wheelchairs with shared autonomy; medical robotics, e.g. <b>robotised</b> laparoscopy involving innovative haptic interfaces.|$|E
5000|$|The MC Race Shift 6-speed <b>robotised</b> {{manual gearbox}} (which shares its {{electronics}} {{and some of}} its hardware from the Ferrari 599GTO) usually operates in an [...] "auto" [...] mode, but the driver can switch this to 'sport' or 'race' (shifts in 60 milliseconds in 'race' mode), which affects gearbox operations, suspension, traction control, and even the sound of the engine. The MC Stradale is the first GranTurismo to break the 300 km/h barrier, with a claimed top speed of 303 km/h. US market MC's do not have the [...] "Stradale" [...] part of the name, as they are sold with a fully automatic six-speed transmission rather than the one available {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in a 2011 {{interview}} with Green Gartside, Robin Turner said: In April '84, [...] "Wood Beez (Pray Like Aretha Franklin)" [...] crackled over airwaves from Anglesey to Arizona like an alien radio transmission beamed {{out to an}} unsuspecting planet. A gleaming, chromium nugget molded by ultra-modernist studioheads, it heralded in {{three and a half}} minutes the dramatic, bravura transformation of a band called Scritti Politti. Formerly a DIY squat punk band, they were now a group doused in glinting pop sheen. ... The resultant LP, Cupid and Psyche 85, yielded a string of radio-slaying singles ("Wood Beez...", [...] "Absolute", [...] "The Word Girl" [...] and [...] "Perfect Way") that segued fluently between ultra-slick <b>robotised</b> funk and meticulously constructed swoonsome lovers rock. Huge sales followed.|$|E
50|$|On the spaceship, Dr. Who and Tom are recaptured {{and taken}} to be <b>robotised</b> when the rebels, {{including}} David, Wyler and Louise, attack it. During the battle, Dr. Who and Tom free themselves. Dr. Who escapes with David, while Tom and Louise become trapped on the spaceship. After the attack fails, Wyler returns to the base where Dortmun and Susan are waiting and tells them that he saw Dr. Who escape. They decide {{to go to the}} outskirts of London and hide out until the rebels can regroup. Susan leaves a written message about their intentions for Dr. Who, then they depart and commandeer a van. Dortmun is killed when they encounter a Dalek patrol, however, and Wyler and Susan are forced to abandon the vehicle just before it is destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geographically}} agnostic {{nature of}} software means that new business opportunities may arise for those organisations {{who have a}} political or regulatory impediment to offshoring or outsourcing. A <b>robotised</b> automation can be hosted in a data centre in any jurisdiction and this has two major consequences for BPO providers. Firstly, for example, a sovereign government may not be willing or legally able to outsource the processing of tax affairs and security administration. On this basis, if robots are compared to a human workforce, this creates a genuinely new opportunity for a [...] "third sourcing" [...] option, after the choices of onshore vs. offshore. Secondly, and conversely, BPO providers have previously relocated outsourced operations to different political and geographic territories in response to changing wage inflation and new labor arbitrage opportunities elsewhere. By contrast, a data centre solution would seem to offer a fixed and predictable cost base that, if sufficiently low in cost on a robot vs. human basis, would seem to eliminate any potential need or desire to continually relocate operational bases.|$|E
5000|$|On {{this album}} their {{trademark}} samples are {{nowhere to be}} heard; the group have worked in live conditions, giving priority to lyrics, David Fall's solid drum work and raging guitars. While their powerful electro world-beat is still in evidence, it now provides a driving force for genuine songs. There is still plenty of experimentation, especially on [...] "Elemental", where the Southern accent of blueswoman Beverly Jo Scott blends admirably with the lyrical flights of a Turkish singer. Another example of cross-fertilisation is provided by [...] "Will You Be Ready", where the voice of Angela McCluskey (the Wild Colonials singer and Telepopmusik diva) merges with the delicate tones of Chitose Hajime's Amami (an island south of Japan shores). On [...] "Endangered Species" [...] (the first single taken from the album), Eric Mouquet's vocoderised vocals pay tribute to Kraftwerk in yet another cross-genre experience where his <b>robotised</b> voice joins with singing from Bulgaria's Stefka Iordanova. Fashioned for the dance floor, the remix of [...] "Endangered Species" [...] is boosted by bass from Galleon, authors of hits such as [...] "Believe" [...] and [...] "So I Begin". While the song Deep Blue Sea which experimented Far East sound, featured a guest vocal by Anggun who sang in both English and Bahasa Indonesia.|$|E
40|$|In a <b>robotised</b> {{warehouse}} a {{major issue}} is the safety of human operators in case of intervention in the work area of the robots. The current solution is to shut down every robot but it causes a loss of productivity, especially for large <b>robotised</b> warehouses. In order to avoid this loss we need to ensure the operator's security during his/her intervention in the warehouse without powering off the robots. The human operator needs to be localised in the warehouse and the trajectories of the robots have to be modified {{so that they do}} not interfere with the human. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate a visual localisation method with visual elements that are already available in the current warehouse setup.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the operation and}} control software of a developed automatic crane {{for use in the}} assembly of modular buildings elements in the construction site. The automatic system was developed using a commercial crane, which was modified by adding the adequate sensors, servomotors and an advanced control system. The new <b>robotised</b> crane system is meant to work in an automatic or semi-automatic manner to achieve the assembly of modules following the sequence established during the design process. ...|$|E
40|$|Filament winding is {{the mostly}} {{suitable}} technology to produce at large volume scale structural composite parts presenting revolution form, such as pressure and non-pressure vessels, tanks and pipes, aircraft fuselage, helicopter blades, etc. [1, 2]. Such process allows optimising the deposition and orientation of continuous reinforced fibres {{in order to}} manufacture the best performance and customised composite part for each specific application. Another advantage of this technological processing method is the possibility it gives of using almost all continuous reinforcing fibres (carbon, glass, aramid) and plastic matrices (both thermosetting and/or thermoplastic). As the investment for acquiring a filament winding equipment was too much high, the Pole for Innovation in Polymer Engineering (PIEP) decided to use its proper know-how to self-develop an own <b>robotised</b> filament winding equipment for laboratorial use. The aim of such equipment is to support R&D projects with industrial companies concerning the production of filament wound scaled prototype parts for testing, optimising and improving fibre deposition trajectories, study the complex shape manufacturing, testing the application of new fibres and matrices, etc. This paper will present the developed and built <b>robotised</b> filament winding equipment and will discuss its major possibilities, trajectories and software data acquisition capabilities and {{the results obtained on}} composite parts manufactured by it.

A simple statistical change detection algorithm for the weld quality, recursive Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), is used. The algorithm may equivalently {{be viewed as a}} cumulative sum (CUSUM) - type test. The test statistics is based upon the variance of the amplitude of the weld voltage. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using experimental data.

40|$|<b>Robotised</b> {{laser welding}} is an {{innovative}} joining technique which is increasingly finding applications, {{especially in the}} automotive industry. In {{order to reduce the}} time needed to prepare and programthe laser welding robot, off-line programming systems are used. The off-line programming systems currently available only allow kinematic simulations of the robot motion, which are insufficient for a proper a priori prediction of the ability to weld the seam as dynamic effects in the path tracking accuracy are not taken into account. Combining off-line programming systems and dynamic simulations of the robot motion makes it possible to predict the path tracking errors in advance...|$|E
40|$|Various {{forms of}} threats, {{technological}} accidents, {{especially in the}} chemical industry and military complexes which cause major damages to humans, assets and environment, draw attention to development of new technological means to eliminate danger without the risk for human life. This determines the equipment logistic for the protection and rescue system. In line with this, the article presents {{the development of a}} robotized system for detection of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats (CBRN), and for detection and neutralization of improvised explosive devices (CIED). In addition, a prototype model of a robotic vehicle is constructed. Reconnaissance, terrain and object mapping are of great importance so that the operators and technicians have at their disposal an option of multiple analysis of a problem. The basic feature of using a robotized machine is the replacement of EOD and CBRN technicians in various life-threatening situations. Citizens 2 ̆ 7 trust is of greatest and crucial importance for providing safety in such extraordinary situations. In order to meet the strict tactical and technical requirements, the <b>robotised</b> system comprises the stealth platform, working tools, a control console, a manipulator arm for complex actions, a CBRN detector, an additional EOD robot for terrain scouting and sample taking, an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and a mobile command center. The prototype model of a robotic vehicle shows that the project is both technically and economically feasible {{on the basis of a}} tracked machine with battery propulsion, the Ultra Low Profile dozer. Existing resources and experience in development of specialized machines are significant for the development of a <b>robotised</b> system...|$|E
30|$|This random space, {{discontinuous}} and heterogeneous, shows {{itself as}} a surface on which spatio-physical events, moving at different speeds, belong to kinds {{of time and space}} that can no longer be united with each other. Within an area of a few square kilometres, often on the horizon of the same locality, we can witness full-scale pluri-secular gaps: situations existing side by side that refer to extremely different time frames; technicians of the advanced tertiary sector side by side with shepherds, <b>robotised</b> industries with flocks of sheep, places where time seems on the one hand to have come to a halt while, on the other, it seems to be synchronised with the clocks of Silicon Valley.|$|E
40|$|When {{dealing with}} {{unmanned}} agricultural vehicles (remotely-controlled vehicles, robots), vision systems are a key-factor for implementing field-solutions having direct interactions with crops. Among {{all the possible}} information given by a vision system, the punctual estimation of the canopy volume is surely an interesting parameter: it {{is related to the}} crop vegetative status and, hence, it is fundamental for performing and setting-up properly some important field-operations (e. g., pruning/thinning, spraying). A system able to recognize the canopy volume can provide either the input-signals for implementing a robotic real-time site-specific farming system or relevant information for a proper crop management. However, there are many practical difficulties in the field implementation of such a system: complex canopy shapes, different colours, textures and illumination conditions with projected shadows. Terrestrial/aerial vision systems working on visible-light wavelengths and/or 2 D-images of crops, although capable of excellent performances, have a computationally-heavy post-processing; therefore, they are unsuitable for implementing low-cost real-time servo-actuated cropping systems (e. g., <b>robotised</b> sprayers). Instead, a vision system composed by two LiDAR sensors aligned vertically, scanning the same targets, could give a sort of stereoscopic vision, here named ‘‘lateral-linear-stereoscopic vision”. The aim of this study is assessing the opportunity to use such a system on an automatic or autonomous/ <b>robotised</b> implement by performing some preliminary tests in a controlled environment. The resulting system is independent of the lighting conditions (it works also in the dark), is highly reliable (no projected shadows) and data processing is very fast. Although further studies are required to overcome the issues that could arise in a future field implementation, this system has all the premises to be successfully embedded in an automatized monitoring system...|$|E
