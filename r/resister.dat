25|$|Clark bore {{four daughters}} {{and two sons}} that were later {{sympathetic}} to women's rights. Margaret Clark Gillett (1878–1962) was a botanist and suffragist. Alice Clark and her sister Esther Bright Clothier were successive secretaries of NUWSS. Hilda Clark was active in women's rights. Roger Clark co-founded the Friends' League for Women's Suffrage, a Quaker group of reformers. Roger Clark's wife Sarah Bancroft Clark was a tax <b>resister</b> and suffragist active in several political groups. In 1900, Clark lived in Millfield, Street, Somerset, England.|$|E
25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the <b>resisters</b> remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent <b>resisters</b> violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the <b>resisters.</b> If the <b>resisters</b> are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the <b>resisters.</b> Often, the willingness of the <b>resisters</b> to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|R

25|$|A {{person could}} {{be both a}} tax protester and a tax <b>resister</b> {{if he or she}} {{believes}} that tax laws do not apply to him or her and also believes that taxes should not be paid based on the use to which the taxes are put. Some tax resisters have put forth legal arguments for their position—for instance that they cannot pay taxes for nuclear weapons development because this would put them in violation of the Nuremberg Principles—that could be considered varieties of tax-protester theories.|$|E
25|$|Andrew McKeever, an NDP {{candidate}} in Durham, announced on October 3 {{that he would}} resign from the election campaign after {{it was revealed that}} he had posted comments on Facebook in which he called one war activist a “fascist bitch” and threatened to beat up another person. Mr. McKeever wrote comments peppered with expletives and calling the operators of a war <b>resister</b> website “Nazis.” McKeever was also quoted as saying “I like the part in Schindler’s List when the guard starts waxing the prisoners.” McKeever’s decision {{to drop out of the}} race came with just over a week left in the campaign, meaning his name would remain on the ballot. One week before the publication of McKeever's resignation, NDP leader Jack Layton defended McKeever and refused to make him step down.|$|E
25|$|On the {{emergence}} of the communist regime in Romania, Celan fled Romania for Vienna, Austria. It was there that he befriended Ingeborg Bachmann, who had just completed a dissertation on Martin Heidegger. Facing a city divided between occupying powers and with little resemblance to the mythic capital it once was, which had harboured the then-shattered Austro-Hungarian Jewish community, he moved to Paris in 1948. In that year his first poetry collection, Der Sand aus den Urnen ("Sand from the Urns"), was published in Vienna by A. Sexl. His first few years in Paris were marked by intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, as expressed in letters to his colleagues, including his longtime friend from Cernăuţi, Petre Solomon. It was also during this time that he exchanged many letters with Diet Kloos, a young Dutch singer and anti-Nazi <b>resister</b> who saw her husband of a few months tortured to death. She visited him twice in Paris between 1949 and 1951.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme (TADP) assisted American war <b>resisters</b> {{who came to}} Canada {{in response to the}} Vietnam War. It illustrates how the TADP responded to political decisions in Canada and in the United States and adapted its strategies to meet the changing needs of war <b>resisters</b> who fled to Canada. The main sources of material used for this research were the TADP’s archival records, newspaper accounts and secondary literature. This study traces the organization’s origins in the Canadian New Left before looking at how TADP released the Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada; a document that advised war <b>resisters</b> on how to successfully prepare for immigration. It will also explore how TADP provided immigration counselling, employment, housing services and emotional support to American war <b>resisters.</b> Some of the organization’s principal actors and its relationship with other Canadian aid organizations are also examined. As the number of draft <b>resisters</b> coming to Canada decreased during the war, the number of military <b>resisters</b> entering the country increased. This shift led to a change in the type of counselling the TADP provided, a reorientation that is also discussed here. As well, the unexpected numbers of African-Americans and women <b>resisters</b> who crossed the border presented a unique set of challenges to the TADP. Finally, this thesis examines the TADP’s attempts to aid American war <b>resisters</b> in Sweden, spread the word about the Canadian government’s liberalized immigration regulations in 1973, and address the issue of amnesty for <b>resisters</b> in America...|$|R

500|$|Goldman was a {{committed}} war <b>resister,</b> believing that wars were fought {{by the state}} on behalf of capitalists. [...] She was particularly opposed to the draft, viewing {{it as one of}} the worst of the state's forms of coercion, {{and was one of the}} founders of the No-Conscription League—for which she was ultimately arrested (1917), imprisoned and deported (1919).|$|E
500|$|The {{results of}} Satin's {{approach}} were noticeable: the Programme went from averaging {{fewer than three}} visitors, letters, and phone calls per day just before he arrived, to averaging 50 per day nine months later. [...] In addition, the American anti-war movement became more accepting of emigration to Canada– for example, author Myra MacPherson reports that Satin's Manual for Draft-Age Immigrants to Canada could be obtained at every draft counseling office in the U.S. [...] However, Satin's approach was distressing to the traditional pacifists and socialists on the Programme's board. [...] The board clashed with Satin over at least 10 political, strategic, and performance issues. [...] The most intractable may have been over {{the extent of the}} publicity. [...] There were also concerns about Satin's personal issues; for example, one war <b>resister</b> claims to have heard him say, [...] "Anonymity would kill me". [...] In May 1968, the board finally fired him.|$|E
500|$|With loan defender John Egan {{returning}} to his parent club {{at the start of}} April, Nick Montgomery's loan at Millwall was all but cut short after only two substitute appearances when he sustained a calf injury likely to sideline him {{until the end of the}} season. David McAllister also saw his loan spell at Shrewsbury cut short shortly after receiving a red card, with the resulting three game ban ruling him out for the remainder of his time at the New Meadow. [...] Back in the league a nervy display saw the Blades edge out Bournemouth at Bramall Lane, before a much more emphatic performance saw them bury Rochdale at the Spotland Stadium. [...] With the Blades now in a straight fight with local rivals Sheffield Wednesday for the second automatic promotion spot they came from behind to beat Leyton Orient at Bramall Lane to open up a four-point gap on third placed Wednesday. [...] The next week however their campaign was dealt a crushing blow as star striker and top scorer Ched Evans's case came to trial where he was found guilty of rape and sentenced to five years in prison. [...] Without Evans and missing his injured strike partner Richard Cresswell, United slipped to a damaging defeat at MK Dons. [...] Worse was to come as United could only <b>resister</b> a draw with Stevenage in a dramatic final home game at Bramall Lane, meaning they slipped out of the automatic promotion places for the first time since February. [...] United went into the final league fixture with Exeter City requiring to win and hope that rivals Sheffield Wednesday were beaten to secure promotion; a combination that failed to materialise as Wednesday registered a victory and the Blades could only draw meaning they were consigned to the play-offs.|$|E
5000|$|Tax <b>resisters</b> are {{distinct}} from [...] "tax protesters," [...] who {{deny that the}} legal obligation to pay taxes exists or applies to them. Tax <b>resisters</b> may accept that some law commands them to pay taxes but they still choose to resist taxation.|$|R
50|$|Individuals that do {{not comply}} with tax payment include tax protesters and tax <b>resisters.</b> Tax protesters attempt to evade the payment of taxes using {{alternative}} interpretations of the tax law, while tax <b>resisters</b> refuse to pay a tax for conscientious reasons. Tax protesters believe that taxation under the Federal Reserve is unconstitutional, while tax <b>resisters</b> {{are more concerned with}} not paying for particular government policies that they oppose. Because taxation is often perceived as onerous, governments have struggled with tax noncompliance since the earliest of times.|$|R

2500|$|Respect or {{love for}} opponents {{also has a}} pragmatic justification, in that the {{technique}} of separating the deeds from the doers allows {{for the possibility of}} the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs.

2500|$|In 1972, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania {{used the}} term tax [...] "protestor" [...] (protester) in United States v. Malinowski. This case, however, {{involved}} a taxpayer {{who was a member}} of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League who was protesting the use of tax money in the Vietnam War. The taxpayer was not making arguments that the tax law itself was invalid; he was essentially protesting the war, not the tax. The taxpayer had filed a false Form W-4, and admitted he knew that he was not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (allowances) he claimed on the W-4. Thus, Malinowski might be termed a tax <b>resister</b> rather than a tax protester. He was convicted, and his motion for a new trial or acquittal was denied.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{had a long}} batting line up in the 1965-66 Ashes {{series and}} in the Fourth and Fifth Tests they had seven {{specialist}} batsmen, the all-rounder Tom Veivers and the wicket-keeper Wally Grout batting at number 9. Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry were the best opening partnership in the world, being the only opening batsmen to have both made a double century in the same innings as they added a record 382 for the first wicket in the West Indies in 1964-65. Lawry was a [...] "tall, lanky, dour, watchful left-hander, and a better player than he looked...a great fighter, and a splendid <b>resister</b> in a corner", who was once unfairly described as [...] "a corpse with pads on". His 592 runs (84.57) in the series was the most in an Ashes series since Don Bradman's 680 runs (97.14) in 1946–47 and his three centuries were the most since Arthur Morris made three in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|Josiah Warren {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, The Peaceful Revolutionist, was the first anarchist periodical published,. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster [...] "It is apparent...that Proudhonian Anarchism was {{to be found in the}} United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews...William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.". Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax <b>resister,</b> development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his books Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication Liberty.|$|E
