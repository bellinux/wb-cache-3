40|$|ABSTRACT: Currently, {{manufacturers}} of agricultural tractors offer to farmers {{a diversity of}} brands, models, and settings for the most diverse agricultural operations. In this sense, the relation mass/power of tractor influences directly {{in the performance of}} these operations. The objective of this research was to study the agricultural wheel tractors marketed in Brazil in relation to their mass, in order to obtain current data to help their selection and proper use. The research involved 145 agricultural tractors models of eight different brands, including 2 WD, MFWD and 4 WD versions.

40|$|Abstract. To use {{dimethyl}} ether as fuel for {{compression ignition engine}} to partially replace fossil oil, this study developed a city bus operating on DME blended with diesel oil. Considering fuel lubricity, viscosity, and calorific value, the optimized mixing ratio for blend fuel was chosen as 20 wt % DME in diesel oil (D 20). Vapor pressure experiments carried out using a highly accurate thermophysical property measurement system showed that the backpressure for blended fuels must not be lower than 0. 6 Mpa to avoid vapor block in the engine fuel supply system. Moreover, because DME attacks conventional polymer sealants in the fuel system, new sealants made of nitrile rubber (NBR) were used to replace those original one. Experiments demonstrated that these were resistant to swelling by DME. For engine performance, {{it was found that}} fueled with D 20, the <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> output can be comparable to that of diesel engine after increasing the supplied fuel amount per cycle, while the overall fuel economy was improved simultaneously.

40|$|This report {{comprises}} {{fuel consumption}} and emissions from {{non-road mobile machinery}} equipped with diesel engine with a rated power of 37 to 560 kW. Non-road mobile machinery comprises of tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulated haulers and trucks etc. Non-road mobile machinery is almost exclusively equipped with diesel engine and thus significantly contributes to the overall emissions of pollutants in the society. In Europe non-road mobile machinery contributes with about 15 to 20 % of the total emissions of nitrogen oxides (EEA, 2005). Besides estimates of annual fuel consumption and emission amounts this report also include inventories {{of the number of}} machines and the annual work hours. In total 15 different types of non-road mobile machinery was identified, of which one was other machinery. Each type of machinery was further divided into three net power regions. Information concerning number of machines, annual work hour, <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> load factor and fuel consumption and emission factors were obtained for each type of machine, power region and model year for the last 25 years. Annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts were individually calculated for each type of machine, net power region and model year. The methodology employed within this study differs to some extend to that of other recently conducted studies within the same area, emissions from non-road mobile machinery. Firstly, concern was taken to the age distribution, for example both the number of machinery and the annual work hour varies significantly with age or model year of the machinery. Secondly, both fuel consumption and emissions factors were individually adapted the each type of machinery and activity in order to better represent the actual use of the machinery and thus resulting fuel consumption and emissions. The fuel consumption and emission factors were based on the CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook and European emissions regulations for non-road mobile machinery and adjusted for: • differences in quality and specification between the fuel stipulated for use during type approval and Swedish diesel of environmental class 1, • differences between the maximum value stipulated in the emission regulations and the recorded emission amounts during type approval, • differences in engine load between the test cycle employed during type approval and during real use of the machinery, and • deterioration in fuel consumption and emission formation with increasing age. In total, 290 000 non-road mobile machinery with a <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of 37 to 560 kW were estimated to operate in Sweden year 2006, which was about 25 % more machinery compared with the last published study concerning number of non-road mobile machinery in Sweden (Flodström et al., 2004). The annual estimated fuel consumption and emission mounts from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden for year 2006 is shown in table S 1. The estimated annual fuel consumption was about 5 % lower compared with previous studies despite the higher number of machinery included. For emissions the differences were even larger compared with the above-mentioned study. Emissions of both carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons were reduced with approximately 70 % each or 13 000 and 5 100 ton respectively. Corresponding data for emissions of nitrogen oxides was 20 000 ton or 50 %. However, the largest difference was obtained for emissions of particulate matter, the estimated amounts within the present study was reduced with 75 % or 3 100 ton compared with the amounts estimated in previous studies. The differences obtained could be attributed to several aspects, for example significantly improved inventory data and especially the age distribution and annual work hour as function of machinery age. Another important characteristics of the present study were the adaptation of fuel consumption and emission factors to the actual use and conditions in Sweden. Finally, the model employed calculated the annual fuel consumption and emission amounts for each type of machinery, net power region and model year individually and not only as averages...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} both the present {{situation}} and estimates of emissions from large non-road mobile machinery were studied. The estimates over future emission amount from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden were conducted for the year 2010 and 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the development of}} technology for diesel engines and alternative fuels. Moreover, possible measures and means of control to reduce emissions in the future were discussed. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions from non-road mobile machinery equipped with diesel engines with a <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of 37 to 560 kW. Nonroad mobile machinery for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined harvester, forestry machines and trucks. The estimate of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts were based on input data concerning occurring types of machinery, number of machines, average engine power, annual work hour, load factors, fuel consumption and emission factors. Furthermore, concern was taken to the age distribution of the entire assembly of machinery. Inventory data regarding types of machinery, number, age, engine power, and annual work hour has been obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The fuel consumption and emission factors used were based on the CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook and European emissions regulations for non-road mobile machinery and adjusted for: • differences in quality and specification between the fuel stipulated for use during type approval and Swedish diesel of environmental class 1, • differences between the maximum value stipulated in the emission regulations and the recorded emission amounts during type approval, • differences in engine load between the test cycle employed during type approval and during real use of the machinery, and • deterioration in fuel consumption and emission formation with increasing age. In total, 290 000 non-road mobile machinery with a <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of 37 to 560 kW were estimated to operate in Sweden year 2006, which was about 25 % more machinery compared with the last published study concerning number of non-road mobile machinery in Sweden (Flodström et al., 2004). The annual estimated fuel consumption and emission mounts from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden for year 2006 is shown in table S 1. The estimated annual fuel consumption was about 5 % lower compared with previous studies despite the higher number of machinery included. For emissions the differences were even larger compared with the above-mentioned study. Emissions of NOx were halved while both emissions of CO and HC only amounted to approximately one-third of previously estimated amounts. The largest difference was obtained for emissions of particulate matter, a reduction with 75 %. The differences obtained could be attributed to improved input data with higher resolution, especially concerning annual work hour as function of machinery age and the adjustment of fuel consumption and emission factors. Possible changes in the assembly of machinery between the present and previous studies were assumed to only have minor importance. Several different estimates of future emission amounts were conducted. The first estimate was based on the introduction of the European emission regulation, which resulted in a reduction of emissions of NOx and PM with about 70 % compared with the present amounts. Corresponding reduction of NOx and PM to year 2010 were about 21 %. The development of technology for diesel engines is focused on the reduction of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. According to the study, current technologies for reduction of NOx were EGR, NOx-traps, SCR and engine-out modifications. For particulate matter, engine-out and different types of particulate filters will be utilised in order to fulfil future emission regulations. Alternative fuels can be used {{in order to reduce the}} emissions from current diesel engines, the most promising and suitable fuels in the future would probably be GTL-fuels, synthetic diesel and different types of biodiesel. For dedicated engines, dimethylester (DME) could be an interesting alternative. Several different means of control for reduction of emissions from non-road mobile machinery exists. Within the agricultural and forestry sector different types of economical means of control were assumed to be the most cost-effective methods.

40|$|The {{ability to}} define in-field tractor load states offers the {{potential}} to better specify and characterize fuel consumption rate for various field operations. For the same field operation, the tractor experiences diverse load demands and corresponding fuel use rates as it maneuvers through straight passes, turns, suspended operation for adjustments, repair and maintenance, and biomass or other material transfer operations. It is challenging to determine the actual fuel rate and load states of agricultural machinery using force prediction models, and hence, some form of in-field data acquisition capability is required. Controller Area Networks (CAN) available on the current model tractors provide engine performance data {{which can be used}} to determine tractor load states in field conditions. In this study, CAN message data containing fuel rate, engine speed and percent torque were logged from the tractor’s diagnostic port during anhydrous NH 3 application, field cultivation and planting operations. Time series and frequency plots of fuel rate and percent torque were generated to evaluate tractor load states. Based on the percent torque, engine speed and <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> actual load on the tractor was calculated in each tractor load state. Anhydrous NH 3 application and field cultivation were characterized by three distinct tractor load states (TS-I, TS-II and TS-III) corresponding to idle states, parallel and headland passes, and turns, whereas corn planting was characterized by two load states (TS-I and TS-II) : idle, and a combined state with parallel, headland passes and turns. For anhydrous NH 3 application and field cultivation at ground speeds of 7. 64 km h– 1 and 8. 68 km h– 1, average tractor load per tool and fuel use rate per tool of the implement were found to be 7. 21 kW tool– 1, 3. 28 L h– 1 tool– 1, and 1. 31 kW tool– 1, 0. 64 L h– 1 tool– 1, respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims at {{showing how}} to transform hydraulic systems of railway multi-actuator machinery characterized by inefficient state-of-the-art systems into the 21 st Century. Designing machines {{that are highly}} efficient, productive, reliable, and cost affordable represents the target of this research. In this regard, migrating from valve-controlled architectures to displacement-controlled layouts is the proper answer. Displacement-controlled systems remove the losses generated by flow throttling typical of conventional circuits, allow an easy implementation of energy recovery (e. g. during regenerative braking), and create the possibility {{for the use of}} hybrid systems capable of maximizing the downsizing of the combustion engine. One portion of the dissertation focuses on efficient propulsion systems suitable for railway construction and maintenance machines. Two non-hybrid architectures are first proposed, i. e. a novel layout grounded on two independent hydrostatic transmissions (HSTs) and two secondary controlled hydraulic motors (SCHMs) connected in parallel. Three suitable control strategies are developed according to the specific requirements for railway machines and dedicated controllers are implemented. Detailed analyses are conducted via high-fidelity virtual simulations involving accurate modeling of the rail/wheel interface. The performance of the propulsion systems is proven by acceptable velocity tracking, accurate stopping position, achieving regenerative braking, and the expected behavior of the slip coefficients on both axles. Energy efficiency is the main emphasis during representative working cycles, which shows that the independent HSTs are more efficient. They consume 6. 6 % less energy than the SCHMs working with variable-pressure and 12. 8 % less energy than the SCHMs controlled with constant-pressure. Additionally, two alternative hybrid propulsion systems are proposed and investigated. These architectures enable a 35 % reduction of the baseline machine’s <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> without modifying the working hydraulics. Concerning the working hydraulics, the focus is to extend displacement-controlled technology to specific functions on railway construction and maintenance machines. Two specific examples of complete hydraulic circuits for the next generation tamper-liners are proposed. In particular, an innovative approach used to drive displacement-controlled dual function squeeze actuators is presented, implemented, and experimentally validated. This approach combines two functions into a unique actuator, namely squeezing the ballast and vibrating the tamping tools of the work-heads. This results in many advantages, such as variable amplitude and variable frequency of the tamping tools’ vibration, improved reliability of the tamping process, and energy efficient actuation. A motion of the squeeze actuator characterized by a vibration up to 45 Hz, i. e. the frequency used in state-of-the-art systems, is experimentally confirmed. In conclusion, this dissertation demonstrates that displacement-controlled actuation represents the correct solution for next-generation railway construction and maintenance machines. ...|$|E

A. 20 -foot wind tunnel on: (1) a wing, of 6. 5 -foot span, 5. 5 -foot chord, and 30 percent maximum {{thickness}}, fitted with large end plates and (2) a 16 -foot span 2. 67 -foot chord wing of 15 percent maximum thickness to determine the increase in lift obtainable by removing the boundary layer and the power required for the blower. The results of the tests on the stub wing appeared more favorable than previous small-scale tests and indicated that: (1) the suction method was considerably superior to the pressure method, (2) single slots were more effective than multiple slots (where the same pressure was applied to all slots), the slot efficiency increased rapidly for increasing slot widths up to 2 percent of the wing chord and remained practically constant for all larger widths tested, (3) suction pressure and power requirements were quite low (a computation for a light airplane showed that a lift coefficient of 3. 0 could be obtained with a suction as low as 2. 3 times the dynamic pressure and a power expenditure less than 3 percent of the <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power),</b> and (4) the volume of air required to be drawn off was quite high (approximately 0. 5 cubic feet per second per unit wing area for an airplane landing at 40 miles per hour with a lift coefficient of 3, 0), indicating that considerable duct area must be provided in order to prevent flow losses inside the wing and insure uniform distribution of suction along the span. The results from the tests of the large-span wing were less favorable than those on the stub wing. The reasons for this were, probably: (1) the uneven distribution of suction along the span, (2) the flow losses inside the wing, (3) the small radius of curvature of {{the leading edge of the}} wing section, and (4) the low Reynolds Number of these tests, which was about one half that of the stub wing. The results showed a large increase in the maximum lift coefficient with an increase in Reynolds Number in the range of the tests. The results of drag tests showed that the profile drag of the wing was reduced and the L/D ratio was increased throughout the range of lift coefficients corresponding to take-off and climb but that the minimum drag was increased. The slot arrangement that is best for low drag is not the same, however, as that for maximum lift...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis is primarily motivated by rising fuel costs and increasingly stringent emissions regulations for diesel engines. These factors increase the cost of operation {{and the cost of}} production of mobile hydraulic machine systems, thereby providing large incentives for the discoveries of more efficient hydraulic system solutions. Additionally, sensors and electronics are becoming more openly accepted for use in mobile hydraulic machine systems and they are key enablers to the development of smarter and more efficient system solutions. Displacement controlled (DC) actuation technology is an energy efficient hydraulic actuation technology which could have a substantial impact on energy consumption and emissions of the mobile machine sector if it were to become widely accepted. It has been demonstrated to save 40 % fuel compared to a standard load sensing hydraulic system on a compact excavator performing a truck loading cycle. Its lack of acceptance today is due to a combination of unfamiliarity with the system, higher costs due to current low volume production of necessary components, and its reliance on sensors and electronic controllers. DC actuation is a hydraulic actuation technology where the motion of the hydraulic motor or cylinder is controlled directly by the volume of fluid displaced by a servo pump, without the use of metering valves. More specifically, in this work it will refer to the use of a swash plate type axial piston pump to control a hydraulic cylinder, where the cylinder motion is controlled directly by adjusting the swash plate angle. This type of actuation is more efficient than valve controlled actuators because only the exact amount of pressure and flow required for actuator control is generated and therefore the only power losses are those of the pump, the transmission lines, and the cylinder. In addition to this the servo pump will behave as a motor when braking of the actuator is required and this will recover energy to the input shaft which can either be stored or used elsewhere in the system. This thesis will focus on design of multi-actuator DC hydraulic systems. Specifically new circuit architectures will be introduced with goals of overcoming common barriers to the application of basic DC actuators in mobile machine systems. The most notable of these architectures is the DC series-parallel (S-P) hydraulic hybrid system which introduces energy storage into DC actuator systems without requiring an additional pump/motor for energy storage and reuse. Among other benefits this system also has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} pumps required for DC actuator systems in multi-actuator mobile machines. A dynamic simulation of this system for an aggressive truck loading cycle of an excavator reveals that the hybrid design would save 20 % fuel compared to the non-hybrid DC system while allowing a reduction of 50 % for the <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power.</b> In addition to new architecture designs static sizing guidelines are given for DC actuators and a multi-body dynamic and hydraulic co-simulation model is derived for multi-actuator DC systems and validated with experimental measurements on a DC excavator. The model is then used to study the effect of component sizing, component performance, and parameter variations on the overall system productivity and efficiency of the non-hybrid DC system. A new static sizing methodology is also introduced for the S-P hybrid system and a dynamic sizing methodology using dynamic programming as a design tool is presented for DC S-P hybrid systems. Finally the improved efficiency of DC hydraulic systems results in lower operating temperatures of the hydraulic oil compared to standard valve controlled systems. For this reason a thermal model for multi-actuator DC mobile machines is introduced. The model is validated with experimental measurements and simulations show that the heat rejection requirement of the hydraulic cooler on the prototype DC excavator could be reduced by as much as 50 %. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} future annual {{emissions}} amounts of gaseous pollutants, particulate matter (PM 10) and {{noise from the}} non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden were estimated. The estimates over future emissions amounts were conducted for each year from 2006 to 2020. Special focus has been taken {{to the impact of}} European and national legislations, the age distribution of different types and sizes of machinery and measures to reduce the annual emissions. Besides different measures to reduce emissions, corresponding costs were also estimated. The study comprises fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and noise from non-road mobile machinery equipped with diesel engines with a <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of 37 to 560 kW. Non-road mobile machinery for example includes tractors, wheel loaders, excavators, articulate haulers, mobile cranes, combined harvesters, forestry machinery and trucks. The current report was a supplementary study to a report describing a methodology for estimating annual fuel consumption and emissions from the non-road mobile machinery sector in Sweden for year 2006. Inventory data of the year 2006 study was obtained from the Swedish machinery testing institute’s machinery inspection operation, statistics of sale returns from trade organisations and the Swedish motor-vehicle register. The number of machinery and annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts for year 2006 is presented in table S 1. Besides estimates of annual fuel consumption and emissions amounts, emissions of noise was also derived both at a national level and for a specific construction site. For the case study the results showed {{that it was possible to}} reduce the average noise level with more than 3 dB(A) compared with the base scenario just by choosing the machinery fulfilling the strictest noise limits, i. e. Stage II which was mandatory for most machinery from 2006. Other measures simulated included various types of retrofit of noise reduction packages. The specific cost for the different measures to reduce average noise emissions from the specific construction site varied from 4 000 up to more than 500 000 SEK dB- 1. For the estimate of future fuel consumption and emissions amounts various simulations were conducted, each with a different measure for reducing the annual amounts. Five main emission reduction measures or programs were studied: - Scrappage program - Alternative fuel program - Voluntary emission regulation program - Retrofit of aftertreatment program - Noise reduction program The impact on engine exhaust gas emissions and noise of the current European emission and noise regulations, Stage I to IV and Stage I to II for emissions and noise respectively were common for all simulations or programs. Besides the impact of European regulations, annual work was set to a fixed value for each type of machinery and year simulated, thus eliminating any potential changes of the state of the market. The result of the baseline scenario "Business as usual" (BAU), i. e. only taking account to the impact of European regulation, is presented in table S 2 for four different years Both fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2 remains fairly constant as an effect of the assumption that the annual work was set at a fixed value. However, emissions of especially NOx and PM showed a major reduction due to the tighter and tighter regulations. All programs simulated were able to reduce the emissions compared with the BAU scenario with exceptions for emissions of nitrogen oxides, which increased in some of the alternative fuel programs. Both the absolute reduction and cost varied significantly between and within the various programs. Reduction of NOx varied from an accumulated increase in emissions of 25 000 tonne to an accumulated reduction of 22 000 tonne for the studied period from 2006 to 2020. At the same time the accumulated cost for the programs varied from a few hundred million SEK to more than 60 000 million SEK. In table S 3, specific reduction cost for each pollutant in SEK kg- 1 for eight typical emission reduction programs are presented. The results showed that the most economically favourable alternative for reducing emissions from non-road mobile machinery was the voluntary emissions regulation program, i. e. early introduction of machinery fulfilling coming emission limits. Another important result was that the introduction of alternative fuels as a mean of emissions reduction was associated with rather high costs compared to the actual reduction in emissions. For emissions of nitrogen oxides the specific reduction cost varied from almost 100 SEK kg- 1 up to a few hundreds of SEK kg- 1 except for the alternative fuel programs, which resulted in a considerable higher cost...|$|E

Multiple fuels were used and data was gathered on the fuel consumption <b>rates</b> at various <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> outputs. The data was then analyzed and cross checked against published data. Comparison showed that the 3 W engine was measured to have efficiencies in the same 5 - 15 % range as a similar sized engines in the literature. This proves the utility of our small engine test stand and verifies the sensors used, all as a step towards a more advanced and highly automated engine testing platform...|$|R

Spoilers on the wings or thrust reversal may also be deployed to lose lift without having to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> substantially, slowing the <b>rate</b> of <b>engine</b> cooling.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we suggest}} {{that the use of}} an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) as a {{bottoming}} cycle to recover waste heat from the exhaust gases of aero-engines {{has the potential to be}} both an efficient and largely mission-independent method to enhance aircraft powertrain hybridisation. Combining an ORC with a downsized engine, fuel consumption can be reduced, provided the weight required for hybridisation does not increase that of the overall aircraft. This paper explores the achievable efficiency, net power and weight of the ORC using a single-pass plate heat exchanger. With R 123 a as the working fluid, a cycle exergy efficiency of 15. 91 % and net power of 14. 1 kW could be achieved with a Continental IO- 240 -B piston engine, which represents 15. 1 % of the <b>engine’s</b> <b>rated</b> <b>power.</b> The effects of the ORC’s weight and effect on the engine back-pressure are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} mathematical {{relationships that}} allow us to forecast the estimated main <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of new container ships, based on data concerning vessels built in 2005 - 2015. The presented approximations allow us to estimate the <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> based on the length between perpendiculars and the number of containers the ship will carry. The approximations were developed using simple linear regression and multivariate linear regression analysis. The presented relations have practical application for estimation of container ship <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> needed in preliminary parametric design of the ship. It follows from the above that the use of multiple linear regression to predict the main <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of a container ship brings more accurate solutions than simple linear regression...|$|R
