(2) Structural properties of driver 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>seat</b> appeared distinctly; that is, vibro-acceleration of horizontal direction at the elbow had a tendency to become remarkably high and at the back that of forward and rear direction showed a similar tendency.

(5) When tractor ran getting over obstacles, vibro-acceleration increased remarkably. Next I am going to measure vibro-acceleration which may occur in real working.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} current finding on {{truck driver}} average exposure to acceleration for several different manufacturer 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s cab-over trucks {{on a variety}} of roads in different countries. The predominant time, for this aspect of the study has been spent in the area around London, England and Warsaw, Poland. The ECE directive 2002 / 44 /EC has provided specific guidelines for vehicle operators 8 hour average acceleration exposure. The primary considerations have been on truck design including the air-ride driver 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>seat.</b> The truck manufacturers have produced truck cabs that have some separate suspension from the truck frame. The truck seat manufacturers have been producing air-ride suspension seats for the cab. Both of these designs have had the objective of meeting the ECE directive and providing the vehicle drivers with some degrees of comfort. This paper will provide some information on the ability of the vehicles to operate {{on a variety of}} roads and meet the objectives. Method The primary method for evaluation of the driver 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exposure has been the use of a seat pad attached to the driver 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>seat.</b> Although this sensor system provides the critical information for the driver, an understanding {{of the reasons for the}} values requires additional measurements. The initial study in England used both driver and passenger seat pads, as shown in Figure 1, as well as triaxial accelerometers mounted on the base of the seat. The latest studies used significantly more transducers to better understand the relative rotations and translations on the truck frame, the cab, and the driver. [...|$|R
