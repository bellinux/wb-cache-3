50|$|Bearings with {{a flange}} {{on the outer}} ring simplify axial location. The housing for such {{bearings}} can consist of a through-hole of uniform diameter, but the entry face of the housing (which may be either the outer or inner face) must be machined truly normal to the hole axis. However such flanges are very expensive to manufacture.A more cost effective arrangement of the bearing outer ring, with similar benefits, is a snap <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> at either or {{both ends of the}} outside diameter.

50|$|Now, if one {{positions}} {{the snap}} ring with its flat side {{such that it}} is pushed into the rounded edge of the snap <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> when load or force is applied, the flat and square edge of the snap ring will “bite” into the rounded edge of the retaining groove and as more force is applied the snap ring will distort as it rides up the rounded edge. This distortion will spread an external snap ring or compress an internal snap ring, leaving it prone to possibly being forced from the groove and releasing the part {{it is designed to}} hold.See the accompanying pictures as to how this works and how to properly orient the snap ring in the groove.|$|E

The effect of roughness on seal performance was analyzed based on calculation of three dimensional flow field. The analysis results show that the surface roughness of rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area has great influence on the seal performance, but the influence is little when roughness on non-grooved rotor ring surface and static ring surface. The influence must be considered when surface roughness of rotor <b>ring</b> <b>grooved</b> area bigger than 0. 2 µm. Roughness of rotor ring surface can increase the loading force while it also can cause the increase of leakage. It is important to select rational roughness when designing gas face seal...|$|R

40|$|Failures in {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion}} engines operating with landfill gas are not uncommon. In general, damage {{is located in}} the combustion chamber surfaces and in the <b>ring</b> <b>grooves,</b> where a layer of non-volatile combustion products is deposited. These deposits attached to the surfaces reduce heat transfer and increase inner temperature, which produces a knocking phenomena damaging the crank bearings and fusing of the piston head material. Lubrication problems also appear due to the formation of a layer of soft paste silicone deposits in the <b>rings</b> <b>grooves,</b> which increases friction losses and accelerates wear on cylinder and rings. In this paper, some typical examples of damaged engines are presented. The deposits found were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–-EDX). Additionally, the engine oil used was also analysed by Infra-Red Spectrometry (IR) and the results were compared with known organo-compounds. A method to detect incipient failure caused by organo-compounds contained in landfill gas is introduced.

40|$|Engine friction, wear, and oil {{consumption}} {{are some of}} the primary interests for the automotive industry. However, there is currently a lack of understanding of the fundamentals involving oil transport inside the power cylinder. Therefore, improving one area of engine performance, such as friction, may lead to decreased performance in another area, such as {{oil consumption}}. This work seeks to address some fundamental aspects of oil transport in the power cylinder through experiments and modeling. A two-dimensional multiple-dye Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) visualization system was implemented in a spark-ignition engine. Real time images of oil distribution were acquired and analyzed for a multitude of operating conditions typically encountered by passenger car engines. Based on experimental observations, major oil flow patterns in the piston ring pack during transient operation were identified and characterized. Physically based models were used to describe and understand the fundamentals of the individual oil transport process. The work shows oil may enter the top <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> under low load (high vacuum) conditions. After enough time at low load, the oil may interfere with the gas flow into the top <b>ring</b> <b>groove.</b> Thereafter, upon a transition to a higher engine load, the top ring may radially collapse, resulting in an extremely large increase of blow-by gases. Additional work was conducted studying oil transport from the piston to the cylinder liner during steady state conditions. The results show that oil transport to the cylinder liner {{may be one of the}} main contributors to oil consumption. Also, analysis of oil transport on the piston skirt was conducted and an overview of the general transport pattern was developed. (cont.) This work was the first comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms of oil transport in the piston ring pack of internal combustion engines during transient operation. Additionally, the understanding of oil transport to the cylinder liner during steady state operation was enhanced.
