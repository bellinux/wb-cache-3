40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> during acute {{infection}} with Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) on the chronic phase of ensuing Chagas` disease {{was the focus}} of this investigation. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate in Wistar rats the influence of <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> during the acute phase of infection (7 days) with the Y strain of T. cruzi on the chronic phase of the infection (at 180 days). Exposure to ether vapor for 1 min twice a day was used as a stressor. <b>Repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> enhanced the number of circulating parasites and cardiac tissue disorganization, from a moderate to a severe diffuse mononuclear inflammatory process and the presence of amastigote burden in the cardiac fibers. Immunological parameters revealed that <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> triggered a reduced concanavalin A induced splenocyte proliferation in vitro with major effects on the late chronic phase. Serum interleukin- 12 concentration decreased in both stressed and infected rats in the early phase of infection although it was higher on 180 days post-infection. These results suggest that <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> can markedly impair the host`s immune system and enhance the pathological process during the chronic phase of Chagas` disease.

40|$|AbstractV 79 Chinese Hamster lung {{fibroblasts}} {{were subjected}} to <b>repetitive</b> low-grade <b>stress</b> through multiple exposures to 30 μM H 2 O 2 in culture for 4 weeks. Akt/protein kinase B became phosphorylated at serine 473 and threonine 308 {{during this period of}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress.</b> Concurrent exposure of the cells to LY 294002 (5 μM), a phosphoinositide- 3 kinase inhibitor or 4. 5 μM epigallocatechin 3 -gallate (EGCG), a tea polyphenol almost completely blocked Akt activation by <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress.</b> Phosphorylation of I kappa B kinase (IKK) and transcriptional activity driven by nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) were significantly enhanced by <b>repetitive</b> oxidative <b>stress.</b> These increases were largely abolished by simultaneous exposure to EGCG. The repetitively stressed cells demonstrated a significant resistance to apoptosis by subsequent acute stress in the form of ultraviolet radiation at 5 J/m 2 or H 2 O 2 (7. 5 mM). The resistance to apoptosis conferred by <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> was drastically reduced (> 80 %) by constant exposure to EGCG during the stress period while the presence of LY 294002 or the NFκB inhibitor SN 50 brought about a relatively moderate effect (about 50 – 65 %). Our data indicate that activation of Akt and NFκB pro-survival pathways by <b>repetitive</b> low-grade <b>stress</b> results in a strong inhibition of the normal apoptotic response after subsequent acute stress. The tea polyphenol EGCG impedes the activation of both Akt and NFκB by <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> and as a result preserves the normal apoptotic response during subsequent acute stress...|$|R

5000|$|A {{slow and}} chronic {{deterioration}} of the ulnar collateral ligament can be due to <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> acting on the ulna. At first, pain can be bearable and can worsen to an extent where it can terminate an athlete’s career. The <b>repetitive</b> <b>stress</b> placed on the ulna causes micro tears in the ligament resulting {{in the loss of}} structural integrity over time. [...] The acute rupture is less common compared to the slow deterioration injury. The acute rupture occurs in collisions when the elbow is in flexion such as that in a wrestling match or a tackle in football. The ulnar collateral ligament distributes over fifty percent of the medial support of the elbow. [...] This can result in an ulnar collateral ligament injury or a dislocated elbow causing severe damage to the elbow and the radioulnar joints.|$|R
