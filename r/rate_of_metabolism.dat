25|$|The human {{organism}} physically restores itself during sleep, healing {{itself and}} removing waste which builds up {{during periods of}} activity. This restoration takes place mostly during slow-wave sleep, during which body temperature, heart rate, and brain oxygen consumption decrease. The brain, especially, requires sleep for restoration, whereas {{in the rest of}} the body these processes can take place during quiescent waking. In both cases, the reduced <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> enables countervailing restorative processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in the structural backbone of tenatoprazole compared to benzimidazole PPIs, is its imidazopyridine moiety, which reduces the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism,</b> allowing a longer plasma residence time but also decreases the pKa of the fused imidazole N {{as compared to the}} current PPIs.

40|$|Palaeontologically {{recognizable}} eutherians originated {{no later}} than the Early Cretaceous in warm, probably moderately seasonal climates. Immediate ancestors were small, sharing many anatomical, physiological and reproductive features with small modern marsupials.

40|$|Introduction: Differences in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> {{nicotine}} <b>metabolism</b> between genders {{and different}} races have been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} disparities in smoking rate, susceptibility to addiction, and ability to quit smoking. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of race and gender on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nicotine <b>metabolism</b> as indicated by the nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) in adolescent smokers. Methods: One hundred and fifty-nine adolescent smokers aged 13 - 17 were given 2 mg of deuterium-labeled cotinine (cotinine-d 4). The NMR was calculated as the ratio of concentrations of deuterium-labeled 3 ′-hydroxycotinine (ng/ml) to cotinine- d 4 (ng/ml) in saliva and is a validated biomarker <b>of</b> the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nicotine <b>metabolism.</b> Results: The sample was 67. 3 % female and racially mixed. On average, Whites had the fastest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> compared with both Blacks/African Americans (p <. 01) and Asians (p =. 01). The NMR was similar between males and females (p =. 70). Among the 19 girls who reported using estrogen-containing contraceptives, there was no significant difference in NMR compared with the 83 girls who did not use contraceptives (p =. 24) or the 10 who used progestin-only contraceptives (p =. 45). Conclusions: Among adolescent smokers, racial variations in <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> nicotine <b>metabolism</b> were similar to those that have been reported in adult smokers. In contrast to findings in adult smokers, the NMR did not vary significantly by gender or selfreported hormone use. © The Author 2012.

40|$|In general, {{tropical}} {{birds have}} a "slow pace <b>of</b> life," lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> whole-animal <b>metabolism</b> and higher survival rates, than temperate species. A fundamental challenge facing physiological ecologists is {{the understanding of}} how variation in life-history at the whole-organism level might be linked to cellular function. Because tropical birds have lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> whole-animal <b>metabolism,</b> we hypothesized that cells from tropical species would also have lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> cellular <b>metabolism</b> than cells from temperate species of similar body size and common phylogenetic history. We cultured primary dermal fibroblasts from 17 tropical and 17 temperate phylogenetically-paired species of birds in a common nutritive and thermal environment and then examined basal, uncoupled, and non-mitochondrial cellular O 2 consumption (OCR), proton leak, and anaerobic glycolysis (extracellular acidification rates [ECAR]), using an XF 24 Seahorse Analyzer. We found that multiple measures <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> in cells from tropical birds were significantly lower than their temperate counterparts. Basal and uncoupled cellular metabolism were 29 % and 35 % lower in cells from tropical birds, respectively, a decrease closely aligned with differences in whole-animal metabolism between tropical and temperate birds. Proton leak was significantly lower in cells from tropical birds compared with cells from temperate birds. Our results offer compelling evidence that whole-animal metabolism is linked to cellular respiration {{as a function of}} an animal's life-history evolution. These findings are consistent with the idea that natural selection has uniquely fashioned cells of long-lived tropical bird species to have lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> than cells from shorter-lived temperate species...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{expenditure}} of endotherms {{is influenced by}} body size, climate, and food habits. Body size {{is the most important}} factor determining basal <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> and thermal conductances. The interaction of these two parameters produces a tem-perature differential between an endotherm and its environment at the lower limit of thermoneutrality that normally increases with body weight. Greater basal <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>metabolism</b> than expected from weight are found in temperate and arctic species; low basal rates are found in desert species. Low basal rates are also found in species that have a periodic food supply, in species that harvest food in an indescriminate manner, or in species that use food of low available energy content. Geographic limitations in the distribution of endotherms and the use of such evasionary tactics as torpor or migration may also be responses to a limited energy availability. Thermal conductances are low in temperate and arctic species, but high in tropical endotherms. Thus, the temperature differentials maintained by endotherms tend to vary with both climate and food habits. The weight-independent variations in metabolism and conductance permit an endother...|$|R
