They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to <b>rescale</b> the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E

25|$|A serious {{difficulty}} arises if the variables are not {{measured in the}} same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the curve – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then {{it is clear that}} we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, and so this leads to meaningless results. Secondly, if we <b>rescale</b> one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|E

I speak from {{personal}} knowledge. One spring morning, before the schoolhouse was built, I was assisting the patriarch to divest the gaunt garden pump of its winter suit of straw. I was taking a drink, I remember, my palm over the mouth of the wooden spout and my mouth at the gimlet hole above, when a leg appeared above the corner of the wall against which the henhouse was built. Two hands followed, clutching desperately at the uneven stones. Then the leg worked as if it were turning a grind-stone, and next moment Snecky was sitting breathlessly on the dyke. From this to the henhouse, whose roof was of [...] "divets," [...] the descent was comparatively easy, and a slanting board allowed the daring bellman to slide thence to the ground. He had come on business, and having talked it over slowly with the old man he turned to depart.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the digital}} cinema {{postproduction}} chain, image <b>rescaling</b> {{serves as a}} core function. The quality of <b>rescaling</b> is critical to maintaining the visual impact of a digital film at play-out. In the EU funded project IP-RACINE, it is required to address color distortion, artifacts and image blur in fractional <b>rescaling</b> within 1 pixel for a typical image of resolution 2 K. To this end, we proposed a hybrid warping framework for fractional image <b>rescaling</b> that not only unifies the two dominant image <b>rescaling</b> methods, namely discrete mapping and interpolation, but also offers greater flexibility in preserve properties of image contents. Within this framework we have devised a novel <b>rescaling</b> method based on constrained seam carving. Compared with unconstrained seam carving[1], the new method can preserve global geometry of image contents and confine nonlinear distortion to be within ± 1 pixel; compared with nearest neighbour mapping, it generates less visible artifacts; compared with interpolation methods, it can maintain color fidelity and sharpness in the original image...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rescaling</b> is {{possibly}} the most popular approach to cost-sensitive learning. This ap-proach works by <b>rescaling</b> the classes according to their costs, {{and it can be}} realized in different ways, e. g., weighting or sampling the training examples in proportion to their costs, moving the decision boundary of classifiers faraway from high-cost classes in pro-portion to costs, etc. This approach is very effective in dealing with two-class problems, yet some studies showed that it is often not so helpful on multi-class problems. In this paper, we try to explore why the <b>rescaling</b> approach is often helpless on multi-class prob-lems. Our analysis discloses that the <b>rescaling</b> approach works well when the costs are consistent, while directly applying it to multi-class problems with inconsistent costs may not be a good choice. Based on this recognition, we advocate that before applying the <b>rescaling</b> approach, the consistency of the costs should be examined at first. If the costs are consistent, the <b>rescaling</b> approach can be conducted directly; otherwise it is better to apply <b>rescaling</b> after decomposing the multi-class problem into a series of two-class problems. An empirical study involving twenty multi-class data sets and seven types of cost-sensitive learners validates the effectiveness of our proposal. Moreover, we show that the proposal is also helpful to class-imbalance learning...|$|R
