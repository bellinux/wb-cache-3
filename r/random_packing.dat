50|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, strippers can be trayed or packed. Packed columns, {{and particularly}} when <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> is used, are usually favored for smaller columns with a diameter less than 2 feet and a packed height of {{not more than}} 20 feet. Packed columns can also be advantageous for corrosive fluids, high foaming fluids, when fluid velocity is high, and when particularly low pressure drop is desired. Trayed strippers are advantageous because of ease of design and scale up. Structured packing can be used similar to trays despite possibly being the same material as dumped (<b>random)</b> <b>packing.</b> Using structured packing is a common method to increase the capacity for separation or to replace damaged trays.|$|E

These channels are chosen and measured as the mesg (Maximum Experimental Safe Gap) of the gas for a particular installation.These passages can be regular, like crimped metal ribbon or wire mesh or a sheet metal plate with punched holes, or irregular, {{such as those in}} <b>random</b> <b>packing.</b>|$|E

Here we show that trying to obtain a compact semi-empirical {{equation of}} state simultaneously compatible with that asymptotic behaviour and with the known virial coefficients raises an analytical difficulty which can be solved if a glassy transition occurs in the disordered metastable phase at a density intermediate between the freezing point and the <b>random</b> close <b>packing</b> limit.

50|$|The {{structure}} of liquids, glasses and other non-crystalline solids {{is characterized by}} the absence of long-range order which defines crystalline materials. Liquids and amorphous solids do, however, possess a rich and varied array of short to medium range order, which originates from chemical bonding and related interactions. Metallic glasses, for example, are typically well described by the dense <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> of hard spheres, whereas covalent systems, such as silicate glasses, have sparsely packed, strongly bound, tetrahedral network structures. These very different structures result in materials with very different physical properties and applications.|$|E
50|$|Trayed {{strippers}} {{can have}} sieve, valve, or bubble cap trays while packed strippers can have either structured packing or <b>random</b> <b>packing.</b> Trays and packing {{are used to}} increase the contact area over which mass transfer can occur as mass transfer theory dictates. Packing can have varying material, surface area, flow area, and associated pressure drop. Older generation packing include ceramic Raschig rings and Berl saddles. More common packing materials are metal and plastic Pall rings, metal and plastic Zbigniew Białecki rings, and ceramic Intalox saddles. Each packing material of this newer generation improves the surface area, the flow area, and/or the associated pressure drop across the packing. Also important, {{is the ability of}} the packing material to not stack on top of itself. If such stacking occurs, it drastically reduces the surface area of the material. Lattice design work has been increasing of late that will further improve these characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|A regular {{tetrahedron}} is the densest configuration for {{the packing}} of four equal spheres. The dense <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> of hard spheres problem {{can thus be}} mapped on the tetrahedral packing problem. It is a practical exercise to try to pack table tennis balls in order to form only tetrahedral configurations. One starts with four balls arranged as a perfect tetrahedron, and try to add new spheres, while forming new tetrahedra. The next solution, with five balls, is trivially two tetrahedra sharing a common face; note that already with this solution, the fcc structure, which contains individual tetrahedral holes, does not show such a configuration (the tetrahedra share edges, not faces). With six balls, three regular tetrahedra are built, and the cluster is incompatible with all compact crystalline structures (fcc and hcp). Adding a seventh sphere gives a new cluster consisting in two [...] "axial" [...] balls touching each other and five others touching the latter two balls, the outer shape being an almost regular pentagonal bi-pyramid. However, we are facing now a real packing problem, analogous to the one encountered above with the pentagonal tiling in two dimensions. The dihedral angle of a tetrahedron is not commensurable with 2; consequently, a hole remains between two faces of neighboring tetrahedra. As a consequence, a perfect tiling of the Euclidean space R3 is impossible with regular tetrahedra. The frustration has a topological character: {{it is impossible to}} fill Euclidean space with tetrahedra, even severely distorted, if we impose that a constant number of tetrahedra (here five) share a common edge.|$|E

50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with <b>random</b> dumped <b>packing</b> (creating a <b>random</b> <b>packed</b> column) or with {{structured}} packing sections, which are arranged or stacked (creating a stacked packed column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Packing material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. Packing offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), which is beneficial while operating under vacuum. Differently shaped packing materials have different surface areas and void space between the packing. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRandom {{packing of}} {{particles}} in cement-based materials {{plays an important}} role in microstructural evolution. The preponderance of preview work has focused on the microstructural model by the <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> of spherical or two-dimensional elliptical particles, and little is known about three-dimensional ellipsoidal particles. In the present work, a new <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> model of three-dimensional ellipsoidal particles was developed to simulate microstructure of cement-based materials. It was based on a novel numerical algorithm for detecting the contact of ellipsoidal particles. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithm were verified by a visualization of the <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> of monodispersed ellipsoidal particles with rigid boundary conditions. According to these numerical algorithms, microstructural model of cement-based materials was constructed by the <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> of polydispersed ellipsoidal particles, of which sizes satisfy a specific distribution. Finally, applied stereological tools and serial sectioning analysis technique, microstructure of cement pastes, composed of ellipsoidal cement particles, was characterized and compared with that of spherical cement particles...|$|E

This model includes material, enthalpy, and momentum balances as well as continuity equations. The model was solved within the parameter space applied for experimental studies under assumption of a bubbly flow. The method of orthogonal collocation on finite elements was applied. For isothermal and polytropic processes and steady state conditions, axial profiles for concentration, temperature, fluid velocities, pressure, and liquid holdup were computed and the conversions for various gas and liquid flow rates were validated with experimental results. The obtained results were also compared in terms of space time yield and catalytic activity with experimental results and stirred tank and also with <b>random</b> <b>packed</b> bed reactor.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} {{statistical}} {{model for the}} <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> of frictionless polydisperse spheres in which {{the complexity of the}} global packing is distilled into a local stochastic process. We simplify the problem by considering the "granocentric" {{point of view of a}} single particle in the bulk, thereby reducing <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> to the assembly of nearest neighbours, followed by a random choice of contacts among them. The model is based on only two parameters, the available solid angle around each particle and the ratio of contacts to neighbors, which are both directly obtainable from experiments or simulations. As a result, the model analytically predicts the microscopic distributions of nearest neighbours and contacts, the local density fluctuations as well as the global density of the packing. We find that this granocentric view captures the essential properties of the polydisperse emulsion packing. This model suggests a general principle of organization for <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> and provides a statistical tool for quantifying the effect of the particle size distribution on the geometry of <b>random</b> <b>packing</b> in a variety of contexts of industrial relevance...|$|E

40|$|The mesh {{generation}} {{is a crucial}} step for Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations and incorrect numerical descriptions of the geometry may strongly affect the reliability and {{the accuracy of the}} results. This is especially true in handling the contact points in <b>random</b> <b>packed</b> bed of spheres. In this respect, we provide a systematic investigation of the treatment of the contact points for reactive CFD simulations of gas-solid packed beds of spheres. In particular, building on previous literature results on radial heat transfer and pressure drop simulations, we extend and assess the bridge method to reaction at surfaces. At this scope, we first analyze a regular bed of spheres in laminar conditions (Re~ 80). This regular packed bed and the laminar flow regime allow for a direct and feasible meshing of the contact points, thus giving the possibility to perform explicit comparisons between meshes with and without bridges. In doing so, we identify guidelines that are then extended and tested to the meshing of a <b>random</b> <b>packed</b> bed reactor. In this way, we identify a meshing protocol, which can be adopted to properly describe surface reactivity in packed bed reactors along with a concomitant sound description of pressure drops and heat transfer...|$|R
