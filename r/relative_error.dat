25|$|In {{more complex}} compounds, there is {{additional}} error since electronegativity {{depends on the}} molecular environment of an atom. Also, the energy estimate can be only used for single, not for multiple bonds.

2500|$|Even the [...] "exact" [...] FFT {{algorithms}} have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, {{but these}} errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley–Tukey, have excellent numerical properties {{as a consequence}} of the pairwise summation structure of the algorithms. [...] The upper bound on the <b>relative</b> <b>error</b> for the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is O(ε log N), compared to O(εN3/2) for the naïve DFT formula, where ε is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the root mean square (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(ε √log N) for Cooley–Tukey and O(ε √N) for the naïve DFT (Schatzman, 1996). These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the trigonometric function values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate trigonometric recurrence formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley–Tukey, such as the Rader–Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.|$|E
2500|$|Distillation {{is one of}} {{the primary}} tools that chemists and {{chemical}} engineers use to separate mixtures into their constituents. Because distillation cannot separate the constituents of an azeotrope, the separation of azeotropic mixtures (also called azeotrope breaking) is a topic of considerable interest. Indeed, this difficulty led some early investigators to believe that azeotropes were actually compounds of their constituents. But there are two reasons for believing {{that this is not the}} case. One is that the molar ratio of the constituents of an azeotrope is not generally the ratio of small integers. For example, the azeotrope formed by water and acetonitrile contains 2.253 moles ( [...] or 9/4 with a <b>relative</b> <b>error</b> of just 2% [...] ) of acetonitrile for each mole of water. A more compelling reason for believing that azeotropes are not compounds is, as discussed in the last section, that the composition of an azeotrope can be affected by pressure. Contrast that with a true compound, carbon dioxide for example, which is two moles of oxygen for each mole of carbon no matter what pressure the gas is observed at. That azeotropic composition can be affected by pressure suggests a means by which such a mixture can be separated.|$|E
