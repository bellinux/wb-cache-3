But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> something very special.|$|E
5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed the country as a backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

60|$|With these words, and {{resisting}} our entreaties {{that she}} would grace the remaining circulation of the punch with her presence, Mrs. Micawber retired to my bedroom. And <b>really</b> I <b>felt</b> {{that she was a}} noble woman--the sort of woman who might have been a Roman matron, and done all manner of heroic things, in times of public trouble.|$|R

25|$|Collectively, {{these attacks}} served to spread fear {{throughout}} the region, especially in northeastern Illinois {{around the area}} of the Indian Creek massacre where a wave of terror gripped the region. Into the lead mining region around Galena, Illinois anxiety spread as attacks occurred and news of the movements of the elusive Black Hawk poured in. After the death of Adam Payne no white settlers in the area <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> safe.|$|E
25|$|Henry and Emma {{return to}} Regina's cave. Emma asks {{to speak with}} Regina alone, and tells {{her that if she}} tells Robin the truth about how she feels, {{everything}} will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself never got the chance to tell Hook how she <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> before it was too late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work up the nerve to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green. Robin tells Regina that she won't have to die alone.|$|E

Only Bastin remained covered.|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} and mixed by David B. Livingstone, {{who at the}} time was the guitarist for God Bullies, and producer Tim Mac. Originally, the record had been mixed to videotape but the result was of poor quality, forcing Mac and Livingstone to remix the entire album from scratch within the relatively short time span of 4 hours. Regarding the album's current mix, Livingstone has said, [...] "I always felt that they got <b>really</b> screwed. I <b>felt</b> <b>really</b> bad." [...] and that he intends to eventually remix the entire album from the original masters.|$|R

500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many things that we can create, and work with, and expand on. So, I never <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that we were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|E

Brown and Damiani formed the [...] "new-wave influenced" [...] Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.|$|E

500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented {{that she thought}} the song was not good at all, and that {{at least she was}} against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it really came in to its own when we toured it, and it <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> lovely on stage".|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} the album's theme, Ciara said it was universal, stating, [...] "It's about everybody. You'll have songs with {{different}} emotions, happy, sad, 'my heart is broken.' What everybody goes through." [...] On her success with the preluding title track, Ciara said, [...] "I'm very content right now. I take everything a day at a time. Every time I hear good news, I'm shouting out, 'Praise God.' Everybody around me is so excited, I still haven't got it. I haven't <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> it like they're feeling it for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{presented}} as a [...] "polished commercial group" [...] in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US {{did not make a}} good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as [...] "a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run." [...] They were also criticised for being too American and the [...] "poor man's Vanilla Fudge". As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, [...] "they were so out of place that you <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for them." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Really</b> Amy <b>felt</b> as if {{it would}} have been less dreadful to have been locked up in her room, or sitting sewing with Jessie in the workroom, than sitting up in the parlour with the rest, and hearing her father show his pride in her, making her fetch her prize for the {{religious}} examination, and talking of her almost {{as if he wanted to}} compare her with Aunt Amy's missionary son.|$|R

The match {{took place at}} their substitute stadium Upton Park in November 1992 and Primus was awarded man of the match for his performance. Primus played the next two matches against Leicester City and Brentford but was disappointed with his performances.

He {{felt that he had}} to leave the club: [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> as though I wasn't wanted and that my days were numbered." ...|$|E
500|$|Alaphilippe's second-place finish was {{the best}} for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was {{struggling}} on the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this {{was similar to the}} events in La Flèche Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; he said after the race [...] "today I <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> I could have done something more".

500|$|Black Beauty was {{originally}} released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side-long tracks spread across a double album, grouping the songs as medleys titled [...] "Black Beauty Part I", [...] "Black Beauty Part II", and so on, {{all of which}} credited Davis as the composer. He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles <b>really</b> <b>felt</b> that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and talking for hours about something that really just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson—Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes.|$|E
