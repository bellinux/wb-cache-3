5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), {{a fledgling}} author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires {{to the bathroom to}} discard a spent cigarette.

500|$|Zack's role in Crisis Core has {{received}} a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it [...] "the heart of the game." [...] Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a [...] "likable and complex hero," [...] arguing that he [...] "transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues." [...] GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as [...] "King of the Nice Guys," [...] noting that even though {{he can be a}} [...] "pretty hate-worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline," [...] players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an [...] "endearing main character" [...] by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the [...] "full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero" [...] due to his personal conflicts, despite his [...] "artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin." [...] Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that [...] "this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until he <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> [...] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks." [...] He also praised Zack's English voice actor for doing a good job, noting [...] "his character's maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline." [...] IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as [...] "pretty likeable." [...] GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the [...] "ultimate payoff" [...] of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song [...] "Why" [...] for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate [...] "to the hearts of many people." [...] IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{you could}} have knocked me down with a feather!" [...] she resumed. [...] "He {{telephones}} me awhile ago and says to be outside the back door at ten to-night, because he'd something {{he wanted to tell}} me.

'Say, I got something to be fresh about!' he says to me. And then he <b>reaches</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> jeans and hauls out the sparkler. 'What's that?' I says to him.

And the next thing I know he's got it on my finger and--" [...] Celestine broke off modestly. [...] "Say, ain't it a beaut, honest!" [...] She gave herself over to contemplation once more. [...] "He says to me how he's on Easy Street now, or will be pretty soon. I says to him 'Have you got a job, then?' He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.' Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters. I asks him what the stunt is, but he won't tell me yet. He says he'll tell me after we're married, but he says it's sure-fire and he's going to buy the license tomorrow." ...|$|E
