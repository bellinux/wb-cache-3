5|$|Following the 2012 Supreme Court ruling {{upholding}} ACA as constitutional, Republicans held another vote to <b>repeal</b> {{the law on}} July 11; the House of Representatives {{voted with}} all 244 Republicans and 5 Democrats in favor of <b>repeal,</b> which marked the 33rd, partial or whole, <b>repeal</b> attempt. On February 3, 2015, the House of Representatives added its 67th <b>repeal</b> vote to the record (239 to 186). This attempt also failed.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} <b>repeal</b> {{of the tobacco}} tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the <b>repeal</b> into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The <b>repeal</b> resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the <b>repeal</b> passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax <b>repeal</b> and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{was also}} viewed {{as one of}} the crucial swing votes on a measure to <b>repeal</b> the death penalty in Colorado and use the {{resulting}} savings to fund a statewide cold case unit.

5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings {{supported the}} <b>repeal</b> of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted {{the rights of}} Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England.

5|$|Once Birmingham Dissenters {{started to}} agitate for the <b>repeal</b> of the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted}} Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley {{were at the}} forefront of the <b>repeal</b> campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed for the sole purpose of overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, the <b>repeal</b> efforts failed in 1787, 1789, and 1790. Priestley's support of the <b>repeal</b> and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group of activists came together not only to oppose the interests of the Dissenters but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the <b>repeal</b> by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the <b>repeal</b> of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for <b>repeal,</b> convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for <b>repeal.</b> Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time the <b>repeal</b> seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E

The CBO also forecasted that <b>repeal</b> of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2015, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.|$|E
5|$|The Stamp Act was {{scheduled}} {{to go into effect}} on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign. Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to <b>repeal</b> the tax. By May 16, 1766, news of the <b>repeal</b> had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.|$|E
5|$|Tsongas is an {{advocate}} for universal health care and supports a public health insurance option. In 2010 she voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. In 2012 Tsongas joined a Republican-led effort to <b>repeal</b> a 2.3% sales tax on medical-device manufacturers, which passed the House 270–146; 36 other Democrats voted for it. Tsongas is pro-choice and received a 100% approval rating from Planned Parenthood in 2008. A supporter of LGBT rights, Tsongas cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act to <b>repeal</b> the Defense of Marriage Act; and voted for the Don't Ask, Don't Tell <b>Repeal</b> Act of 2010, which allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces.|$|E

5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after the recession began forced through <b>repeal</b> of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its <b>repeal</b> outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to <b>repeal</b> this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would <b>repeal</b> any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
