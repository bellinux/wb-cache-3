5|$|After the English cricket team's tour of Australia in 1932–33, {{known for}} the Bodyline bowling tactics used by the English team, {{relations}} between the Australian Board of Control and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were strained. In the English winter of 1935–36, the MCC sent a team to tour Australia and New Zealand, {{in an attempt to}} regain some good will in Australia. Holmes captained the side, which was predominantly composed of younger players the MCC wanted to gain experience. Mitchell-Innes was included in the touring party, and played in ten first-class matches, including two of the four contests against the New Zealand national cricket team. He scored four first-class half-centuries, achieving his highest score of the tour against Otago, when he contributed 87 <b>runs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MCC's total of 550.|$|E

5|$|Following this, {{the road}} becomes East 4th Street and heads north-{{northwest}} across the Christina River on a drawbridge. US 13/DE 9 curves northwest and passes under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line, {{at which point}} northbound US 13 splits from the road by turning northeast on North Church Street at the crossing of a railroad spur. A block later, the concurrency between DE 9 and southbound US 13 ends {{at the point where}} southbound US 13 joins the road from North Spruce Street. DE 9 continues northwest through residential and commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, entering downtown Wilmington. Here, it intersects US 13 Bus., which is routed on the one-way pair of North Walnut Street northbound and North King Street southbound.

5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly millstone grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock <b>runs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Ainsworth, in his 1842 novel Guy Fawkes, {{wrote about}} the local story that the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was planned by Guy Fawkes and Robert Catesby in Ordsall Hall's Star Chamber. Guy Fawkes is {{supposed}} to have escaped capture by the king's soldiers by way of an underground tunnel from Ordsall Hall to an inn at the cathedral end of Hanging Bridge, at the northern end of present-day Deansgate. There is no firm supporting evidence, but the Radclyffes were prominent Roman Catholics and were acquainted with the Catesby family. The legend is remembered {{in the name of the}} modern road that <b>runs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the hall, Guy Fawkes Street.|$|E

5|$|Nicol {{arrived in}} Chicago on July 20 and was penciled in {{to start on}} {{consecutive}} days against Charles Radbourn and Cy Young. Though he performed poorly in both games, the Colts still managed to win. He was shelled {{in the third inning}} by the Cincinnati Reds and on the next day, he gave up seven <b>runs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Spiders in only two innings. Because of these starts, he did not appear in another game until August 14, when he was used in relief to face the Brooklyn Dodgers. His control issues flared up and he had trouble holding the Dodgers' baserunners. He was released one week later, having walked 10 batters in the 11 innings he pitched for the Colts.

5|$|On 7 April 1967, the {{grandstand}} caught {{fire and the}} entire structure burned down beyond repair. The buildings and stands were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration proposed that the Fetveien road, which <b>runs</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the stadium, should be moved to run through the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
