Whilst it can <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> shortcomings in the recording mix {{as well as the}} monitoring chain, it may lead to listener fatigue with prolonged use in the domestic setting.|$|E
5|$|The pottery {{found at}} the site were in {{an early stage of}} hand crafting, of the coarse variety, in steel-grey, dull red, brown, and buff colours with mat prints at the bottom; they were in the shape of bowl, vase and stem. The antiquities did not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> signs of burials sites.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, would be {{difficult}} to detect due to the strong glare of the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E

5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> large violations.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. was {{developed}} and published by Atlus for the Virtual Boy, and was released on September 29, 1995 in Japan, and somewhere between late October and November 1995 in North America. According to Nintendo Power, Atlus did not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> details about the game's development, although {{it is known that}} it initially was planned to be titled Devil Busters. It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei series, and the first entry to be released outside Japan. Being a Virtual Boy title, it made use of the system's stereoscopic 3D to display conventional 2D graphics in monochrome red and black visuals, and a graphics technique called parallax scrolling, to create a 3D effect.|$|E
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> disturbances in electrolytes. A coagulation screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{completed}} the 2009–10 campaign {{with a new}} personal best in points {{for the third consecutive}} season with 75 points (25 goals and 50 assists). With the Sundin's retirement and Demitra being held out of the lineup with injuries, he was moved to his natural center position and joined by wingers Mikael Samuelsson and Mason Raymond. His 26 power play points ranked second on the team to Henrik Sedin. Playing on the second power play unit, he earned many of his points controlling the puck along the half-boards. He also averaged a career-high 19:37 minutes of ice time per game, which ranked second among team forwards to Henrik Sedin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Kesler notched a goal and nine assists in 12 games. After helping the Canucks eliminate the Los Angeles Kings in the first round, he played with a sore shoulder in the second round, as Vancouver were eliminated by the Blackhawks for the second consecutive year. An MRI did not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> serious injury. He admitted following the defeat to not having played his best during the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} assume different identities {{based on}} their strengthsYudhishtira as the advisor and dice player Kankubhattu, Bhima as the cook Valala, Nakula as horse groomsman Damagranthi, Sahadeva as cowherd Tantripala. Draupadi meets Virata's wife Sudeshna at a temple. She introduces herself as Sairandhri, an ill-fated woman married to five Gandharvas and requests {{for a job in}} her palace. Sudeshna agrees and promises that Sairandhri would never be used to perform unethical tasks and jobs. The Pandavas too join Virata's palace in these disguised forms and perform various duties. The Kauravas are in search of the Pandavas and their cousin Krishna learns about this. Arjuna's son Abhimanyu wishes to convey the same to the Pandavas and Krishna reluctantly agrees. Before sending him to Matsya, Krishna warns Abhimanyu not to reveal his real identity. Abhimanyu falls in love with Virata's daughter Uttaraa but does not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> details of his. Brihannala, who teaches dance to Uttaraa, learns this and is happy. Uttaraa's brother Uttara Kumara too wishes to see their alliance turn into a reality and waits for the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{new head}} of G-2, Major General Clayton L. Bissell, at the urging of Groves and Furman, decided to create a new, even larger Alsos Mission for western Europe in March 1944. Pash assumed command of the new unit upon its {{official}} creation by the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, on 4 April. The military staff for the new mission were selected by Bissell on Pash's advice. Lieutenant Colonel George R. Eckman became the deputy commander. Captain Henry A. Schade was appointed {{as the head of the}} naval contingent. Groves and Vannevar Bush, the head of OSRD, selected the scientific staff, and appointed Samuel Goudsmit, a University of Michigan physicist with a good command of several western European languages, as its head. Goudsmit had not been working on the Manhattan Project, and therefore could not <b>reveal</b> <b>any</b> of its secrets if captured. The British considered creating their own rival mission, but in the end agreed to participate as a junior partner. Three Dutch and one Norwegian officer also served with the Alsos Mission. By the end of August it had seven officers and 33 scientists.|$|E
