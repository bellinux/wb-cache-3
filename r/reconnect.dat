5|$|The plan to {{regenerate}} central Scotland's canals and <b>reconnect</b> Glasgow with Edinburgh {{was led by}} British Waterways with support and funding from seven local authorities, the Scottish Enterprise Network, the European Regional Development Fund, and the Millennium Commission. Planners decided early on to create a dramatic 21st-century landmark structure to <b>reconnect</b> the canals, instead of simply recreating the historic lock flight.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to <b>reconnect</b> the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to <b>reconnect</b> the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E

30|$|Boundary layer {{theory of}} forced {{magnetic}} reconnection {{due to an}} externally applied boundary perturbation is improved by introducing correct asymptotic matching which {{takes into account the}} effect of inertia in the inner layer precisely. The improved theory yields an integral equation for the time evolution of the <b>reconnected</b> flux. The initial evolution of the reconnection process is characterized by some significant features represented by the <b>reconnected</b> flux and an inner-layer <b>reconnected</b> flux. The typical time scales of the <b>reconnected</b> flux and of the inner-layer <b>reconnected</b> flux include the time scale of the boundary perturbation and exclude the Sweet-Parker time scale. The role of stability against the tearing modes in the reconnection process is also clarified. A current sheet induced on a resonant surface is in such a direction as to oppose the progress of the reconnection, because the equilibrium is stable against tearing modes {{in the absence of the}} boundary perturbation.|$|R

The focus of the conference was on the long-term consequences of prolonged unemployment, from national and international perspectives, but particularly in the United States. The keynote speech to the conference by economist Richard B.

It aims to ensure that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape scale conservation projects in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to <b>reconnect</b> with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) {{find out}} that Dave was {{planning}} on marrying Linda; however, as the two were an interracial couple, they gained an enemy in Eric Singleton (Alexander Cendese), who stole the engagement ring out of the couple’s car, but after they were dead. Megan later finds residue in Linda's eyes {{to suggest that the}} killer closed her eyes after she died, which leads them back to Linda's parents, who knew that Dave intended to propose. When they call the two into the office, Al admits he killed Dave and Linda. He had only wanted to scare them so they would not marry; however, the gun discharged, killing Linda, and in panic, he killed Dave too. After apologizing to Laura, Al is taken away. Throughout the day, Megan tries to <b>reconnect</b> with her daughter Lacey (Mary Mouser); however, her attempts to create a better relationship with her backfire.|$|E

Rakoto Frah soon came to their attention, and they offered him a full-length album of his own. Two of Rakoto Frah's granddaughters provided vocals for this album, which was entitled Rakoto Frah: Flute Master of Madagascar. From the mid-1980s onward, Rakoto Frah enjoyed a revival in popularity, particularly among the youth, {{many of whom were}} seeking to <b>reconnect</b> with the traditions of their elders. In addition to recording numerous tracks and albums of his own, the flutist often appeared as a guest artist on the albums of others.

5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and <b>reconnect</b> without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.|$|E
