40|$|The {{competitive}} dialogue procedure {{is a new}} public procurement award procedure first introduced by the Directive 2004118 for the tender of particularly complex contracts, when contracting authorities consider {{that the use of}} the open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> do not allow for the contract to be tendered. It is not intended to be adopted freely as the open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures,</b> but contracting authorities may use it only when the need arises and specific grounds for its use are fulfilled. The procedure was introduced with the stated objective of increasing the flexibility of procurement, which had been already identified as a shortcoming of previous existing EU procurement framework. This thesis studies how the {{competitive dialogue}} has been implemented in Portugal and Spain. It covers both the legal transposition and aspects of its practice in these countries., through the use of empirical research methods. Through his research, the author has found that the procedure was implemented very differently in Portugal and Spain with consequences on its use. This study has tried to highlight similarities and differences in the transposition, illustrate how the competitive dialogue is being used in Spain and explain why it is being used only sparingly in Portugal.

40|$|The European public {{procurement}} regulation {{has been described}} as a restrictive force on PPP projects, especially in countries which employ a strict interpretation of the directives. One major limitation brought forward has been the restrictions on negotiations during the procurement procedure. In the literature it has been suggested that the negotiation would improve PPP performance because it allows for a clarification of the contract and enables alignment of the parties’ goals. Two propositions are used to examine if the regulations are a hindrance to PPP performance by comparing the current doctrine and European case law on {{public procurement}} to those two propositions. The perspectives are the regulation of the different procedures available in the directives: competitive dialogue, the negotiated procedure, and the open and <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> and the possibility of early involvement before the formal procedure has begun. The conclusion is that, while the directives limit the procuring authorities’ abilities to exchange information and negotiate provisions, the information which need to be transferred, and negotiations which needs to be conducted, can in most cases be carried out within the current procurement framework. Thus, the public procurement legislation does not present any substantial limitations on PPP performance...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} power of {{measurements}} implementable with local quantum operations and classical communication (or LOCC measurements for short) {{in the setting of}} quantum channel discrimination. More precisely, we consider discrimination procedures that attempt to identify an unknown channel, chosen uniformly from two known alternatives, that take the following form: (i) the input to the unknown channel is prepared in a possibly entangled state with an ancillary system, (ii) the unknown channel is applied to the input system, and (iii) an LOCC measurement is performed on the output and ancillary systems, resulting in a guess for which of the two channels was given. The restriction of the measurement in such a procedure to be an LOCC measurement is of interest because it isolates the entanglement in the initial input/ancillary systems as a resource in the setting of channel discrimination. We prove that there exist channel discrimination problems for which <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> of this sort can be at either of the two extremes: they may be optimal within the set of all discrimination procedures (and simultaneously outperform all strategies that make no use of entanglement), or they may be no better than unentangled strategies (and simultaneously sub-optimal within the set of all discrimination procedures).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{the past}} {{bilateral}} neck exploration was {{the gold standard}} for successful surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism. More <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> have been introduced recently thanks to imaging techniques and intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay confirming eradication of hyperfunctioning tissue. METHODS: Thirty patients operated for parathyroid adenoma were submitted to intraoperative PTH determination with Quick Pack immunochemiluminescent assay (Nichols lab.) prior to excision and 5, 10 and 20 minutes after removal of the presumed hyperactive gland. Eleven patients were operated on by a minimally invasive procedure with videoassistance. RESULTS: Response to excision of the hyperfunctioning gland was evidenced by a significant decrease of PTH levels (50 % of initial value) in 26 patients. Plasma PTH levels decreased by at least 80 % of pre-excisional value after 20 minutes, 70 % after 10 minutes and by 50 % after 5 minutes. In 2 cases, significant decrease of PTH was obtained after 45 and 60 minutes respectively. In 2 other cases, the adenoma could not be found and there was no decrease of PTH even after extensive exploration of the neck. In the 11 patients who underwent minimal invasive surgery, 2 were converted to open neck surgery: in one case the adenoma was not accessible in {{the upper part of the}} neck, in the other case the hyperfunctioning gland remained undiscovered. CONCLUSION: intraoperative measurement of PTH should be considered a reliable and reproducible method for evaluation of the secreting activity of a parathyroid gland. The Quick Pack method has the advantage of confirming that the hyperactive gland has really been eradicated and consequently of considerably reducing operating time and avoiding extensive exploration of the neck.

The results confirmed the poor performance of the DBA mice in SNT. Nonetheless, DBA mice were perfectly able to recognize the novel object in SORT. By contrast, C 57 mice were good performers in SNT but failed to recognize a novel object in SORT. Finally, food restriction selectively improved C 57 performance in SNT and DBA performance in SORT.

40|$|We use the {{composite}} boson (coboson) many-body formalism to tackle scattering lengths relevant to cold atoms. We show that bound dimers {{can be taken}} as elementary entities provided that fermion exchanges between them are treated exactly, as can be done through the coboson formalism. This alternative tool extended to cold atom many-body physics not only makes transparent the many- body processes at hand through Shiva diagrams specific to cobosons, but also greatly simplifies the numerical computation. Indeed, the integral equation we derive for the atom-dimer scattering length and easily solve by restricting the dimer relative motion to the ground state, gives the previously obtained values for all fermion mass ratios. This remarkable result is also true for the dimer-dimer scattering length, except for equal fermion masses where our <b>restricted</b> <b>procedure</b> gives a value slightly larger than the accepted one (0. 64 $a_d$ instead of 0. 60 $a_d$).

30|$|A {{different}} {{solution that}} {{should also be}} mentioned is the BoundHole algorithm [20]. As local minima occur at the boundaries of holes, i.e. the regions in the network where greedy routing can fail, BoundHole finds these boundaries in advance, and then routes a data packet along a boundary. BoundHole requires nodes to gather information about their 1 -hop neighbourhood enabling them to identify stuck nodes as a previous step to detect a hole boundary. However, routing along the boundary can fail if the destination is inside the hole. In that case, a <b>restricted</b> flooding <b>procedure</b> is initiated by the boundary nodes until a path is found [20]. In either case, the mechanism to be implemented introduces a considerable overhead. Our approach is similar to BoundHole, as we also use the least angle distance to select the next forwarder. However, unlike BoundHole, ARROW does not require to implement the <b>restricted</b> flooding <b>procedure,</b> even if the destination is inside the hole.|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{monitoring}} {{in clinical}} trials is often employed to allow for early stopping and other interim decisions, while maintaining the type I error rate.

In particular, we discuss a new technique for the computation of approximate conditional tests following <b>restricted</b> randomization <b>procedures</b> and then apply this technique to approximate the joint distribution of sequentially computed conditional randomization tests.
