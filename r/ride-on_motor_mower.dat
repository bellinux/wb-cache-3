50|$|In the 1920s one of {{the most}} {{successful}} companies to emerge during this period was Atco, at that time a brand name of Charles H Pugh Ltd. The Atco <b>motor</b> <b>mower,</b> launched in 1921 was an immediate success. Just 900 of the 22-inch-cut machines were made in 1921, each costing £75. Within five years, annual production had accelerated to tens of thousands. Prices were reduced and a range of sizes was available, making the Standard the first truly mass-produced engine-powered mower.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1949 by Dr. Lino Pasquali, {{the company}} began {{production}} of two-wheel tractors, and in the late 1950s ergonomic improvements such as rubber tires, seat, and steering handles were added. In the late 1960s a line of articulated four-wheel tractors was added. In 1999, the BCS group purchased the Pasquali brand. Pasquali machines work all over the world, {{with a wide range}} of <b>motor</b> <b>mowers,</b> two-wheel tractors, and specialized tractors with power up to 100 hp. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|R
50|$|Valpadana {{was founded}} in 1935 in San Martino in Rio, Italy. In 1954, the company {{manufactured}} its first lawn mower. In 1959, it opened a new production plant. The first tractor was produced in 1960. In 1966, the company created the SEP division. The division focused on the commercialization of <b>motor</b> <b>mowers.</b> It produced its first reverse drive tractor with the driving position on a rotating platform in 1988. In 1995, the company was purchased by Argo SpA, owned by the Morra family. That same year Landini, a division of Argo, acquired in 1994, took over Valpadana. After being purchased by ARGO, Valpadana expanded its production line offering specialized tractors, such as for vineyards and orchards.|$|R
50|$|Ferrari is a {{manufacturer}} of two and four wheel tractors devoted to agriculture and lawn care. It was created in 1954, during the agricultural reconstruction period of the country. After an initial period dedicated {{to the production of}} wire-drawing machines for irrigation pipes, in 1957 Ferrari took part in the Verona exhibition with its first agricultural machine: the two-wheel tractor MC 57, which carries the date of its birth. In 1965 Ferrari launched the first articulated tractor MT65. The range of products was increased to <b>motor</b> <b>mowers</b> and tractors for diverse applications. At the end of the 1960s, the company looked to foreign markets; the subsidiary company Ferrari France was established in 1972. In 1988 Ferrari became part of the BCS Group. Today Ferrari has a wide range of machines between maintenance machines for recreational use and professional tractors for niche agriculture. Headquarters and factories are located at Abbiategrasso.|$|R

Grace made large scores, {{he was more}} terrifying than ever elsewhere until August. The exceptionally hot and dry summer of 1868, however, saw him lose a little of his deadliness with thirty-six fewer wickets, but Wootton recovered this ground for one last time in 1869 before, {{at the beginning of}} the 1870s, losing his skill for good just before the heavy roller and <b>motor</b> <b>mower</b> eliminated the shooters that made him so feared. Wootton took ninety wickets in 1870, but was so ineffective after May in 1871 with the first extensive use of heavy rollers, as to drop out of first-class cricket at the end of July with a mere ten wickets in eight games. A few deadly games in 1872 suggested he was still capable of terrorising batsmen at Lord's, but around this time Wootton showed an interest in giving up cricket for a career as a farmer, which he did following a benefit in 1873.|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} 1871, George Freeman {{had started a}} {{business}} as an auctioneer and this restricted his appearances that year. Although he was not quite so lethal {{as he had been}} in the previous four seasons, it was still a surprise when Freeman did not play in the early matches of the 1872 season, reappearing only against Gloucestershire for his own benefit match. W. G. Grace scored 150 against him, and for the next five years Freeman, with a growing business claiming all his time, played only very occasionally in minor matches for the Malton club. In 1878, however, playing as an amateur, Freeman appeared in first-class cricket for the first time in six years against Middlesex at Lord’s, but lack of practice and the improvement in pitches from the heavy roller and <b>motor</b> <b>mower</b> meant he could not take more than three wickets at a cost of ninety-one runs. He played once against each of the first two Australian touring teams, but took only two wickets in total. However, George Freeman still bowled with success for “Gentlemen of Yorkshire” teams as late as 1883.|$|R

5000|$|... 22 June: W. G. Grace {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut playing for Gentlemen of the South v. Players of the South. This was a two-day match which his team won by an innings and 58 runs. Amazingly, {{he began his}} career with a duck: st HH Stephenson b G Bennett. However, he made up for this disappointment by taking 5-44 and 8-40 when aged just 16! Grace played in five matches during his debut season but he was still not attached to a first-class county (Gloucestershire did not become a first-class team until 1870). His other games in 1865 were for Gentlemen v. Players (twice), England v. Surrey and Gentlemen of England v. Gentlemen of Middlesex. Grace played till 1908, and remains peerless as a player and became known to history as [...] "The Great Cricketer". A massive personality who was the sport’s supreme all-rounder, but best remembered as a master batsman who conquered the uncertain pitch conditions of his early years before the heavy roller and <b>motor</b> <b>mower</b> eliminated deadly shooters and [...] "bumping" [...] or [...] "flying" [...] balls on the head. His superiority over his contemporaries is astounding and only Don Bradman has a similar stature in the game's history.|$|R
40|$|Extract] When {{one of us}} (A. G. B.) {{was rather}} younger than he is today, he {{acquired}} the solemn responsibility for mowing the family lawn with a somewhat battered two-stroke <b>motor</b> <b>mower.</b> Each week, he would wheel it out, prime the carburettor and pull the starter cord. Occasionally it would start, but most weeks it would not. Out came the spanners, screwdrivers and a handy hubcap to keep all the bits, as the motor was stripped down and rebuilt. Finally, it would be repaired and the lawn mowed. But a paradox remained, for every time the mower was stripped down and rebuilt, a few pieces were left over: a split washer, a few screws, a nut or a strangely shaped piece of metal that seemed to fit… nowhere. After some years of this treatment, the question had to be asked: How few pieces can a lawnmower have and still run? The contemporary history of experimental models in immunology has taken something of an opposite path. Once the T-cell receptor (TCR) was cloned {{and the structure of}} the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -encoded ligands determined (and that nasty business with I-J swept under the carpet), there was a general feeling that the vertebrate immune system did not need many parts. It should be possible (it was reasoned) to create an experiment that would demonstrate at what point tolerance was induced and what cell or factor was responsible for its production. And so the three pieces of the machine were assembled: TCR; peptide antigen; and restriction molecule. The critical tool in the assembly was the use of transgenic technology...|$|R

50|$|Capacitor {{discharge}} ignition (CDI) or thyristor ignition {{is a type}} {{of automotive}} electronic ignition system which is widely used in outboard <b>motors,</b> motorcycles, lawn <b>mowers,</b> chainsaws, small engines, turbine-powered aircraft, and some cars. It was originally developed to overcome the long charging times associated with high inductance coils used in inductive discharge ignition (IDI) systems, making the ignition system more suitable for high engine speeds (for small engines, racing engines and rotary engines). The capacitive-discharge ignition uses capacitor discharge current to the coil to fire the spark plugs.|$|R

The proposal was passed 4-2, although another member, Alderman Salder, noted that [...] "Launceston was well known as a loyal community and {{did not need to}} change the park's name" [...] to prove their fidelity to the monarchy. A bowling green and tennis courts were completed by 1910, along with the main oval which was used for state school sports.In 1919, the council held a competition for the design of the York Park sports ground, the winner to receive £20. The final design had to include two full sized tennis courts, a bowling green, a cycling track, cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators. Although not fully complete, York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921.

40|$|This {{approach}} to inflating bicycle tyres used Julian Peck’s {{concept of a}} rip-cord and was developed chiefly by Hilton and co-authors for competition cycling, where {{time is of the}} essence. Hilton’s design development enables tyres to be inflated faster and to a set pressure. The project demonstrates Hilton’s {{approach to}} innovation; determining new and systemic perspectives for effective engagement of ‘project communities’ and responsible economic development through diversity of effective solutions. In the case of Cyclaire, understanding the way users interfaced with the product was key to its success. Watson supported the Pro/Engineer solid modelling of the pump, while Hewitt supported its sketch development and presentation. Inspiration for Cyclaire came from pull-cords for outboard <b>motors</b> and lawn <b>mowers</b> (total funding for project was £ 87 k) [...] This output builds on his doctoral study into the development of personal innovation potential by individuals and design team; which strongly influenced the development of the School of Design’s MA module: Research Principles. This encourages students to take a creative and critical approach to the development of value through research. In 2001, Cyclaire won top prize in the Spirit of Innovation Awards and was voted Innovation of the Year in Cycling Plus magazine in 2005. More recently, in 2006, it won the £ 100 K prize in the SKY programme ‘The Big Idea’. [URL] In the first year 15, 000 pumps were sold, in the UK, Germany, Denmark and the US.

40|$|ABSTRACT Energy {{consumption}} {{is still a}} lot of energy use consumables or can not be updated, such as petroleum, coal and natural gas. The increasing energy needs of the human effort to exploit the energy resources of consumables is increasing. Indonesia as a country with a tropical climate sunlight energy is abundant. So that the sun's light energy {{has the potential to be}} used as a substitute for oil, coal, etc. Along with the issues described above, the purpose of this study was to design a solar powered lawn <b>mower</b> dc <b>motor.</b> Design lawn <b>mower</b> using alternative energy from sunlight is converted into electrical energy using solar panels and then stored in the accumulator 12 volt 70 Ah and flowed into a load with a battery charger. The electrical energy stored in the accumulator is used as an additional power source if the power generated is less solar panels. How to observations made are related to data capture voltage and current generated by the solar panel, motor speed, and length of time working tools. The equipment used for this measurement, among others: luxmeter, used to measure the intensity of light. Ammeters, used to measure DC. RPM flow meter is used to measure the rotational speed of the motor. Stopwatch, used to calculate the length of time. Results of experiments without the solar panels produce motor rotation 14041 RPM. This is caused by the output voltage and current from flowing in the motor accumulator (12 V, 25 A). While testing is based on the highest light intensity received sollar cell at the time of study 97000 lux, capable of producing a voltage, current, and RPM (12 V, 25 A, 14058 RPM). Testing of the mower using solar panels can last for 59 minutes. Whereas without the solar panel the mower can work for 40 minutes. Working time mower increased by a margin of 19 minutes compared with no solar panels...|$|R
