5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this is particularly prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating. These movements are usually abrupt and irregular and present during both <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> sleep.|$|E
5|$|Andhakupa (well {{with its}} mouth hidden): It is the hell {{where a person}} who harms others with the {{intention}} of malice and harms insects is confined.

5|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying is the spraying of insecticides on {{the walls}} inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite. As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin. This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use. One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.|$|E

5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, {{which had been}} largely destroyed.

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Blue Dragon uses turn-based gameplay elements seen {{in older}} Japanese role-playing video games.

50|$|The Sigur {{river valley}} {{acts as a}} crucial micro-habitat for herbivores, {{especially}} elephants, gaur and sambar and carnivores such as tiger, leopard, wild dog (dhole), sloth bear and striped hyaena for feeding, <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> denning. Smaller carnivores such as palm civet, small Indian civet, jungle cat, jackal and several species of mongoose also use this valley intensively for feeding, <b>resting</b> <b>and</b> denning.|$|R
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E
5|$|After <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a marksman. He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by shrapnel on 10 November 1916. Although he eventually recovered from his wound, {{at the time it}} was serious enough that he was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E

5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at <b>rest,</b> <b>and</b> swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|By May, the Rangers were emplaced at Hill 258, on {{the front}} lines between the 31st RCT and the 7th Marine Regiment of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. They {{conducted}} frequent patrols along an outpost network, often encountering and engaging Chinese troops. They fortified the hill and surrounding areas, which served as an advance outpost to warn the 7th Infantry Division if the Chinese attacked. During this period, the fighting entered a lull, and troops resumed their <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> recuperation rotations. Allen, Pryor, and Freeman left on one such rotation with a number of men, leaving Queen and only 80 enlisted men on the hill.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{division}} was mobilised for war in December 1941 and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia before being deployed to New Guinea in 1943 where they {{took part in}} the Salamaua–Lae campaign against the Japanese in 1943–44, before returning to Australia for <b>rest</b> <b>and</b> reorganisation. In late 1944 they were sent to Bougainville to take part in their final campaign of the war. There they undertook a series of advances across the island before the war came to an end in August 1945.|$|E
