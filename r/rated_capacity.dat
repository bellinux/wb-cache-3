However, solid mathematical foundations for information-theoretic analysis of molecular communication {{have not yet been}} built. In particular, no one has ever proven that the channel coding theorem applies for molecular communication, and no relationship between information <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> (maximum mutual information) and code <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> (supremum achievable code rate) has been established. In this paper, we focus on a major subclass of molecular communication - the diffusion-based molecular communication. We provide solid mathematical foundations for information theory in diffusion-based molecular communication by creating a general diffusion-based molecular channel model in measure-theoretic form and prove its channel coding theorems. Various equivalence relationships between statistical and operational definitions of channel capacity are also established, including the most classic information <b>rate</b> <b>capacity</b> and code <b>rate</b> <b>capacity.</b> As byproducts, we have shown that the diffusion-based molecular channel is with "asymptotically decreasing input memory and anticipation" and "d-continuous".

In addition, the C-76 failed {{a number of}} critical flight tests. It was discovered in testing that the C-76 was unstable when not carrying a cargo load; {{in order to obtain}} a stable center of gravity, the plane had to be ballasted beyond its maximum permissible gross takeoff weight. At any speed, or in any gusting wind, the C-76's elevators would flap back and forth violently. The wing structure failed in eight separate static tests, sometimes with a load as low as 40% of the wing's <b>rated</b> <b>capacity.</b> The wing failures were attributed by some sources to the failure of the fasteners used to secure the wood components of the aircraft. Numerous additional fasteners, metal stirrups, and wood ply reinforcements were added to the structure in an effort to strengthen it, thereby increasing the plane's overall weight.|$|E
25|$|A battery's {{capacity}} {{is the amount}} of electric charge it can deliver at the rated voltage. The more electrode material contained in the cell the greater its capacity. A small cell has less capacity than a larger cell with the same chemistry, although they develop the same open-circuit voltage. Capacity is measured in units such as amp-hour (A·h). The <b>rated</b> <b>capacity</b> of a battery is usually expressed as the product of 20 hours multiplied by the current that a new battery can consistently supply for 20 hours at , while remaining above a specified terminal voltage per cell. For example, a battery rated at 100 A·h can deliver 5 A over a 20-hour period at room temperature. The fraction of the stored charge that a battery can deliver depends on multiple factors, including battery chemistry, {{the rate at which the}} charge is delivered (current), the required terminal voltage, the storage period, ambient temperature and other factors.|$|E

500|$|Despite funding {{increases}} for MDOT by the State Legislature, M-275 languished {{on the drawing}} boards. New plans in 1983 had addressed several of the environmental concerns by moving interchanges and rerouting around wetlands. These plans even canceled an extension of Northwestern Highway (then M-4, now part of M-10) to Pontiac Trail and a connection with M-275. The state increased MDOT's budget by $602 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ), but left the M-275 project off a priority list. The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) continued to factor M-275 into regional transportation planning forecasts. SEMCOG's position was that the location population that would be served by the new highway would rival 70 of Michigan's counties combined, yet there was no four-lane highways through the area. Opponents cited urban sprawl, which SEMCOG dismissed because the population {{was already in the}} area of the new highway. Transportation planners at an April 24, 1985, meeting of the West Bloomfield Republicans said that the highway extension [...] "would make sense" [...] but MDOT [...] "is planning no new freeways and no major road construction" [...] at the time. By the next month, MDOT had relinquished ownership of right-of-way in West Bloomfield Township, ending any further progress at building the roadway. Studies comparing the levels of traffic at various checkpoints along the existing I-275 showed that the freeway was only handling half of its <b>rated</b> <b>capacity.</b> At 8Mile Road, the freeway carried 57,000vehicles in 1977 and 88,000vehicles in 1984.

2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a battery is being {{discharge}}d.

Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate <b>rated</b> <b>capacity</b> in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer uninterruptible power supply, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|E
