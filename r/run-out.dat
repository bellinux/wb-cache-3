5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams {{were taken}} out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen trams {{were taken out}} of service due to radial <b>run-out.</b> The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial <b>run-out</b> the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{began the}} 1982 county season with five County Championship fixtures, {{featuring}} his first half-century with the bat, a career-best 72, while leading Warwickshire against the touring Indian side on 9 May. He also took two wickets. He also reached his 750th first-class wickets with his 2/71 against Yorkshire on 19 May. India {{were scheduled to}} play three Tests and two ODI matches that tour; however, before the matches began, the England selectors dropped Fletcher, the captain. Willis, though seen as an unlikely candidate and ambivalent towards the role, was awarded the captaincy. On 2 June, the new captain faced India {{as part of the}} England ODI squad, taking two wickets and effecting a <b>run-out</b> with the help of Botham, who also took four wickets. England restricted India to 193 and achieved victory by nine wickets. The second ODI match followed two days later, and England also won – this time by 114 runs with Willis taking 1/10 from seven overs.|$|E
25|$|Discs can be {{machined}} {{to eliminate}} thickness variation and lateral <b>run-out.</b> Machining {{can be done}} in situ (on-car) or off-car (bench lathe). Both methods will eliminate thickness variation. Machining on-car with proper equipment can also eliminate lateral <b>run-out</b> due to hub-face non-perpendicularity.|$|E

2500|$|Maxwell {{was born}} in Kew, Victoria, and played his junior cricket for South Belgrave CC. He began his cricket as a pace bowler, before remodelling his run-up and {{becoming}} an off spin bowler.

25|$|Umpiring is a thankless sort of task. it is unspectacular, its {{financial}} rewards are not great, and {{it calls for}} unwavering concentration during hours of standing, sometimes under a pitless sun, sometimes in a biting wind. To this must be added the fact that decisions like stumpings, <b>run-outs,</b> l.b.w.s and catches at the wicket are frequently the cause of contention, with the umpire invariably coming in for adverse criticism.|$|R
5000|$|The grandmother, {{who also}} cares for her old friends very much, lives {{a simple and}} humble life. Eventually, from {{constant}} play, Sang-woo's Game Boy <b>runs-out</b> of batteries so he asks his grandmother for money for new ones. But she is poor and has none. Selfishly he teases her, and in an intolerant manner throws away her shoes, breaks one of her vases and draws graffiti on her house walls.|$|R
25|$|The bowler is {{credited}} in the statistics with having taken a wicket if the batsman is out bowled, LBW, caught, stumped, or hit wicket. If {{the ball is}} a no ball then the batsman cannot be out {{in any of these}} ways. The bowler is not credited with having taken a wicket if the batsman is run out, hits the ball twice, or obstructs the field; these dismissals may occur even when the delivery is a no ball. The fieldsman {{is credited}} in the statistics with a dismissal if he takes a catch or a stumping (for a stumping this will necessarily be the wicket-keeper), and may be credited on scorecards for a <b>run-out</b> (although a <b>run-out</b> will not be credited to a player's statistics).|$|E
25|$|He was {{involved}} in a bizarre <b>run-out</b> with Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the third Test against New Zealand in 2006. Morton drove the ball to mid-on where Daniel Vettori was fielding and ran to the non striker end. Chanderpaul, at the other end, initially took a few steps down the wicket but then turned {{and went back to the}} non-striker's end. Morton believed he was out, and, furious at his captain, began to walk off. However, following a call to the third umpire, it was decided that Morton had grounded his bat at the non-striker's end just before Chanderpaul, and hence was safe and that Chanderpaul was out. Video evidence suggests that the umpire's decision was wrong: although Morton made his ground first, he then left it before the <b>run-out</b> was made, so he should have been the one dismissed.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} for South Australia in the Futures League in the 2016–17 season and his form improved, averaging 45.50. He scored twin centuries, 104 and 100 not out, against Victoria. He got {{the opportunity to}} play against the touring South African side in a tour match for a South Australia second XI. He scored 20 runs before he was <b>run-out.</b>|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{recovered}} from the trauma of their semi-final thrashing to beat Sri Lanka by 51 runs. 56 not out from Harris and 56 from Astle were the main elements of a final total of 212/7 that included three <b>run-outs.</b> The Sri Lankans struggled to 77/7 in their innings, and though they added 53 for the eighth wicket thanks to Perera's 45, it was never likely to be enough and they were bowled out for 161.|$|R
50|$|Yousuf is a skilful infielder, with {{a report}} {{prepared}} by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the seventh highest number of <b>run-outs</b> in ODI cricket of any fieldsman. He is also distinguished by his characteristic celebration after hitting one hundred runs for his country, where he prostrates in thankfulness to Allah {{in the direction of}} Mecca. He has observed this act (known as the Sajdah) since his conversion to Islam.|$|R
25|$|At {{backward}} point, he {{was considered}} {{by some to be}} the next Jonty Rhodes in his ability to hit the stumps, with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the eighth highest number of <b>run-outs</b> in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the tenth highest success rate. Gibbs is said to rarely practice in the nets before a match. It is said he prefers to play on instinct in this case.|$|R
25|$|On 5 June 2009, Netherlands {{defeated}} England by four wickets in {{the first}} match of the ICC World Twenty20. The Netherlands needed seven to win from the final over with Broad bowling. He spurned two <b>run-out</b> opportunities from the first two balls, and dropped a catch off the third. The Dutch needed two runs from the final ball to win, and got them after Broad picked up the ball in his follow through and, attempting to win the match, overthrew, missing his third <b>run-out</b> opportunity of the over and allowing the batsmen {{to come back for}} the match-clinching second run. in the next match against Pakistan, he took 3–17 to help England win by 48 runs. England also beat India by 3 runs. Although Broad failed to take a wicket, he bowled his four overs for just 21 runs to help England secure a narrow victory. England lost their final game of the tournament against the West Indies, with Broad taking 1–20.|$|E
25|$|Despite some solid Test knocks for Australia, he {{is remembered}} {{more for a}} couple of legends of the early days of Test cricket than for {{anything}} he did on the field. He was involved, for example, in an incident with WG Grace in the 1882 Test Match, when he was <b>run-out</b> after having, under the assumption that the ball was dead, left his crease to pat down the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Needing 364 to make England bat again, several Australian batsmen again made starts {{before getting}} out. Watson made a brisk 38 before a mix-up left both him and Hughes {{at the same}} end for an easy <b>run-out,</b> the third <b>run-out</b> of the series that he was {{involved}} in. Clarke scored 41 in his second innings as captain and Haddin made 30, but Tremlett then tempted Haddin into playing a bouncer behind to Prior before clean-bowling Johnson with his next delivery, prompting an extra half hour of play on Day 4. In an eighth-wicket partnership worth 80 runs, Smith made an unbeaten half-century and Siddle made 43; however, after Siddle was removed, Hilfenhaus soon departed for just 7 before Tremlett took the final wicket: Beer bowled, playing on, for 2. Australia's total was 281 and England won by an innings and 83 runs. This was the third time they had won by an innings in the series – the first time a touring side had ever won three Tests by an innings during a single series.|$|E
25|$|He {{compiled}} fifty-two hundreds in all, {{and made}} 209 and 146 {{in the same}} game against Middlesex in 1979, a feat unequalled at Trent Bridge. He scored 1,000 runs in a season eight times, took 361 catches and 13 wickets at 31.00. He was popular with the crowds, who found his enthusiastic fielding and comic antics entertaining. He was famous for running, rather than walking, towards the batsman in the covers as the bowler delivered the ball and was responsible for many <b>run-outs.</b>|$|R
25|$|Martyn {{was also}} an {{occasional}} medium-pacer and distinguished fieldsman primarily in the covers who was capable of creating spectacular <b>run-outs.</b> He also very occasionally kept wicket at first-class level. He was named man of the series in the Border Gavaskar Trophy in 2004, to help Australia defeat India on the subcontinent {{for the first time}} in more than 30 years, and was named in early 2005 as the Australian Test player of the Year at the annual Allan Border Medal presentations.|$|R

25|$|De Villiers has a {{reputation}} as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving <b>run-out</b> of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who {{was also one of the}} finest fielders of his generation.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{water slide}} uses a pump system to pump {{water to the}} top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces {{friction}} so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long <b>run-out</b> chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed {{at the top and}} the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider gets hurt they will be treated immediately.|$|E
25|$|Sharma and Rahul {{built their}} {{partnership}} on Day 3 very slowly. Sharma {{brought up a}} half-century but was bowled shortly after (53). Rahul survived a huge <b>run-out</b> opportunity to bring up his first half-century as India reached lunch at 2/122, with Rahul (50*) and Virat Kohli (16*). The pair built a big partnership after lunch and dominated the Australian bowlers as Kohli brought up another half-century. Rahul brought up his first test century right on tea with India at 2/234 at the break.|$|E

50|$|The jumping test {{consisted}} of 18 obstacles, {{a maximum of}} 1.25 meters high, on a 1,150 meter course. There was a 3-minute time limit, again rewarding speed with an extra 1/2 point for every second under the time, adding 1/4 point for every second over. Unlike today's show jumping tests, some obstacles had to be cleared multiple times during the test, at {{a different part of}} the fence each time. Riders gained points for refusals, <b>run-outs,</b> falls, and going off-course.|$|R
