50|$|However, {{the right}} to silence was not always a {{practical}} reality for all accused in the English courts for some period afterwards. With limited access to legal counsel (often depending on the social status of the accused), a shifting standard of proof, and a system generally distrustful of silent defendants, a criminal accused who remained silent was often believed to be guilty and got sentenced. Nevertheless, it remained a basic <b>right</b> <b>available</b> to the accused and has been an accepted practice {{over the past few}} centuries. In England, the practice of judicial questioning of accused persons at trial (as distinct from questioning prior to trial), did not really disappear until well into the 18th century. But by the 19th century, the accused was not allowed to give evidence on oath even if they wanted to - also said to be a reaction to the inequities of the Star Chamber and High Commission.|$|E

50|$|Gardiner ran for {{parliament}} at the 1900 Albany by-election, after George Leake resigned. Although he {{lost that}} by-election, he was {{actively involved in}} the campaign for the federation of Australia. During the federal campaign, the Western Australian parliament at first refused the people of the colony the right to vote for or against accepting the draft Commonwealth constitution, a <b>right</b> <b>available</b> to electors in all other Australian colonies. James Gardiner, George Leake and Walter James, with other supporters of federation, promoted the 'Bill to the People Petition' supporting federal union. The petition was initially unheeded by parliament, but the cause was furthered by the 'Separation for Federation' movement on the goldfields. There was strong anti-federation sentiment in the farming, coal mining and viticulture industries, owing to fears that the abolition of inter-colonial import tariffs and the inception of free trade with the eastern colonies would ruin these industries. Gardiner campaigned with Walter James in June 1900 to allay the fears of Collie coal miners that the coal industry would suffer as a result of federation. The miners ultimately voted for federation on 31 July 1900.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{questions}} {{with regard to the}} relationship between media and politics is: ‘who is in control?’ or ‘who controls whom?’. A crucial element hereby is control over (the flow of) information. In our article we describe the prevailing attitude towards information in a given society by using the concept of information climate or information culture, in line with the concept of political culture. The information culture can be labelled as universalistic – when information is considered a universal <b>right,</b> <b>available</b> to everyone (journalists, citizens, [...] ) on the same basis – or particularistic – when information is considered a particular right or privilege, not on the same basis available to everyone (only for selected journalists, citizens, [...] ). This classification goes beyond the rough ‘openness versus secrecy’ extremes and allows an insight into the deeper value orientation of a given society and consequently an understanding of a specific situation. The theoretical views are tested and illustrated at the hand of the case of communist and post-communist Russia. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Today’s rich service {{offer in}} the World Wide Web {{increasingly}} requires {{the disclosure of}} personal user data. Service providers ’ appetite for personal user data, however, is accompanied by growing privacy implications for Internet users. Addressing this rising threat, privacy-enhancing tech-nologies aim at aiding users in protecting their personal data. Even though effective privacy laws facilitate users to edit and revoke already disclosed personal data, few PET solutions support users in exercising this <b>right.</b> <b>Available</b> tools lack intuitive interfaces and are built on powerful infrastructures on the provider side. In this paper we introduce the Data Disclosure Log component within a user-centric privacy archi-tecture. Built on a browser-based logging extension, we present a visualization tool that displays past personal data disclosures from different perspectives. A graph-based view allows for the dynamic presentation of relations between selected entity types. Such an overview enables users to know the conditions of past personal data transactions at any time. This knowledge represents a prerequisite for an ex post revision or revocation of personal data. Usability and user acceptance of the developed prototype is evaluated in a conducted user test...|$|E
