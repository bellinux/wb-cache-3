40|$|ABSTRACT: Aquifer {{recharge}} {{programs are}} concepts that {{will play a}} role in the solution to the water supply concerns throughout the world, not only for urban users, but also for agricultural and environmental users. There is merit in many of these programs, but uncertainties over permitting and the efficiency of water and wastewater treatment plants plays a role in their use, along with proper geologic conditions. It is generally understood that each recharge program should be designed, constructed, and tested with the unique goals of the project in mind (e & injection <b>rate,</b> <b>storage</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>storage</b> period, recovery <b>rate,</b> water quality of recharge, water quality of native, and water quality of intended rewvered use). Water quantity issues are murky and water quality issues are generally unknown. Therefore, regulatory agencies have resistance to recharge programs, especially those that have been proposed involving waters of less than pristine (or impaired) quality, caused by the risk of effects to the public should these waters be recovered in water supply wells at a later point in time. This is a risk issue can only be overcome with the proper peer review, multi-jurisdictional input, and an effort to maximize the information gained to help clarify the magnitude of such projects.

40|$|AbstractThe most {{important}} technical challenge now facing geologic carbon <b>storage</b> (GCS) involves <b>rates</b> of <b>storage,</b> not <b>volumes.</b> The factors governing well injectivity combine to make achieving material <b>storage</b> <b>rates</b> (of order 0. 1 Gt CO 2 /y in a basin or region) difficult. One such {{factor is the}} correlation between injectivity and <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of structural traps, which restricts access to much space that is desirable for secure storage for centuries. This limitation is exacerbated by the reduction in fracture pressure when injected CO 2 is cooler than the storage formation. Changing the storage paradigm, so that brine is extracted from the storage formation as CO 2 is injected, is the only robust option for materiality. A solution to the resulting brine disposal problem is to dissolve CO 2 into the brine, then reinject it into the storage formation. This and other alternatives to injection-only storage must be examined if GCS is to play a substantive role in mitigating CO 2 emissions {{over the course of}} decades...|$|R
40|$|Variations in fluvial {{sediment}} transport <b>rates</b> and <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> {{have been described}} previously as sediment waves or pulses. These features have been identified {{over a wide range}} of temporal and spatial scales and have been categorized using existing bedform classifications. Here we describe the factors controlling the generation and propagation of what we term sediment slugs. These can be defined as bodies of clastic material associated with disequilibrium conditions in fluvial systems over time periods above the event scale. Slugs range in magnitude from unit bars (Smith, 1974) up to sedimentary features generated by basin-scale sediment supply disturbances (Trimble, 1981). At lower slug magnitudes, perturbations in sediment transport are generated by local riverbank and/or bed erosion. Larger-scale features result from the occurrence of rare high- magnitude geomorphic events, and the impacts on water and sediment production of tectonics, glaciation, climate change and anthropogenic influences. Simple sediment routing functions are presented which may be used to describe the propagation of sediment slugs in fluvial systems. Attention is drawn to components of the fluvial system where future research is urgently required to improve our quantitative understanding of drainage-basin sediment dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} from CO 2 injection at pilot projects (Frio, Ketzin, Nagaoka, US Regional Partnerships) and existing commercial operations (Sleipner, Snøhvit, In Salah, acid-gas injection) demonstrates that CO 2 geological storage in saline aquifers is technologically feasible. Monitoring and verification technologies {{have been tested}} and demonstrated to detect and track the CO 2 plume in different subsurface geological environments. By the end of 2008, approximately 20 Mt of CO 2 had been successfully injected into saline aquifers by existing operations. Currently, the highest injection <b>rate</b> and total <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> for a single storage operation are approximately 1 Mt CO 2 /year and 25 Mt, respectively. If {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is to be an effective option for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, commercial-scale storage operations will require orders of magnitude larger storage capacity than accessed by the existing sites. As a result, new demonstration projects will need to develop and test injection strategies that consider multiple injection wells and the optimisation of the usage of storage space. To accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, demonstration projects should be selected that can be readily employed for commercial use; i. e. projects that fully integrate the capture, transport and storage processes at an industrial emissions source...|$|R
40|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of {{internet}} data center {{is one of}} the classical time series. It is very valuable to predict the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> of a data center for the business value. However, the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series from a data center is always “dirty,” which contains the noise, missing data, and outliers, so it is necessary to extract the main trend of <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series for the future prediction processing. In this paper, we propose an irregular sampling estimation method to extract the main trend of the time series, in which the Kalman filter is used to remove the “dirty” data; then the cubic spline interpolation and average method are used to reconstruct the main trend. The developed method is applied in the <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series {{of internet}} data center. The experiment results show that the developed method can estimate the main trend of <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> series accurately and make great contribution to predict the future volume value...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{study of}} the {{freshwater}} discharge into the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) has been carried out. Using available streamgage data, regression equations were developed for monthly flows. These equations express discharge {{as a function of}} basin physical characteristics such as area, mean elevation, and land cover, and of basin meteorological characteristics such as temperature, precipitation, and accumulated water year precipitation. To provide the necessary input meteorological data, temperature and precipitation data for a 40 year hind-cast period were developed on high-spatial-resolution grids using weather station data, PRISM climatologies, and statistical downscaling methods. Runoff predictions from the equations were found to agree well with observations. Once developed, the regression equations were applied to a network of delineated watersheds spanning the entire GOA drainage basin. The region was divided into a northern region, ranging from the Aleutian Chain to the Alaska/Canada border in the southeast panhandle, and a southern region, ranging from there to the Fraser River. The mean annual runoff volume into the northern GOA region was found to be 7926 120 km 3 yr 21. A water balance using MODIS-based evapotranspiration <b>rates</b> yielded seasonal <b>storage</b> <b>volumes</b> that were consistent with GRACE satellite-based estimates. The GRACE data suggest that an additional 576 11 km 3 yr 21 be added to the runoff from the northern region...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{methodology}} is proposed {{to determine the}} design space for synthesis, analysis, and optimization of solar water heating systems. The proposed methodology incorporates different design constraints to identify all possible designs or a design space on a collector area vs. <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> diagram. The design space is represented by tracing constant solar fraction lines on a collector area vs. <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> diagram. It has been observed that there exists a minimum {{as well as a}} maximum <b>storage</b> <b>volume</b> for a given solar fraction and collector area. Similarly existence of a minimum and a maximum collector area is also observed for a fixed solar fraction and <b>storage</b> <b>volume.</b> For multi-objective optimization, a Pareto optimal region is also identified. Based on the identified design space, the solar water heating system is optimized by minimizing annual life cycle cost. Due to uncertainty in solar insolation, system parameters and cost data, global optimization may not be utilized to represent a meaningful design. To overcome this, a region of possible design configurations is also identified in this paper. (c) 200...|$|R
