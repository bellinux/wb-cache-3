When the ficus branch were treated by 2, 4, 5 T., a kind of plant hormones, a few lower fruits riped in a week or so, while the other younger fruits and adults leaves were markedly damaged. To escape those unfavorable effects, therefore, lower three fruits alone were treated. The results were very favoreble in the treatment of 0. 1 - 0. 02 %. 2. Devices of killing methods of <b>rice</b> <b>borers.</b> The writer fixed four glass plates to neon lump. Using it, the killing percentage of <b>rice</b> <b>borers</b> can be markedly increased. Observing the damage of <b>rice</b> <b>borers</b> in the ripening period, we were surprised to find that the percentage of attacked stems were very high and decrease of seed weight were considerably severe in intolerant varieties. These facts suggest the need of insecticides or neon lump in the ripening period too. 3. Dameges of rice plants suffered by the cool temperature. The writer observed the severe dameges by the sterility of rice plants caused by the cool temperature, exploring at the mountain distric of Bantai. In this investigation he caught the important facts thet the rice plants have critical stages to the cool tempreature 17 - 18 ℃ before heading as well as at heading, To detect the stages, many post of rice plants were alternately put in cool spring water 17 - 18 ℃ for a week. 4. Role of vacuoles in the rice plants tissue as oxgen passages to the root. Several upper lengthend internodes have no vacuole in their tissue while the lower ones have apparent vacuoles. When the writer observed whether the atmost internode which developed the roots has any vacuole in the tissue, he found that the development of roots and vacuoles in the stem coincides aimost completely which suggests the vacuoles may act the role of Oxgen passages to the roots. 5.

Information on the biology of L. jalisco is scarce and indispensable for its propagation in captivity and understanding of L. jalisco-E. loftini interactions. Parasitoid longevity, reproductive biology and immature development were studied under laboratory conditions. At 22 C, honey-fed mated adults lived about two weeks whereas lifespan of unmated individuals averaged three weeks. Females of L. jalisco emerged with a complement of eggs that continued to develop during the first days following emergence. Mating was necessary for embryonic development. After copulation, eggs were fertilized and gradually transferred to an elongated ovisac where they incubated for about one week before hatching. Hatching occurred in the female’s reproductive tract, an attribute of true ovoviviparous repro-duction. First instar larvae were available for oviposition during the female’s entire lifetime. Egg load increased with adult female size; mean lifetime potential fecundity was 400 140 eggs per female. Parasitoids successfully developed on second to sixth instar host larvae...|$|R
