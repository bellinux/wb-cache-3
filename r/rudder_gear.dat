50|$|On Wednesday 26 August 1908, RMS Etruria {{was moving}} astern from her pier in Liverpool to anchor {{opposite}} the Princes' Landing Stage, where her passengers would embark. A hopper crossing the Mersey came {{too close to}} Etruria and was violently rammed by her. Etrurias rudder and propeller were thrust deep into the hopper, almost severing it in two. However, being impaled on Etrurias propeller prevented the hopper from sinking. Both vessels drifted helplessly in the Mersey, and the hopper was violently crushed against the landing stage. This not only spelt the end for the hopper, but finished the career of Etruria as well. Her propeller, <b>rudder</b> and steering <b>gear</b> were seriously damaged, forcing the cancellation of her sailing to New York. Etrurias passengers were put up in hotels and then caught Umbria later in the week. Etruria was taken into dock, where temporary repairs were made.|$|R

50|$|The Heinkel {{company began}} the He 280 project {{on its own}} {{initiative}} after the He 178 had been met with indifference from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (German, Reich Aviation Ministry, RLM). The head designer was Robert Lusser, who began the project under the designation He 180 in late 1939. It had a typical Heinkel fighter fuselage, elliptically-shaped wings and a dihedralled tailplane with twin fins and <b>rudders.</b> The landing <b>gear</b> was of the retractable tricycle type with very little ground clearance. This arrangement was considered too frail for the grass or dirt airfields of the era; however, the tricycle layout eventually gained acceptance.

The ship's commanding officer was relieved of duty and replaced via helicopter a few days later. The attached Marine force onboard was transferred to the US naval ship [...] shortly after that. After getting underway 28 October, she arrived at Talcahuano on the 31st, under tow by the Chilean icebreaker Oscar Viel Toro. This was her final port, as repairs to her severely damaged hull and machinery were judged to be uneconomical. Within a few weeks, 90% of the crew was returned to the United States.

2500|$|A British {{reconnaissance}} aircraft sighted Bismarck {{in the early}} morning hours of 26 May by following its oil slick. At dusk on 26 May, Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft from HMS Ark Royal attacked. Though much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed Bismarcks <b>rudders</b> and steering <b>gear.</b> Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but Lütjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage Lütjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer Bismarck somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to [...] and effectively left it circling in the water.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>rudder</b> and {{steering}} <b>gear</b> {{is the most}} widely used ship maneuvering equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, steering gear, steering mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the steering gear failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the steering gear in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure steering gear failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem. Foreword The hydraulic steering <b>gear</b> moves the <b>rudder</b> by hydraulic pressure. Its main components are hydraulic pump, hydraulic valve, hydraulic pipe, oil tank and 2 or 4 pcs hydraulic cylinders wit...|$|R
5000|$|At dusk that evening, and in atrocious weather conditions, Swordfish from Ark Royal {{launched}} an attack. The first wave mistakenly targeted Sheffield {{which had been}} detached from Force H under orders to close and shadow Bismarck. Although precious time was lost by this incident, it proved beneficial to the British in that the magnetic detonators on the torpedoes used against Sheffield were seen to be defective and for the following attack on Bismarck were replaced by those designed to explode on contact. Despite the lateness of the day, {{it was decided to}} try again. The attack commenced in near darkness at around 21:00 but once again the Swordfish torpedo bombers found Bismarck with their ASV II radars. A hit by a single torpedo from a Swordfish, hitting her port side, jammed Bismarcks <b>rudder</b> and steering <b>gear</b> 12° to port. This resulted in her being, initially, able to steam only in a large circle. Repair efforts by the crew to free the rudder failed. Bismarck attempted to steer by alternating the power of her three propeller shafts, which, in the prevailing force 8 wind and sea state, resulted in the ship being forced to sail towards King George V and Rodney, two British battleships that had been pursuing Bismarck from the west. At 23:40 on 26 May, Admiral Lütjens delivered to Group West, the German command base, the signal [...] "Ship unmanoeuvrable. We will fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical or [...] "wind vane" [...] {{self-steering}} {{started out}} as a way to keep model sail boats on course.Before the advent of Radio Control, model yacht racing (started before WW1) was typically contested on long narrow ponds, and the number of stops along the banks was counted as a penalty in the final result. Initially a system of counterweight on the tillers was devised to compensate for the weather helm when the model boat heeled in a gust. These crude systems evoved in a more sophisticated system called Braine Gear after its inventor, George Braine. The Braine steering gear was a fine-tuned system of quadrant on the rudder stock driven by the tension of the mainsail sheet and damped by a rubber band. A more sophisticated system called the vane gear was later devised, it relied on a small vane or airfoil driving the main rudder via an adjustable system of clockwork <b>gears</b> vane <b>gear</b> <b>rudder.</b> It was very similar to the later vane driven autopilots seen on transatlantic yachts such as Blondie Hasler's self steering rudder.Some transatlantic singlehanded sailors used a crude form of self steering devices to cross the Atlantic Ocean in the 1920s and 1930s, the most notable being Frenchman Marin Marie (Pierre Durand Coupel de Saint Front) who crossed the Atlantic twice in the 1930s, first on a sailing yacht called Winnibelle II and secondly on a motor pinnace called Arielle.|$|R
6000|$|Three ships still hung on {{the next}} margin of destruction, {{steaming}} desperately to their moorings, dashed helplessly together. The Calliope was the nearest in; she had the Vandalia close on her port side and a little ahead, the Olga close a-starboard, the reef under her heel; and steaming and veering on her cables, the unhappy ship fenced with her three dangers. About a quarter to nine she carried away the Vandalia's quarter gallery with her jib-boom; a moment later, the Olga had near rammed her from the other side. By nine the Vandalia dropped down on her too fast to be avoided, and clapped her stern under the bowsprit of the English ship, the fastenings of which were burst asunder as she rose. To avoid cutting her down, {{it was necessary for}} the Calliope to stop and even to reverse her engines; and her rudder was at the moment--or it seemed so to the eyes of those on board--within ten feet of the reef. [...] "Between the Vandalia and the reef" [...] (writes Kane, in his excellent report) [...] "it was destruction." [...] To repeat Fritze's manoeuvre with the Adler was impossible; the Calliope was too heavy. The one possibility of escape was to go out. If the engines should stand, if they should have power to drive the ship against wind and sea, if she should answer the helm, if the wheel, <b>rudder,</b> and <b>gear</b> should hold out, and if they were favoured with a clear blink of weather in which to see and avoid the outer reef--there, and there only, were safety. Upon this catalogue of [...] "ifs" [...] Kane staked his all. He signalled to the engineer for every pound of steam--and at that moment (I am told) much of the machinery was already red-hot. The ship was sheered well to starboard of the Vandalia, the last remaining cable slipped. For a time--and there was no onlooker so cold-blooded as to offer a guess at its duration--the Calliope lay stationary; then gradually drew ahead. The highest speed claimed for her that day is of one sea-mile an hour. The question of times and seasons, throughout all this roaring business, is obscured by a dozen contradictions; I have but chosen {{what appeared to be the}} most consistent; but if I am to pay any attention to the time named by Admiral Kimberley, the Calliope, in this first stage of her escape, must have taken more than two hours to cover less than four cables. As she thus crept seaward, she buried bow and stem alternately under the billows.|$|R
40|$|The Active Gear, Flexible Aircraft Takeoff and Landing Analysis program, AGFATL, was {{developed}} to provide a complete simulation of the aircraft takeoff and landing dynamics problem. AGFATL can represent an airplane either as a rigid body with {{six degrees of freedom}} or as a flexible body with multiple degrees of freedom. The airframe flexibility is represented by the superposition of up to twenty free vibration modes on the rigid-body motions. The analysis includes maneuver logic and autopilots programmed to control the aircraft during glide slope, flare, landing, and takeoff. The program is modular so that performance of the aircraft in flight and during landing and ground maneuvers can be studied separately or in combination. A program restart capability is included in AGFATL. Effects simulated in the AGFATL program include: (1) flexible aircraft control and performance during glide slope, flare, landing roll, and takeoff roll under conditions of changing winds, engine failures, brake failures, control system failures, strut failures, restrictions due to runway length, and control variable limits and time lags; (2) landing gear loads and dynamics for up to five gears; (3) single and multiple engines (maximum of four) including selective engine reversing and failure; (4) drag chute and spoiler effects; (5) wheel braking (including skid-control) and selective brake failure; (6) aerodynamic ground effects; (7) aircraft carrier operations; (8) inclined runways and runway perturbations; (9) flexible or rigid airframes; 10) <b>rudder</b> and nose <b>gear</b> steering; and 11) actively controlled landing gear shock struts. Input to the AGFATL program includes data which describe runway roughness; vehicle geometry, flexibility and aerodynamic characteristics; landing gear(s); propulsion; and initial conditions such as attitude, attitude change rates, and velocities. AGFATL performs a time integration of the equations of motion and outputs comprehensive information on the airframe, state-of-maneuver logic, autopilots, control response, and aircraft loads from impact, runway roll-out, and ground operations. Flexible-body and total (elastic plus rigid-body) displacements, velocities, and accelerations are also output in the flexible-body option for up to twenty points on the aircraft. The AGFATL program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with an overlayed central memory requirement of approximately 141 (octal) of 60 bit words. The AGFATL program was last updated in 1984...|$|R
