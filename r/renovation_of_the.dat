5|$|The Adam Smith Theatre, the town's main auditorium, plays host to {{theatrical}} {{and musical}} productions {{as well as}} showing a selection of arthouse and commercial films.

5|$|The {{football}} match {{crowd at}} Hampden were renowned {{for creating the}} Hampden Roar and trying to terrify opposing teams. The stadium's capacity exceeded 100,000 from the early 1900s until the 1980s and the Roar could be heard whenever Scotland scored an important goal. After the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium and the reduced capacities, the roar has become more muted.|$|E

An ornate centrepiece with a trophy of arms containing a bust of Carafa was added above the main entrance.

5|$|Although Herod's <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Temple was {{initiated}} in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps {{of a type}} common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was popular}} with {{travelling}} vendors, particularly of small fancy goods, {{the maintenance of}} the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125. In 2005 the base of the cross was rediscovered in excavations during <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market area, but has since been re-covered. Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in the market floor.|$|E
5|$|Another home beckoned in 1959 {{with the}} <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Exhibition Stadium to {{accommodate}} Canadian football. Often remembered ruefully by Torontonians for its {{exposure to weather}} and poor sightlines, the stadium was nevertheless {{the site of the}} Argos' greatest attendance in the late 1960s and 1970s. Particularly brutal conditions at the 70th Grey Cup in 1982 {{paved the way for the}} construction of a domed stadium in Toronto.|$|E
25|$|Main Street {{has seen}} a revival with <b>the</b> {{addition}} <b>of</b> several new restaurants, a brand new court house, ongoing <b>renovations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old State Theater into a 10-screen multiplex movie theater, and {{plans to build a}} hotel and a music venue.|$|R
50|$|From {{its opening}} in 1973 until 2011, the station (and square) {{was known as}} Moszkva tér. <b>The</b> {{exterior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building is strikingly {{similar to that of}} Saint Petersburg's Pionerskaya Station. <b>Renovations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station began in 2015, along with the surrounding square.|$|R
50|$|Decatur House, now a museum, {{is located}} at 748 Jackson Place, N.W., on President's Park (Lafayette Park).

5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway {{around the turn}} of the 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons in and around Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> only seat of higher education in Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive defense of his colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the AirTrain case appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct {{structures}} had been constructed already. The system was ready for its first test trains by December 2000. The state spent $75 million to renovate the Howard Beach station, which brought it into ADA compliance and facilitated passengers' transfers {{to and from the}} AirTrain. The new Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001. The Port Authority also contributed $100 million toward the <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jamaica LIRR station, with the State of New York paying {{for the rest of the}} $387 million project. The purpose of this renovation was, in part, to facilitate AirTrain connections. The <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jamaica station started in May 2001 upon the completion of the Howard Beach station. By this time, the system's guideway rails were complete and the guideways were being constructed. The first two AirTrain cars were delivered in March 2001 and were undergoing testing at the AirTrain maintenance facility near Lefferts Boulevard. The guideways were completed in August 2001. However, a parking structure, proposed near the Jamaica terminal as part of a long-term plan to redevelop downtown Jamaica, was largely unfunded by 2002, the year the AirTrain was originally supposed to open.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to football, the Estadio Nacional {{is home to}} other sports. Sixteen Peruvian sporting federations are headquartered at the national stadium. These include the Boxing, Karate, Bodybuilding, Kung Fu, Taekwondo and Volleyball federations. They were temporarily relocated for <b>the</b> <b>renovations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium.|$|R
2500|$|Land {{purchase}} The {{school board}} voted to purchase 2 parcels of land totaling [...] for $1 million.
