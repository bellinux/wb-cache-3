Thirty six <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> were identified in Australian universities of which 80 % were reuse of a Learning Design.

5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is the <b>role</b> <b>played</b> by Armenian clerics in that process. According {{to a number of}} scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity.

5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and would never have been seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider <b>role</b> <b>played</b> by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E

5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the <b>role</b> <b>played</b> by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E
40|$|Purpose This paper aims to identify, {{through a}} {{literature}} review, key issues regarding how online <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> {{can be designed}} and to apply them when designing a <b>role</b> <b>play</b> on conflict management. Design/methodology/approach By drawing on the key issues identified in the literature review, a <b>role</b> <b>play</b> on conflict management was designed and evaluated. Data were collected by developing a survey that focused on perceived learning, participation and satisfaction. Findings Overall, {{a majority of the}} students felt that they learned and participated in the <b>role</b> <b>play.</b> The most positive finding was that the students were satisfied with their <b>role</b> <b>play</b> experience. Research limitations/implications Researchers are urged to further develop the dimensions and measures of online <b>role</b> <b>play</b> success. The measures that were developed for evaluating perceived learning, participation and satisfaction with <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> can be further developed and tested. It is suggested that the effects on learning need to be further explored. Practical implications It is suggested that teachers take the identified key issues of online <b>role</b> <b>play</b> design into account. An important challenge seems to be to encourage students to reflect and do additional reading and research in relation with online <b>role</b> <b>plays.</b> Originality/value Online collaboration is commonly argued as beneficial from an e-learning perspective.

Method: The module was conducted from January to August 2011 using a total of 15 <b>role</b> <b>plays.</b> Student feedback was obtained using a semi-structured questionnaire. Informal discussions were held and a questionnaire was circulated among the first year students {{who had participated in}} the module. Results: Ninety-eight of the 100 students in the module participated in the study. The overall opinion regarding the <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> was positive. Students stated <b>role</b> <b>plays</b> helped to make module objectives concrete and interesting, made students identify with the problem being investigated and improved communication skills. <b>Role</b> <b>plays</b> were designed to address important health issues in Nepal and prepare students for addressing these issues in future practice.

The links between Conwy and Savoy are not straightforward, however, as in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built after James had left the region.
