Considering a mobile wireless communications system with four transmit antennas, we form an 8 D signal constellation as Cartesian product of four 2 D <b>rectangular</b> <b>signal</b> sets, an 8 D point being transmitted {{by the first}} antenna as four concatenated 2 D points in four consecutive channel uses. The 2 D symbols transmitted by the other three antennas are not independent, but so chosen as to form, together with the symbols transmitted by the first antenna, the entries of a 4 × 4 quasiorthogonal matrix. The union of two sets of quasi-orthogonal matrices forms a super-quasi-orthogonal signal set. With 4 × 4 quasi-orthogonal matrices, we then label the state transitions of a trellis diagram describing {{the operation of the}} encoder. The frame error rate (FER) and the bit error rate (BER) performance results show an excellent behavior of our proposed super-quasiorthogonal ST trellis codes. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a computer-simulation study of a (4, 12) circular signal set for use over regenerative satellite links. The signal has a 16 -ary symbol alphabet. The satellite transponders and each of the earth-stations use either travelling-wave-tube amplifers (TWTAs) or solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) for high-power amplification. Several different earth-stations are assumed to have simultaneous access to a given regenerative satellite, in an arrangement of frequency division multiple access (FDMA). Thus, adjacent-Channel-Interference (ACI) can be introduced into the wanted signal by the immediately adjacent channels. The performances of the signal are compared to those of a 16 -ary differentially encoded-quadrature-amplitude-modulated (16 -ary DEQAM) signal with a <b>rectangular</b> <b>signal</b> set and the results are used to determine to preferred signal set for spectrally efficient transmission over satellite links. It has been shown that, with TWTAs used for high-power amplification {{and in the absence of}} ACI, the circular signal set has an advantage of about 3 dB over the <b>rectangular</b> <b>signal</b> set, at the error rate of 10 - 4. While in the presence of the ACI, the advantage is 2 dB. With SSPAs, the respective advantages becomes 0. 7 and 0. 5 dB. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

However, our non-stationary indicator still suffers from two-step transition problem, i.e., the transition between two valid states of the cluster <b>rectangular</b> <b>signals</b> is not immediate (this case can be shown in Figure 8 around the 14, 000 th and 24, 000 th samples). Using 1.2 in Appendix Appendix 1 : high-order statistics estimators {{and the fact that the}} two-step transition problem generates two Dirac delta functions with different values but sharing the same sign, we developed another process called two-step transition process to deal with this problem (see Appendix Appendix 3 : continuity process algorithm).|$|R

After solving this problem using assumption 1.2 in Appendix Appendix 1 : high-order statistics estimators and a continuity procedure, an accurate transition indicator of non-stationary signals is achieved.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an {{approach}} for simplifying the experimental arrangement, needed to generate limited diffracting waves through annular ultrasonic arrays, is analyzed in terms mainly {{of the subsequent}} acoustic field. The main idea is to approximate the theoretical X-wave electrical excitations to <b>rectangular</b> driving <b>signals</b> in each array annulus, {{by means of the}} L 2 curve criterion. The differences between theoretical X-wave signals and these approximate signals, related to real excitation effects, were minimized by using the transition times and amplitudes of the <b>rectangular</b> <b>signals</b> as fitting parameters. Acoustic field simulations, based on the impulse response technique, are applied for evaluating the agreement degree between both emitted ultrasonic fields, whit the calculated classical X wave and with the new approximation method proposed here for low-cost limited-diffraction wave generation. In addition, source vibration and ultrasonic field simulated signals were compared with those of the classic x wave under an exact driving, with the purpose of validating the method. The good agreement between the two vibration signals and resulting field distributions, obtained from the classical X wave excitations and those provided by the drastic simplification presented here, can be justified by the filtering effects induced by the transducer elements bands in frequency domain. These results suggest the possibility of achieving limited diffraction waves with relatively simple driving waveforms, which can be implemented with a moderate cost in analogical electronics...|$|R
