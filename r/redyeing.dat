30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} the elastic fibers of arterial wall, elastic stain was performed as described by Albini et al. (2014). After dewaxing and rehydration, sections were incubated with Verhoeff’s dyestuff (Goodbio Biotechnology Company, Hubei Province, China), followed by 2  % ferric trichloride for 10 – 20  s. After washing in PBS and <b>redyeing</b> with Verhoeff’s dyestuff for 10 – 15  s, all sections were washed in ethyl alcohol and mounted under coverlips. The sections were evaluated using a microscope with a digital camera.|$|E
40|$|The plant {{pathogen}} basidiomycete S. rolfsii secretes two laccases (SRL 1 and SRL 2) with molecular weights of 55 and 86 kDa, respectively. Laccase production {{was shown to}} be inducible {{by the addition of}} 2, 5 -xylidine to the cultural media. After treatment with a combination of chitinase and - 1, 3 -glucanase, two different laccases were isolated from the sclerotia depending on the stage of sclerotia development. The more prominent laccase, SRL 1, was purified and found to decolourize the industrially important wool azo dye Diamond Black PV 200 without the addition of redox mediators. The enzyme (pI 5. 2) was active in the acidic pH range, showing an optimal activity at pH 2. 4, with ABTS as substrate. The optimum temperature for activity was determined to be 62 ◦C. Enzyme stability studies revealed that SRL 1 was notably stable at 18 ◦C and pH 4. 5, retaining almost full activity after a week. Oxidation of tyrosine was not detectable under the reaction conditions but the enzyme did oxidize a variety of the usual laccase substrates. SRL 1 was strongly inhibited by sodium azide and fluoride. Dye solutions decolourized with the immobilized laccase were successfully used for <b>redyeing...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Adjacent to {{his social}} and {{monetary}} ambitions were William Cavendish's tremendous literary ambitions, which he aspired toward {{in his own}} writings but homed in on most thoroughly by developing relationships {{with a wide range}} of poets and playwrights including Ben Jonson, Thomas Shadwell, and John Dryden. Because of her father's literary and political connections, Jane's world was—from the start—replete in the excesses that typified Charles I's court. She had a number of elegant gowns, many made of sumptuous velvets, and a fine collection of garments and linens. More significant than these signs of her social standing, however, are some early traces of her literary development. In one of her father's manuscript books (now University of Nottingham MSS Portland Collection, Pw V 25:21-22), Jane responded to her father's couplet [...] "Sweet Jane / I know you are a rare Inditer.— / And hath the Pen off a moste <b>redye</b> writer. / W.N." [...] with the following lines: [...] "My Lord / I know you doo but Jest with mee / & so in obdence I right this nothing / Jane Cavendysshe." [...] It is worth noting that although William wrote similar couplets to each of his children, only Jane and one of her brothers recorded a response—and Jane’s is by far the cleverer of the two. Her father’s assessment of her as “a moste <b>redye</b> writer” carried over into her adult life, when she collaborated with her sister on some literary documents and also wrote her own poetry.|$|R
5000|$|During {{approximately}} {{the same time period}} the Platinum IIe was being produced (1987), Apple released an alternative machine for the European market. It re-used the original Apple IIe case mold and keyboard, however both <b>redyed</b> in the platinum color scheme—including metal ID badges which were recolored from dark grey to platinum, blending them into the case lid. Additionally, the sticker over the keyboard power indicator was labeled [...] "65C02" [...] rather than [...] "Enhanced". Internally it used the same (newer) motherboard found in the Platinum IIe with reduced chip count. Notably absent is the numeric keypad and standardized keyboard layout found on the Platinum IIe.|$|R
50|$|Later that day, {{the girls}} arrived {{back at the}} model mansion - where it was {{revealed}} {{to them that they}} would be sent off to Miami for the final stages of the competition. All the girls became extremely excited as they began to pack their belongings. As they started to pack up, Paul (the stylist from the makeovers) came over to the house, and told Anastasija that although Elle and the judges initially wanted her hair to remain pink, it would be <b>redyed</b> blonde for the new destination. When the girls arrived at the airport, Anastasija's passport was rejected - and she was left behind in England, while Jessica, Imogen, Juste and Jade moved on.|$|R
40|$|The Japanese kesa or kasaya in Sanskrit, {{originated}} in India in 4 th century BC as a robe for the devotees of Buddha Sakyamuni. Created in the brick-like {{pattern of the}} Asian rice-field, the original kasaya were constructed of discarded fabric that was cleansed, (<b>redyed</b> and stitched together with prayers as a devotional act. When Buddhism came to (Japan in the 6 th century AD the kesa followed, a treasured manifestation of the Buddhist dharma. One of the earliest extant Japanese kesa, composed of seven layers of silk, in nine vibrant colors, bound together with tiny stitches belonged to Emperor Shomu (701 - 756 AD, and is still housed in the Nara Shoso-in Repository. While kesa are unfamiliar to many outside of the Buddhist community, {{they are in the}} collections of many museums outside of Japan. Five US museums have holdings of 100 kesa or more (MFA Boston, RISD, Metropolitan, Yale University and the Nelson-Atkins Museum). As a fiber artist living in Japan for more than 18 years, I enjoyed the opportunity of basing my studio work on Japanese textile research. In 1999 I began a project to create a contemporary kesa for each of the seven continents in the proscribed manner of the Buddhist tradition. With extensive research and planning, seven robes were created from layers of Asian silk, using the resist dye technique of roketsu-zome as well as shishu (embroidery), kata-kinsai (stenciled gold powders) and quilting. The seven kesa I created were sent to sites on each continent where they were introduced as a contemporary form of a 2500 year old tradition. They were worn at the millennium in ceremonies of healing, unity and peace and continue now as a traveling exhibition...|$|R
