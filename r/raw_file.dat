2500|$|Photographers {{control the}} camera and lens to [...] "expose" [...] the light {{recording}} material to the required amount of light to form a [...] "latent image" [...] (on plate or film) or <b>RAW</b> <b>file</b> (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image. Digital cameras use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.|$|E
5000|$|This {{standard}} has {{not been}} adopted by most camera manufacturers - Exif/DCF is the current industry standard file organisation system which uses the Exchangeable image file format. However, TIFF/EP provided {{a basis for the}} raw image formats of a number of cameras. One example is Nikon's NEF <b>raw</b> <b>file</b> format, which uses the tag TIFF/EPStandardID (with value 1.0.0.0). Adobe's DNG (Digital Negative) <b>raw</b> <b>file</b> format was based on TIFF/EP, and the DNG specification states [...] "DNG... is compatible with the TIFF-EP standard". Several cameras use DNG as their <b>raw</b> <b>file</b> format, so in that limited sense they use TIFF/EP too.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Raw</b> <b>files</b> {{contain the}} {{information}} {{required to produce}} a viewable image from the camera's sensor data. The structure of <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> often follows a common pattern: ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{decoding}} - {{image data}} of <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> are typically encoded for compression purpose, but also often for obfuscation purpose (e.g. <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> from Canon or Nikon cameras).|$|R
5000|$|Sinar now uses DNG as the <b>raw</b> <b>file</b> {{standard}} for their eMotion series of digital backs.|$|E
5000|$|Will {{play the}} <b>raw</b> <b>file</b> [...] "foobar" [...] as a 22050-Hz, mono, 8-bit, mu-law [...]au file.|$|E
50|$|When {{a camera}} saves a <b>raw</b> <b>file</b> it defers {{most of this}} processing; {{typically}} the only processing performed is the removal of defective pixels (the DNG specification requires that defective pixels are removed before creating the file). Some camera manufacturers do additional processing before saving raw files; for example, Nikon has been criticized by astrophotographers for applying noise reduction before saving the <b>raw</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
50|$|Camera Raw version 3.0 {{was a new}} {{addition}} in CS2, and it allowed settings for multiple <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> to be modified simultaneously. In addition, processing multiple <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> to other formats including JPEG, TIFF, DNG or PSD, {{could be done in}} the background without executing Photoshop itself.|$|R
30|$|To display <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> {{that are}} the decoder's outputs, the <b>raw</b> <b>files</b> should be {{transformed}} into RGB files. This work conducts float computations in pixel units. Therefore, no differences in the complexity between frames are caused by the transformation work in general cases where images of the same frame size are continued.|$|R
