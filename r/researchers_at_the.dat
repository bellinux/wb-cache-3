5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Scripps Institution of Oceanography {{concluded}} that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere.

5|$|This {{problem has}} been the object of growing concern. For example, <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Hohenheim are {{studying}} how bees can be poisoned by exposure to seed disinfectants. In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an expert group, the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. <b>Researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002.

5|$|A {{study by}} <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) found that growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could {{increase}} farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop {{because it can}} provide food, feed and fuel. With grain sorghum currently grown on over 11 million hectares (ha) in Asia and on 23.4 million ha in Africa, a switch to sweet sorghum could have a considerable economic impact.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, <b>{{researchers}}</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston {{found that}} plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Nations {{considered}} more peaceful have lower index scores. Countries with rankings in green {{are in the}} most peaceful 20% for that year; those in red are in the bottom 20%. In 2013 <b>researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Institute for Economics and Peace harmonized the Global Peace Index database {{to ensure that the}} scores were comparable over time. Several countries have been removed since 2008 {{due to the fact that}} the compilers agreed that the GPI would include nations, but not micro-states. Now, countries covered by the GPI must either have a population of more than 1 million or a land area greater than 20,000 square kilometers.|$|E

5|$|New {{materials}} {{may make}} even better collectors. One such material {{is inspired by}} the Namib Desert beetle, which survives only on the moisture it extracts from the atmosphere.

5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
