We have conducted a content analysis of the personal case studies with male assault offenders {{in the range of}} 18 - 23 years old. The study showed that the suspects of foreign background were presented differently in comparison to the suspects of Swedish background. The differences were noticeable foremost in the description of the suspects relationship to family and friends, but also in the description of the suspects possible criminal values. The personal case studies differed {{in the way that the}} suspects of Swedish background had more of a detailed description of relationships to family and friends, but they were also given the opportunity to value their own experience of their relationships. While the description of relationships to the suspects of foreign background consisted more of a mapping of family members and friends with no description of how the suspect experienced the relationships. The presentation of the suspects possible criminal values differed in the way that in the personal case studies of the suspects of Swedish background included a professional statement about their non-criminal values, but the suspects of foreign background had no such statement nor that they had criminal values. Although this haven´t affected the final statement that the probation officer has done. We have argued that the lack of <b>relationship</b> <b>description</b> and statement of criminal values had made the presentation of the foreign suspect as someone who could be perceived as an impersonal stranger with unknown criminal values where preconceived ideas can grow and lead to stigmatizing processes...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the role of {{attributions}} {{in the context of}} dating relationships. A large sample completed a questionnaire comprising structured ratings and a free-response <b>relationship</b> <b>description.</b> As expected, cognitive or attributional activity was more frequent within relationships when they were in the early stages, when important choice points or changes were occurring, and when the relationships were perceived as unstable. Also as predicted, subjects who reported higher relationship happiness, commitment, and love for their partners tended to describe the relationship in more interpersonal terms, to rate the causal inputs of the partners as equal, and to attribute lower external attributions for relationship maintenance. Finally, some evidence was obtained that attributions for relationship maintenance are causally related to relationship happiness over a 2 -month period. The results are discussed in terras of the relationship between cognitive processing and the development of dating relationships. Love and intimate relationships are of central importance in people's lives. Hence {{it is hardly surprising that}} on occasions we invest considerable cognitive activity in evaluating the personal-ities of our prospective partners, predicting the future of our relationships, trying to understand why they are deteriorating or becoming more successful, and so on. In recent years, particular interest has focused on the role that causal attribution processes play in close relationships (for reviews see Berley & Jacobson, 1984; Fincham, 1983, 1985 a; Newman & Langer, in press). Two important and related ques-tions often arise in this field: When do attributions spontane-ously occur in relationships, and what influence do attributions have on such factors as relationship happiness, commitment, or love for one's partner? This study deals with both questions by using a large sample of persons involved in current dating rela-tionships and examining these relationships over time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background TEM β-lactamases are {{the main}} cause for {{resistance}} against β-lactam antibiotics. Sequence information about TEM β-lactamases is mainly found in the NCBI peptide database and TEM mutation table at [URL]. While the TEM mutation table is manually curated by experts in the lactamase field, who guarantee reliable and consistent information, the rapidly growing sequence and annotation information from the NCBI peptide database is sometimes inconsistent. Therefore, the Lactamase Engineering Database has been developed to collect the TEM β-lactamase sequences from the NCBI peptide database and the TEM mutation table, systematically compare sequence information and naming, identify inconsistencies, and thus provide a versatile tool for reconciliation of data and for {{an investigation of the}} sequence-function <b>relationship.</b> <b>Description</b> The LacED currently provides 2399 sequence entries and 37 structure entries. Sequence information on 150 different TEM β-lactamases was derived from the TEM mutation table which provides a unique number to each protein classified as TEM β-lactamase. 293 TEM-like proteins were found in the NCBI protein database, but only 113 TEM β-lactamase were common to both data sets. The 180 TEM β-lactamases from the NCBI protein database which have not yet been assigned to a TEM number fall in three classes: (1) 89 proteins from microbial organisms and 35 proteins from cloning or expression vectors had a new mutation profile; (2) 55 proteins had inconsistent annotation in terms of TEM assignment or reported mutation profile; (3) 39 proteins are fragments. The LacED is web accessible at [URL] and contains multisequence alignments, structure information and reconciled annotation of TEM β-lactamases. The LacED is weekly updated and supplies all data for download. Conclusion The Lactamase Engineering Database enables a systematic analysis of TEM β-lactamase sequence and annotation data from different data sources, and thus provides a valuable tool to identify inconsistencies in sequences from the NCBI peptide database, to detect TEM β-lactamases with a novel mutation profile, and to identify new amino acid positions at which mutations can occur. </p...|$|E

Their interrelationship {{was influenced by}} mostly events that were connected with a change of international environment in the 90 ?s, but also by recent affairs. The primary aim of our work was to analyze factors which affected the mutual relation. The aim of the work was not providing a comprehensive and exhaustive analysis, but rather {{a focus on the}} main factors that determined the relationship between the OSCE and Russia. As our work shows, in the past the OSCE and Russia could work together constructively, e. g. during the Estonia issue. In most cases, however, the OSCE and the Russian Federation stand in different positions, even though Russia is a full and important member of the OSCE. Nevertheless, our work presented us on several examples {{it is not easy to}} generalize this relation and find some short definition of their relation. The relation of OSCE and Russia is more or less different from case to case. It usually depends on Russia's political and economic interests in the area. Then Russia?s behavior is pragmatic and regards to their own interests and cooperates with the OSCE at a level that suits him. The Kremlin's relation to this organization is not static but it has been evolving because the relationship is a dynamic entity. Therefore, this topic deserves further study for it is a very interesting subject. In the beginning we had set ourselves to find a suitable description of the relation between the Kremlin and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. As we noted above, this relation is very complicated and it?s impossible to describe it with one or a few words. But despite the need for more comprehensive definition of their relation form, we can say that we managed, on the basis of mutual interaction examination, to find a satisfactory form of <b>relationship</b> <b>description</b> and that the main aim of the thesis has been fulfilled...|$|E

Each theasurus is treated as a knowledge base, containing information both in the terms and in the various types of relationships between terms. DynaSaurI uses combinations of string matching and tree browsing to propose a ranked array of related MeSH terms for each SNOMED term presented. A medical expert selected the closest match from the array of terms proposed by DynaSaurI and entered the appropriate type of relationship between the terms. The information acquired from the expert was then used to refine DynaSaurI's mapping rules.
