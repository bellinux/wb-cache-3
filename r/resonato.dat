We show that nonlinear frequency responses can be exploited to identify {{not only the}} Q-factor and the natural frequency of a resonator, but also information about its internal structure. The proposed method requires less demanding measurements and is less model-dependent than the existing state-of-the-art methods. Its accuracy is illustrated with simulations and it is experimentally validated on a capacitive MEMS <b>resonato...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{new method}} for {{enhancing}} the 2. 1 VSWR impedance bandwidth of microstrip antennas is presented. Bandwidth enhancement {{is achieved by}} loading the microstrip antenna by a ceramic microwave dielectric resonator (DR). The validity of this technique has been estab-lished using rectangular and circular radiating geometries. This method improves the bandwidth of a rectangular microstrip antenna to more than 10 % (= 5 times that of a conventional rectangular microstrip antenna) with an enhanced gain of I dB. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|A novel {{scheme for}} {{implementation}} of all-optical NOT logic gate based on photonic crystal ring resonator has been proposed. Photonic crystal {{is comprised of}} two-dimensional square lattice of dielectric rods in air substrate. Indium phosphide with a refractive index of 3. 1 is adopted as the material of the rods. The finite different time domain (FDTD) and plane wave Expansion (PWE) methods are {{used to analyze the}} behavior of the structure. The simulation results show that the contrast ratio is 10. 97 dB for NOT gate. Moreover, the operational wavelength of the input ports is 1. 55 µm. Since the structure has a simple geometric shape with clear operating principle, it is potentially applicable for photonic integrated circuits.

40|$|Abstract- The {{attractive}} {{features of}} the Finite-Volume Time-Domain (FVTD) method for the solution of Maxwell’s equations come from the application in unstructured polyhedral meshes combined with an explicit time stepping. This paper reviews current developments of the FVTD method and provides an assessment of its potential as a general-purpose electromagnetic simulation technique. A tutorial on the FVTD algorithm is given first, followed by {{a discussion of the}} strengths {{as well as of the}} limitations of the method. More generally, the challenges associated with a widespread use of conformal time-domain techniques are described. The addressed points are illustrated by a representative application of the method, which involves the detailed modelling of dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) in several configurations.

40|$|Abstract—We report {{simulations}} {{and experimental}} results of THz QCLs with quasi-periodic resonators {{based on a}} Fibonacci sequence. Terahertz quantum cascade lasers were first demonstrated in 2002 [1] and have since undergone rapid development. One {{of the most active}} areas of reasearch into these devices has been the development of devices emitting in a single longitudinal mode through the use of distributed feedback (DFB) resonators. Because the optical mode in these devices arises through a surface plasmon, it is possible to implement them with periodically arranged slits in the top metallisation. These have been demonstrated for both single- and double-metal waveguides [2],[3],[4]. Since the patterns are easily defined with optical contact lithography, this system is well suited to study novel <b>resonato...</b>|$|E
40|$|New {{experimental}} {{possibilities of}} investigating layered magnetic structures in oscillating magnetic fields are discussed. Spin flip and nonspin flip neutron reflection and transmission probabilities show a frequency dependency near the magnetic neutron resonance condition. This allows {{to increase the}} precision of the static magnetic depth profile measurements of the magnetized matter. Moreover, this opens new possibilities of measuring the induction of the oscillating field inside the matter and determining the magnetic susceptibility of the oscillating magnetic field. Refraction of neutrons as they pass through a magnetic prism {{in the presence of}} an oscillating magnetic field is also investigated. A non polarized neutron beam splits into eight spatially separated neutron beams, whose intensity and polarization depend on the strength and frequency of the oscillating field. Also, it is shown that the oscillating magnetic permeability of an angstrom thick layer can be measured with a neutron wave <b>resonato...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design and test of a {{miniature}} coupled bistable vibration energy harvester. Operation of a bistable structure largely depends on vibration amplitude rather than frequency, which makes it very promising for wideband vibration energy harvesting applications. A coupled bistable structure consists {{of a pair of}} mobile magnets that create two potential wells and thus the bistable phenomenon. It requires lower excitation to trigger bistable operation compared to conventional bistable structures. Based on previous research, this work focused on miniaturisation of the coupled bistable structure for energy harvesting application. The proposed bistable energy harvester is a combination of a Duffing’s nonlinear structure and a linear assisting resonator. Experimental results show that the output spectrum of the miniature coupled bistable vibration energy harvester was the superposition of several spectra. It had a higher maximum output power and a much greater bandwidth compared to simply the Duffing’s structure without the assisting <b>resonato...</b>|$|E
40|$|The U- 70 RF {{system was}} worked out {{to operate with}} the {{injector}} - linac at 100 MeV energy. A wide RF range was (2. 6 - 6. 1) MHz. For the U- 70 injector Booster the wide RF range decreased {{and now it is}} (5. 5 - 6. 1) MHz. This fact and simplest method of changing the parameters in RF ferrite dominated cavities allow one to increase of the equivalent value of the cavity capacitance for the main frequency by about a factor of 2. 7 and increase {{of the value of the}} cavity gap capacitance by about a factor of 5 [1]. The experimental investigation of the U- 70 RF cavities due to the injection of bunches from the Booster into the U- 70 orbit, near transition and on main flat-top is presented. I.
