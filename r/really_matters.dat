5|$|The {{concept and}} origin of Burnt Norton is {{connected}} to Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. The poem discusses the idea {{of time and the}} concept that only the present moment <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that <b>really</b> <b>matters,</b> because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a [...] "strange, electronic, {{slightly}} broken noise" [...] that spans between {{the start of the}} song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, [...] "Nothing <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> / love is all we need / everything I give you / all comes back to me." [...] Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of what <b>really</b> <b>matters</b> during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has been anything but. Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E
