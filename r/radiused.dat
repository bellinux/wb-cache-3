5|$|The Baths {{were built}} around hot springs, {{the only ones}} {{naturally}} occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool {{in the corner of the}} temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300years. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass-domed centre and single-storey <b>radiused</b> corner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Abrasive flow {{machining}} (AFM) {{has become}} one of the more attractive finishing processes used in applications such as deburring, recast layer removal, <b>radiusing</b> as well as for polishing. Recently, there has been renewed interest in developing low cost / low pressure modular AFM systems and media. The media which contains the abrasive particles is the key element in ensuring efficient material removal and a good surface finish. In this paper, the authors will present their work on the development and characterization of a new abrasive media formulation...|$|R
2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with <b>radiused</b> corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw blade can tilt to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the blade tilts away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{shoulder}} <b>radiusing</b> and grooving (longitudinally and circumferentially) the afterbodies of bluff bodies {{to reduce the}} base drag at low speeds is investigated experimentally. Shoulder radii as large as 2. 75 body diameters are examined. Reynolds number (ReD) based on body diameter varied from 20, 000 to 200, 000. Results indicate that increasing the shoulder radius to 2. 00 body diameters can reduce the drag levels to those of a streamline body having 67 percent greater fineness ratio. For the relatively sharp shoulder case, body drag reductions as large as 50 and 33 percent are obtained using circumferential or longitudinal grooves, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{investigations}} on the abrasive jet machining (AJM) with output parameters as material removal rate (MRR), penetration rate and surface finish {{have been carried out}} and reported by various authors. But no detailed investigations are known to be carried out on the shape of the abrasive jet machined surface. Deburring, which includes the edge conditioning/shaping, offers a potential application area for AJM. In this paper, a semi-empirical equation is derived to obtain the shape of the surface generated in AJM. With the help of this equation, it is shown that the abrasive jet machined surface is reverse bell mouthed in shape with an edge radius at the entry side of the target surface. It is also observed that the entry side diameter increases with the input parameters. The effects of particle size, stand-off-distance, center line and peripheral velocities of the jet on the generated shape are also discussed in this paper. The result of this work was compared with the result of earlier abrasive jet deburring experimental work for edge <b>radiusing</b> and found satisfactory. © Elsevie...|$|R

40|$|The {{deburring}} of PM parts {{is commonly}} {{performed in a}} batch process. This typically involves loading a quantity of parts into a vibratory bowl filled with abrasive media. The vibration of the bowl causes the abrasive media, and parts, to “flow”. This interaction between the media and parts gradually abrades all surfaces of the part. Drawbacks to this process include part impingement upon one another, waste generation, lodging of media into the part, deburring of unnecessary areas on the part and the inherent vibration and noise created by the operation of these systems. This paper discusses an abrasive filament medium which is ideal for deburring and edge <b>radiusing</b> PM parts.

50|$|The {{fingerboard}} is {{a crucial}} part of the guitar. It is generally made up of ebony or rosewood. It is not flat in shape. At the one end of the fingerboard it has radius of 16, with this we achieve low action and also prevents buzz while string bending. At the other end of fingerboard, it has radius of 10 for the purpose of comfort. First of all, Design of fingerboard is prepared on some commercial software like,aspire. If it has some kind of additional aesthetic design, then how it will look like in reality, is interpreted. The aesthetic design is split and pieces, required for it, are sorted out in design. To get exact size and shape, separate design for pieces are prepared and code is generated. For precision work and repeatability, the cutting is done on cnc machine with the help of code. The cutting parameters are specified then pieces are cut. Also the <b>radiusing</b> is done on the fingerboard. Then pockets are generated on the fingerboard for the accommodation of pieces. Pieces are glued in the pockets. To get finish and removal of extra glue sanding is done on this. Wet wipe is done on this for cleaning and then oiling is done. After this fret slot cutting is done to put steel wire fret in that. At last nut pocket is generated for locking nut.|$|R
40|$|Mass {{finishing}} is {{amongst the}} most widely used finishing processes in modern manufacturing, in applications from deburring to edge <b>radiusing</b> and polishing. Processing objectives are varied, ranging from the cosmetic to the functionally critical. One such critical application is the hydraulically smooth polishing of aero engine component gas-washed surfaces. In this, and many other applications the drive to improve process control and finish tolerance is ever present. Considering its widespread use mass finishing has seen limited research activity, particularly with respect to surface characterization. The objectives of the current paper are to; characterise the mass finished stratified surface and its development process using areal surface parameters, provide guidance on the optimal parameters and sampling method to characterise this surface type for a given application, and detail the spatial variation in surface topography due to coupon edge shadowing. Blasted and peened square plate coupons in titanium alloy are wet (vibro) mass finished iteratively with increasing duration. Measurement fields are precisely relocated between iterations by fixturing and an image superimposition alignment technique. Surface topography development is detailed with ‘log of process duration’ plots of the ‘areal parameters for scale-limited stratified functional surfaces’, (the Sk family). Characteristic features of the Smr 2 plot are seen to map out the processing of peak, core and dale regions in turn. These surface process regions also become apparent in the ‘log of process duration’ plot for Sq, where lower core and dale regions are well modelled by logarithmic functions. Surface finish (Ra or Sa) with mass finishing duration is currently predicted with an exponential model. This model is shown to be limited for the current surface type at a critical range of surface finishes. Statistical analysis provides a group of areal parameters including; Vvc, Sq, and Sdq, showing optimal discrimination for a specific range of surface finish outcomes. As a consequence of edge shadowing surface segregation is suggested for characterization purposes...|$|R
