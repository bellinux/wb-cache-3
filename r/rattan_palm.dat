60|$|Purnea {{is a large}} station, and {{considered}} very unhealthy {{during and after the}} rains. From it the road passed through some pretty lanes, with groves of planted Guava and a <b>rattan</b> <b>palm</b> (Calamus), the first I had seen. Though no hills are nearer than the Himalaya, from the constant alteration of the river-beds, the road undulates remarkably for this part of India, and a jungly vegetation ensues, consisting of the above plants, with the yellow-flowered Cactus replacing the Euphorbias, which were previously much more common. Though still 100 miles distant from the hills, mosses appeared on the banks, and more ferns were just sprouting above ground.|$|E
60|$|At about 5000 feet {{the country}} is very open and bare, the ridges being so uniform and flat-topped, that the broad valleys they divide are hidden till their precipitous edges are reached; and the eye wanders far east and west over a desolate level grassy country, unbroken, save by the curious flat-topped hills I have {{described}} as belonging to the limestone formation, which lie to the south-west. These features continue for eight miles, when a sudden descent of 600 or 700 feet, leads into {{the valley of the}} Kala-panee (Black water) river, where there is a very dark and damp bungalow, which proved a very great accommodation to us.* [It may be of use to the future botanist in this country to mention a small wood on the right of this road, near the village of Surureem, as an excellent botanical station: the trees are chiefly Rhododendron arboreum, figs, oaks, laurels, magnolias, and chestnuts, on whose limbs are a profusion of Orchideae, and amongst which a <b>Rattan</b> <b>palm</b> occurs.|$|E

30|$|Rattan, {{which are}} {{centered}} in their distribution on the Sunda Shelf (Whitmore 1984), were an {{important feature of}} the studied forest, reaching densities of 83.3 individuals (apparent genets) per hectare. Although this density is much lower than in West Malaysia (115 clumps/ ha, Abdul Hamid and Suratman 2010) or Sulawesi (314 mature genets/ha, Siebert 2005), rattan diversity (10 species in this study) was higher than in East Malaysia (6 species, Putz and Chai 1987) and similarly high in West Malaysia (11 species, Abdul Hamid and Suratman 2010). Apart from <b>rattan,</b> <b>palm</b> trees were a common element in the forest, as already noticed for Central Siberut before (Whitten 1982 d), reaching relatively high densities (Oncosperma horridum: 52.3 palms ≥ 10  cm dbh/ha, Arenga obtusifolia: 17.3 palms ≥ 5  cm dbh/ha or 9.7 palms ≥ 10  cm dbh/ha). They are no indicator of disturbance, as they are common in primary forests (Laumonier 1997). Densities of other species which are more light demanding and thus common in secondary forests (Kochummen et al. 1990) were all low or average, thus there was no floristic indication for disturbances in the plots (Endospermum malaccensis, Euphorbiaceae: 2.3 trees/ha, Dillenia obovata, Dilleniaceae: 3.0 trees/ha, Macaranga sp, Euphorbiaceae: 0.7 trees/ha, Campnosperma auriculatum, Anacardiaceae: 1 tree/ha; compared to a mean of all tree species of 2.7 trees/ha, or the maximum density of 20.3 trees/ha of Vatica pallida, Dipterocarcpaceae).|$|E

40|$|The {{data used}} in this paper have been mainly {{collected}} during prolonged investigations of the forest fauna of Java, {{particularly with regard to}} insect species of some economic or silvicultural importance (see KALSHOVEN, 1955). This explains why some special {{attention has been paid to}} weevils damaging the <b>rattan</b> <b>palms,</b> a source of very valuable secondary forest produce in the East, as well as to those living on the bamboos, often growing wild or semi-wild in the forests, and to certain species occurring on Zingiberaceae, which plants are such a common feature of the oriental forest vegetation. These investigations formed only a side-line of the programme of forest entomological work and inevitably only yielded fragmentary data, but they could be supplemented to some extent with information found in the files of the former ”Instituut voor Plantenziekten” (Institute for Plant diseases and Pests) at Bogor. Moreover the literature was extensively searched for additional data from neighbouring countries. The identification of the collected species mainly dates from the year 1936 and was much furthered by the cooperation of Mr. F. C. DRESCHER, the diligent and successful collector of Coleoptera, who lived at Bandung at the time (LIEFTINCK, 1958). Mr. DRESCHER had recently submitted most of his Rhynchophorine material to Dr. K. GUENTHER at Dresden, Germany, who specialized in the group and published a few papers on its Indomalayan representatives. Mr. DRESCHER sent us a list of some 74 different species, mostly of Javanese and Sumatran origin, in his collection, adding a few notes on the host-plants so far observed by him or reported by his native collectors. Exchange of specimens with known hosts also took place. Recently I studied the Rhynchophorinae in the museum at Amsterdam, which possesses Mr. DRESCHER’S captures during the first period of his residence in Java. These have not been seen by GUENTHER but a great number have been identified by K. M. HELLER, the well known specialist on oriental Curculionidae. I also studied the material at the Leiden Museum, Where the rich VETH collection of Indomalayan Coleoptera is kept. As a further introduction some general remarks on the Rhynchophorinae of <b>rattan</b> <b>palms</b> and bamboos in Java may precede the survey of ecological details on the individual species...|$|R
25|$|Like {{many other}} plants, palms have been {{threatened}} by human intervention and exploitation. The greatest risk to palms is destruction of habitat, {{especially in the}} tropical forests, due to urbanization, wood-chipping, mining, and conversion to farmland. Palms rarely reproduce after such great changes in the habitat, and those with small habitat ranges are most vulnerable to them. The harvesting of heart of palm, a delicacy in salads, also poses a threat because it {{is derived from the}} palm's apical meristem, {{a vital part of the}} palm that cannot be regrown (except in domesticated varieties, e.g. of peach palm). The use of <b>rattan</b> <b>palms</b> in furniture has caused a major population decrease in these species that has negatively affected local and international markets, as well as biodiversity in the area. The sale of seeds to nurseries and collectors is another threat, as the seeds of popular palms are sometimes harvested directly from the wild. At least 100 palm species are currently endangered, and nine species have reportedly recently become extinct.|$|R
40|$|Forest {{people in}} southeastern Borneo are {{producing}} both rattan used for making baskets, 'cane' furniture, etc and food by shifting cultivation without harming the environment, {{according to a}} report by Joseph Weinstock, published in Ecodevelopment News by the International Research Center on Environment and Development (ClRED) in Paris. This production system is used by the Luangan Dayaks, who clear a section of forest, burn it and plant their crops. After being used for food crop production for one or two years, the land is allowed to regenerate into forest. But before they leave, the Luanga traditionally plant climbing <b>rattan</b> <b>palm</b> trees. Seven to 15 years later,when the land is ready to be used again, the farmer returns not to unproductive forest but to a mature rattan garden. The rattan is then harvested for home use or for sale, and the forest is again cut and burned and made ready to host rice and other food crops. Rattan grows naturally in rainforests, but the planting of rattan seeds and seedlings ensures that rattan gets a head start and dominates the less desirable jungle flora.

60|$|The chief {{feature of}} this forest was the {{abundance}} of <b>rattan</b> <b>palms</b> hanging from the trees, and turning and twisting about on the ground, often in inextricable confusion. One wonders at first how they can get into such queer shapes; but it is evidently caused by the decay {{and fall of the}} trees up which they have first climbed, after which they grow along the ground until they meet with another trunk up which to ascend. A tangled mass of twisted living rattan, is therefore, a sign that at some former period a large tree has fallen there, though there may be not the slightest vestige of it left. The rattan seems to have unlimited powers of growth, and a single plant may mount up several trees in succession, and thus reach the enormous length they are said sometimes to attain. They much improve the appearance of a forest as seen from the coast; for they vary the otherwise monotonous tree-tops with feathery crowns of leaves rising clear above them, and each terminated by an erect leafy spike like a lightning-conductor.|$|R

Polynomial models of second order explained 59 and 32 % of species richness and density with the factor elevation, respectively. A majority of rattan species (65 %) overlapped between 1000 and 1100 m elevation, while a pronounced change in the rattan flora occurred above 1100 m. Commercially important rattan species (Calamus zollingeri, C. ornatus var. celebicus, Daemonorops macroptera) were not observed above 1250 m. The change of species assemblage {{was significantly related to}} elevation (56 %), followed by geographical distance (47 %) and precipitation (40 %).
