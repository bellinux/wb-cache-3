5|$|Although Gillis was not {{exclusively}} used on Post covers, the Willie Gillis series of covers was {{a hallmark of}} <b>Rockwell's</b> wartime work. In <b>Rockwell's</b> prime and {{at the peak of}} its popularity, the Post had a subscribership of 4 million, and many of these subscribers believed Gillis was a real person. <b>Rockwell's</b> wartime art, including Willie Gillis, the Four Freedoms and Rosie the Riveter, contributed {{to the success of the}} wartime bond sales efforts.|$|R

5|$|Prior to McCarran Airport, {{the first}} airport to serve Las Vegas was Anderson Field, opened in November 1920 {{southeast}} of present-day Sahara Ave and Paradise Rd. Purchased by the <b>Rockwell</b> brothers in 1925, the airfield was renamed <b>Rockwell</b> Field, and Western Air Express (WAE) introduced {{commercial air service}} in April 1926. When the brothers sold <b>Rockwell</b> Field and the new owner canceled WAE's lease, the airline had to look for another airport. Local businessman P. A. Simon had built an airfield northeast of the city, now known as Nellis Air Force Base, to which WAE relocated in November 1929.|$|E

5|$|The FBI raid {{led to the}} {{formation}} of Colorado's first special grand jury, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which <b>Rockwell</b> admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the GAO, and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and <b>Rockwell</b> the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. While any criminal penalties allotted to <b>Rockwell</b> would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers, <b>Rockwell</b> claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws, including hazardous waste.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving NASA in 1985, Lunney took a {{position}} at <b>Rockwell</b> International, the contractor responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of the space shuttle. At first he worked in California, managing a <b>Rockwell</b> division that was building satellites for the Global Positioning System; this was his first experience with unmanned spacecraft. In 1990, he returned to Houston as President of the <b>Rockwell</b> Space Operations Company, which provided support for flight operations at Johnson Space Center and employed about 3000 people. For Lunney, this represented a return to his roots in mission operations, which he had left twenty years before.|$|E

5|$|A {{class action}} lawsuit, Cook v. <b>Rockwell</b> International Corp., was filed in January 1990 against <b>Rockwell</b> and Dow Chemical (due to the {{indemnity}} of nuclear contractors, the award {{would have been}} paid by the federal government). Sixteen years later, the plaintiffs were awarded $926 million in economic damages, punitive damages, and interest. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently threw out the verdict and ordered a retrial. A further appeal was rejected without comment by the United States Supreme Court in June 2012.|$|E

5|$|From 1916 {{through his}} John F. Kennedy {{memorial}} cover on December 16, 1963, <b>Rockwell</b> created 321 magazine covers for the Post, {{which was the}} most popular American magazine {{of the first half of}} the 20th century with a subscribership that reached a peak of 4 million. <b>Rockwell</b> illustrated American life during World War I and World War II in 34 of his cover illustrations, and he illustrated 33 Post covers in total during World War II. Some of the war art involved American life. During much of the first half of the 1940s, Rockwell's cover illustrations focused on the human side of the war. <b>Rockwell</b> encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II by means of his covers that endorsed war bonds, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service. His World War II illustrations used themes of patriotism, longing, shifting gender roles, reunion, love, work, community and family during wartime to promote the war. In his role as a magazine illustrator during times of war, <b>Rockwell</b> draws comparisons to Winslow Homer, an American Civil War illustrator for Harper's Weekly. Rockwell's artistic expressions were said to have helped the adoption of the goal of the Four Freedoms as set forth by United States President Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address. His painting series, the Four Freedoms, toured in a war bond effort that raised $132 million.|$|E

5|$|On May 24, 1942, <b>Rockwell</b> {{was seeking}} {{approval}} for a poster design at The Pentagon because the Artists Guild had designated that he advocate for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. Robert Patterson, who was then United States Undersecretary of War, suggested revisions. On the same day, he visited with Thomas Mabry of the Graphic Division of the War Department's Office of Facts and Figures, which coordinated war-themed posters and billboards. Mabry relayed the need for Four Freedoms artwork. <b>Rockwell</b> returned home pondering the Atlantic Charter, which had incorporated the Four Freedoms.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} trip to Vermont with Schaeffer on June 16, they stopped in Philadelphia {{to meet with}} new Saturday Evening Post editor Ben Hibbs.

A June 24 correspondence from The Post clarified that both Rockwell's and Schaeffer's series would be published. By June 26, The Posts art editor James Yates notified <b>Rockwell</b> of plans for a layout of paintings with an accompanying essay or accompanying essays by President Roosevelt.|$|E
