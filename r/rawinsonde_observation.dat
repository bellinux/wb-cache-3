40|$|April 1960 for a {{detailed}} analysis of the structure of a cold front. They attempted to show that the important temperature changes at upper levels occurred several hours following the passage of the front at the earth’s surface and that the cooling extended nearly vertically throughout most of the troposphere. The structure of this so-called “main front ” was inferred primarily from information given by a sounding made at 2112 GMT on April 5, 1960. It is the purpose of this note to question the reliability of this sounding and, in turn, the reality of the frontal structure described by Schwerdtfeger and S trommen. The <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observation</b> released at Bedford at 2 f 12 GMT, April 5, 1960 showed a cooling from the previous hour of over 4 O C. through most of the layer from 1000 t...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work done}} by the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) to add composite soundings to the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS). This allows National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters to compare the current atmospheric state with climatology. In a previous phase, the AMU created composite soundings for four <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observation</b> stations in Florida, for each of eight flow regimes. The composite soundings were delivered to the NWS Melbourne (MLB) office for display using the NSHARP software program. NWS MLB requested that the AMU make the composite soundings available for display in AWIPS. The AMU first created a procedure to customize AWIPS so composite soundings could be displayed. A unique four-character identifier was created {{for each of the}} 32 composite soundings. The AMU wrote a Tool Command Language/Tool Kit (TcVTk) software program to convert the composite soundings from NSHARP to Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format. The NetCDF files were then displayable by AWIPS...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{emphasis of}} this research was to develop a technique which would be a significant improvement over those currently used for flight planning to avoid clear air turbulence (CAT). The technique should, ideally, be both quantitative in determining potential intensity and specific in locating regions of relatively high risk. Furthermore, it should not rely on specialized data but be functional using the currently available <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observation</b> (raob) system. Encouraging results documented in an earlier investigation were considered compelling enough to warrant a closer look into the possibilities of a Specific Clear Air Turbulence Risk (SCATR) index approach to the clear air turbulence problem. Unlike that research, which considered sustained periods of flight in light to moderate clear air turbulence, this study focuses on several cases of documented severe CAT. Results of these case studies suggest that a SCATR index is not an unrealizable goal and that uses of such an index, event in its current prototype level of development, are also apparent...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} task, the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) developed {{spatial and temporal}} climatologies of lightning occurrence based on eight atmospheric flow regimes. The AMU created climatological, or composite, soundings of wind speed and direction, temperature, and dew point temperature at four <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observation</b> stations at Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, {{for each of the}} eight flow regimes. The composite soundings were delivered to the National Weather Service (NWS) Melbourne (MLB) office for display using the National version of the Skew-T Hodograph analysis and Research Program (NSHARP) software program. The NWS MLB requested the AMU make the composite soundings available for display in the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), so they could be overlaid on current observed soundings. This will allow the forecasters to compare {{the current state of the}} atmosphere with climatology. This presentation describes how the AMU converted the composite soundings from NSHARP Archive format to Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format, so that the soundings could be displayed in AWl PS. The NetCDF is a set of data formats, programming interfaces, and software libraries used to read and write scientific data files. In AWIPS, each meteorological data type, such as soundings or surface observations, has a unique NetCDF format. Each format is described by a NetCDF template file. Although NetCDF files are in binary format, they can be converted to a text format called network Common data form Description Language (CDL). A software utility called ncgen is used to create a NetCDF file from a CDL file, while the ncdump utility is used to create a CDL file from a NetCDF file. An AWIPS receives soundings in Binary Universal Form for the Representation of Meteorological data (BUFR) format ([URL] and then decodes them into NetCDF format. Only two sounding files are generated in AWIPS per day. One file contains all of the soundings received worldwide between 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC, and the other includes all soundings between 1200 UTC and 0000 UTC. In order to add the composite soundings into AWIPS, a procedure was created to configure, or localize, AWIPS. This involved modifying and creating several configuration text files. A unique fourcharacter site identifier was created for each of the 32 soundings so each could be viewed separately. The first three characters were based on the site identifier of the observed sounding, while the last character was based on the flow regime. While researching the localization process for soundings, the AMU discovered a method of archiving soundings so old soundings would not get purged automatically by AWl PS. This method could provide an alternative way of localizing AWl PS for composite soundings. In addition, this would allow forecasters to use archived soundings in AWIPS for case studies. A test sounding file in NetCDF format was written in order to verify the correct format for soundings in AWIPS. After the file was viewed successfully in AWIPS, the AMU wrote a software program in the Tool Command Language/Tool Kit (Tcl/Tk) language to convert the 32 composite soundings from NSHARP Archive to CDL format. The ncgen utility was then used to convert the CDL file to a NetCDF file. The NetCDF file could then be read and displayed in AWIPS...|$|E

These cases were well-sampled by the regional rawinsonde network, highly instrumented aircraft, and extensive ground-based remote sensors at COF.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{algorithm is}} developed based on support vector regression (SVR) to estimate horizonal water vapor transport integrated through {{the depth of}} the atmosphere ((Theta)) over the global ocean from observations of surface wind-stress vector by QuikSCAT, cloud drift wind vector derived from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and geostationary satellites, and precipitable water from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I). The statistical relation is established between the input parameters (the surface wind stress, the 850 mb wind, the precipitable water, time and location) and the target data ((Theta) calculated from rawinsondes and reanalysis of numerical weather prediction model). The results are validated with independent daily <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations,</b> monthly mean reanalysis data, and through regional water balance. This study clearly demonstrates the improvement of (Theta) derived from satellite data using SVR over previous data sets based on linear regression and neural network. The SVR methodology reduces both mean bias and standard deviation comparedwith <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations.</b> It agrees better with observations from synoptic to seasonal time scales, and compare more favorably with the reanalysis data on seasonal variations. Only the SVR result can achieve the water balance over South America. The rationale of the advantage by SVR method and the impact of adding the upper level wind will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Several {{case studies}} are {{examined}} {{in an attempt}} to relate Visible infrared spin scan radiometers Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) water vapor channel radiance data to atmospheric moisture. Since the 6. 7 micrometer channel detects radiation emitted by atmospheric water vapor from a rather thick layer, a scheme is developed which weighted <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> of relative humidity in a similar manner. A comparison of the two fields (weighted relative humidity values from gridded <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> and the VAS water vapor image) indicates that even when mesoscale data are used, the technique only presented a smooth representation of the radiance field. This weighting function is dependent on both the temperature and moisture distribution of the atmosphere. Cross sections of relative humidity from the mesoscale rawinsondes are produced which sliced the water vapor imagery in particularly interesting regions (areas of high and low blackbody temperatures). Comparisons are then made between the cross sections and the variations in the VAS radiance data along the cross section line. Bright regions in the water vapor imagery (cold blackbody temperatures) are often associated with thin layers of high relative humidity or thick layers of only moderately moist air. The reverse also applies, i. e., dark regions (warm blackbody temperatures) in the imagery corresponded well with very dry regions in the cross sections...|$|R

40|$|The {{assumption}} that a rawinsonde balloon system may experience large {{changes in its}} rate of ascent, {{as compared to the}} average rate for the observation, while traversing a region of clear air turbulence is investigated. In a 5 -day period a well-defined region of turbulence, concentrated near a trough, progressed eastward for several successive synoptic <b>observations.</b> <b>Rawinsonde</b> ascensional rates are studied for 20 stations located within and outside this turbulent region for layers 2, 000 ft. to 2, 500 ft. thick between about 20, 000 ft. and 45, 000 ft. in altitude. Those <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> within the turbulent region show much larger ascensional rate changes between layers, compared to the average for the observation, than do those outside the turbulent region. Furthermore the observations showing these large variations progress eastward with time corresponding generally to the eastward motion of the turbulent region. A large change or variation is defined as one for which the change in ascensional rates between adjacent layers is 25 percent or greater of the average ascensional rate for the observation. This value is about 2. 5 times the standard deviation for the total population of these changes, about 2, 100 observations, and about four times the estimated standard deviation of the errors involved in the pertinent <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations.</b> This study is being extended to cover a larger portion of the United States for special clear air turbulence collection periods. If a relationship between clear air turbulence and large ascensional rate variations is established, {{it may be possible to}} use these data on a real time basis to detect and track clear air turbulence. 1...|$|R
40|$|Hyperspectral {{infrared}} sounder radiance data are assimilated into operational modeling systems however {{the process is}} computationally expensive and only approximately 1 % of available data are assimilated due to data thinning {{as well as the}} fact that radiances are restricted to cloud-free fields of view. In contrast, the number of hyperspectral infrared profiles assimilated is much higher since the retrieved profiles can be assimilated in some partly cloudy scenes due to profile coupling other data, such as microwave or neural networks, as first guesses to the retrieval process. As the operational data assimilation community attempts to assimilate cloud-affected radiances, {{it is possible that the}} use of retrieved profiles might offer an alternative methodology that is less complex and more computationally efficient to solve this problem. The NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center has assimilated hyperspectral infrared retrieved profiles into Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulations using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) System. Early research at SPoRT demonstrated improved initial conditions when assimilating Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) thermodynamic profiles into WRF (using WRF-Var and assigning more appropriate error weighting to the profiles) to improve regional analysis and heavy precipitation forecasts. Successful early work has led to more recent research utilizing WRF and GSI for applications including the assimilation of AIRS profiles to improve WRF forecasts of atmospheric rivers and assimilation of AIRS, Cross-track Infrared and Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS), and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) profiles to improve model representation of tropopause folds and associated non-convective wind events. Although more hyperspectral infrared retrieved profiles can be assimilated into model forecasts, one disadvantage is the retrieved profiles have traditionally been assigned the same error values as the <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> when assimilated with GSI. Typically, satellitederived profile errors are larger and more difficult to quantify than traditional <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> (especially in the boundary layer), so it is important to appropriately assign observation errors within GSI to eliminate potential spurious innovations and analysis increments that can sometimes arise when using retrieved profiles. The goal of this study is to describe modifications to the GSI source code to more appropriately assimilate hyperspectral infrared retrieved profiles and outline preliminary results that show the differences between a model simulation that assimilated the profiles as <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> and one that assimilated the profiles in a module with the appropriate error values...|$|R

40|$|Past {{attempts}} to assimilate precipitation by nudging or variational methods {{have succeeded in}} forcing the model precipitation {{to be close to}} the observed values. However, the model forecasts tend to lose their additional skill after a few forecast hours. In this study, a local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF) is used to effectively assimilate precipitation by allowing ensemble members with better precipitation to receive higher weights in the analysis. In addition, two other changes in the precipitation assimilation process are found to alleviate the problems related to the non-Gaussianity of the precipitation variable: (a) transform the precipitation variable into a Gaussian distribution based on its climatological distribution (an approach that could also be used in the assimilation of other non-Gaussian observations) and (b) only assimilate precipitation at the location where at least some ensemble members have precipitation. Unlike many current approaches, both positive and zero rain observations are assimilated effectively. Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are conducted using the Simplified Parametrisations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics (SPEEDY) model, a simplified but realistic general circulation model. When uniformly and globally distributed observations of precipitation are assimilated in addition to <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations,</b> both the analyses and the medium-range forecasts of all model variables, including precipitation, are significantly improved as compared to only assimilating <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations.</b> The effect of precipitation assimilation on the analyses is retained on the medium-range forecasts and is larger in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) than that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) because the NH analyses are already made more accurate by the denser rawinsonde stations. These improvements are much reduced when only the moisture field is modified by the precipitation observations. Both the Gaussian transformation and the new observation selection criterion are shown to be beneficial to the precipitation assimilation {{especially in the case of}} larger observation errors. Assigning smaller horizontal localisation length scales for precipitation observations further improves the LETKF analysis...|$|R

Severe weather reports and lightning network data from 1 January 1999 through 30 June 1999 were used to classify the weather at a set of Rapid-Update Cycle (RUC- 2) grid points into four weather categories.

However the analysis also shows that episodes occur fairly frequently where these layers contribute 20 % or more of the horizontal transport. Instances when the layer’s moisture {{is an important part of}} the water transport tend to occur for relatively dry soundings. Numerical models that fail to resolve the layers during these episodes may thus miss condensation events leading to cloud formation and precipitation, and also give overly smooth vertical profiles of radiative heating and cooling.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to investigate the atmospheric energy budget as related to cyclogenesis. Energy budget equations are developed that are shown to be advantageous because the individual terms represent basic physical processes which produce changes in atmospheric energy, and the equations provide a means to study {{the interaction of the}} cyclone with the larger scales of motion. The work presented represents an extension of previous studies because all of the terms of the energy budget equations were evaluated throughout the development period of the cyclone. Computations are carried out over a limited atmospheric volume which encompasses the cyclone, and boundary fluxes of energy that were ignored in most previous studies are evaluated. Two examples of cyclogenesis over the eastern United States were chosen for study. One of the cases (1 - 4 November, 1966) represented an example of vigorous development, while the development in the other case (5 - 8 December, 1969) was more modest. Objectively analyzed data were used in the evaluation of the energy budget terms in order to minimize computational errors, and an objective analysis scheme is described that insures that all of the resolution contained in the <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> is incorporated in the analyses...|$|R
40|$|Intraregional {{variability}} in tropospheric environments during freezing rain events is investigated for the South Central United States. National Weather Service (NWS) Automated Surface Observing Stations (ASOS) {{are used to}} detect the occurrence of freezing rain, and <b>rawinsonde</b> <b>observations</b> (RAOB) employed to analyze lower tropospheric vertical profiles of temperature, dew point temperature, wind, and layer thicknesses during these periods. The study area consists of seven 100 mile radius RAOB proximity sub-regions centered around Peachtree City Georgia, Nashville Tennessee, Birmingham Alabama, Jackson Mississippi, Shreveport Louisiana, Little Rock Arkansas, and Springfield Missouri. A series of difference of means tests are performed to determine if statistically significant differences exist in mean values of selected tropospheric variables during periods of freezing rain between adjacent RAOB sites to determine the character of intraregional variability within the South Central United States. Results of these tests suggest 5 sub-regions exist in which freezing rain events can be forecast based upon thresholds and ranges of lower tropospheric environmental variables. As a final step, flow charts are developed {{for each of the}} 5 subregions to aid meteorologists in forecasting freezing rain within the Southeast United States. Department of GeographyThesis (M.
