5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than four sections all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Al-Zawahiri {{was one of}} {{hundreds}} arrested following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. Initially, the plan was derailed when authorities were alerted to Al-Jihad's plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information, in February 1981. President Sadat ordered the <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> more than 1500 people, including many Al-Jihad members, but missed a cell in the military led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, who succeeded in assassinating Sadat during a military parade that October. His lawyer, Montasser el-Zayat, said that Zawahiri was tortured in prison.|$|E

She was pregnant, and Cobb later said that the father was Castro's bodyguard, Jesus Yanez Pelletier. Lorenz's mother later reported that Cobb had called her and offered her employment if she would return to Cuba with her daughter. Che Guevara conducted {{an investigation of the}} incident and Cobb was included in a <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> the suspects. She was protected by Castro and Sánchez, but the relationship cooled and she lost the access she had had before.|$|E

A <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> related research on Journalist's Resource, a project of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's John F.

Bennett Irwin, one of the cattlemen on the 1879 roundup into the Sandhills, had as early as 1884 began to file on land in a large valley {{to the west of}} Bean Soup Lake called the Home Valley. The Home Valley is {{at the beginning of a}} series of large valleys capable of producing many thousands of tons of hay, making it an ideal location for settlement and development of a ranch.|$|E
25|$|In August 1940 La Rocque began {{actively}} {{to participate}} in the Resistance, transmitting information to the British Secret Intelligence Service via Georges Charaudeau's Réseau Alibi ("Alibi Network"), and forming the Réseau Klan ("Klan Network") in 1942 as a means of coordinating intelligence-gathering activities among PSF members. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that he could convince Pétain to abandon his collaborationist line, to which end he requested, and was granted, three meetings with the Marshal in early 1943. Two days after their last meeting, on 9 March, La Rocque was arrested by the Gestapo during a nationwide <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> over one hundred PSF leaders. Deported first to Czechoslovakia and later to Austria, he returned to France only in May 1945.|$|E

5000|$|The blasts {{were said}} to have taken the Kuwaiti {{government}} [...] "completely by surprise" [...] and left it dumbfounded, terrified and shaken to their core that such a well-organized terrorist operation could have taken place under their noses.

25|$|Some accused {{war criminals}} were judged, some {{for a second}} time, from the 1980s onwards: Paul Touvier, Klaus Barbie, Maurice Papon, René Bousquet (the head of the French police during the war) and his deputy Jean Leguay. Bousquet and Leguay were both convicted for their {{responsibilities}} in the Vel' d'Hiv <b>Roundup</b> <b>of</b> July 1942. Among others, Nazi hunters Serge and Beate Klarsfeld spent part of their post-war effort trying to bring them before the courts. A fair number of collaborationists then joined the OAS terrorist movement during the Algerian War (1954–62). Jacques de Bernonville escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. Jacques Ploncard d'Assac became counsellor to the dictator António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|He {{received}} his first national exposure for his daily <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> the O.J. Simpson trial. After that, {{he continued to}} host his regular show on WLS (AM). Eventually he teamed up with Garry Meier to cohost the highly successful Roe & Garry Show. In 2004, amid an impasse in contract negotiations with the station, Meier did not renew his contract with WLS. Roe then became the sole host of the show, which also featured Jim Johnson and Christina Filiaggi. Many praise Roe Conn for having {{a good sense of}} humor and for being skilled at articulating his thoughts. In the spring 2006 ratings period, The Roe Conn Show became Chicago’s most listened-to radio talk show among adults.|$|E
25|$|Following the Velodrom d’Hiver <b>roundup</b> <b>of</b> Jews of July 15, 1942, the Northern {{assembly}} of cardinals and archbishops sent a protest letter to Pétain. With the free press silenced, Charles Lederman, a Jewish Communist approached the Archbishop of Toulouse, Jules-Géraud Saliège, to alert public opinion {{to what was}} being done to the Jews. He told Saliège of the arrests, kidnappings and deportations. Saliège read his famous Pastoral letter the following Sunday. Other bishops - Monseigneur Théas, Bishop of Montauban, , Bishop of Marseilles, Cardinal Gerlier, Archbishop of Lyon, Monseigneur Vansteenberghe of Bayonne and Monseigneur Moussaron, Archbishop of Albi - also denounced the roundups from the pulpit and through parish distributions, {{in defiance of the}} Vichy regime. The protest of the bishops is seen by various historians as {{a turning point in the}} formerly passive response of the Catholic Church in France.|$|E
50|$|The {{reprisals}} went {{much further}} as the Nazis conducted widespread <b>roundups</b> <b>of</b> Czechs, including {{the whole village}} of Lidice, then summarily killed the men and children, while they placed the women in concentration camps. The Orthodox churches in Moravia and Bohemia were closed and the Church forbidden to operate. Metropolitan Seraphim courageously refused to issue any statement condemning Bishop Gorazd. It {{was not until the}} end of the war that the Orthodox Church in Czechoslovakia would function again.|$|R

50|$|Drancy {{was under}} the control of the French police until 3 July 1943 when Germany took direct control of the Drancy camp.

In December 1941, 40 prisoners from Drancy were executed in retaliation for a French attack on German police officers.|$|R
