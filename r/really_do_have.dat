500|$|Between the two series, Digital Spy also {{mentioned}} Casualty thirtieth anniversary stunt, placing {{it as the}} number one moment to watch in their list of the [...] "10 big moments {{that you have to}} see this week", before releasing a teaser article about the episode on the night of its airing, adding that it was [...] "an episode you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to watch live." [...] The episode was broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2016 and was available to watch for thirty days afterwards on BBC iPlayer. In addition to this, [...] "Too Old for This Shift" [...] was made available for digital download via BBC Store on 27 August 2016 in standard definition, with higher definition later made available for purchase.|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|August Brown for the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "'Cheers (Drink to That)' and 'Raining Men,' as foamy and spunky {{as they may}} be, are such a dogleg turn from Rated R that they come off {{as little more than}} image recalibration. That's her {{prerogative}} as an artist, and it's certainly earned. But it underscores the one thing we've always wondered about Rihanna — what is she really feeling?". Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media was more critical of the song, commenting that [...] "Raining Men is a shameless Beyoncé rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the fact that it's a pretty-damn-good Beyoncé rip off with a characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj". James Reed of The Boston Globe also noticed the similarity between the song's composition and the work of American R recording artist Beyoncé Knowles, saying [...] "'Raining Men', borrowing a digitized riff from Beyoncé's 'Diva', features rising rapper Nicki Minaj on a typically manic guest rhyme. The song's message doubles as the album's mantra: Some cats <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> nine lives". Idolator reviewer Becky Bain praised Minaj's [...] "infectious and energetic verse" [...] and felt the song's rhythm [...] "fits Nicki's quirkiness perfectly".|$|E

500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated that [...] "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more people coming in and telling you what to do; we are grown up and big enough {{to know where the}} boundaries are". They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a lot of that happens nowadays." ...|$|E

He wrote, 'f Iraq's pre-invasion rate really was 5.5 per 1,000, it was lower than almost {{every country in the}} Middle East, and many countries in Europe.' This is just wrong! If Kaplan had checked the U.N. death-rate figures, most Middle Eastern nations <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> lower death rates than most European countries, and in fact have lower death rates than 5.5. Jordan's death rate is 4.2, Iran's 5.3, and Syria's 3.5. The reason for the lower rate is simple: Most Middle Eastern nations have much younger populations compared to most Western nations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane has portrayed Hagrid {{in all of}} {{the film}} adaptations of the Harry Potter novels. Robin Williams was {{interested}} for the role and approached Chris Columbus, the director of the first two films, about participating in the project but Columbus rejected him due to the [...] "all-British and Irish cast" [...] policy. Rowling had wanted Coltrane for the role from the start, responding [...] "RobbieColtraneforHagrid" [...] all in one quick breath when asked who was the top of her list of casting choices. Coltrane was already a fan of the books and has commented that being part of the Harry Potter franchise was [...] "a fantastic thing." [...] Rowling discussed Hagrid's past and future with Coltrane, assisting him in preparing for the role. She also stated that [...] "Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic [...] but he had to have – you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to sense – a certain toughness underneath [...] and I think Robbie does that perfectly." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take the time to talk to me made a big difference. I have always been the type of individual that takes all the information and then makes the decision that's appropriate for me. I can be very stubborn. I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to credit those two women for saving me." ...|$|E
