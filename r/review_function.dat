It has been suggested that the courts' jurisdiction in such matters depends on contract. The rules of an association form a contract between the members of the association themselves, and the need for hearings to be conducted in accordance with natural justice is an implied term in the contract.

2500|$|In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, {{ex parte}} Hargreaves (1996), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{initially}} rejected {{the argument that}} the courts could perform a substantive <b>review</b> <b>function</b> beyond that permitted by Wednesbury unreasonableness. In contrast, in the earlier case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khan (1984), the applicant had argued that the government had unfairly failed to apply the criteria in a government circular that outlined when a family could adopt children living outside the UK. In the Court of Appeal's judgment, Lord Justice of Appeal Hubert Parker surmised that expanding the doctrine of legitimate expectation to protect a substantive element would not necessarily be inconsistent with the principle underlying the doctrine. He stated that [...] "just as [...] resile from an undertaking and change [...] policy without giving a fair hearing so, in principle, the Secretary of State, if he undertakes to allow in persons if certain conditions are satisfied, should not in my view be entitled to resile from that undertaking without affording interested persons a hearing".|$|E

The response can be given by the relevant Government minister, by the chairperson of the relevant ministry, or by an undersecretary. It may be given in writing or delivered to the parliament orally. The member who asked the question can respond to say {{whether or not the}} answer is satisfactory. In injunctions, a fact is noted with a request for the reasons for the conduct of the Government and its future intentions. The process is done by writing. If the member who filed the injunction is not satisfied with the response, they can present a motion to hold a debate in the Parliament.|$|E

Another aspect of the legal control function of the office consists in its power to issue legally binding opinions on issues concerning the laws that govern administrative bodies and procedures. Both public entities and private parties can request the office to clarify any point of law arising from the functioning of public services. The access to the office is therefore remarkably broad. In practice, the exercise of the interpretive power has entailed that many practitioner use the office as an administrative tribunal which work alongside the ordinary judiciary in the country.|$|E

40|$|Although the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Suspension Clause {{explicitly}} {{mentions the}} writ of habeas corpus, {{it does not}} require that Congress make the writ available in its common-law form at all times. Rather, the Clause has long been understood to permit Congress to replace the writ with an alternative procedure, so long as that remedy is an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus. Under this functional view of the Suspension Clause, Congress might delegate responsibility for performing the habeas <b>review</b> <b>function</b> to an entity other than an Article III court, so long as the substitute procedure allows a detainee to challenge the lawfulness of his detention fairly and effectively. Because, at its core, habeas is concerned with checking arbitrary executive detention, however, this Article argues that any delegation of the habeas <b>review</b> <b>function</b> to a non—Article III entity must conform to the dictates of the nondelegation doctrine. To delegate the authority for designing the procedures used to challenge executive detention to the very Executive responsible for detention would defeat the purpose of the Clause. In Boumediene v Bush, the Supreme Court cast doubt on its prior functional jurisprudence regarding the Suspension Clause. In particular, the Court expressed hostility toward any substitute for habeas corpus that did not rely exclusively on an Article III court. This Article criticizes the Court 2 ̆ 7 s approach in Boumediene and demonstrates how it threatens the functional view of the Suspension Clause the Court had embraced previously. At the same time, this Article explains how and why nondelegation concerns justified the result in Boumediene. In particular, by relying so heavily on an executive-designed scheme—the Combatant Status Review Tribunals—Congress 2 ̆ 7 s substitute for habeas delegated excessive authority to the Executive to perform the habeas <b>review</b> <b>function.</b> For that reason, Congress 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to eliminate access to the writ for Guantanamo detainees through the Military Commissions Act of 2006 violated the Suspension Clause when read in conjunction with the nondelegation doctrine. A decision grounded more in nondelegation than in the absolutist conception of the Suspension Clause espoused by the Boumediene majority would have preserved more flexibility for the political branches to design a system for detaining terrorist suspects in the future...|$|E
