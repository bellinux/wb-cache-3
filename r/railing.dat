5|$|Within each turret, a red stripe on the {{interior}} wall, inches from the <b>railing,</b> marked the boundary of the barrel's recoil, warning the crew to keep back.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the lantern}} is a {{concrete}} gallery, accessible {{through a door}} in the lantern wall, with a white painted balustrade, and a 1990 <b>railing.</b> The solar panels are mounted on the gallery.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the <b>railing</b> into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the <b>railing,</b> leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing against the side of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E
5000|$|April 2007 {{for removal}} of {{existing}} <b>railings</b> and the erection of new <b>railings</b> and a timber fence. (Approved) ...|$|R
50|$|Any cameras or {{microphones}} permanently attached on <b>railings</b> {{are treated}} {{as part of the}} <b>railings</b> and are in play.|$|R
50|$|New {{cast iron}} <b>railings</b> were {{installed}} on the bridge. The abutments of the <b>railings</b> resemble these on the canal's embankment.|$|R
5|$|Following the victory, {{the largely}} UT crowd {{stayed in the}} stands to {{celebrate}} the Longhorns' return to the Rose Bowl—this time for {{a shot at a}} National Championship. As players circled the stadium giving high-fives and handshakes to fans, a section of the <b>railing</b> collapsed and fans spilled onto the sideline. Oneperson suffered injuries and was removed from the field on a stretcher.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a <b>railing</b> and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart {{to another part of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin: The baker {{appears in}} the film {{on top of the}} <b>railing</b> with Jack and Rose as the ship sinks, {{drinking}} brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.|$|E
50|$|It was {{originally}} surrounded by <b>railings</b> {{to separate the}} livestock from the food produce. The <b>railings</b> were removed in 1895.|$|R
50|$|The <b>railings</b> {{around the}} gardens were removed in 1940 {{as part of}} the war effort. The current <b>railings</b> date from 1947.|$|R
50|$|Cable <b>railings</b> or {{wire rope}} <b>railings</b> are safety rails that use {{horizontal}} or vertical cables {{in place of}} spindles, glass, mesh etc. for infill.|$|R
5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge <b>railing</b> and new stringers. The bridge was much better cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E
5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the <b>railing</b> and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|During a {{train ride}} to New York, the {{conductor}} {{told her to}} move into the smoking car. She refused, explaining her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she clutched at the <b>railing,</b> they muscled her away, breaking her arm in the process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for the conductor to kick her off the train.|$|E
5000|$|Wrought iron {{may be used}} to {{construct}} ornate <b>railings.</b> The Davies brothers of Wrexham made such <b>railings</b> in the 18th century and these are much admired — Nikolaus Pevsner described their work as [...] "miraculous". [...] They made fine wrought iron <b>railings</b> for Stansty Park and these may now be seen at Erddig Hall.|$|R
5000|$|While {{arguing with}} the police, John Bedford Leno's friend, Humphreys, {{noticed that the}} <b>railings</b> would stand no {{pressure}} and began to sway them backwards and forwards. He was soon helped by the masses and the <b>railings</b> fell in {{what was to become}} known as the [...] "Hyde Park <b>Railings</b> Affair". The people flooded into Hyde Park despite the efforts of the police to restrain them.|$|R
50|$|Seedlings {{from the}} {{original}} tree were cultivated and one was replanted, a set of iron <b>railings</b> proving to be necessary to deter souvenir collectors. The tree is healthy; however, it and its <b>railings</b> were slipping down into the Water of Coyle circa 2010 on a section of road now closed to vehicles and, in theory, pedestrians. In 2013 the <b>railings</b> were raised and the site fully restored by Burnsians.|$|R
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone <b>railing</b> on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper <b>railing.</b> Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the <b>railing</b> into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{refurbishment}} of {{the bridge}} took place and included upgrading the parapet <b>railings,</b> installation of safety kerbing and <b>railings,</b> resurfacing of the carriageway deck and footways, upgrading streetlights. Over £400,000 was spent on the project.|$|R
50|$|The Mahabodhi Temple is {{surrounded}} {{on all four}} sides by stone <b>railings,</b> about two metres high. The <b>railings</b> reveal two distinct types, both in style {{as well as the}} materials used. The older ones, made of sandstone, date to about 150 BCE, and the others, constructed from unpolished coarse granite, are believed to be of the Gupta period. The older <b>railings</b> have scenes such as Lakshmi, the Hindu/Buddhist goddess of wealth, being bathed by elephants; and Surya, the Hindu sun god, riding a chariot drawn by four horses. The newer <b>railings</b> have figures of stupas (reliquary shrines) and garudas (eagles). Images of lotus flowers also appear commonly.|$|R
5000|$|Arthur Macnamara {{was buried}} in the Billington churchyard, with a monumental {{tombstone}} surrounded by iron <b>railings.</b> There is a legend that it was a tradition for the spikes on top of the <b>railings</b> to curve outwards to keep the devil out, but on Arthur Macnamara's grave, the spikes were turned in to prevent him from escaping. (The <b>railings</b> were removed during World War II when iron work was melted down to help the war effort.) ...|$|R
5|$|MFP Baseball, which {{purchased}} the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective <b>railing</b> was installed {{along the edge}} of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|The choir {{is where}} the priest and/or a choral group sings the psalms. It {{is located in the}} central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in a semicircular fashion, much like Spanish cathedrals. It was built by Juan de Rojas between 1696 and 1697. Its sides contain 59reliefs of various saints done in mahogany, walnut, cedar and a native wood called tepehuaje. The <b>railing</b> that {{surrounds}} the choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in Macao, China and placed in the cathedral in 1730.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} {{placed in front of}} a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron <b>railing.</b> Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{originally}} had standard metal panels along the sidewalks. In the early 1990s, they were replaced with new <b>railings,</b> {{but these were}} replaced again with metal lattice <b>railings</b> in the mid-1990s {{through the efforts of}} Edith Gilbert.|$|R
50|$|McElwain co-founded the Jones, McElwain and Company Iron Foundry in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Some {{of their}} <b>railings</b> in the Hillcrest Cemetery are {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. Many <b>railings</b> are also present in New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|Jones Bridge {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} bridges in the country. Some recent {{improvements}} on the current bridge were the addition of street lamps and replacing the old pole <b>railings</b> with stone <b>railings</b> reminiscent of the first Jones Bridge.|$|R
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels hung from a circular <b>railing,</b> slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the <b>railing</b> and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|When Boycott {{was eight}} years old, he was impaled through his chest by the handle of a mangle after falling off an iron <b>railing</b> near his home. Boycott nearly died, and in the efforts to save his life, his spleen was removed. In March 1950, Boycott's father had a serious {{accident}} {{while working as a}} coalminer, suffering severe damage to his spine after he was hit by empty coal carts; He never fully recovered, and died in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} viaduct {{had not had}} parapets and {{had probably}} never had handrails, which were now essential for safety. It was considered appropriate to make them of steel in an authentic period style, and after examining photographs of the cast iron <b>railings</b> of Chirk Aqueduct and other early examples, masonry copings and light-coloured <b>railings</b> were provided. The preservation of the 300mm distortion of arch 2 was maintained; the light coloured <b>railings</b> are unobtrusive visually against the sky.|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s {{there was}} a problem with {{travellers}} who parked caravans without permission, but this was prevented by erecting metal <b>railings</b> round the part of the perimeter of the park where there are no houses, round the car park, along the main driveway, these <b>railings</b> separate areas where vehicles are permitted from areas where vehicles are not permitted. There are gates in these <b>railings</b> which are unlocked for permitted vehicles, for example when the funfair arrives.|$|R
