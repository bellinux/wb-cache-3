25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left crank arm with a spider and chainring, and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on freewheel, a special hub with a left <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> for a special freewheel must be used , which is also <b>threaded</b> left <b>hand</b> and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal freewheel. If the freewheel and hub were <b>threaded</b> with <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>threads,</b> the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the freewheel from the hub.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project {{was conducted to}} increase weld gap tolerance in Friction Stir Welding (FSW) of 8 mm thick aluminum alloy 6082 – T 6. Investigation was done on I-STIR PDS platform and a Johnford milling machine. The {{research project}} involved tool-pin design with varying re-entrant features and varying parameters {{as a method of}} weld gap closing to produce successful welds. Direction of spindle rotation and dwell time were established as part of a preliminary study. Clockwise spindle rotation with 20 seconds dwell time allows sufficient plasticity and improved material flow which assisted in achieving welds with prior 30 percent weld gap of the plate thickness. Final welds were made using three rotational speeds and feed rates with sufficient plunging to prevent root defects. Analysis of the results were detailed which include vickers microhardness test, tensile test and metallographic observation to access the suitability of the weld structure. From the set of tool-pins designed, the flare tool-pin gave a well-defined weld nugget with improved stirring at the weld root. Also, with a concave shoulder, <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>threaded</b> tool-pin and counterclockwise flutes undergoing a clockwise spindle rotation, plasticized material flow was upward which was beneficial in reducing the amount of plate thinning. The <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>thread</b> counter clockwise flute with a flute machined in the foot exhibited superior tensile strength for welds containing 30 percent weld gap...|$|R
50|$|If a track hub is not available, or if a {{beginner}} wishes {{to try a}} fixed gear bicycle without buying a new hub or rear wheel, track cogs can be installed on a standard Freewheel hub using a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>threaded</b> ISO English bottom bracket lockring as the lockring for the cog (the threads are exactly the same). This may work for some lighter, or delicate riders, but any repeated reverse or braking pressure on the pedals will eventually cause the cog and lockring to come loose. It is recommended that anyone using a freewheel hub with a track cog in this manner do so with caution and with both front and rear brakes mounted to the bicycle.|$|R
40|$|This study quantifies {{the effect}} of a {{simultaneous}} grip on wrist strength. It was hypothesized that wrist flexion strength increases with an increasing grip and wrist extension strength decreases with an increasing grip. Twelve subjects performed maximum wrist flexion and extension exertions with a different level of simultaneous grip – minimum, preferred, and maximum. Wrist flexion strength increased 34 % and wrist extension strength decreased 10 % from minimum to maximum grip. This shows that measure of wrist strength for assessing strength capabilities or the efficacy of hand surgeries or rehabilitation programs requires control of finger flexor activities to ensure consistent and relevant results. When opening a bottle in an outward direction (<b>right</b> <b>hand</b> <b>thread),</b> wrist extension strength may be significantly limited by a simultaneous grip due to muscle antagonism. When twisting a fragile or uncomfortable object, reduced finger flexor activities can limit wrist flexion strength...|$|R

50|$|The helix of {{a thread}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions, {{which is known}} as handedness. Most threads are oriented so that the threaded item, when seen from {{a point of view}} on the axis {{through the center of the}} helix, moves away from the viewer when it is turned in a clockwise direction, and moves towards the viewer when it is turned counterclockwise. This is known as a right-handed (RH) thread, because it follows the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> grip rule. <b>Threads</b> oriented in the opposite direction are known as left-handed (LH).|$|R
40|$|A {{table of}} the {{families}} of alternating knots formed by conways is presented. The Conway's function is shown {{with the use of}} linear algebra in terms of natural numbers, called conways, that represent the number of crossings along a direction, as it was used by J. Conway for the classification of knots. Colored figures and tangles show the parts of the knots or tangles with a definite handedness: all the colored parts of the knot family are associated to a particular orientation. For example all the colored conways have a <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> screw <b>thread,</b> and all the white conways have the opposite handedness. Figures for six conways were colored with two different colors for forty two families in order to show the dissection of the knot in two tangles corresponding to a particular factorization of the Conway's function. The Conway's function of each family is expressed as the internal product of two vectors corresponding to each of two colored family 2 -tangles, and with a full factorization which is not unique.

5000|$|Inkpot (sumitsubo 墨壺), The sumitsubo is {{used for}} marking long {{straight}} lines onto various surfaces. A thread (tsuboito) is tied to a rounded piece of wood with a needle fixed at the end (karuko). The {{other end of the}} thread is passed through the small opening {{at the end of the}} sumitsubo (itoguchi), through the depression containing ink (ike) and wound around a spool (itomaki-guruma). The ink is stored in the ike soaked in silk wadding. Silk threads are used as tsuboito. To draw a line, the sumitsubo is held in the left hand and the karuko's needle is fixed onto the surface determining the position of one end of the thread. The sumitsubo is gradually moved away from the karuko until the required length of the thread is unreeled at which point the rotation of the spool is stopped using the thumb. With the index finger the thread is pressed down at the required end point of the line. Using the <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> the <b>thread</b> is pulled upwards into tension and then suddenly released, consequently hitting the surface and leaving a straight line of ink onto any surface, regardless of any surface irregularities.|$|R

The first/most common was the ACS South Paw Claw model, available in 16T.
