40|$|In {{the region}} of Mearim and Grajaú rivers, the Parnaíba Basin relief is {{composed}} of small hills mostly associated with sandstones of the Itapecuru Formation. Furthermore, interspersed valleys with Podzolic soils are derived from shales, siltstones, marls and limestones of Codó and Grajaú formations. The longitudinal profiles of about 356 rivers were analyzed in order to verify if the degree of fluvial incision of topography is controlled only by lithologic variation. Three geomorphometric indices were used: stream&# 8208;length gradient, normalized steepness, and spatial distribution of knickpoints. All indices {{are based on the}} identification of slope changes along longitudinal profiles. The stream&# 8208;length gradient index (Hack index) reflects the power flow of a river and is calculated by multiplying the slope and upstream length of the channel at a given point. The normalized steepness index is obtained by combining the slope and drainage area of river sections on a log-log graph. For the extraction of knickpoints, which represent convex reaches interrupting the typically concave river profiles, a new approach was used based on automatic identification of minimum and maximum slopes on the Distance-Slope graph. This procedure is more sensitive in defining knickpoints than the visual inspection of longitudinal profiles alone. Comparison of results with geological and geophysical data permitted to consider that <b>relief</b> <b>incision</b> is controlled not only by lithology but also by geologic structure, as suggested by the spatial coincidence of knickpoints with basement faults and crustal domain boundaries. Processes involved may be related to tectonic reactivation or differential compaction. Pages: 3572 - 357...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSequences {{of coral}} reef {{terraces}} characterized by staircase morphologies and a homogeneous lithology make them appropriate {{to isolate the}} influence of uplift on drainage morphology. Along the northern coast of Sumba Island, Indonesia, we investigated the correlations between landscape morphology and uplift rates, which range from 0. 02 to 0. 6 mm·yr− 1. We studied eight morphometric indices at two scales: whole island (~ 11, 000 km 2) and within sequences of reefal terraces (~ 3000 km 2). At the latter scale, we extracted morphometric indices for 15 individual catchments draining mostly the reefal terraces and for 30 areas undergoing specific ranges of uplift rates draining only the reefal terraces. Indices extracted from digital elevation models include residual <b>relief,</b> <b>incision,</b> stream gradient indices (SL and ksn), the hypsometric integral, drainage area, mean relief, and the shape factor. We find that SL, the hypsometric integral, mean relief and the shape factor of catchments positively correlate with uplift rates, whereas incision, residual relief, and ksn do not. More precisely, we find that only the areas that are uplifting at a rate faster than 0. 3 mm·yr− 1 can yield the extreme values for these indices, implying that these extreme values are indicative of fast uplifting areas. However, the relationship is not bivalent because any uplift rate {{can be associated with}} low values of the same indices. For all indices, the transient conditions of the drainage influence the correlation with Pleistocene mean uplift rates, illustrating the necessity to extract morphometric indices with an appropriate choice of catchment scale. This type of analysis helps to identify the morphometric indices that are most useful for tectonic analysis in areas of unknown uplift, allowing for easy identification of short spatial variations of uplift rate and detection of areas with relatively fast uplift rates in unstudied coastal zones...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} one of {{the most}} unusual techniques identified in the study of Catalan Modernista architecture: the cladding of walls and ceilings with papier-mâché tiles produced by the Hermenegild Miralles firm. These tiles are similar in appearance to Valencian ceramic tiles, from which they took their designs and surface finishes. The company’s catalogue included a full range of finishes based on contemporary experiments with glazed and enamelled ceramics, such as golden hues, <b>reliefs</b> and <b>incisions.</b> The product catalogue claimed that the papier-mâché tiles were patented, so the technique was closely linked to the firm that marketed it. As far as we know, the tiles were on the market for a rather short time: the catalogue which we have discovered dates from 1894 and the latest examples of the tiles’ use are from 1905. We have found them in works by Antoni Gaudí and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, among others. Because {{of the importance of the}} buildings in which these tiles were used and the architects who designed them, we consider that this was not a one-off invention but rather one that, for a certain period of time, offered rich formal possibilities and was simple to install. The new product met a demand for sensory expression and attractive cladding materials. It was inexpensive, lightweight and easily mouldable, so it allowed daring and highly expressive solutions that were affordable for more peoplePeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Based on new seismological {{and recent}} {{faulting}} data, we analyze five main sectors {{in the western}} part of the Betic Cordillera from an active tectonic perspective: i. The northwestern frontal sector of the cordillera, including the Morón de la Frontera area, with shallow (< 15 km depth) seismogenic active NE-SW reverse and strike-slip faults that do not reach the surface. ii. The Teba area, in the External Zones, which is deformed by sparse N-S to NW-SE normal faults with associated wedges of Quaternary sediments and active strike-slip faults at intermediate crustal levels. iii. The Ronda Basin, representing the major Late Miocene intramontane basin of the western Betic Cordillera, is mainly deformed by NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE folds and locally by NW-SE normal faults. iv. The internal part of the orogen, which is characterized by shallow (< 40 km) and intermediate (40 to 120 km depth) seismicity beneath Málaga and the Alborán Sea, ENE-WSW folding, <b>relief</b> uplift, river <b>incision</b> and scarce active faults with surface expression. v. The Spanish Atlantic coast, which coincides with the western end of the Betic orogen, where Pliocene to Quaternary shallowmarine sedimentary rocks are deformed by meso-scale NW-SE oriented normal faults and few ENE-WSW reverse faults. These data support the recent tectonic activity of the western Betic Cordillera determined by the NW-SE Eurasian-African convergence with variable features from the mountain front, characterized by shallow deformations, up to the Internal Zones that mainly undergo uplift and intermediate seismicity...|$|R
40|$|Paganzo Group {{exposures}} (Tupe Formation) in the Huaco area {{provide an}} excellent opportunity for assessing the role of sea level and climatic changes on the morphology and nature of coastal fluvial systems deposited in areas of limited tectonic activity. The paleogeographic position of Huaco, close to a coastal region within the Paganzo Basin, allows identification {{of the effects of}} sea level change on fluvial architecture. Despite the fact that the Huaco area was dominated by coastal fluvial systems, three marine incursions flooded this part of the basin during the Namurian, Early Pennsylvanian and Late Pennsylvanian respectively. During deposition of the Paganzo Group, climatic conditions evolved from glacial (Namurian) to hot and dry (Late Cisuralian). Five types of fluvial deposits were recognized on the basis of architectural element analysis, lithofacies distribution and type of fluvial bounding surfaces present. Fluvial system 1 (FS 1) constitutes {{the lower part of the}} Tupe Formation and consists of stacked multi-storey channel-fill complexes formed on large braided alluvial plains dominated by channel-avulsion processes. FS 2 consists of multi-storey channels alternating with floodplain deposits including coal beds and organic-rich mudstones. This fluvial system is interpreted as the deposit of an anastomosed network of sandy channels. FS 3 occurs between the Early Pennsylvanian and Late Pennsylvanian marine transgressions and consists of sandstones and some conglomerates that form stacked channel complexes. Sporadically, very fine-grained sandstone and mudstone floodplain deposits appear as thin intercalations. FS 3 likely formed on braided alluvial plains with channels dominated by transversal bars. FS 4 corresponds to an anastomosed fluvial system that was dominated by two types of braided channel belts that were separated by narrow floodplains. Finally, FS 5 is composed of fining-upward cycles ranging from gravely sandstones at the bottom of channels to muddy floodplain deposits at the top. The whole FS 5 succession was deposited by high-sinuosity meandering rivers. Detailed stratigraphic analyses clearly suggest that both, sea level and climate changes were first-order controls on fluvial system configurations. In this way, braided systems belonging to FS 1 correspond to a low-accommodation system tract. Whereas, coal beds of FS 2, which resulted from high water-tables, correspond to a high accommodation system tract that was likely associated with advanced stages of the Late Pennsylvanian transgression. A significant change in the nature of fluvial deposits took place prior to the Late Pennsylvanian sea level rise when braided fluvial systems (FS 3) with very scarce floodplain deposits prevailed. Towards the top of the Late Pennsylvanian transgressive deposits, a high <b>relief</b> fluvial <b>incision</b> surface was carved into the underlying marine deposits. This surface was later mantled by anastomosed rivers (FS 4) corresponding to low-accommodation deposits formed in a lowstand or during the early stages of the ensuing sea level rise. In later phases of this transgression, high accommodation conditions prevailed and fluvial sedimentation was dominated by high-sinuosity rivers (FS 5). These fluvial deposits are considered as an inland equivalent to the shallow-marine deposits exposed in the neighboring Agua Negra Formation located to the west...|$|R
40|$|We use the landcape {{evolution}} model Zscape {{to explore}} quantitatively {{the development of}} mountainous topography in the Basin and Range province (formerly the Basin Ranges), USA, {{as a function of}} faulting, surface processes and microclimate. Many of the classic morphologies of mountains in the Basin and Range were described in the late part of the 19 th century. The varied topography coupled with differing experiences led to a similarly diverse set of explanations. We are able to demonstrate through a variety of numerical experiments that a diverse landscape is easily obtained by the simple, steady combination of tectonic and surface processes. Numerical landscapes reveal the same features observed in the field, including facets, spur benches, piedmonts, and relatively linear and regularly spaced drainages. In all cases, a steady-state landscape is generated on the order of 106 years, so that there remains little information in the landscape that can tell us about processes or conditions prior to 1 million years ago. The fundamental form of the steady-state landscape (including the facet and spur bench morphology) is governed by the spacing of rivers and bedrock strength and the resulting relief is for the most part strength-limited. Neither hillslope nor facet relief is dependent on the rate of fault slip or channel <b>incision.</b> <b>Relief</b> is incision-limited, however, nearer the headwaters of rivers where stream power is relatively low. Topographically asymmetric ranges may be generated over tectonically symmetric horsts by allowing precipitation to be driven by orographic processes, but the asymmetry is likely to be dependent on the ability to remove eroded material from the adjacent basins. The value of the experiments presented here is to demonstrate that the astute and impressive observations made by the likes of Gilbert, Davis and Dutton are reproducible using a relatively simple description of the relevant physics and that we can recognize and explain various landscape morphologies that have in the past been the subject of necessarily qualtitative reasoning...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pain {{involves}} different {{brain regions}} and is critically determined by emotional processing. Among other areas, the rostral {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (rACC) is implicated in the processing of affective pain. Drugs that interfere with the endocannabinoid system are alternatives {{for the management of}} clinical pain. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid found in Cannabis sativa, has been utilized in preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of pain. Herein, we evaluate the effects of CBD, injected either systemically or locally into the rACC, on mechanical allodynia in a postoperative pain model and on the negative reinforcement produced by <b>relief</b> of spontaneous <b>incision</b> pain. Additionally, we explored whether CBD underlies the reward of pain relief after systemic or rACC injection. Methods and Results: Male Wistar rats were submitted to a model of incision pain. All rats had mechanical allodynia, which was less intense after intraperitoneal CBD (3 and 10 mg/kg). Conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to assess negative reinforcement. Intraperitoneal CBD (1 and 3 mg/kg) inverted the CPP produced by peripheral nerve block even at doses that do not change mechanical allodynia. CBD (10 to 40 nmol/ 0. 25 μL) injected into the rACC reduced mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. CBD (5 nmol/ 0. 25 μL) did not change mechanical allodynia, but reduced peripheral nerve block-induced CPP, and the higher doses inverted the CPP. Additionally, CBD injected systemically or into the rACC at doses that did not change the incision pain evoked by mechanical stimulation significantly produced CPP by itself. Therefore, a non-rewarding dose of CBD in sham-incised rats becomes rewarding in incised rats, presumably because of pain relief or reduction of pain aversiveness. Conclusion: The study provides evidence that CBD influences different dimensions of the response of rats to a surgical incision, and the results establish the rACC as a brain area from which CBD evokes antinociceptive effects {{in a manner similar to}} the systemic administration of CBD. In addition, the study gives further support to the notion that the sensorial and affective dimensions of pain may be differentially modulated by CBD...|$|R
40|$|Relief {{analyses}} {{were carried out}} in the south-eastern part of the crystalline Argentera Massif, using the classical geomorphometric parameters (local <b>relief,</b> depth of <b>incision</b> and fraction of the relief occupied by valleys). The aim of this analysis is the morphological characterisation of the opposite slopes of the axial chain and the explanation of orographic problems in this sector of the Alpine chain. The relief analysis, carried out with the swath profiles method, showed a morphological difference between the eastern and western slopes of the axial chain, which develops along the Italian-French border line. The western slope (Italian part) is characterised by a greater relief energy, maximum elevation and depth of incision than the French slope. Moreover, a very marked orographic maximum was observed {{in the eastern part of}} the chain. The same analysis carried out with three parallel swath profiles in the area of the M. Matto-Argentera-Rocca dell'Abisso (MAA area) (south-east Italian part of the Massif) confirmed the presence of an orographic culmination with a direction parallel to that of the axial chain. This orographic culmination was also in agreement with a morphotectonic lineament, Colle del Sabbione-Colle del Chiapous Lineament (CSCC Lineament), which crosses the Massif for a distance of about 50 km. In the MAA area the normalisation of the topography showed the presence of an alignment of the main peak elevations, in agreement with the direction of the orographic culmination and the CSCC Lineament. The study of the drainage network of the Argentera shows that the hydrographic basin of the T. Gesso (MAA area), only in part that of the Vesubie (French slope), has a general drainage direction (trans-orogenic) considerably different from that of the other basins of the Massif (intra-orogenic). An examination of the relief data, geomorphologic-structural considerations and the known tectonic data, suggest that the orographic maximum within the axial chain corresponds to the morphological culmination of the hanging wall of a SW vergent thrust of the crystalline basement. The processes of exumation acting on the crystalline basement thus constituted generated in the Italian slope of the SE part of the Argentera a dishomogeneous relief, with steeper slopes, more incised network and a general phenomenon of retrogression of the watershed. The geomorphological evolution of this part of the Massif shows therefore that the process of tectonic uplift of the Argentera Massif occurred differentially...|$|R
