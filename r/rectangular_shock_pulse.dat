The material thickness chosen based on cushion curves establishes overall package size, a key determiner of logistics costs. Cushion curves are constructed by dropping a mass onto a cushion, and interpreting the resulting <b>shock</b> <b>pulse</b> deceleration.

40|$|Abstract: The {{capability}} to withstand non-contact underwater explosions (UNDEX) {{is an important}} aspect to be emphasized {{in the design of}} modern warships, and shock testing is one of the efficient methods to qualify the ability. A brief history on the research of shock testing of naval shipboard equipment as well as major means in evaluating anti-shock performance of warship equipment is introduced first in this paper. Three prevailing shock test methods: UNDEX testing, virtual shock trial and land-based test with shock test machines are presented with the focus on the advances in shock test machines in US and Europe. Comparison of current shock testing facilities is also given. Moreover, some new concepts of shock test machines are reviewed as well, and three major directions of the development of shock test machines are concluded. The first trend is that shock testing machines are required to generate positive and negative <b>shock</b> <b>pulse</b> to simulate real UNDEX environment made up of shock wave followed by bubble pulse and structural whipping. The second is that shock test machines can test heavy equipments, and the last is that <b>shock</b> <b>pulses</b> can be controlled and customized conveniently. ...|$|R

In Part A {{the development of a}} shock test is presented and in Part B a detailed test plan for environmental testing of a telemetry package is presented. Both are the culmination of effort for the Naval Missile Center, Point Mugu, California. Part A describes the procedures and analysis leading to the developed ship shock loads test on the HARPOON missile. In describing the necessary equipment to perform the test it was found that some energy absorbing device was needed to obtain the required <b>shock</b> <b>pulse.</b> Because of the unique specifications of the <b>shock</b> <b>pulse,</b> this energy absorbing device had to be designed and built as a method for producing that requirement existed. A comparison of recorded data to required <b>shock</b> <b>pulse</b> specifications was undertaken to verify the adequacy of the simulation. From the data {{it was found that the}} developed test will be an adequate simulation of the specifications of underwater ship shock loads on the HARPOON missile. In Part B, environmental simulations were to be performed on a telemetry package designed to be used in the ARMY MQM - 34 D target. As of this writing, only the test plan has been completed and is included in Part B. No future date for performing these environmental tests is forseen. In this test plan, three environmental test conditions which most nearly resemble actual environmental conditions where these targets are used (White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico) for testing Surface - to - Air Missiles are explained in detail for testing and evaluation of the telemetry package's integrity and ability to withstand the environment. The telemetry package sends attitude conditions of the target's evasive actions to the ground control station for evaluation of the missile's reliability.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this study}} is to {{distinguish}} the supramembrane potential difference-induced electroconformational changes from the huge transmembrane current-induced thermal damages in the delayed rectifier K+ channels. A double Vaseline-gap voltage clamp was used to deliver <b>shock</b> <b>pulses</b> and to monitor the channel currents. Three pairs of 4 -ms <b>shock</b> <b>pulses</b> were used to mimic the electric shock by a power-line frequency electric field. Each pair consists of two pulses with the same magnitude, starting from 350 to 500 mV, but with opposite polarities. The shock pulse-generated transmembrane ion flux and the responding electric energy, the Joule heating, consumed in the cell membrane, as well as the effects on the K+ channel currents, were obtained. Results showed that huge transmembrane currents are not necessary to cause damages in the K+ channel proteins. In contrast, reductions in the K+ channel currents are directly related to the field-induced supramembrane potential differences. By a comparison with the shock field-induced Joule heating effects on cell membranes, the field-induced supramembrane potential difference plays a dominant role in damaging the K+ channels, resulting in electroconformational changes in the membrane proteins. In contrast, the shock field-induced huge transmembrane currents, therefore the thermal effects, play a secondary, trivial role...|$|R
