50|$|Some {{fireplace}} units {{incorporate a}} blower which transfers {{more of the}} fireplace's heat to the air via convection, resulting in a more evenly heated space and a lower heating load. Fireplace efficiency can also be increased {{with the use of}} a fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel. Efficiency is a complicated concept though with open hearth fireplaces. Most efficiency tests consider just the effect of heating of the air. An open fireplace is not, and never was, intended to heat the air. A fireplace with a fireback is a <b>radiant</b> <b>heater,</b> and has done so since the 15th century. The best way to gauge the output of a fireplace is if you notice you're turning the thermostat up or down.|$|E

Among infants raised under <b>radiant</b> <b>heaters</b> (8 of whom had topical antibiotics applied to the umbilicus), only one was colonized with this organism.

The thermal model includes the 6061 square hollow section and the steel <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> plate. The measured full-field temperatures of the steel plate heater were prescribed and the resultant full-specimen thermal response was predicted from the radiation exchange between the <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> and sample.

40|$|An {{inspection}} {{process of}} <b>radiant</b> <b>heaters</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. The proposed non destructive testing and evaluation (NDT and E) technique for defect assessment of <b>radiant</b> <b>heaters</b> is based on infrared thermography images properly acquired and processed. The technique {{can be used in}} on-line fabrication quality control <b>radiant</b> <b>heaters</b> manufacturing processes. By exciting the heater with a very short electrical pulse, a sequence of thermographic images is captured by an infrared camera and then analyzed. Regardless of the electrical excitation applied to the heating element of the heater, the electrical power supplied will dissipate at the resistor. Provided enough spatial resolution, the heaters could be tested with an infrared camera capturing the radiated heat. The analysis of the heating wire during the heating flank shows differences among pixels corresponding to defective points and pixels belonging to non-defective areas of the wire. The automation is provided by the development of an algorithm that looks for the slope of the heating evolution of each pixel. A Radon Transform based algorithm is here proposed to reduce human intervention providing just one image where an operator could quickly locate possible defects...|$|R

40|$|A {{generalized}} modeling {{program was}} adapted in BASIC {{on a personal}} computer to compare the performance of four types of biowaste resistojets and two types of hydrazine augmenters. Analyzed biowaste design types were: (1) an electrically conductive ceramic heater-exchanger of zirconia; (2) a truss heater of platinum in cross flow; (3) an immersed bicoiled tubular heater-exchanger; and (4) a nonexposed, refractory metal, <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> in a central cavity within a heat exchanger case. Concepts 2 and 3 are designed to have an efficient, stainless steel outer pressure case. The hydrazine design types are: (5) an immersed bicoil heater exchanger and (6) a nonexposed <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> now with a refractory metal case. The ceramic biowaste resistojet has the highest specific impulse growth potential at 2000 K of 192. 5 (CO 2) and 269 s (H 2 O).

40|$|Stainless-steel honeycomb-core {{sandwich}} panels which differed {{primarily in}} skin thicknesses were tested at elevated temperatures under static and aerodynamic conditions. The {{results of these}} tests were evaluated to determine the insulating effectiveness and structural integrity of the panels. The static radiant-heating tests were performed {{in front of a}} quartz-tube <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> at panel skin temperatures up to 1, 5000 F. The aerodynamic tests were made in a Mach 1. 4 heated blowdown wind tunnel. The tunnel temperature was augmented by additional heat supplied by a <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> which raised the panel surface temperature above 8000 F during air flow. Static radiant-heating tests of 2 minutes duration showed that all the panels protected the load-carrying structure about equally well. Thin-skin panels showed an advantage for this short-time test over thick-skin panels from a standpoint of weight against insulation. Permanent inelastic strains in the form of local buckles over each cell of the honeycomb core caused an increase in surface roughness.

40|$|AIMS: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that external radiant heating might lead to significant fluctuations in superficial and core head temperatures in newborn infants. METHODS: In an observation group of 14 term infants nursed under a <b>radiant</b> <b>heater,</b> servo-controlled to the abdominal skin, changes in rectal, core head, and scalp temperatures with heater activation were examined. In a further intervention group of six infants {{the effect of a}} reflective head shield on the fluctuations of scalp temperature was also tested. RESULTS: In the observation group, when the heater had been off for 30 minutes, the rectal and scalp temperatures were 36. 7 (SD 0. 6) and 35. 6 (0. 6) degrees C, respectively, a difference of 1. 2 (0. 2) degrees C. After 30 minutes with the <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> on this fell to 0. 2 (0. 5) degrees C. The core head temperature, however, remained similar to the rectal temperature throughout. In the intervention group a reflective shield prevented the loss of the rectal-scalp gradient. CONCLUSION: Overhead heater activation is associated with loss of the core to scalp temperature gradient, but no change in core head temperature in term infants. The clinical relevance of this superficial heating in vulnerable infants warrants further study...|$|E

40|$|A new {{open-loop}} {{heat flux}} control technique {{has been developed}} to conduct transient thermal testing of thick, thermallyconductive aerospace structures. This technique uses calibration of the <b>radiant</b> <b>heater</b> system power level {{as a function of}} heat flux, predicted aerodynamic heat flux, and the properties of an instrumented test article. An iterative process was used to generate open-loop heater power profiles prior to each transient thermal test.

This iteration process has reduced the effects of environmental and test system design factors, which are normally compensated for by closed-loop temperature control, to acceptable levels.
