30|$|To {{facilitate}} the measurement, a <b>rotating</b> <b>jig</b> {{provided by the}} manufacturer (SinoUnion Healthcare Inc., Beijing, China) was used, with a 3 -mm-diameter Ge- 68 line source of 11.1  MBq. The line source was rotated around {{the center of the}} scanner parallel to the axial direction of the scanner at a radius of 20  cm. No attenuation or scatter correction was assumed in the study, and the dead time loss was also ignored due to the low activity of the source. The differences in the arrival times for all the coincidence photons passed through the scanner center of field of view (CFOV) were recorded, and timing histograms were generated for all the possible lines of response (LORs). In theory, two symmetrical peaks in the histograms could be observed with a distance corresponding to the flight time across the 40  cm diameter. Gaussian fitting was applied to the two peaks in the timing histogram, and the average FWHM was reported as the system TOF timing resolution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vehicles}} {{successfully completed}} troop trials and from 1939-1940 a further 101 of the armoured cars - initially designated [...] "Tank, Light, (Wheeled) Mark I"- were produced. These were constructed used welding rather than rivetting. The contract specification {{had been for}} riveted construction but Guy suggested welding as being more suitable and effective. To that end they developed the necessary techniques including <b>rotating</b> <b>jigs</b> which meant the bodies and turrets could be produced quicker and cheaper. The Royal Commission for Awards to Inventors recognised this after the war.|$|R
50|$|From the mid-1930s, {{the company}} became {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} British rearmament programme, developing and producing military vehicles. In 1935 Guy submitted their new four wheel Ant armoured car to military trials where it impressed and 150 were ordered by the government. After this success Guy began to concentrate solely on the production of military vehicles and by 1938 Guy relied exclusively on Government contracts and had ended civilian productions. During this time Guy designed a new armoured car, the Quad Ant, which was welded rather than riveted together. The original official contract specification it had been designed in response to had been for riveted construction but Guy had suggested welding as being more suitable and effective. To that end they developed the necessary techniques including <b>rotating</b> <b>jigs</b> which meant the bodies and turrets could be produced quicker and cheaper. This new development made armoured vehicles much safer and {{is reported to have}} eventually saved the British government £100 million pounds, earning Guy a commendation from the Royal Commission. Initially though, the government's technical advisors were skeptical that welding armour plate using these techniques would be economical, so Guy offered to weld the first batch ordered, and if unsuccessful, to stand the cost. The vehicles were welded, and on examination by the British Army, the welding was found to have worked extremely well. Over time it was further developed and became widely used in allied armoured vehicles, such as later models of the Churchill and Sherman tanks.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the part}} size and {{technological}} limitations of the available assembly equipment, traditional wing manufacturing has consisted of a three stage process. Parts are first manually tacked together in an assembly jig, They are then removed from the <b>jig,</b> <b>rotated</b> horizontally and craned into an automated fastening machine. Finally they are removed from the fastening machines and craned to a third station where the manual tacks are removed and the parts are prepped for final wing box assembly. With the advent of electromagnetic riveting (EMR) and the traveling yoke assembly machine this traditional approach has been replaced with single station processing. Wing panels and spars can now b...|$|R
40|$|Finite helical axes (FHAs) are a {{potentially}} effective tool for joint kinematic analysis. Unfortunately, no straightforward guidelines exist for calculating accurate FHAs using prepackaged six degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) rigid body trackers. Thus, this study aimed to: (1) describe a protocol for calculating FHA parameters from 6 DOF rigid body trackers using the screw matrix and (2) {{to maximize the}} number of accurate FHAs generated from a given data set using a moving window analysis. Four OPTOTRAKV R Smart Markers were used as the rigid body trackers, two moving and two fixed, at different distances from the hinge joint of a custom-machined jig. 6 DOF pose information was generated from 51 static positions of the <b>jig</b> <b>rotated</b> and fixed in 0. 5 deg increments up to 25 deg. Output metrics included the FHA direction cosines...|$|R
