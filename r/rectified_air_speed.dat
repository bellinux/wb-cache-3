40|$|Abstract. Surface {{discharge}} plasma {{was used}} to activate air to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for promoting the oxidation of ammonium sulfite by air forced oxidation method. The effect of applied voltage and the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> in discharge reactor on the generation of ozone {{as well as the}} oxidation kinetic of ammonium sulfite were analyzed and discussed. The ozone concentration increased with the discharge voltage, but decreased with the <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> and a maximum mass of generated ozone was obtained at <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> of 15 m/s. Compared with air forced oxidation, the oxidation kinetic constant of ammonium sulfite by ROS injection had an increase by 2. 67 -fold, and the oxidation of ammonium sulfite followed a pseudo zero order kinetics. An increase in <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> accelerated the oxidation of ammonium sulfite, and the oxidation kinetic constant of ammonium sulfite was increased by 5 -fold when the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> increased by 2 -fold...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the solar chimney&# 8217;s stack height, depth, width and inlet position on the interior performance (<b>air</b> temperature and <b>speed</b> at 1. 20 m height above the ground) as well as proposes an optimal tropical solar chimney design. Simulations show that the output air temperature remains constant while the solar chimney&# 8217;s width is the most significant factor influencing output <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> The solar chimney&# 8217;s inlet position has limited influence on the output <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> although regions near the solar chimney&# 8217;s inlet show an increase in <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> Furthermore, a regression model is developed based on the solar chimney&# 8217;s stack height, depth and width to predict the interior <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> To optimize solar chimney in the tropics, the recommendation is to first maximize its width as the interior&# 8217;s width, while allowing its stack height to be the building&# 8217;s height. Lastly, the solar chimney&# 8217;s depth is determined from the regression model by allocating the required interior <b>air</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R

In this study, we examined whether the ground and calculated <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> of four great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) were affected by wind conditions using high-resolution GPS data loggers.

40|$|For {{the design}} of {{naturally}} ventilated buildings, information of <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at the openings of a building is important. However, the only data set usually available to designers is meteorological data, such as wind speed and direction measured at weather stations. This paper explores the ratio of <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at building openings to the wind speed measured at weather stations. Meteorological data from three weather stations as well as air velocity that was obtained through full-scale physical measurements were used in this study. The results showed that <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at building openings was {{about half of the}} wind speed recorded at the closest station to the case study. This ratio reduced to approximately 30 % when comparing to the weather stations located in greater distance and more open areas. Given that <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> at the openings has a direct relation to the ventilation rate, employing these ratios to the available weather data when designing for natural ventilation, can provide more realistic picture of natural ventilation performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The fluids speed measurement, {{particularly}} the <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> measurement {{is very important}} for industrial and laboratory applications. The ultrasonic method is among the most common methods used for determining the <b>air</b> <b>speed.</b> The basic principle to measure a fluid speed, using an ultrasonic transducer, is based on the modification of the apparent propagation speed of an ultrasonic signal caused by the fluid movement. Particularly, the method based on the Transit Time, which can use the techniques of Phase Difference and Time Difference, {{is one of the most}} used. In this work we carry on a comparative study of the uncertainty propagation employing these techniques in ultrasonic anemometers for determining the <b>air</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thermal soaring birds reduce flight-energy {{costs by}} alternatingly gaining {{altitude}} in thermals and gliding across the earth's surface. To {{find out how}} soaring migrants adjust their flight behaviour to dynamic atmospheric conditions across entire migration routes, we combined optimal soaring migration theory with high-resolution GPS tracking data of migrating Honey Buzzards Pernis apivorus and wind data from a global numerical atmospheric model. We compared measurements of gliding <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> to predictions based on two distinct behavioural benchmarks for thermal soaring flight. The first being a time-optimal strategy whereby birds alter their gliding <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> {{as a function of}} climb rates to maximize cross-country <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> over a full climb-glide cycle (Vopt). The second a risk-averse energy-efficient strategy at which birds alter their gliding <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> in response to tailwinds/headwinds to maximize the distance travelled in the intended direction during each glide phase (Vbgw). Honey Buzzards were gliding on average 2. 05 ms- 1 slower than Vopt and 3. 42 ms- 1 faster than Vbgw while they increased <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> with climb rates and reduced <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> in tailwinds. They adopted flexible flight strategies gliding mostly near Vbgw under poor soaring conditions and closer to Vopt in good soaring conditions. Honey Buzzards most adopted a time-optimal strategy when crossing the Sahara, and at the onset of spring migration, where and when they met with the best soaring conditions. The buzzards nevertheless glided slower than Vopt during most of their journeys, probably taking time to navigate, orientate and locate suitable thermals, especially in areas with poor thermal convection,. Linking novel tracking techniques with optimal migration models clarifies the way birds balance different trade-offs during migration...|$|R

50|$|In HVAC, <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> {{is defined}} as the rate of air {{movement}} at a point, without regard to direction. According to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55, it is the average <b>speed</b> of the <b>air</b> to which the body is exposed, with respect to location and time. The temporal average {{is the same as the}} air temperature, while the spatial average is based on the assumption that the body is exposed to a uniform <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> according to the SET thermo-physiological model.However, some spaces might provide strongly nonuniform air velocity fields and consequent skin heat losses that cannot be considered uniform. Therefore, the designer shall decide the proper averaging, especially including <b>air</b> <b>speeds</b> incident on unclothed body parts, that have greater cooling effect and potential for local discomfort.|$|R
