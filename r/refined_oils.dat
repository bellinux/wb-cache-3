40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare the <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> derived from Sardinella longiceps by a {{step-wise}} procedure of degumming, bleaching, and deodorization. The <b>refined</b> sardine <b>oil</b> showed greater susceptibility toward oxidation than the crude oil, but the addition of ethyl acetate fractions of the red seaweeds Hypnea musciformis, Kappaphycus alvarezii, and Jania rubens with great antioxidant potential significantly increased the oxidative stability of the <b>refined</b> <b>oil.</b> The <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> supplementedwith the ethyl acetate fraction of these seaweeds indicated more noteworthy oxidative stability indices (≥ 0. 51 h) than α-tocopherol. The induction time was greater for <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> added with H. musciformis (1. 26 h) than butylated hydroxytoluene (1. 04 h) and α-tocopherol (0. 4 h). No traces of aromatic (δ 6. 7 – 7. 5 ppm), hydroperoxides, and aldehydes (δ 9 – 10 ppm) in the 1 H-NMR spectra of the <b>refined</b> <b>oil</b> supplemented with seaweed extracts at the baseline and after the accelerated storage study demonstrated that the seaweed extracts were able to prevent the formation of secondary oxidation products in the unsaturated system during storage. This study demonstrated the potential of seaweeds as natural alternatives to the synthetic antioxidants to prevent the rancidity of the refined fish for use in food and pharmaceutical industries...|$|R

The blend of <b>refined</b> olive <b>oil</b> and <b>refined</b> palm <b>oil</b> exhibited a higher chemical stability during the frying process than that of <b>refined</b> soya bean <b>oil</b> and <b>refined</b> palm <b>oil.</b> Indeed, the total polar compounds and volatile compounds formed, especially 2, 4 -decadienal, were found to be relatively increased in the refined soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend reaching 36. 50 % and 46. 70 %, respectively, after fifty deep-frying sessions. Moreover, the degradation of linoleic acid and β-sitosterol was significantly (P <  0. 05) observed for the refined soya bean oil/refined palm oil blend. The results have proven that the proper blending of monounsaturated <b>refined</b> olive <b>oil</b> with <b>refined</b> palm <b>oil</b> increases its stability and hence improves the quality of such olive oil during frying process...|$|R

[...] Two new fuel importation complexes were built in the 1950s, one to the south west of Bristol and one in the Stanlow area.
