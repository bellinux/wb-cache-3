60|$|Miss Rebecca Linnet, indeed, was not {{a general}} favourite. While most people thought it a pity that a {{sensible}} woman like Mary had not found a good husband--and even her female friends said nothing more ill-natured of her, than that her face was {{like a piece of}} putty with two Scotch pebbles stuck in it--Rebecca was always spoken of sarcastically, and it was a customary kind of banter with young ladies to recommend her as a wife to any gentleman they happened to be flirting with--her fat, her finery, and her thick ankles sufficing to give piquancy to the joke, notwithstanding the absence of novelty. Miss Rebecca, however, possessed the accomplishment of music, and her singing of 'Oh no, we never mention her', and 'The Soldier's Tear', was so desirable an accession to the pleasures of a tea-party that no one cared to offend her, especially as Rebecca had a high spirit of her own, and in spite of her expansively rounded contour, had a particularly sharp tongue. Her reading had been more extensive than her sister's, embracing most of the fiction in Mr. Procter's circulating library, and nothing but an acquaintance with the course of her studies could afford a clue to the rapid transitions in her dress, which were suggested by the style of beauty, whether sentimental, sprightly, or severe, possessed by the heroine of the three volumes actually in perusal. A piece of lace, which drooped round the edge of her white bonnet one week, had been rejected by the next; and her cheeks, which, on Whitsunday, loomed through a Turnerian haze of network, were, on Trinity Sunday, seen reposing in distinct red outline on her shelving bust, like the sun on a fog-bank. The black velvet, meeting with a crystal clasp, which one evening encircled her head, had on another descended to her neck, and on a third to her waist, suggesting to an active imagination either a magical contraction of the ornament, or a fearful <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> in Miss Rebecca's person. With this constant application of art to dress, she could have had little time for fancy-work, even if she had not been destitute of her sister's taste for that delightful and truly feminine occupation. And here, at least, you perceive the justice of the Milby opinion as to the relative suitability of the two Miss Linnets for matrimony. When a man is happy enough to win the affections of a sweet girl, who can soothe his cares with crochet, and respond to all his most cherished ideas with beaded urn-rugs and chair-covers in German wool, he has, at least, a guarantee of domestic comfort, whatever trials may await him out of doors. What a resource it is under fatigue and irritation to have your drawing-room well supplied with small mats, which would always be ready if you ever wanted to set anything on them! And what styptic for a bleeding heart can equal copious squares of crochet, which are useful for slipping down the moment you touch them? How our fathers managed without crochet is the wonder; but I believe some small and feeble substitute existed in their time under the name of 'tatting'. Rebecca Linnet, however, had neglected tatting as well as other forms of fancy-work. At school, to be sure, she had {{spent a great deal of}} time in acquiring flower-painting, according to the ingenious method then fashionable, of applying the shapes of leaves and flowers cut out in cardboard, and scrubbing a brush over the surface thus conveniently marked out; but even the spill-cases and hand-screens which were her last half-year's performances in that way were not considered eminently successful, and had long been consigned to the retirement of the best bedroom. Thus there was a good deal of family unlikeness between Rebecca and her sister, and I am afraid there was also a little family dislike; but Mary's disapproval had usually been kept imprisoned behind her thin lips, for Rebecca was not only of a headstrong disposition, but was her mother's pet; the old lady being herself stout, and preferring a more showy style of cap than she could prevail on her daughter Mary to make up for her.|$|E

These jets contain {{significant}} kinetic energy, which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades, as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades, {{with a net}} increase in steam velocity across the stage.As the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure (atmospheric pressure, or more usually, the condenser vacuum). Due to this high <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> of steam, the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity.

The model takes the buoyancy forces into account via the Boussinesq approximation. We focus our study on showing the effects of wall shape on the flow and on the temperature inside the thermosyphon. To this extend we determine the dependency of the flow rate and the increase in temperature, on the geometrical characteristics of the loop. The geometry considered is a set of axially symmetric corrugated pipes described by a set of parameters; namely the pipe inner radius, the period of the corrugation, the amplitude of the corrugation, and the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> and contraction regions of a period of the pipe. The governing equations are solved using the Finite Element Method, in combination with an adaptive mesh refinement technique in order to capture the effects of wall shape. We characterize the effects of the amplitude and of the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> and contraction. In particular we show that for a given fixed amplitude it is possible to find an optimal <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> and contraction that minimizes the temperature inside the thermosyphon.

It can realize an improvement of about 7 % in thermal efficiency under WOT,and about 4 % under partial load of BMEP= 0. 2 MPa.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} sought to test the neurodevelopmental {{hypothesis}} of schizophrenia through analysis of cortical gyrification. However, to date, results have been inconsistent. A possible {{reason for this is}} that gyrification measures at the centimeter scale may be insensitive to subtle morphological changes at smaller scales. The lack of consistency in such studies may impede further interpretation of cortical morphology as an aid to understanding the etiology of schizophrenia. In this study we developed a new approach, examining whether millimeter-scale measures of cortical curvature are sensitive to changes in fundamental geometric properties of the cortical surface in schizophrenia. We determined and compared millimeter-scale and centimeter-scale curvature in three separate case-control studies; specifically two adult groups and one adolescent group. The datasets were of different sizes, with different ages and gender-spreads. The results clearly show that millimeter-scale intrinsic curvature measures were more robust and consistent in identifying reduced gyrification in patients across all three datasets. To further interpret this finding we quantified the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> in the upper and lower cortical layers. The results suggest that reduced gyrification in schizophrenia is driven by a reduction in the expansion of upper cortical layers. This may plausibly be related to a reduction in short-range connectivity...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the design of nuclear cooling systems. A Delta Loop was built up in Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) to obtain the experimental data. This loop is a multi-section closed system that differs in diameter from one part to another. Hence an intensive study on the overall and regional corrosion distribution is necessary and valuable. In previous studies, experimental data on this research area is very limited and far from accurate and complete. Simulation and analysis of the above two studies, using a commercial software, are presented in this paper. For analyzing the overall corrosion distribution, the Materials Test Loop has been assumed to be a 5 m long toroidal geometry with a circular cross-section. Wall concentrations obtained from previous analytical studies have been used to impose as boundary condition on the model. For analyzing the provincial concentration dissemination, different flow and geometry conditions, have been modeled. The geometries considered are sudden expansion and sudden contraction. At various Reynolds Number and <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> or contraction, local corrosion rates are presented and analyzed.

40|$|Through {{the various}} LNG cold {{recovery}} applications, cryogenic air separation {{is the only}} one recovering the coldest range of exergy, which is also the most valuable. Several designs of integrated ASU and LNG regasification have been proposed but there is still a lack of fair comparison between the existing options. In this study, promizing configurations have been selected and classified according to the number of columns in the ASU block and the use of LNG cold exergy either for feed air cooling or in the nitrogen liquefaction loop. Each case has been modelized in the commercialized software Aspen HYSYS and evaluated thanks to a range of performance indicators: LNG cold exergy use, work requirement per amont of liquid nitrogen produced, Exergy Transfer Effectiveness and the decomposition of material stream exergy variations both at stream level and at component level. The two first indicators where insufficient to compair fairly the cases and required to scale the designs to a common set of constraints. ETE provided a tool to fairly compare the designs, with regards to all the ASU products, without re-scaling the original models. Yet, the high energy requirements for ASU processes overweighted material stream exergy variations in ETE results, making it close to a <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> to compression work. Further decomposition of material exergy variations confirmed that exergy analysis at component level was more consistant than stream level calculation for processes with a chemical change. Single column designs were more efficient than two-column ASU configurations, the best performing cases among integrated designs being the recuperative vapor recompression ASU using heat pump effect proposed by Fu and Gundersen (2013) followed by the integration of column draws coupled to compression-expansion described by Mehrpooya et al (2015) ...|$|E
40|$|For {{a hungry}} fruit fly, {{locating}} and landing on a fermenting fruit {{where it can}} feed, find mates, and lay eggs, is an essential and difficult task requiring the integration of both olfactory and visual cues. Understanding how flies accomplish this will help provide a comprehensive ethological context for the expanding knowledge of their neural circuits involved in processing olfaction and vision, as well as inspire novel engineering solutions for control and estimation in computationally limited robotic applications. In this thesis, I use novel high throughput methods to develop a detailed overview of how flies track odor plumes, land, and regulate flight speed. Finally, I provide {{an example of how}} these insights can be applied to robotic applications to simplify complicated estimation problems. To localize an odor source, flies exhibit three iterative, reflex-driven behaviors. Upon encountering an attractive plume, flies increase their flight speed and turn upwind using visual cues. After losing the plume, flies begin zigzagging crosswind, again using visual cues to control their heading. After sensing an attractive odor, flies become more attracted to small visual features, which increases their chances of finding the plume source. Their changes in heading are largely controlled by open-loop maneuvers called saccades, which they direct towards and away from visual features. If a fly decides to land on an object, it begins to decelerate so as to maintain a stereotypical <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> to retinal size. Once they reach a stereotypical distance from the target, flies extend their legs in preparation for touchdown. Although it is unclear what cues they use to trigger this behavior, previous studies have indicated that it is likely under visual control. In Chapter 3, I use a nonlinear control theoretic analysis and robotic testbed to propose a novel and putative mechanism for how a fly might visually estimate distance by actively decelerating according to a visual control law. Throughout these behaviors, a common theme is the visual control of flight speed. Using genetic tools I show that the neuromodulator octopamine {{plays an important role in}} regulating flight speed, and propose a neural circuit for how this controller might be implemented in the flies brain. Two general biological and engineering principles are evident across my experiments: (1) complex behaviors, such as foraging, can emerge from the interactions of simple independent sensory-motor modules; (2) flies control their behavior in such a way that simplifies complex estimation problems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thermal stress {{induced by}} the {{mismatch}} <b>of</b> the thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficients between dissimilar materials becomes an important issue in many bi-layered systems, such as composites and micro-electronic devices. It is useful to provide a simple and efficient analytical model, so that the stress level in the layers can be accurately estimated. Basing on the Bernoulli beam theory, a simple but accurate analytical formulation is proposed to evaluate the thermal stresses in a bi-material beam. The analytical results are compared with finite element results. Good agreement demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to provide an efficient way for the calculation of the thermal stresses. It is shown that thermal stresses are linear proportion to the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficients between the two materials. Parametric studies reveal that thermal stresses in each layer are decreasing {{with the increase of}} thickness, and are increasing with the increase <b>of</b> Young’s modulus <b>ratio</b> between the two materials...|$|R

And the concentric-circle model with a fine scaled sinusoidal interface was proposed to describe the stresses distribution on the rough interface of TBCs with macro curved geometry. The influences of the geometric and thermophysical parameters were discussed by the developed model. The results showed that the radial stress on the rough interface can be separated into two sections: the overall level stress from macro surface curvature and the local stress from local asperity of the interface. The overall level stress was determined by the thicknesses and the thermophysical parameters of each layer. It has been found that the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> local stress and overall level stress was influenced by the interface asperity, the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> elastic modulus and the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficients <b>of</b> the layers beside the rough interface.

We categorize thirteen materials, ranging from heavy fermion metals to frustrated magnets, where such experimental signatures have been found. Remarkably, seven stoichiometric materials at ambient pressure show H_c= 0. However, additional thermodynamic and magnetic experiments suggest {{that most of them}} do not show a zero-field QCP. While the existence of a pressure insensitive "strange metal" state is one possibility, for some of the materials Γ_ H seems influenced by impurities or a fraction of moments which are not participating in a frozen state.

40|$|Negative thermal {{expansion}} (NTE) and negative Poisson&# 039;s ratio (NPR) are counterintuitive material properties that have gained popularity {{as the focus}} of many recent works. However, most of the structures previously studied only exhibit NTE or NPR exclusively. One important structure that has already been shown to exhibit NPR is the re-entrant triangle. In this work, the property of NTE in re-entrant triangular cellular structure composed of welded/bonded/brazed ribs of two different materials is investigated via analytical and finite element (FE) modelling. Based on analytical and FE analysis, the geometrical and material parameters for attaining NTE in the re-entrant metamaterial are established. The analysis and simulations reveal the dependence of NTE on the inclination of the longer chevron strut, the dimensionless rod coefficient <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> (CTE), the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficients <b>of</b> constituent struts but independent of scale and temperature.

In this work we study 5 nucleotides: cyclic nucleotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphate, 5 '-adenosine and 5 '-cytidine monophosphate, and also adenosine diphosphate in water. The structures of nucleotides vary systematically, {{which results in}} different physical properties such as acidity, solubility, hydrophobicity, and melting point. We discuss {{the connection between the}} thermal diffusion behavior and the properties of the different nucleotides. Additionally, {{as in the case of}} the alkanes and monoscaccharides, we find a correlation between the thermal diffusion coefficient and the <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> the thermal <b>expansion</b> coefficient and the kinematic viscosity...|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} and thermal {{behaviors of the}} concrete slab are characterized by its modulus <b>of</b> elasticity, Poisson’s <b>ratio,</b> coefficient <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion,</b> and density. Also, the subgrade layer and dowel bars were considered as linear elastic materials characterized by their modulus of elasticity and Poisson’s ratio. In particular, {{the use of a}} finer mesh for the 3 -D dowel bar is imperative to accurately capture the dowel-sliding, shear force transfer, and bearing stresses in the concrete. In this study, the sliding interface was modeled between concrete and dowel bars in order to effectively simulate the dowel bar movement in consideration of the temperature effect.|$|R
40|$|The thermo-mechanical {{analysis}} of a simply supported, functionally graded shell is considered in this work. Refined shell theories are considered to account for grading material variation in the thickness direction. The governing thermodynamical equations are derived from the Principle of Virtual Displacements. The distribution of the temperature field T(z) is not assumed linear in the thickness direction of the layered shells and Fourier&# 039;s heat conduction equation is solved to provide T(z). Classical and higher order shell theories are implemented in cases of both an equivalent single layer and layer-wise variable description by referring to Carrera&# 039;s Unified Formulation. The numerical results show temperature, displacement and stress distributions along the thickness direction. Different volume fractions of the metallic and ceramic constituents as well as different shell thickness <b>ratios</b> and orders <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> are analyzed. These are in good agreement with the quasi- 3 D solution obtained considering mathematical layers with constant properties in the FGM layer and using high orders <b>of</b> <b>expansion...</b>|$|R
