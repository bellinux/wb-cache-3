40|$|Three {{methods to}} {{quantify}} gene transcript levels in mast cells, real-time RT-PCR, competitive RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR analyses, were compared. Linear regression analysis on five gene transcripts {{revealed that the}} mRNA levels measured by <b>real-time</b> RT-PCR <b>analysis</b> were minimally correlated with those by conventional RT-PCR analysis. In addition, differences in the mRNA level between samples measured by conventional RT-PCR analysis were smaller than those by <b>real-time</b> RT-PCR <b>analysis,</b> suggesting that conventional RT-PCR analysis is less sensitive at measuring mRNA levels. Results from competitive RT-PCR analysis correlated closely with those from <b>real-time</b> RT-PCR <b>analysis.</b> When the differences in mRNA level between samples are relatively smaller, however, the correlation tended to be weaker. <b>Real-time</b> RT-PCR <b>analysis</b> has higher reliability, but is expensive. In contrast, competitive RT-PCR analysis is inexpensive, but is weaker at detecting smaller differences in gene transcript level between samples. Therefore, the most appropriate analytical method to measure mRNA levels should be chosen, depending on the experimental conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficient}} {{processing of}} large collections of patterns (Boolean expressions, XPath expressions, or continuous SQL queries) over data streams plays {{a central role}} in major data intensive applications ranging from user-centric processing and personalization to <b>real-time</b> data <b>analysis.</b> On the one hand, emerging user-centric appli-cations, including computational advertising and selective informa-tion dissemination, demand determining and presenting to an end-user only the most relevant content that is both user-consumable and suitable for limited screen real estate of target (mobile) devices. We achieve these user-centric requirements through novel high-dimensional indexing structures and (parallel) algorithms. On the other hand, applications in <b>real-time</b> data <b>analysis,</b> including com-putational finance and intrusion detection, demand meeting strin-gent subsecond processing requirements and providing high-freq-uency and low-latency event processing over data streams. We achieve <b>real-time</b> data <b>analysis</b> requirements by leveraging recon-figurable hardware – FPGAs – to sustain line-rate processing by exploiting unprecedented degrees of parallelism and potential for pipelining, only available through custom-built, application-specific, and low-level logic design. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed tech-niques in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms designed for event processing...|$|R
