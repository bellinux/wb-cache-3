5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to <b>rear</b> <b>children,</b> weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{affect the}} feminization of poverty, and these factors place women {{at high risk}} of poverty. Multiple factors {{contribute}} to women’s economic insecurity, including the gender wage gap, women’s prevalence in low-paid occupations, a lack of work-family supports, and the challenges involved in accessing public benefits. Though low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to <b>rear</b> <b>children.</b> It then lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain formal employment, which in turn deepens the cycle of poverty. As the number of women in poverty increases, the diverse causes affecting their poverty must be examined. Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty. It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{women in}} {{fundamentalist}} groups are often expected to <b>rear</b> <b>children</b> and other domestic tasks, {{it is not}} accurate to assume that all women in polygamous relationships in Mormon fundamentalist groups are powerless. Mormon women in fundamentalist groups experience their gender roles differently than women in the LDS church. In fundamentalists sects, sex {{is viewed as a}} necessary evil for reproduction. Women who are menstruating, lactating, or pregnant are not expected to have sex with their husbands. One fundamentalist women said that because her husband had other wives, she didn't feel pressured to sexually satisfy her husband. Fundamentalist women help their husbands seek other wives, and many say that for their husbands to look for a wife without consulting existing wives would be akin to infidelity. Some wives in polygamous marriages feel closer to their sister wives than to their husbands. In some polygamous relationships, a wife nurtures her husband's relationship with his other wives by encouraging her husband to spend time with them. Sister wives help each other with childrearing, cooking, and other domestic tasks. Women in polygamous relationships have their own bedrooms, while their husbands are treated as visitors. Sister wives also often control the household's finances. The studies that examined the experience of fundamentalist women did not examine underage marriage, which the authors felt was a separate issue. The 2008 police raid of the FLDS Texas compound found that 12 girls were married before age 16 and sexually abused.|$|E

40|$|Background Disorders of {{attachment}} and social engagement have mainly {{been studied in}} <b>children,</b> <b>reared</b> in institutions and foster care. There are few studies amongst home <b>reared</b> <b>children</b> living with biological parents. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the clinical significance of inhibited attachment behaviour and disinhibited social engagement behaviour in young home <b>reared</b> <b>children,</b> referred for treatment of emotional and behavioural problems, compared with young children in treatment foster care. Methods The Disturbances of Attachment Interview, Maltreatment Classification System, the Child Behaviour Checklist and Parenting Stress Index were used in 141 referred home <b>reared</b> <b>children</b> and 59 referred foster children, aged 2. 0 GÇô 7. 9 GÇëyears (MGÇë=GÇë 4. 7, SEGÇë=GÇë 1. 3), 71 % boys. Results Inhibited attachment behaviour was less prevalent in the referred home reared group (9 %) than in the foster care group (27 %). Disinhibited social engagement behaviour was found in 42 % of the home reared group, similar to the foster care group. Inhibited attachment behaviour and disinhibited social engagement behaviour were not associated with child maltreatment. More inhibited attachment behaviour was associated with clinical levels of child internalizing and externalizing behaviour in the home reared group, not in the foster care group. In both groups, more disinhibited social engagement behaviour was associated with clinical levels of externalizing behaviour and with more parenting stress. Conclusions Even without evident links to maltreatment, results of this study suggest clinical significance of inhibited attachment behaviour and disinhibited social engagement behaviour in young home <b>reared</b> <b>children</b> referred for treatment of emotional and behavioural problem...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{experiences}} of Korean mothers in parenting children with Hunter's syn-drome, an X linked recessive genetically inherited disease usually affecting boys. Methods: Data were collected from 14 moth-ers having children with Hunter's syndrome, through two focus group interviews and individual in-depth interviews. Qualitative data from the field notes and transcribed notes were analyzed using the grounded theory methodology developed by Strauss & Corbin (1998). Results: The core category about the process of <b>rearing</b> <b>children</b> with Hunter's syndrome was identified as “navigating in the maze”. The process of <b>rearing</b> <b>children</b> with Hunter's syndrome passed through three phases; ‘entering an unknown region’, ‘struggling to escape from the unknown region’, ‘settling down in the unknown region’. Conclusion: In this study “navigating in the maze”, as the core category deeply showed joys and sorrows of mothers in the process of <b>rearing</b> their <b>children</b> with Hunter's syndrome. In this rearing process they gradually adjusted themselves to their given condition. Also they gained initiatively coping strategies to care for, and protect their children.

40|$|As it is documented, {{investment}} of households in human capital is {{negatively related to}} the number of children individuals will have and requires some loans to be financed. We show that this negative relationship contributes to explain episodes of bubbles that are associated to higher growth rates. This conclusion is obtained in an overlapping generations model where agents choose to invest in a productive asset, that can be interpreted as human capital, and decide their number of children. A bubble allows to smooth consumption and expenses over the life-cycle, and can therefore be used to finance either productive investment or the cost of <b>rearing</b> <b>children.</b> The time cost of <b>rearing</b> <b>children</b> {{plays a key role in}} the analysis. If the time cost per child is sufficiently large, households have only a small number of children. The bubble then has a crowding-in effect because it is used to finance productive investment. On the contrary, if the time cost per child is low enough, households have a large number of children. Then, the bubble is mainly used to finance the total cost of <b>rearing</b> <b>children</b> and has a crowding-out effect on investment. Therefore, the new mechanism we highlight shows that a bubble enhances growth only if the economy is characterized by a high rearing time cost per child...|$|R

6000|$|Now it {{does not}} need {{that you should be}} a Socialist to see how cruel and ridiculous it is to have mothers in such a dilemma.

He declares that we are here in the presence of an unsound and harmful way of regarding parentage; that we treat it as a private affair, that we are still disposed to assume that people's children are almost as much their private concern as their cats, and as little entitled to public protection and assistance. The right view, he maintains, is altogether opposed to this; parentage is a public service and a public duty; a good mother is the most precious type of common individual a community can have, and to let a woman on the one hand earn a living as we do, by sewing tennis-balls or making cardboard boxes or calico, and on the other, not simply not to pay her, but to impoverish her because she bears and makes sacrifices to <b>rear</b> <b>children,</b> is the most irrational aspect of all the evolved and chancy ideas and institutions that make up the modern State.
