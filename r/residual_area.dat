30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to consider the 63 patients who underwent surgery who did not have cancer.

There are personal costs, such as anxiety with associated surgery.

30|$|These {{considerations}} {{should be}} addressed before a new silvicultural scheme is applied at a large scale to avoid unwanted side effects. In the present work, our aim was, therefore, to evaluate the impacts of single-tree selection cutting with two different <b>residual</b> basal <b>areas,</b> upon structural and compositional attributes of old-growth temperate rainforests of the evergreen forest type. We were interested in finding management approaches that could avoid negative impacts on old-growth attributes and associated biodiversity at the stand scale. The objectives were to: (a) quantify the type and magnitude of structural and compositional changes induced through single-tree selection cutting with high <b>residual</b> basal <b>areas</b> (HRBA; 60  m 2  ha− 1) and low <b>residual</b> basal <b>areas</b> (LRBA; 40  m 2  ha− 1); and (b) identify key structural and compositional attributes of old-growthness that were affected through single-tree selection cutting with HRBA and LRBA. Unmanaged and well-conserved forests of the evergreen forest type in Chile reach 80 – 100  m 2  ha− 1 in basal area and support regeneration of almost exclusively shade-tolerant species (Donoso and Nyland 2005). The rationale for these two levels of <b>residual</b> basal <b>areas</b> was, therefore, that single-tree selection with LRBA would create relatively more light availability and was expected to favour the development of both ecologically and economically important mid-tolerant tree species (Donoso 2013). However, there might be trade-offs in terms of greater structural and compositional changes at LRBA compared with HRBA.|$|R

Here, an independent prospective validation {{of these results}} was performed using an overlap-fraction (OF) calculation of various FDG-uptake based thresholds. Data from twelve patients treated at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center with lung cancer were analyzed. All patients underwent two FDG-PET-CT scans, one pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and one approximately three months after treatment (post-RT). Of the twelve analyzed patients, eight patients showed residual FDG uptake on the post-RT scan and were included for analysis. One of these patients had a residue that was not clearly distinguishable from the surrounding tissue due to FDG avid inflammation. Therefore, seven patients remained for further analysis. The mean volume of the <b>residual</b> metabolic-active <b>areas</b> post-RT was 14. 6 +/- 10. 0 % (mean+/-SD) of the mean volume of the gross tumour volume (GTV) pre-RT. The <b>residual</b> metabolic-active <b>areas</b> largely corresponded with the pre-RT GTV (OF= 93. 7 +/- 7. 2 %). The pre-RT-scan threshold delineations of 34 %, 40 % and 50 % of the SUV(max) had a large OF with the residual region, 86. 9 +/- 8. 3 %, 77. 4 +/- 8. 1 % and 67. 9 +/- 6. 8 %, respectively. In this independent dataset, we confirmed that the location of <b>residual</b> FDG-uptake <b>areas</b> after radiotherapy corresponds with the high FDG-uptake areas pre-radiotherapy.

40|$|PURPOSE. We {{set out to}} {{characterize}} the pattern of fundus autofluorescence (AF) loss in choroideremia (CHM) patients of varying ages and disease severity {{in order to determine}} the average rate of progression of this potential disease biomarker. METHODS. Fifty consecutive CHM patients (100 eyes) attending outpatient clinics at Oxford Eye Hospital underwent analysis with the Heidelberg OCT Spectralis with autofluorescence capabilities. The area of residual AF was traced using Heidelberg Eye Explorer. Bland-Altman analysis was used to calculate the coefficient of repeatability (CR). The degree of AF loss was correlated to different ages and the pattern of residual AF constructed into color-coded maps in order to gain insight into the mechanism of disease progression. RESULTS. The CR for measurement of AF area is < 1 %, indicating that a small change is likely to be significant. Correlation of patient age and area of residual AF produced a clinically relevant index of expected anatomic disease. Progression is 7. 7 % of the <b>residual</b> <b>area</b> each year (95 % confidence intervals 7. 0 %- 8. 2 %) and follows a logarithmic pattern with age (r = 0. 95, P < 0. 001). From this we derived the mean half-life of AF as 9 years. Qualitatively, the pattern of remaining AF centered on a point temporal to the fovea. CONCLUSIONS. The area of residual AF in CHM can be measured reproducibly and shows a distinct pattern of loss. The measured <b>residual</b> <b>area</b> is inversely correlated to age. The ratio of the two variables may provide useful information regarding the rate of progression for any one individual at a given point in time...|$|E

MethodsSingle string is a novel method in which, first, the side branch (SB) stent is deployed with a single stent cell protruding into the main branch (MB).

Although corrosion of stirrup do not influence distinctly on the ultimate strength of the columns, the ultimate drift and plastic rotation capacities greatly decrease with increasing the corrosion level.

30|$|A {{significant}} number (13 %) of women after endometrial resection have patent fallopian tubes [11].

40|$|The {{central concern}} of this thesis {{is with the}} degree of freedom of action which {{peripheral}} areas retain in directing their own development.

Theoretical perspectives are drawn from regional economics, and the relationship between centre and periphery. A relational definition of centre and periphery is proposed: that the periphery is a region differentiated from another region, the centre, because it is disadvantaged in an asymeetrical interaction relationship. Examples are taken from the economic geography of Sogn og Fjordane which illustrate this proposal. The scale of the processes which are described is given by an analysis of Population and Agricultural census information for Indre Sogn, an area of the county.
