50|$|Upon {{reaching}} apogee in {{the transfer}} orbit, {{the first stage}} and interstage structure were jettisoned. The second stage then fired to circularize the orbit, after which it released the satellite and, using its attitude control jets, began a <b>retrograde</b> <b>maneuver</b> to enter a lower orbit to avoid any possibility of collision with its payload.|$|E

Captain Ray made detailed plans involving exacting preparations for a movement of major strategic importance and of the most hazardous nature, then executed the mission with marked skill and coolness in the face of greatly superior enemy forces.|$|E
40|$|LANDSAT- 4 (formerly LANDSAT-D) was {{launched}} successfully at 1 : 59 p. m. EDT on July 16, 1982, from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The Delta 3920 launch vehicle performed flawlessly {{and placed the}} satellite into the planned three sigma low orbit of 694 km. The lower orbit was selected to eliminate a <b>retrograde</b> <b>maneuver</b> for the orbit adjust burns necessary to place the satellite into its planned operational 16 -day repeat track at 705 km. Spacecraft separation and the initiation of solar array depolyment occurred, over the Indian Ocean tracking station. Spacecraft attitude rates at separation were low, allowing the Earth sensor to immediately acquire the Earth with the momentum wheels and without use of the propulsion system. All systems activated as of noon on July 18, 1982, are performing well with no significant discrepancies reported...|$|E
40|$|Background—The use of {{percutaneous}} lead extraction {{techniques in}} a patient with extracardiac or protruding atrial leads could have disastrous consequences. Traditionally, the management of these patients has included a median sternotomy. We describe a minimally invasive technique that involves a transatrial, retrograde laser lead extraction using a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach. Methods and Results—Between January 2004 and June 2009, 14 patients with severed leads at the clavicle and extracardiac leads or lead-caused erosions of the atrial wall were identified through chest radiograph and CT scan. There were 9 men and 5 women aged 19 to 91 years (mean age, 69. 7120. 67 years). Ten devices were pacemakers, and 4 were defibrillators. Indications for extraction were 12 infections and 2 malfunctions. Mean ejection fraction was 4217. 67 % (range, 10 % to 65 %). Time of implanted leads was 93. 6951. 88 months (range, 33 to 213 months). Laser sheaths size were 12 F (7. 1 %), 14 F (85. 7 %), and 16 F (7. 1 %). A right-side thoracoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. A <b>retrograde</b> laser sheath <b>maneuver</b> was performed, freeing the lead from any adhesions. The lead was removed and the incision closed. One patient experienced a pleural effusion. There was no mortality, and all patients were alive and well at 1 -month follow-up. Conclusions—Transatrial, retrograde laser lead extraction is a safe and effective procedure. This procedure may provide an excellent alternative to open sternotomy.
