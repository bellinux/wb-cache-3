40|$|International audienceSoftware Radio (SWR) system being a {{combination}} of different standards, where each standard consisting of multicarrier signals makes SWR signal extremely power fluctuating which results in high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). OFDM and SWR signals due to their multi-carrier nature inherit the same PAPR distribution characteristics and this fact {{makes it possible to}} employ already developed OFDM PAPR reduction techniques to SWR signals. Several techniques have been devised to reduce the PAPR of the OFDM signal. One of these PAPR reduction techniques is based on Peak <b>Reducing</b> <b>Carriers</b> (PRC) concept where a set of subcarriers is employed to reduce the temporal signal's peak. This paper employs PRC method for SWR signal PAPR reduction. An SWR base station would transmit a multiplex of standards signal where each standard having its own transmitting power requirements different from the other standards present in the SWR signal. An initial study is done for a bi-standard SWR system to see the variations in PAPR reduction gain with the variations in transmit power gap between the standards. Then PRC method is employed to reduce PAPR of a bi-standard SWR system containing standards with transmit power gap of 25 dB. PAPR is not only reduced by using in-band unused carriers of the standards as peak <b>reducing</b> <b>carriers</b> but also some inter-standard free carriers are also used to reduce PAPR. The PAPR reduction performance by in-band and out-of-band peak <b>reducing</b> <b>carriers</b> is compared.

5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, SPV {{measurements}} involve monitoring {{the potential of}} a semiconductor surface while generating electron-hole pairs with a light source. The surfaces of semiconductors are often depletion regions (or space charge regions) where a built-in electric field due to defects has swept out mobile charge carriers. A <b>reduced</b> <b>carrier</b> density means that the electronic energy band of the majority carriers is bent away from the Fermi level. This band-bending {{gives rise to a}} surface potential. When a light source creates electron-hole pairs deep within the semiconductor, they must diffuse through the bulk before reaching the surface depletion region. The photogenerated minority carriers have a shorter diffusion length than the much more numerous majority carriers, with which they can radiatively recombine. The change in surface potential upon illumination is therefore a measure of the ability of minority carriers to reach the surface, namely the minority carrier diffusion length. As always in diffusive processes, the diffusion length [...] is approximately related to the lifetime [...] by the expression , where [...] is the diffusion coefficient. The diffusion length is independent of any built-in fields in contrast to the drift behavior of the carriers.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some forms}} of AM, the carrier may be reduced, to save power. The term DSB - <b>Reduced</b> <b>Carrier</b> {{normally}} implies enough carrier remains in the transmission to enable a receiver circuit to regenerate a strong carrier or at least synchronise a phase-locked loop but there are forms where the carrier is removed completely, producing double sideband with suppressed carrier (DSB-SC). Suppressed carrier systems require more sophisticated circuits in the receiver and some other method of deducing the original carrier frequency. An example is the stereophonic difference (L-R) information transmitted in stereo FM broadcasting on a 38 kHz subcarrier where a low-power signal at half the 38-kHz carrier frequency is inserted between the monaural signal frequencies (up to 15 kHz) and {{the bottom of the}} stereo information sub-carrier (down to 38-15 kHz, i.e. 23kHz). The receiver locally regenerates the subcarrier by doubling a special 19 kHz pilot tone. In another example, the quadrature modulation used historically for chroma information in PAL television broadcasts, the synchronising signal is a short burst of a few cycles of carrier during the [...] "back porch" [...] part of each scan line when no image is transmitted. But in other DSB-SC systems, the carrier may be regenerated directly from the sidebands by a Costas loop or squaring loop. This is common in digital transmission systems such as BPSK where the signal is continually present.|$|E
