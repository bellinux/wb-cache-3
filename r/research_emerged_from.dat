The research took a large Chinese manufacturing firm as a case study. A theoretical ERP risk ontology, which was adopted from our previous research, was used to frame the study and generate data collection tools. Questionnaire was used to explore ERP risks in the selected case company, from which 42 valid responses were received and analysed. The study identified 37 ERP exploitation risks, of which seven were identified as the most critical to the case company. It concluded that, in contrast with technical risks, organisational and human-related risks are more crucial to potential ERP failures...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} Sustainable Community Development (SCD) {{in the context}} of the Baltic Sea Region. The research focuses on understanding a model for SCD piloted in Robertsfors, Sweden. The model is said to be transferable to any community around the world. This study seeks to understand the concepts and tools used in the Robertsfors Model. It also examines whether the model is strategic with regards to sustainability and whether it is successful in engaging the local community around these issues. Considerations for transferability are also addressed, focusing specifically on the Eastern Baltic Sea Region. Opportunities for improving the model are also studied. A combination of secondary research, in the form of literature review and primary research (structured interviews and questionnaires) was used to explore these questions.

40|$|ArticleThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from MHRA via the DOI in this record. Russia's Civil War {{was a period of}} escalating violence as the Bolsheviks struggled to retain power, yet it was also a period of numerous amnesties. This article analyses the nature and impact of these amnesties, and explores their value to the Bolsheviks. These amnesties were not a sign of mercy; they never admitted mistakes or granted innocence, but excused or underplayed crimes and their significance. Instead, amnesties had a range of practical and political functions for the state, not least of which was to act as a ‘safety valve’ to release burgeoning pressures on the fledgling justice system and tensions between state and society. The majority of the research for this article was funded by a research fellowship from The Leverhulme Trust and I am very grateful for their support.

40|$|This <b>research</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> {{the idea}} that the {{education}} system in Romania would achieve efficiency and applicability if it acknowledged the needs of students, who are in fact the ones who benefit from the system.

The aim {{of this study is that}} of identifying and reporting the students’ views on Geography as a subject, with a view to materializing its findings, particularly at this stage when the education system is redefining itself. In this context,after designing the questionnaire, we administered it to 120 12 th grade students from three high schools in Baia Mare. The interpretation of the results enabled us to draw some conclusions which reflected a significant gap between students’ expectations and what we considered to be in line with the requirements of a society based on knowledge, globalization, and what they were offered by the education system in terms of Geography...|$|E

The first stage in designing the system is to conduct a comprehensive requirements study to understand specific student and staff needs in the envisaged scenario. As part of the requirements study we were interested in identifying weaknesses in the current mode of teaching, as well as problems students currently experience in understanding key concepts. We found that students did not stay adequately focused on the task and failed to identify appropriate technologies. We also noted scope for further support with analysing their findings.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a survey of}} literature reviews {{in the area of}} lot sizing. Its intention is to show which streams of <b>research</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> Harris' seminal lot size model, and which major achievements have been accomplished in the respective areas. We first develop the methodology of this review and then descriptively analyze the sample. Subsequently, a content-related classification scheme for lot sizing models is developed, and the reviews contained in our sample are discussed in light of this classification scheme. Our analysis shows that various extensions of Harris' lot size model were developed over the years, such as lot sizing models that include multi-stage inventory systems, incentives, or productivity issues. The aims of our tertiary study are the following: firstly, it helps primary researchers to position their own work in the literature, to reproduce the development of different types of lot sizing problems, and to find starting points if they intend to work in a new research direction. Secondly, the study identifies several topics that offer opportunities for future secondary research...|$|E

To help bridge this gap, we elucidate the dominant understandings of reciprocity, ask which areas of <b>research</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> them, and explore how they interconnect. Our bibliometric methodology detects four clusters of management research on reciprocity. Across these clusters, authors subscribe mainly to substantialist ontology, marginalize morally oriented motives consistent with relational ontology, and largely assume that benefit-oriented motives underlie reciprocity. We outline the advantages of a moral-oriented relationalist concept of reciprocity and discuss potential areas for its development in management research.|$|R

40|$|English {{language}} {{has been applied}} as a general subject at the tertiary level education in all the faculties of Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal and treated {{as a second language}} (ESL) or a foreign language (EFL). It is also regarded as an international language. The latest change in the curriculum took place in 1997 and since then no research has been done on the effectiveness of the curriculum yet. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the EFL curriculum effectiveness and help to improve it.

40|$|The present work aims {{reflecting}} on the position held by psychoanalysts when analyzing drug-addicted individuals. This <b>research</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> the difficulty to understand the position required by a drug-addicted patient, examined by this researcher at the CET (Centro de Estudos das Toxicomanias Dr. Claude Olievenstein [Center of Studies in Drug Addiction Dr. Claude Olievenstein]), at UFPR. To elucidate the questions this case brought up, a revision of the psychoanalytical literature on {{the position of the}} analyst and on the treatment of drug addictions was carried out. Based on the analysis of the Myth of Chiron, the Wounded Healer, we try to understand the dimension of "healing" that requires the analyst take the stand of a "forever wounded healer", since the idea present in the myth is that Chiron was able to become an excellent healer because of his own incurable wound. Chiron's wound, which he used as a resource to understand the suffering of those he cured, is thus related to the transfer process present in an analysis. In this paper it's elucidated the process experienced by the analyst of 'being affected' by the suffering of the others as a possibility of analytical bounding for the drug-addicted patient...|$|E
