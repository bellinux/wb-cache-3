40|$|Background: Several simple {{clinical}} grading {{scores have}} been developed for intracerebral hemorrhage, primarily to predict 30 -day mortality. Aims: We aimed to determine the accuracy of three popular scores (original intracerebral hemorrhage, modified intracerebral hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage grading scale) on 30 -day mortality and 90 -day death or major disability, and whether the magnitude of benefit varies according to prognosis graded by the three predictive scores. Methods: Data from the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial which included 2839 intracerebral hemorrhage patients (< 6 hours) and elevated systolic blood pressure (150 - 220 mmHg), randomized to intensive (target systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg) or guideline-based (< 180 mmHg) blood pressure management. Discrimination of scales for predicting death and poor outcome (modified Rankin scale 3 - 6) was evaluated in area under <b>receiver</b> <b>operator</b> characteristic curves. Results: Among 2556 (90 %) participants with available data, the modified intracerebral hemorrhage had the highest discrimination (<b>receiver</b> <b>operator</b> characteristic 0 · 75) for 90 -day poor outcome compared with the original intracerebral hemorrhage (<b>receiver</b> <b>operator</b> characteristic 0 · 68) and intracerebral hemorrhage grading scale (<b>receiver</b> <b>operator</b> characteristic 0 · 69). All scores had good positive predictive value (approximately 80 - 90 %) for poor outcome but poor sensitivity and positive predictive value for death. The scores do not clearly discriminate a patient group most likely to benefit from blood pressure lowering. Conclusions: Intracerebral hemorrhage prognostic scores are not useful in defining patients at high probability of early death, but they are reliable for predicting poor outcome, defined by death or major disability. Potential benefits of early intensive blood pressure lowering are broadly applicable across grades of severity defined by such scores...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Prosthetic joint {{infection}} is usually treated using surgery and antibiotics. The {{response to the}} treatment regimen is often evaluated using serial monitoring of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In order to examine how useful this monitoring is, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of CRP concentrations for predicting treatment failure.

25|$|One {{very early}} {{experiment}} in electrical telegraphy was an electrochemical telegraph {{created by the}} German physician, anatomist, and inventor Samuel Thomas von Sömmering in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish polymath and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo. Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) in order to visually represent most Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von Sömmering's design), {{with each of the}} telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. As an electric current was applied by the sender representing each character of a message, it would at the recipient's end electrolyse the acid in its corresponding tube, releasing a stream of hydrogen bubbles next to its associated letter or numeral.

Of the 801 incident {{type 2 diabetes}} cases identified in the cohort during 7 years of follow-up, 579 remained for analyses after exclusions.

40|$|Decision-making in an {{uncertain}} environment {{is driven by}} two major needs: exploring the environment to gather information or exploiting acquired knowledge to maximize reward. The neural processes underlying exploratory decision-making have been mainly studied by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, overlooking any information about the time when decisions are made. Here, we carried out an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, in order to detect {{the time when the}} brain generators responsible for these decisions have been sufficiently activated to lead to the next decision. Our analyses, based on a classification scheme, extract time-unlocked voltage topographies during reward presentation and use them to predict the type of decisions made on the subsequent trial. Classification accuracy, measured as the area under the <b>Receiver</b> <b>Operator's</b> Characteristic curve was on average 0. 65 across 7 subjects.

On an individual subject basis, distributed source estimations were performed on the extracted topographies to statistically evaluate the neural correlates of decision-making.
