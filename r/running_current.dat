25|$|A {{turning point}} was the 1997 Asian BoP Crisis, where unsympathetic {{responses}} by western powers caused policy makers in emerging economies to re-assess {{the wisdom of}} relying on the free market; by 1999 the developing {{world as a whole}} stopped <b>running</b> <b>current</b> account deficits while the U.S. current account deficit began to rise sharply.|$|E
25|$|By 1999, the 1997 Asian {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} harsh response by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had already caused free market policies {{to be at least}} partially discredited in the eyes of developing world policy makers. The developing world as a whole stopped <b>running</b> <b>current</b> account deficits in 1999, {{largely as a result of}} government interventions to devalue the countries' currencies, which would help build foreign reserves to protect against future crises and help them enjoy export led growth rather than just rely on market forces.|$|E

2500|$|From 2003, economists such as Michael P. Dooley, Peter M. Garber, and David Folkerts-Landau {{began writing}} papers {{describing}} {{the emergence of}} a new international system involving an interdependency between states with generally high savings in Asia lending and exporting to western states with generally high spending. Similar to the original Bretton Woods, this included Asian currencies being pegged to the dollar, though this time by the unilateral intervention of Asian governments in the currency market to stop their currencies appreciating.

2500|$|A magnetic-hydraulic {{circuit breaker}} uses a solenoid coil to provide {{operating}} force {{to open the}} contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic [...] breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, {{the speed of the}} solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal <b>running</b> <b>current</b> for motor starting, energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.|$|E

60|$|Within an hour it {{was decided}} that we three were to carry Captain Bowman's report to Major Clarke, and when I lay down to sleep that night it was with the {{knowledge}} that at the first light of dawn we would begin the sixty-mile journey, counting on making it within four-and-twenty hours with but little labor, since from this point we could proceed in a canoe, aided by the swiftly <b>running</b> <b>current.</b>|$|E

Then he showed what had hitherto been spent for various benevolent purposes connected with the schools and his establishments at Spindlewood.

It was 1906; I was fifty; I published {{my own view}} of evolution in a play called Man and Superman; and I found that most people were unable to understand how I could be an Evolutionist and not a Neo-Darwinian, or why I habitually derided Neo-Darwinism as a ghastly idiocy, and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions. It was {{in the hope of}} making me clear the matter up that the Fabian Society, which was then organizing a series of lectures on Prophets of the Nineteenth Century, asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet Darwin. I did so; and scraps of that lecture, which was never published, variegate these pages.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a <b>running</b> <b>current</b> overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal <b>running</b> <b>current</b> without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E

50|$|Across-the line {{starting}} of induction motors {{is accompanied}} by inrush currents up to 7-10 times higher than <b>running</b> <b>current,</b> and starting torque up to 3 times higher than running torque. The increased torque results in sudden mechanical stress on the machine {{which leads to a}} reduced service life. Moreover, the high inrush current stresses the power supply, which may lead to voltage dips. As a result, lifespan of sensitive equipment may be reduced.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by <b>running</b> <b>currents</b> through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|R
