40|$|Purpose:To {{evaluate}} arterio-venous {{transit time}} (AVTT) of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> of the optic nerve head (ONH) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods:Circulation {{times of the}} <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> of the ONH were quantified - in 35 POAG and 35 age-matvhed controls - using an objective, electronic guided examination of a high speed dynamic fluorescein angiography. AVTT of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> of the ONH was compared between groups, and vs ONH morphology and visual field defects. Results: AVTT of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> of the ONH was significantly: higher in POAG patients vs controls (2. 28 vs 1. 29 sec; p<. 001), and related to ONH morphology and field defects. Conclusion: AVTT of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> of the ONH may be exactly quantified and may represent a new, objective parameter of glaucomatous damage...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a laminar neural-field model of {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) consisting of a <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> of neurons that encode the spatial location and orientation of a local visual stimulus coupled to a deep layer of neurons that only encode spatial location. The spatially-structured connections in the deep layer support the propagation of a traveling front, which then drives propagating orientation-dependent activity in the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer.</b> Using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we establish {{that the existence of}} a coherent orientation-selective wave relies on the presence of weak, long-range connections in the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> that couple cells of similar orientation preference. Moreover, the wave persists in the presence of feedback from the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> to the deep layer.

Three models of layers were used to investigate this pattern of frailty. First, primary neurons from E 14 and E 17 embryonic murine cortices, corresponding respectively to future deep and <b>superficial</b> <b>layers,</b> were treated either with Aβ 1 - 42, okadaic acid, or kainic acid.

Anatomical tracing experiments with fluorescent microspheres revealed that a retinotopic map is present in the newborn ferret SC. Aspiration of the caudal region of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> of the right SC on postnatal day 0 did not cause a reorganization of this projection. Consequently, recordings made when the animals were mature showed that visual units in the remaining <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> in rostral SC had receptive fields that spanned a restricted region of anterior space. Auditory units recorded beneath the remaining <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> were tuned to corresponding anterior locations. Both the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> visual map and the deeper layer auditory map were normal in the left, unoperated SC. The majority of auditory units recorded throughout the deeper layers ventral to the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> lesion were also tuned to single sound directions. In this region of the SC, however, we observed much greater scatter in the distribution of preferred sound directions and {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of units with spatially ambiguous responses. The auditory representation was degraded, although many of these units were also visually responsive. Equivalent lesions of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> made in adult ferrets did not alter the topographic order in the auditory representation, suggesting that visual activity in these layers may be involved in aligning the different sensory maps in the developing SC.

40|$|New {{approaches}} to the clinical treatment of traumatic nerve injuries may one day utilize stem cells to enhance nerve regeneration. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) are found in abundant quantities and can be harvested by minimally invasive procedures that should facilitate their use in such regenerative applications. We have analyzed the properties of human ASC isolated from the deep and <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> of abdominal fat tissue obtained during abdominoplasty procedures. Cells from the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> proliferate significantly faster than those from the deep layer. In both the deep and <b>superficial</b> <b>layers,</b> ASC express the pluripotent stem cell markers oct 4 and nanog and also the stro- 1 cell surface antigen. <b>Superficial</b> <b>layer</b> ASC induce the significantly enhanced outgrowth of neurite-like processes from neuronal cell lines when {{compared with that of}} deep layer cells. However, analysis by reverse transcription with the polymerase chain reaction and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has revealed that ASC isolated from both layers express similar levels of the following neurotrophic factors: nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, human ASC show promising potential for the treatment of traumatic nerve injuries. In particular, <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> ASC warrant further analysis of their neurotrophic molecules...|$|R

5000|$|The {{entorhinal cortex}} (EC) is {{composed}} of six <b>layers.</b> <b>Superficial</b> <b>layer</b> I consists largely of afferent fibers onto the apical dendrites of the cells in layers II-VI. Caudal levels project strongly to rostral levels. Within each EC area, deeper <b>layers</b> innervate <b>superficial</b> <b>layers,</b> with <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> innervating adjacent <b>superficial</b> <b>layers.</b> Entorhinal pyramidal cells of layer V receive strong input from the perirhinal cortex and sensory cortices. [...] These pyramidal cells then project into the <b>superficial</b> entorhinal <b>layer</b> II and III cells. Layer V EC cells have strong recurrent excitatory synapses much like CA3 layers in the hippocampus and when provoked are capable of burst activity. Medial to lateral entorhinal area connections are sparse and principally project from the medial EC to the lateral EC. These connections are not reciprocal. The majority of cells in the EC are pyramidal. More than 90% of layer V cells are regular spiking, {{with only a few}} burst-firing and fast-spiking cells. GABA is strong in <b>superficial</b> <b>layers.</b> Horizontal slice tissue preparations of both EC and hippocampus tissues show that exposure to low magnesium ion concentrations produces protracted seizure events. This response is likely a result of the interconnections of layer V pyramidal cells. Increases in extracellular potassium in seizures are seen in deeper layers. These responses are accurate reflections of in-vivo animal models.|$|R

40|$|The firing {{rates of}} neurons in {{primary visual cortex}} (V 1) are {{suppressed}} by large stimuli, an effect known as surround suppression. In cats and monkeys, the strength of suppression is sensitive to orientation; responses to regions containing uniform orientations are more suppressed than those containing orientation contrast. This effect {{is thought to be}} important for scene segmentation, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We asked whether it is possible to study these mechanisms in the visual cortex of mice, because of recent advances in technology for studying the cortical circuitry in mice. It is unknown whether neurons in mouse V 1 are sensitive to orientation contrast. We measured the orientation selectivity of surround suppression in the different layers of mouse V 1. We found strong surround suppression in layer 4 and the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers,</b> part of which was orientation tuned: iso-oriented surrounds caused more suppression than cross-oriented surrounds. Surround suppression was delayed relative to the visual response and orientation-tuned suppression was delayed further, suggesting two separate suppressive mechanisms. Previous studies proposed that surround suppression depends on the activity of inhibitory somatostatin-positive interneurons in the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers.</b> To test the involvement of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> we topically applied lidocaine. Silencing of the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> did not prevent orientation-tuned suppression in layer 4. These results show that neurons in mouse V 1, which lacks orientation columns, show orientation-dependent surround suppression in layer 4 and the <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> and that surround suppression in layer 4 does not require contributions from neurons in the <b>superficial</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{ventricular}} zone (VZ) of the embryonic dorsal telencephalon {{is a major}} {{site for}} generating cortical projection neurons. The transcription factor Pax 6 is highly expressed in apical progenitors (APs) residing in the VZ from the earliest stages of corticogenesis. Previous studies mainly focused on Pax 6 −/− mice have implicated Pax 6 in regulating cortical progenitor proliferation, neurogenesis, and formation of <b>superficial</b> cortical <b>layers.</b> We analyzed the developing cortex of PAX 77 transgenic mice that overexpress Pax 6 in its normal domains of expression. We show that Pax 6 overexpression increases cell cycle length of APs and drives the system toward neurogenesis. These effects are specific to late stages of corticogenesis, when <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> neurons are normally generated, in cortical regions that express Pax 6 at the highest levels. The number of <b>superficial</b> <b>layer</b> neurons is reduced in postnatal PAX 77 mice, whereas radial migration and lamina specification of cortical neurons are not affected by Pax 6 overexpression. Conditional deletion of Pax 6 in cortical progenitors at midstages of corticogenesis, by using a tamoxifen-inducible Emx 1 -CreER line, affected both numbers and specification of late-born neurons in <b>superficial</b> <b>layers</b> of the mutant cortex.

However, to make full use of this wealth of information, further progress is needed to extend the qualitative interpretation of data to a more quantitative evaluation of the explored terrain. To that intent, we developed a two-step process: In the first step, a ID electric model is fitted to the data over the full explored area, {{and in the second}} step, using the moment method, localized 3 D interpretation is applied to limited areas, for which the characteristics of a given feature require closer scrutiny. After a first test with synthetic data generated using the surface integral 3 D modeling method, this process was applied to three different archaeological sites and one test site, for both handheld pole-pole array systems and a multipole continuous electric profiling mechanically pulled system. At the test site, the characteristics of a known wall were accurately recovered. At the Duntzenheim site, the thickness and width of the archaeological remains determined by 3 D interpretation corresponded to the features observed through excavation. At the other two sites, 3 D interpretation made it possible to establish that the conductive features extend across {{the full extent of the}} <b>superficial</b> <b>resistive</b> second <b>layers...</b>|$|R

We studied the communication between deep and <b>superficial</b> entorhinal <b>layers</b> in the anaesthetized rat using field potential recordings, current source density analysis and single unit measurements. We found that subiculum stimulation was able to excite entorhinal neurons in deep layers.

Our investigation is based on finding the role of group III mGluRs in synaptic facilitation and depression in controlling synchronous network activity in the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). We expected that there might be influence between the <b>superficial</b> and deep <b>layers</b> of the mEC, so we gave a cut at the CA 3 region of the hippocampus and recorded the oscillations.
