These concerns stem from the expected strain on social security and health systems when this generation leaves the paid workforce. <b>Retirement</b> <b>planning</b> has been identified by social science researchers as one way of protecting pre-retirees’ future well-being, {{but there are many}} problems within this research. For example, the long-term benefits of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> are yet to be confirmed, the causal relationships between socioeconomic, psychological, and demographic variables have been under-theorised, and existing conceptualisations of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> have not adequately captured the construct. This has had implications for the resultant measures and for the development of new <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> knowledge. A programme comprising four studies was designed to address these limitations in the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> research. For Study One, longitudinal data from the American Health and Retirement Survey were used to illustrate the prospective benefits of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> on well-being in later life. For Study Two, a sub-sample of 2, 277 working men and women from the New Zealand Health, Work, and Retirement survey, was used to theorise and model the causal effects of SES, work involvement, and retirement perceptions on <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> from a gendered perspective. Study Three described the development and validation of a comprehensive and theoretically driven measure of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> using a population sample of 1, 449 New Zealand pre-retirees. Fifty two items were developed to assess each stage of the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> process for financial, health, lifestyle, and psychosocial planning. The final study used the same data to examine the relationships between certain psychological, socioeconomic, and demographic variables and the process of <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> The results indicated that these variables were inconsistently correlated with the different stages III of the planning process. These inconsistencies were theorised as barriers to completing the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> process. Overall, the results of the four studies indicate that <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> predicts well-being and that certain groups are less prepared than others. Conceptualising <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> as a process has the potential to build on our current understandings by generating research questions that have not previously been considered.

40|$|Researchers {{consistently}} {{conclude that}} finances and health {{are the two}} most significant factors associated with retirement decision-making and a successful <b>retirement</b> experience. <b>Retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is one mechanism by which individuals prepare for the retirement transition; however, <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> routinely emphasizes financial concerns, often to the exclusion of health or other significant aspects of <b>retirement.</b> <b>Retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is an increasingly relevant topic {{at a time when the}} population is aging, company-sponsored pensions and retiree benefits have diminished significantly, and reform is being sought for the long-standing social programs that have provided support for generations of older Americans. From a financial perspective, few would question the positive benefits associated with retirement planning; however, preparing for a healthy retirement is equally important. If a relationship between <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> and health status were to be established, Americans might find increased public and private support for individual <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> efforts, particularly among more vulnerable populations such as minorities and women. This dissertation explores the notion that engagement in <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> is associated with health status through three studies. Utilizing data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the first article explores prevalence of <b>plans</b> for <b>retirement</b> among worker and retiree respondents, and compares health and other key characteristics associated with planning among the two sub-samples. The second and third articles focus on time order relationships between health status and <b>retirement</b> <b>planning,</b> with article two addressing the question of whether onset of poor health precedes <b>planning</b> for <b>retirement</b> and article three examining health status of planners versus non-planners, over time, to determine whether those who engage in <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> are more likely to realize better health outcomes.

40|$|Abstract: Saving for {{retirement}} {{is a central}} concern for governments all over the world. Increasing longevity and {{the rising cost of}} post-retirement medical cover for members who fail to save enough {{for retirement}} becomes the responsibility of the governments. Of greatest concern are individuals who deliberately opt not to plan and save for retirement. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate how behavioural factors influence the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> of middle and high income earners in South Africa. A sample of 1 880 pre-retirees earning more than R 16 000 per month was selected from four economic sectors (mining, finance, trade and manufacturing) in South Africa. Online questionnaires were administered to gather data on behavioural factors that influence <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. The data was statistically analysed to determine the significance of the factors that influence the <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour of the respondents. It was found that while some variables (retirement goal clarity and self-rated knowledge of financial planning) had a strong and significant correlation with <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour, future time perspective and potential conflicts to retirement had weak and insignificant relation to <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. Regression analysis was also applied to test the extent to which the observed behavioural factors influence <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour. All six psychological variables (planning activity level, goal clarity, future time perspective, risk tolerance, self-rated knowledge of financial planning and potential conflicts to retirement) were found to influence <b>retirement</b> <b>planning.</b> The regression model explained 62 % of the variability in <b>retirement</b> <b>planning</b> behaviour of middle and high income earners in South Africa.

25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor <b>retirement</b> <b>plan</b> for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental <b>retirement</b> <b>plan</b> unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.|$|E

Under FERS, senators contribute 1.3% of their salary into the FERS <b>retirement</b> <b>plan</b> and pay 6.2% of their salary in Social Security taxes. The amount of a senator's pension depends on the years of service and the average of the highest 3 years of their salary. The starting amount of a senator's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of their final salary. In 2006, the average annual pension for retired senators and representatives under CSRS was $60,972, while those who retired under FERS, or in combination with CSRS, was $35,952.|$|E
