While {{a number of}} solutions have been proposed, such as network capabilities, thirdparty traffic scrubbing, and overlay-based protection, most suffer from drawbacks that limit their applicability in practice. We propose CAT, a new network-based flood protection scheme. In CAT, all flows must perform a three-way handshake with an in-network element to obtain permission to send data. The three-way handshake dissuades source spoofing and establishes a unique handle for the flow, which can then be used for <b>revocation</b> <b>by</b> the receiver. CAT offers the protection qualities of network capabilities, and yet does not require major architectural changes. ...|$|R
50|$|If the {{foreigner}} {{is able to}} clear up the facts after a successful application, the asylum {{which is based on}} incorrect or incomplete information will usually be considered for a possible <b>revocation</b> <b>by</b> the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. Parallel to this procedure the authorities can, if necessary, make further decisions and can even disregard deception which was relevant for the right of residence or deception for the right of residence which was used a long time ago. The verification can, however, also lead to a deportation. In some federal states of Germany false or incomplete information can exclude a consideration of the Hardship Commission.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2006, Panday invited estranged former Attorney General, Ramesh Lawerence Maharaj {{back into}} the UNC.

Following this came the resignation from the Senate of Roy Augustus. Panday replaced Montano with Dr. Tim Gopeesingh, a loyalist and CEO of the UNC and Augustus with former Trinidad and Tobago sprint star Ato Boldon.

The strike, led by Brendan Hughes, was called off before any deaths, when the Government seemed to offer to concede their demands; however, the Government then reneged {{on the details of}} the agreement. [...] The prisoners then called another hunger strike the following year. This time, instead of many prisoners striking at the same time, the hunger strikers started fasting one after the other in order to maximise publicity over the fate of each one.|$|R
30|$|Also, Rajaram and Palaniswami [19] {{designed}} a high performance CA that supports certificate renewal, revocation, and resists to various outside attacks. Their scheme supports routing cum forwarding (RCF) of packet monitoring, certification revival, and certificate <b>revocation.</b> <b>By</b> monitoring RCF behavior, the malicious nodes are detected by monitoring the behavior hop-by-hop. Certificate revival uses a redundancy scheme {{in which a}} node is allocated more than one key share by incorporating redundancy into the network. This mechanism guarantees that genuine nodes can continue {{to stay in the}} network by revival of their certificates along a periodical time period. Certificate revocation provides the authority to isolate any malicious nodes or regain the nodes which turn up to its best state after any attack or failure.|$|R
50|$|The Minnesota Department of Corrections also {{implemented}} the Circles of Support and Accountability program {{as part of}} its reentry efforts. In 2013, preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial compared 31 Core Members from the Minnesota CoSA (MnCoSA) program with a non-CoSA control sample by prospectively randomly assigning participants to separate groups who either received CoSA or supervision-as-usual. The authors reported a non-significant reduction in sexual recidivism over an average 2-year follow-up, but a significant reduction of 40% in re-arrests (for any offense). Further analysis revealed that participation in MnCoSA significantly reduced the chance (hazard ratio) of re-arrest by 62%, of technical violation <b>revocations</b> <b>by</b> 72%, and any re-incarceration by 84%. No significant reductions in the chance of reconviction or new offense re-incarcerations were reported.|$|R

Save {{for certain}} {{possible}} exceptions, discussed below, the principal may summarily revoke the agent’s authority {{to perform a}} juristic act on the principal’s behalf, if the act in question has not already been performed. This is so even if the authority is expressed to be irrevocable. If Arthur, for example, engages Boucher to find a suitable person to buy Arthur’s house, and authorises Boucher to sell the house, Arthur may revoke the authority granted to Boucher. After such revocation, Boucher cannot bind Arthur to a sale of the house, though Boucher may claim damages from Arthur for breach of contract. In order to be effective as against interested third parties, however, the revocation of authority must be communicated to such third parties.|$|R

25|$|A {{decision}} of the EPO to revoke a European patent is final (when the opportunity to appeal before the EPO is exhausted), which makes the opposition proceedings at the EPO especially attractive for opponents. In contrast, a {{decision of}} the EPO not to revoke a European patent (the decision instead maintaining the patent as granted or in an amended form) leaves the way open for <b>revocation</b> <b>by</b> the national court. The EPO decision does not create an estoppel precluding a subsequent challenge by an unsuccessful opponent {{at the national level}} (at least before the English courts). The validity of a European patent can be scrutinised both at the national level, before a national court, and at the international level, before the European Patent Office during opposition. The same is not true for infringement proceedings, upon which national courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a revocation model for handling personal data in cyberspace. The model {{is motivated by}} a series of workshops undertaken by the EnCoRe project aimed at understanding the control requirements of a variety of data subjects. We observe that {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the various technical options available for implementing revocation preferences, and introduce the concept of informed <b>revocation</b> <b>by</b> analogy to Faden and Beauchamp’s informed consent. We argue that we can overcome the limitations associated with informed consent via the implementation of EnCoRe technology solutions. Finally, we apply our model and demonstrate its validity to a number of datahandling scenarios which have arisen in the context of the EnCoRe research project. We have found that users tend to alter their default privacy preferences when they are informed of all the different types of revocation available to them...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tractable structural model whereby controlling equity holders are {{also among the}} creditors of the firm. As the firm approaches distress, equity holders can depauperate the firm and expropriate other creditors by repaying their credit before bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court's right to revoke such repayment protects arm's length creditors, reduces the cost of borrowing and induces equity holders to anticipate repayment of their credit. Equity holders decide repayment neither too early nor too late, so as {{to reduce the risk}} of repayment <b>revocation</b> <b>by</b> the bankruptcy court. Similar conclusions apply to the preferential repayment of bank loans personally guaranteed by equity holders. The analysis also suggests that callable bearer bonds may be more valuable to equity holders than to other creditors. equity holders's credit, debt repayment, assets liquidation, revocatoria, debt valuation, default, structural model...|$|R
