30|$|In {{realistic}} environment, {{speech is}} often corrupted by acoustic interference. Meanwhile, many applications have bad performance when handling the noisy speech. Therefore, noise reduction or speech enhancement is meaningful for {{systems such as}} speech recognition and hearing aids. Numerous speech enhancement algorithms have been proposed in the literature [1]. The methods, such as independent component analysis [2] or beam forming [3], require multiple sensors. However, this <b>requirement</b> is <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> for many applications such as telecommunication. Spectrum subtraction [4] and subspace analysis [5] proposed for monaural speech enhancement usually make strong assumptions on acoustic interference. Therefore, these methods are limited to some special environments. Segregating speech from one monaural recording {{has proven to be}} very challenging. At present, it is still an open problem in realistic environments.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Virtualization {{has been}} {{receiving}} increasing at-tention in embedded real-time systems. However, real-time systems, whose correctness depends on timing <b>requirements,</b> are <b>not</b> easily <b>applicable</b> to virtualization since virtualiza-tion mainly focuses on functional correctness. A hierarchical scheduling framework (HSF) provides {{a method of}} composing the complex timing requirements of real-time systems. There have been several works on {{the implementation of the}} HSF. Although the scheduling framework of virtualization directly corresponds to the HSF, they did not consider implementing the HSF on virtualization. In this paper, we implement a two-level HSF, where components use a periodic interface model using virtualization. We use an L 4 /Fiasco micro-kernel as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) and an L 4 Linux as a virtual machine (VM) and extend these to support real-time properties. The experimental results show that the HSF is suitable for the virtualization environment. Keywords-Real-time scheduling, Compositional real-time guarantees, Virtualizatio...|$|R

40|$|In this {{deliverable}} {{the three}} artefacts (reference architecture, implementation and pilots) are evaluated {{on the basis}} of the legal requirements as stated in D 22. 6. The Design Science Methodology framework has been used, as it is the common evaluation approach for the FutureID evaluations across multiple disciplines. For the legal evaluation, many <b>requirements</b> were considered <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> for the specific artefacts. Therefore, an additional section was added which considered a possible deployment scenario based on one of the pilots. For the reference architecture artefact, almost none of the requirements were applicable. For the implementation artefact, some requirements were applicable. All applicable requirements have been considered as passed since the implementation allows a legally compliant deployment. However, the passing of a requirement on an implementation level does not automatically mean legal compliance of the deployment, only that it is technically possible to deploy the system legally compliant. Accordingly, for a legal evaluation, the final deployment is the important part, which could however not be evaluated as the final deployment is not yet realized. For this reason, and due to the fact that most requirements for the pilots were <b>not</b> <b>applicable</b> as no personal data was used, a scenario involving the e-learning pilot, assuming that personal data would be used, was considered as an example of what a deployment could look like if personal data would be used. The fulfilment of the general legal requirements was considered for this scenario. Overall, the legal requirements possibly could be passed in a final deployment. Some aspects which specifically should be considered are the withdrawal of consent, the amount of data received by the data processor and the data controller, how it will be ensured that the technology stays the state-of-the-art, how a privacy preserving logging can be achieved (including deletion when the data is not necessary anymore) and how the contractual relationships between the different actors will be shaped. status: publishe...|$|R
