2500|$|Whiting {{again was}} {{operating}} in the Delaware Bay under Lieutenant Commander Glang's command when Egyptair Flight 990, a Boeing 767-300ER, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, on 31 October 1999. The U.S. Coast Guard requested her support {{in the search for}} the downed aircraft, and she soon got underway for Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island, where she replenished her supplies and refueled before proceeding to the crash area. Arriving on the scene early on 2 November, she put her sidescan sonar to use and discovered the debris field of the crash on the ocean bottom on her first surveying pass, only 12 hours after arriving. After only a day of search operations, however, a gale with 50-knot (58-mph; 93-km/hr) winds and 20-foot (6-meter) seas forced Whiting and U.S. Navy survey ships in the area to return early on 3 November to Newport, where Whitings crew compared their survey data with data collected by U.S. Navy ships. A break in the weather allowed Whiting to return on 5 November to continue her bottom-mapping operations; although she had to suspend mapping operations briefly when the towfish containing her sidescan sonar became entangled in a lobster pot and was damaged, her crew was able to improvise a night repair in difficult weather conditions and put the sonar back into service. Whitings bottom map combined with charts provided by NOAA's Office of Coast Survey allowed the U.S. Navy rescue and salvage ship [...] to anchor safely over the debris field without disturbing the wreckage. Having completed her Egyptair Flight 990 work and turned over continued mapping and search operations to U.S. Navy <b>remotely</b> <b>operated</b> <b>vehicles,</b> Whiting departed Naval Station Newport on 11 November 1999 to return to her home port at Norfolk, Virginia.|$|E
