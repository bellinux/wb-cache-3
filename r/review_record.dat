'Should you {{cast your}} eye on the {{signature}} of this letter before you read the contents, you might imagine that they related to a slanderous paper which appeared in your Review some time since.... I am not in the habit of permitting myself to be disturbed by what is said or written of me.... The case is different with the unfortunate subject of this letter, the author of Endymion, to whose feelings and situation I entreat you to allow me to call your attention. I write considerably in the dark; but, if it is Mr. Gifford that I am addressing, I am persuaded that, in an appeal to his humanity and justice, he will acknowledge the fas ab hoste doceri. I am aware that the first duty of a reviewer is towards the public; and I am willing to confess that the Endymion is a poem considerably defective, and that perhaps it deserved as much censure as the pages of your <b>Review</b> <b>record</b> against it. But, not to mention that there is a certain contemptuousness of phraseology, from which it Is difficult for a critic to abstain, in the review of Endymion, I do not think that the writer has given it its due praise. Surely the poem, with all its faults, is a very remarkable production for a man of Keats's age[7]; and the promise of ultimate excellence is such as has rarely been afforded even by such as have afterwards attained high literary eminence. Look at book 2, line 833, &c., and book 3, lines 113 to 120; read down that page, and then again from line 193[8]. I could cite many other passages to convince you that it deserved milder usage. Why it should have been reviewed at all, excepting for the purpose of bringing its excellences into notice, I cannot conceive; for it was very little read, and there was no danger that it should become a model to the age of that false taste with which I confess that it is replenished.|$|E

She joined the Heritage Society at Oxford University and sang with a group called Mistral. An appearance at Sidmouth Folk Festival led to folk club bookings and she contributed to various records. One of her earliest recordings was in 1972 on an anthology called Stagfolk Live. She also featured on Rosie Hardman's Firebird (1972) and The First Folk <b>Review</b> <b>Record</b> (1974). At {{the time she was}} singing purely traditional unaccompanied material but in 1976 she collaborated with Maddy Prior on the Silly Sisters album and tour, with a full band that included Nic Jones. It provided the launching pad that same year (1976) for her first album in her own right, Airs and Graces. She later joined again with Prior, this time using the name Silly Sisters for their duo. Starting in 1977 Martin Simpson joined her in the recording studio for three albums before he moved to America in 1987. (Simpson has returned from America to be a guest guitarist on albums in the 2000s (decade).) After his departure, she started working closely with pianist Huw Warren.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{report an}} unusual {{case of a}} 66 -year-old female with a {{suspicious}} thoracic outlet mass presenting with severe biochemical hyperparathyroidism and classic hypercalcemic symptoms of renal and bone involvement. Case Presentation There was clinical suspicion for parathyroid carcinoma, further supported by intra-operative findings. However, the final pathology described a primary hyperceullar parathyroid lesion with pathognomonic changes secondary to fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, along with a separate parathyroid lesion likely resulting from seeding along the needle tract. Upon further <b>review,</b> <b>record</b> of a remote FNA was discovered. This case highlights the complications associated with parathyroid FNA resulting in a diagnostic challenge and raising the possibility of malignancy. Conclusions We therefore recommend to take caution {{when there is a}} prior parathyroid FNA, as it can present with the risks of a secondary lesion from seeding and increase resemblance of malignancy both clinically and through pathologic diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The goal of {{this study}} was to provide {{estimates}} of race- and sex-specific survival rates over a 10 -year period for a cohort of 49, 752 Medicare patients admitted to the hospital in 1984 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. METHODS: Data were derived from Medicare Provider Analysis and <b>Review</b> <b>Record</b> inpatient claims files and the National Death Index file. RESULTS: For a primary diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, median survival times among Black men and women were 2. 5 years and 5. 2 years, respectively; for White men and women, the median survival times were 4. 3 years and 5. 9 years, respectively. Median survival times for Black men and women and White men and women with a secondary diagnosis of pulmonary embolism were 0. 4 years, 0. 7 years, 0. 8 years, and 1. 4 years, respectively. Survival rates declined with advancing age. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, survival rates among Blacks were lower than those among Whites, and men had lower survival rates than women. These survival estimates provide new insights into outcomes following pulmonary embolism in hospitalized elderly people...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUser {{reviews in}} forum sites are the {{important}} information source for many popular applications (e. g., {{monitoring and analysis}} of public opinion), which are usually represented in form of structured records. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, little existing work reported in the literature has systemically investigated the problem of extracting user reviews from forum sites. Besides the variety of web page templates, user-generated reviews raise two new challenges. First, the inconsistency of review contents in terms of both the document object model (DOM) tree and visual appearance impair the similarity between review records; second, the review content in a <b>review</b> <b>record</b> corresponds to complicated subtrees rather than single nodes in the DOM tree. To tackle these challenges, we present WeRE — a system that performs automatic user review extraction by employing sophisticated techniques. The review records are extracted from web pages based on the proposed level-weighted tree similarity algorithm first, and then the review contents in records are extracted exactly by measuring the node consistency. Our experimental results based on 20 forum sites indicate that WeRE can achieve high extraction accuracy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{redesign}} {{the existing}} clinical review form (RF 2) used in previous retrospective case record review studies {{in order to}} clarify the review process and provide a more powerful analysis of adverse events; and then to ask clinicians to pilot and evaluate the new modular review form (MRF 2). The review form is divided into five sections, each with a defined purpose, providing a modular structure. DESIGN: Design and testing of the MRF 2 on a sample of medical and nursing records, and evaluation of the reviewers' responses regarding the new review form. SETTING: Hospital based teams from eight countries. RESULTS: The modular review form {{was reported to be}} comprehensive, well structured, and clear. Most of the reviewers agreed with the positive statements regarding the review form. Overall, the modular structure was thought to be helpful. Several modifications have been made to the final version to take account of criticisms and suggestions. CONCLUSIONS: The full potential of case record review has yet to be explored. The benefits of this review form include a modular format which enables reviewers or project leaders to select the focus of their review based on resources and the purpose of the review, and to identify contributory factors which indicate areas for improvement and prevention. The training of reviewers is of vital importance for record <b>review.</b> <b>Record</b> review remains one of the primary methods for assessing the incidence of adverse events and the new format is suitable for both prospective and retrospective review...|$|E

ABB FACTS intend to develop new Product Platforms that is partly {{accomplished}} with new methods and processes. This Master Thesis concerns the development of a generic Review and Approval Process for these R&D Projects. The development of the generic Review and Approval process is mostly founded on several interviews of employees at ABB FACTS. The respondents are employees from several departments with different amount of experiences and background. In addition to the interviews a Literature Study focused on Roles and Responsibilities, Document Management and R&D Processes was performed. Information in connection to the problem statements concerning Responsibility- and Project Roles in R&D projects and Review and Approval Execution was collected and analyzed during the project. Information regarding how to demonstrate Roles and Responsibilities in relation to the project participants was also considered. The result of this project consists of a Responsibility Chart where all R&D Project related Document Types are listed in relation to the defined Project Roles. This Responsibility Chart also display what responsibility every Project Role has regarding review and approval related to the Document Types. Besides the Responsibility Chart also other objects were developed, such as a <b>Review</b> <b>Record,</b> a Process Description and a User Guide. The above mentioned results are developed in close cooperation with several R&D Project Managers. Furthermore the expectations are that the developed result will be taken in usage and thereby continuously be revised and improved in order to suit the organization to maximum extent...|$|E
