25|$|The {{improved}} HH-3E variant {{would follow}} later, with eight built, and all 50 CH-3Es {{were converted to}} this standard. Known as the Jolly Green Giant, the HH-3E featured protective armor, self-sealing tanks, a retractable inflight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe,</b> jettisonable external tanks, a high-speed hoist, and other specialized equipment.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all other}} modernized Hawks, the Hawk 200's all-glass cockpit has a multi-functional colour display, with a {{dedicated}} processor and 15-colour graphics symbology generator. There are 27 display formats which provide flight and aircraft data. The cockpit is also compatible with night-vision goggles. Just {{outside of the}} cockpit is an inflight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe.</b>|$|E
25|$|MH-60K Black Hawk: Special {{operations}} modification first {{ordered in}} 1988 {{for use by}} the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ("Night Stalkers"). Equipped with the in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe,</b> and T700-GE-701C engines. More advanced than MH-60L, the K-model also includes an integrated avionics system (glass cockpit), AN/APQ-174B terrain-following radar, color weather map, improved weapons capability, and various defensive systems.|$|E
50|$|The PAF is {{currently}} installing in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>probes</b> of South African origin to the upgraded Mirage III ROSE I aircraft, stating {{that it is}} a pilot program for the induction of aerial refueling capability into the PAF.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, {{during the}} coup d'état attempt against {{president}} Carlos Andres Perez, 3 F-5s were lost to a rebel-operated OV-10 Bronco bombing Barquisimeto Air Base. The failed coup delayed the modernization {{program for a}} year, finally coming together in 1993. The fleet was equipped with inertial laser navigation systems (similar to those in Venezuelan F-16s), IFFs, HUDs, <b>refueling</b> <b>probes</b> and modernized engines with an estimated lifespan of 22 years.|$|R
50|$|Several escort {{carriers}} were pressed {{back into}} service {{during the first}} years of the Vietnam War because of their ability to carry large numbers of aircraft. Redesignated AKV (air transport auxiliary), they were manned by a civilian crew and used to ferry whole aircraft and spare parts from the U.S. to Army, Air Force and Marine bases in South Vietnam. However, CVEs were useful in this role only for a limited period. Once all major aircraft were equipped with <b>refueling</b> <b>probes,</b> it became much easier to fly the aircraft directly to its base instead of shipping it overseas.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle type {{landing gear}} by Messier-Dowty, with twin nosewheels {{and a single}} wheel on each main gear. A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with the}} landing gear's carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|E
25|$|MH-60L Black Hawk: Special {{operations}} modification, {{used by the}} U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ("Night Stalkers"), {{based on}} the UH-60L with T700-701C engines. It was developed as an interim version in the late 1980s pending fielding of the MH-60K. Equipped {{with many of the}} systems used on MH-60K, including FLIR, color weather map, auxiliary fuel system, and laser rangefinder/designator. A total of 37 MH-60Ls were built and some 10 had received an in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> by 2003.|$|E
25|$|Various munitions {{could be}} {{mounted on the}} one {{centerline}} and four under-wing hardpoints, including bombs, missiles and rockets; payloads of up to 2,000 lb may be carried upon the centerline and the two innermost under-wing pylons, while the outer pylons can carry up to 1,000 lb. All four of the under-wing hardpoints are plumbed for drop tanks to extend the aircraft's range, Italian aircraft are also fitted with a fixed aerial <b>refueling</b> <b>probe.</b> Optical reconnaissance pods can be carried externally on the centerline hardpoint. Wingtip rails are provided for infrared guided air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder and MAA-1 Piranha. Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20mm rotary cannon {{on the port side}} of the lower fuselage. The United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.|$|E
50|$|The MiG-29 has a {{ferry range}} of 1,500 km without {{external}} fuel tanks, and 2,100 km with external tanks. The internal fuel {{capacity of the}} original MiG-29B is 4,365 litres distributed between six internal fuel tanks, four in the fuselage and one in each wing. For longer flights, this can be supplemented by a 1,500-litre (330 Imp gal, 395 US gal) centreline drop tank and, on later production batches, two 1,150-litre (253 Imp gal, 300 US gal) underwing drop tanks. In addition, a small number have been fitted with port-side inflight <b>refueling</b> <b>probes,</b> allowing much longer flight times by using a probe-and-drogue system.|$|R
5000|$|As built, the Tu-22M {{included}} the provision for a retractable probe {{in the upper}} part of the nose for aerial <b>refueling.</b> The <b>probe</b> was reportedly removed as a result of the SALT negotiations, because with refueling it was considered an intercontinental range strategic bomber. [...] The probe can be reinstated if needed.|$|R
5000|$|The prime {{aircraft}} of {{the squadron}} was the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, or [...] "Deuce", {{which was the}} more common nickname. In order to deploy to Naha, each plane was configured with <b>refueling</b> <b>probes</b> and required extensive pilot training. This {{was one of the}} few times such a modification was done to a relatively short-ranged jet fighter-interceptor. In January 1968, the 82d was scrambled to South Korea in response to the Pueblo Incident, where North Korea had seized the intelligence ship [...] The 82d Fighter Interceptor Squadron maintained a presence in South Korea with a detachment of temporarily assigned aircraft (12) and personnel (TDY) to Suwon Air Base, ROK. The squadron continued this service until 31 May 1971 when the 51st Fighter Inteceptor Wing (51 FIW), along with all the other operational and support squadrons (including the 82d Fighter Interceptor Squadron) were inactivated.|$|R
25|$|The {{impact of}} the rocket had also {{dislodged}} two of the 1000-lb AN-M65 bombs, which fell to the deck, and lay in the pool of burning fuel between White's aircraft and that of Lieutenant Commander John McCain. Damage Control Team No. 8 swung into action immediately, and Chief Gerald Farrier, recognizing the risk, and {{without the benefit of}} protective clothing, immediately smothered the bombs with a PKP fire extinguisher in an effort to delay the fuel fire spreading for long enough to allow the pilots to escape. The pilots, still strapped into their aircraft, were immediately aware that a disaster was unfolding, but only some were able to escape in time. McCain, pilot of A-4 Skyhawk side No. 416, next to White's, {{was among the first to}} notice the flames, and escaped by scrambling down the nose of his A-4 and jumping off the <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> shortly before the explosions began.|$|E
500|$|Saab {{describes}} the Gripen as a [...] "swing-role aircraft", stating {{that it is}} capable of [...] "instantly switching between roles at the push of a button". [...] The human/machine interface changes when switching between roles, being optimized by the computer in response to new situations and threats. [...] The Gripen is also equipped to use a number of different communications standards and systems, including SATURN secure radio, Link-16, ROVER, and satellite uplinks. Equipment for performing long range missions, such as an aerial <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> and onboard oxygen generation system (OBOGS), was integrated upon the Gripen C/D.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
50|$|A leading-edge root {{extension}} (LERX), {{which is}} a small fillet, is situated on the front section of the intake and wings of the aircraft. It has a typically roughly rectangular shape, running forward from {{the leading edge of}} the wing root to a point along the fuselage. Also, the AMCA has an In-flight <b>refueling</b> (IFR) <b>probe</b> that retracts beside the cockpit during normal operation.|$|R
50|$|The Su-30MKI has a {{range of}} 3,000 km with {{internal}} fuel which ensures a 3.75 hour combat mission. Also, it has an in-flight <b>refueling</b> (IFR) <b>probe</b> that retracts beside the cockpit during normal operation. The air refueling system increases the flight duration up to 10 hours with {{a range of}} 8,000 km at a cruise height of 11 to 13 km. Su-30MKIs can also use the Cobham 754 buddy refueling pods.|$|R
25|$|The first F-100D (54–2121) flew on 24 January 1956, piloted by Daniel Darnell. It entered {{service on}} 29 September 1956 with the 405th Fighter Wing at Langley AFB. The {{aircraft}} suffered from reliability {{problems with the}} constant speed drive which provides constant-frequency current to the electrical systems. In fact, the drive was so unreliable that the USAF required it {{to have its own}} oil system to minimize damage in case of failure. Landing gear and brake parachute malfunctions claimed a number of aircraft, and the <b>refueling</b> <b>probes</b> had a tendency to break away during high speed maneuvers. Numerous post-production fixes created such a diversity of capabilities between individual aircraft that, by 1965, around 700 F-100Ds underwent High Wire modifications to standardize the weapon systems. High Wire modifications took 60 days per aircraft at a cost for the entire project of US $150 million. In 1966, the Combat Skyspot program fitted some F-100Ds with an X band radar transmitter to allow for ground-directed bombing in inclement weather or at night.|$|R
2500|$|A second {{batch of}} 70 {{airframes}} was ordered (mix of ex-US Navy A-4Bs and A-4Cs) in 1980, these were shipped directly to Singapore for rebuilding with the A-4Cs being rebuilt as the A-4S-1s while the A-4Bs was {{to remain in}} storage for use as spares. Along with {{a small number of}} TA-4S-1s, these newer Skyhawks (characterised by its straight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> instead of the cranked <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> found on the original A-4S/TA-4S) would join the RSAF as attrition replacements from 1982. However, these airframes retained the original [...] Colt Mk 12 cannons of the A-4Cs.|$|E
2500|$|From 1963–66, F-101Bs were {{upgraded}} {{under the}} Interceptor Improvement Program (IIP; {{also known as}} [...] "Project Bold Journey"), with a fire control system enhancement against hostile ECM and an infrared sighting and tracking (IRST) system in the nose {{in place of the}} in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the baseline configuration, the Bell-Boeing team is including eight possible variants, or [...] "excursion designs", including a sea-based variant. The design team is planning on payloads ranging from 16 to 26 tons {{and a range of}} [...] The baseline version includes a fully retractable <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> and an interconnecting drive system for power redundancy.|$|E
5000|$|The Multi-point Refueling Systems (MPRS) {{modification}} adds refueling pods to the KC-135's wings. The pods allow refueling of U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps {{and most}} NATO tactical jet aircraft {{while keeping the}} tail-mounted refueling boom. The pods themselves are Flight Refueling Limited (FRL) MK.32B model pods, and <b>refuel</b> via the <b>probe</b> and drogue method common to USN/USMC tactical jets, rather than the primary [...] "flying boom" [...] method used by USAF fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to refuel two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.|$|R
50|$|The two X-47B demonstrators were {{initially}} {{planned to have}} a three-year test program with 50 tests at Edwards AFB and NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, culminating in sea trials in 2013. However, the aircraft performed so consistently that the preliminary tests stopped after 16 flights. Thereafter, the Navy {{decided to use the}} aircraft to demonstrate carrier launches and recoveries, as well as autonomous inflight <b>refueling</b> with a <b>probe</b> and drogue. In November 2011, the Navy announced that aerial refuelling equipment and software would be added to one of the prototype aircraft in 2014 for testing. The Navy also affirmed that the demonstrator aircraft would never be armed. In 2012, Northrop Grumman tested a wearable remote control system, designed to allow ground crews to steer the X-47B while on the carrier deck.|$|R
2500|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} with {{this system is}} that when contacted, the hose does not “retract” into an HDU. [...] Instead, the hose bends depending on how far it is pushed toward the boom. [...] If it is pushed too far, it can loop around the probe or nose of the aircraft, damage the windscreen, or cause contact with the rigid boom. [...] If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. [...] Because of a much smaller position keeping tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. [...] When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the <b>probe</b> <b>refueling</b> valve disconnects from the valve in the basket. [...] Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to “prang” the probe and/or strike the aircraft’s fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|Mitsubishi and Sikorsky have teamed {{in support}} of the Self Defense Force's mission requirements. The UH-60J+ {{incorporates}} various upgrades for the modern SAR mission. [...] By 2006 Defense budget of Japan, UH-60Js begin addition of <b>Refueling</b> <b>probe</b> in 2009. These UH-60Js completed training with the United States Air Force and widened their activity in SAR mission.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, the U.S. Air Force {{chose the}} UH-60A Black Hawk to replace its HH-3E Jolly Green Giant helicopters. After {{acquiring}} some UH-60s, the Air Force began upgrading each {{with an air}} <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> and additional fuel tanks in the cabin. The machine guns were changed from 0.308in (7.62mm) M60s to 0.50in (12.7mm) XM218s. These helicopters were referred to as [...] "Credible Hawks" [...] and entered service in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|All HH-60Gs have an {{automatic}} flight control system, night vision goggles lighting and forward looking infrared system that greatly enhances night low-level operations. Additionally, some Pave Hawks have color weather radar and an engine/rotor blade anti-ice system {{that gives the}} HH-60G an all-weather capability. Pave Hawk mission equipment includes a retractable in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe,</b> internal auxiliary fuel tanks, two crew-served (or pilot-controlled) 7.62mm miniguns or [...]50-caliber machine guns and an 8,000 pound (3,600kg) capacity cargo hook. To improve air transportability and shipboard operations, all HH-60Gs have folding rotor blades.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{government}} {{canceled the}} BAC TSR-2 strike aircraft in 1965, citing the lower {{costs for the}} TFX and ordered 50 F-111K aircraft in February 1967 for the Royal Air Force. [...] The F-111K was to be supplemented later by the Anglo-French Variable Geometry Aircraft then under development. [...] The F-111K {{was based on the}} F-111A with longer F-111B wings, FB-111 landing gear, Mark II navigation/fire control system, and British supplied mission systems. Other changes included weapons bay modifications, addition of a centerline pylon, a retractable <b>refueling</b> <b>probe,</b> provisions for a reconnaissance pallet, and a higher gross weight with the use of FB-111A landing gear.|$|E
2500|$|On June 3, 1982, a British Vulcan {{diverted}} {{to an emergency}} landing in Brazil when its in-flight <b>refueling</b> <b>probe</b> broke en route to Ascension Island after bombing Argentine positions in the Falkland Islands. The crew sent a [...] "Mayday" [...] signal, jettisoned classified documents, and attempted to ditch its missile armament, but all bar one malfunctioned and remained on the plyons. The Vulcan was intercepted by Brazilian F-5 Tiger II jets and escorted to the Galeão Air Force Base in Rio de Janeiro, where the crew and aircraft were interned. After diplomatic negotiations with the United Kingdom, the aircraft and crew were released on June 11. However, the remaining Sidewinder and AGM-45 Shrike missiles on board the aircraft were confiscated by the Brazilian authorities.|$|E
