40|$|The noise, {{vibration}} and harshness (NVH) {{performance of}} passenger vehicles strongly {{depends on the}} fluid-structure interaction between {{the air in the}} vehicle cavity and the sheet metal structure of the vehicle. Most of the noise and vibration problems related to this interaction come from <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> of the sheet metal, which are excited by external forces (road, engine, and wind). A reduction in these <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> can be achieved by applying bitumen damping layers, also called deadeners, in the sheet metal. The problem is where these deadeners shall be fixed, which is usually done in a trial-and-error basis. In this work, one proposes the use of embedded sensitivity to locate the deadeners in the sheet metal of the vehicle, more specifically in the vehicle roof. Experimental frequency response functions (FRFs) of the roof are obtained and the data are processed by adopting the embedded sensitivity method, thus obtaining the sensitivity of the <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> on the local increase in damping due to the deadeners. As a result, by examining the sensitivity functions, one can find the optimum location of the deadeners that maximize their effect in reducing the <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> of interest. After locating the deadeners in the optimum positions, it was possible to verify a strong reduction in <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> of the vehicle roof, thus showing the efficiency of the procedure. The main advantage of this procedure is that it only requires FRF measurements of the vehicle in its original state not needing any previous modification of the vehicle structure to find the sensitivity functions.

Another potential problem with amplitude modulation is that a sudden change to a more repulsive (less attractive) force can shift the resonance past the drive frequency causing it to decrease again. In constant height mode this will just lead to an image artefact, but in feedback mode the feedback will read this as a stronger attractive force, causing positive feedback until the feedback saturates.|$|E

50|$|Bound protons are {{associated}} with proteins and as {{they have a very}} short T2 decay they do not normally contribute to image contrast. However, because these protons have a broad <b>resonance</b> <b>peak</b> they can be excited by a radiofrequency pulse that has no effect on free protons.

In this technique, it was shown that the source effect can be minimized by normalizing the horizontal spectral amplitude with the vertical spectral amplitude. Assuming that the shear wave dominates the microtremor, Nakamura [...] indicated that the horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratio of microtremors at a site roughly equals the S-wave transfer function between the ground surface and bedrock ata site. This means that the H/V peak period and peak value itself correspond to the natural site period and amplification factor respectively. This method does not require any boreholes and is, hence, more convenient and inexpensive compared to the traditionalborehole method. This method is now widely used for microtremor observation although it lacks a clear theoretical background.Lermo and Chavez-Garcia [...] showed the applicability of Nakamura’s method of microtremor in site effect prediction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate associations between the breathing sound spectra and glottal dimensions in exercise-induced vocal cord dysfunction (EIVCD) during a bicycle ergometry test. Nineteen subjects (mean age 21. 8 years and range 13 - 39 years) with suspected EIVCD were studied. Vocal folds were continuously imaged with videolaryngoscopy and breathing sounds were recorded during the bicycle exercise test. Twelve subjects showed paradoxical movement of the vocal folds during inspiration by the end of the exercise. In seven subjects, no abnormal reactions in vocal folds were found; they served as control subjects. The glottal quotient (interarytenoid distance divided by the anteroposterior glottal distance) was calculated. From the same time period, the tracheal-vocal tract <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> of the breathing sound spectra were analyzed, and stridor sounds were detected and measured. Subjects with EIVCD showed significantly higher <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> during the inspiratory phase compared to the expiratory phase (p < 0. 014). The glottal quotient decreased significantly in the EIVCD group (p < 0. 001), but not in the control group. 8 out of 12 EIVCD patients (67 %) showed stridor sounds, while none of the controls did. There was a significant inverse correlation between the frequencies of the breathing sound <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks</b> and the glottal quotient. The findings indicate that the typical EIVCD reaction of a paradoxical approximation of the vocal folds during inspiration, measured here as a decrease in the glottal quotient, is significantly associated with an increase in inspiratory <b>resonance</b> <b>peaks.</b> The findings are applicable in the documentation of EIVCD findings using videolaryngoscopy, in addition to giving clinicians tools for EIVCD recognition.
