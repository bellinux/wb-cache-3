30|$|Aerial <b>ropeways</b> {{are widely}} used as {{continuous}} transport for organization of passenger and cargo carriage in many countries worldwide [1, 2]. Passenger aerial <b>ropeways</b> are mostly used for rapid and convenient movement of people to the sports, tourist, ecological and health-improving facilities within nature areas with difficult terrain which are difficult to access [3, 4]. Cargo <b>ropeways</b> are used in many sectors of economics for transportation of different cargos. The industries where {{one can see the}} use of cargo <b>ropeways</b> are mining, coal, chemical, metallurgical, power, timber and agricultural [5, 6, 7, 8]. According to the data of the comparative techno-economic study [2, 9, 10, 11], aerial <b>ropeways</b> are more economically and environmentally beneficial than land transport (road, conveyor and rail), especially in cases when the terrain, high density of the housing and industrial development and various urban planning restrictions impede the development of the ground traffic.|$|R

25|$|Into the 1930s {{the aerial}} <b>ropeway</b> to the Engstligenalp was built with further ropeways following. The Silleren area was {{up into the}} 1980s {{accessible}} by buses.|$|E

25|$|At the Limebank Quarry near Loerie, quarried {{limestone}} {{was crushed}} and loaded into buckets carried on an overhead <b>ropeway</b> from the quarry to bunkers at Loerie. In 1954, the cement company doubled its quarry output capacity when a second parallel <b>ropeway</b> {{was placed in}} service. A limitation in {{the capacity of the}} limestone trains throughout the steam haulage era was that double heading by Garratt locomotives was not permitted to protect their pivots from excessive stresses. It therefore became common practice to run heavier Garratt-headed trains of up to 14 wagons with a Class NG10 helper cut in to the train some eight to ten wagons back. From a passing loop at Summit, the Garratt would continue to Chelsea unassisted whilst the helper returned down the hill to Loerie.|$|E

25|$|Fort de Vernayaz (A68/69) {{complements}} Follatères on {{the south}} side of the Rhône at Vernayaz. The fort occupies a unique location at the mouth of the Trient Gorges overlooking the rail line and Verayaz. The fort is accessed by walkways on the cliffside above the torrent, with footbridges connecting tunnel portals over the water. Materials were delivered by a <b>ropeway.</b> There are three levels of galleries, which are no longer military property. Plans are underway to open the complex to visits by the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{cableway}} and {{the cabins}} {{come from the}} Leitner Group. A continuous circulating bi-cable aerial <b>ropeway</b> system, where the track cable acts as a rail {{in the sky and}} the haul cable pulls the cabins, allows long spans between towers. It is the first of its type to be installed in Hong Kong. Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and bigger than that used in Austria. He said the steel columns used to support the system have to be stronger, and thus more expensive.|$|E

30|$|As it {{is shown}} in the related literatures [2, 6, 9, 11, 12], aerial <b>ropeways</b> are an {{effective}} {{alternative to the}} conventional modes of land public transport in metropolitan areas and cities. Aerial <b>ropeways</b> may be labeled as high-speed urban transport. The average speed of the passenger cabins may be from 18 to 40  km/h [9, 10, 13]. This value is higher than an average travel speed of the conventional land transport in straitened urban conditions. In addition, the problem of transport accessibility is becoming increasingly important when evaluating projects for the modernization of transport infrastructure in major urban centers [14]. This indicator is an apparent advantage of aerial <b>ropeways</b> as well.|$|R
25|$|Hopes of {{extensions}} {{were raised}} when the Southern Railway invested £44,000 in discounted shares (£220,000 at par) in 1926, but dashed when it lost interest (although remaining friendly and having directors on the Board). The railway {{settled down to}} running coal trains for Tilmanstone Colliery as its only profitable activity. The colliery company objected to its rates, and opened an aerial <b>ropeway</b> in competition to the Eastern Arm of Dover Harbour in 1930. This was a failure, as the coal did not sell on the export market and mostly found a market in London. However, it was only dismantled in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Designed by Aedas, {{also the}} {{architect}} of the project, the line uses a continuous circulating twin cable aerial <b>ropeway</b> system, technically described as a bi-cable gondola lift. The Leitner Group was the contractor for the cable car system. Between the Tung Chung and Ngong Ping Terminals, the 5.7km cableway changes direction twice at the two angle stations, one on the south shore of Chek Lap Kok; the other west of Nei Lak Shan within the Lantau North Country Park. Whilst the gondola cabins are temporarily detached from the cables at each angle station, there are no passenger loading or unloading facilities at these points.|$|E
25|$|Work was {{commenced}} at Tilmanstone in 1906. An {{accident in}} 1909 killed {{three men and}} destroyed the pumping system, causing the mine to flood and work was abandoned for nine months. The site {{was connected to the}} East Kent Light Railway in 1912 and coal first brought to the surface in March 1913. An accident at the pit on 27 February 1931 resulted in Sydney William Padfield being awarded a bronze Edward Medal, the only one awarded in the Kent Coalfield. An aerial <b>ropeway</b> was built in 1930 to link the pit with Dover Harbour. This included tunnelling through the cliff at Dover to deliver the coal to a 5,000 ton bunker at the harbour. It wasn't used much after 1935, and was dismantled in 1954. In 1945, the workforce was 914, with 631 being employed sub-surface and 283 above. The colliery closed in 1986, having produced over 20,000,000 tons of coal. A system of tokens was used in the pithead baths and canteen and a lamp check was operated, in common with the majority of pits. All buildings have been demolished.|$|E
30|$|A {{detailed}} {{review of}} exploitation of aerial <b>ropeways</b> in different cities {{is given in}} [2, 13, 15]. In the urbanized environment, aerial <b>ropeways</b> have begun to {{play an active role}} in the last 10 ~ 15  years [16]. Therefore, due to the lack of theoretical studies and scientific publications on the topic, at present a lot of specific questions related to designing, calculation and modeling of operational processes in aerial <b>ropeways</b> should be considered specifically for the urbanized environment. Among the early publications on the issue is the research presented in [17]. Questions related to the productivity, cost and possibility of applying of cable-propelled systems in the urban environment are considered in the article. A number of papers addressed the issues of the effect of climatic factors (wind and air temperature difference) on the dynamics of passenger cabins and the cable system of aerial <b>ropeways</b> [18, 19]; calculation of strength and tension of carrying ropes [20, 21, 22]; safety of passenger transportation [2, 3].|$|R

25|$|Construction of the two-storey ropewalk {{began in}} November 1692 {{leading to the}} start of {{production}} the following year and reaching full capacity in 1696. As Stockholm's rope factory had burnt down in 1676, the Lindholmen factory was the country's only royal rope factory. By 1726, there were 75 employees at the works, assisted each day by up to 250 hands from the naval base. From 1793, thanks to Joseph Huddart's patented approach, it was possible to produce much stronger rope. But despite attempts by former naval officer Fredrik Henrik af Chapman to adopt the system in Karlskrona, the machine designed by one of his engineers proved a failure and it was not until 1832 that the Huddart approach was finally successful in Sweden. That same year, a steam engine was purchased to drive Lindholmen's equipment. Later in the 19th century, rails were laid for a traction engine and windows were added. In 1928, electricity was introduced allowing new machinery to be installed. New tar houses were built in brick, and <b>ropeway</b> walls were built on the eastern and northern sides. Between 1946 and 1957, all the machinery was replaced with a resulting increase in production enabled by the introduction of synthetic materials. Staffing was reduced until the final team consisted of just seven men. The last stretch of rope was produced on 30 December 1960. Until 1960, when production ceased, it was the only factory producing mooring ropes and cordage for the navy's warships although its products were also sold on the civilian market.|$|E
