In this work the rotational analog of the Unruh effect is investigated by employing two relativistic rotational transformations corresponding to the eccentric rotating observer, and it is shown that in both cases the detector response function is non-zero. It is also shown that although consecutive Lorentz transformations can not give a frame within which the canonical construction can be carried out, the expectation value of particle number operator in canonical approach will be zero if we use modified Franklin transformation. These conclusions reinforce the claim that correspondence between vacuum states defined via canonical field theory and a detector is broken for rotating observers.

An incremental definition of rotations is adopted based on an improved <b>rotational</b> <b>transformation</b> matrix, and a convected (Eulerian) system is employed for establishing the contribution of individual elements to the strain energy (U). The Eulerian displacements are obtained by means of element-based local vectors, where the vectors representing the principal axes of bending follow the deformed configuration of the element and are continuously updated to a position normal to the element chord. The nonlinear solution procedure is formalized in terms of transformations between the Eulerian and the global systems, and expressions for geometric stiffness and transformation matrices are explicitly derived...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Interpolating {{diffusion}} tensor fields {{is a key}} {{technique to}} visualize the continuous behaviors of biological tissues such as nerves and muscle fibers. However, this has been still a challenging task due to the difficulty to handle possible degeneracy, which means the rotational inconsistency caused by degenerate points. This paper presents an approach to interpolating 3 D diffusion tensors in 2 D planar domains by aggressively locating the possible degeneracy while fully respecting the underlying transition of tensor anisotropy. The primary idea behind this approach is to identify the degeneracy using minimum spanning tree-based clustering algorithm, and resolve the degeneracy by optimizing the associated <b>rotational</b> <b>transformations.</b> Degenerate lines are generated in this process to retain the smooth transitions of anisotropic features. Comparisons with existing interpolation schemes will be also provided to demonstrate the technical advantages of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to real-time shape editing that produces physically plausible deformations using an efficient and easy-to-implement volumetric approach. Our algorithm alternates between a linear tetrahedral Laplacian deformation step and a differential update in which <b>rotational</b> <b>transformations</b> are approximated. By means of this iterative process we can achieve non-linear deformation results while having to solve only linear equation systems. The differential update step relies on estimating the rotational component of the deformation relative to the rest pose. This makes the method very stable as the shape can be reverted to its rest pose even after extreme deformations. Only a few point handles or area handles imposing an orientation are needed to achieve high quality deformations, which makes the approach intuitive to use. We show that our technique is well suited for interactive shape manipulation and also provides an elegant way to animate models with captured motion data...|$|R
