Anomalous tunneling phenomena are observed in our numerical simulations. According to our analytical results, selective tunneling rule is proposed to explain this interesting transport behavior. The switch design enriches the phenomenon of the Klein paradox and also provides a platform to study the paradox. Comment: 4 pages and 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed September 9, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 80 - 82) Microstrip patch antennas have been studied and designed extensively over the years which find many applications in wireless communications, satellite communications and radar applications. These antennas have features such as simple, robust, low profile, cheaper and versatile for various modes of operations. However, the patch antennas are inherently narrow band, hence require wide-bandwidth and/or frequency agile property {{in order to meet}} the need of modern wireless communications applications. This thesis presents investigation results on the effect of employing variable height ground plane and copper <b>ribbon</b> <b>switches</b> on the frequency agile behavior of wideband microstrip patch antenna. The effect of ground plane height variation not only alters operating frequency, but also, Gain and impedance bandwidth. First a narrow band patch antenna and its array configuration will be studied for its frequency agility and far-field performance by varying the ground plane, followed by the proposed wideband patch antenna, which is basically a U-slot loaded modified E-shape microstrip patch antenna (USLMES). The narrowband patch antenna achieves 33 % frequency agility which increases to 43 % for the array configuration. The proposed USLMES antenna is excited using the notch feed mechanism by a 50 [upper case omega] coaxial probe outside the patch surface so that coaxial probe does not contribute significantly to the peak-cross-polarization levels. The parametric study results are presented for the wideband patch antenna design and important parameters have been noted. The proposed wideband patch antenna offers impedance (S 11 = - 10 dB) and 3 dB gain bandwidths of at least 35 % (3. 09 GHz to 4. 42 GHz) and approaches 38 % (3. 09 GHz to 4. 59 GHz) based on experimental measured data with stable radiation patterns and acceptable cross-polarization levels. Frequency agility is also achieved from 3. 02 GHz to 4. 95 GHz by turning different combination of copper <b>ribbon</b> <b>switches</b> ON/OFF in the later part of the thesis. The prototype antennas were fabricated and experimentally verified for both frequency agility and wideband patch performance verifications. The simulated performance is in reasonable agreement with the measured results. The proposed wideband microstrip patch antenna can be used as the radiating elements in base station applications...|$|R

40|$|Nanometer {{materials}} have been attracting strong attention {{due to their}} interesting structure and properties. Many important practical applications have been demonstrated for nanometer materials based on their unique properties. This article provides a review on the fabrication, electrical characterization, and memory application of two-terminal resistive-switching devices using nanomaterials as the active components, including metal and semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs), nanotubes, nanowires, and graphenes. There are mainly two types of device architectures for the two-terminal devices with NPs. One has a triple-layer structure with a metal film sandwiched between two organic semiconductor layers, and the other has a single polymer film blended with NPs. These devices can be electrically switched between two states with significant different resistances, i. e. the &#x 2018;ON&#x 2019; and &#x 2018;OFF&#x 2019; states. These render the devices important application as two-terminal non-volatile memory devices. The electrical behavior of these devices can {{be affected by the}} materials in the active layer and the electrodes. Though the mechanism for the electrical switches has been in argument, it is generally believed that the resistive switches are related to charge storage on the NPs. Resistive switches were also observed on crossbars formed by nanotubes, nanowires, and graphene <b>ribbons.</b> The resistive <b>switches</b> are due to nanoelectromechanical behavior of the materials. The Coulombic interaction of transient charges on the nanomaterials affects the configurable gap of the crossbars, which results into significant change in current through the crossbars. These nanoelectromechanical devices can be used as fast-response and high-density memory devices as well.
