In order to improve the speed and accuracy of register control, a feedforward PID control algorithm is presented according to the linear model in multi-layer <b>register</b> <b>system.</b> This algorithm is unique in that it uses the PID to adjust the inputs of the <b>register</b> <b>system,</b> and feedforward compensation for the known disturbance, making the register control accuracy has been greatly improved. The simulation shows that the proposed register controller is able to realize a high precision control for the <b>register</b> <b>system</b> and endowed with better control performance than PID controller in register control...|$|R

Thus, the number of servers can change dynamically and accordingly, the quorum size changes over time. We give algorithms that implement join, leave, read and write operations that preserve the quorum intersection property despite the server churn. Furthermore, we give a probabilistic analysis of the churn behavior of the dynamic <b>register</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

However, the complex relationships of multilayer <b>register</b> <b>system</b> make the problem of decoupling control difficult to be solved, which has limited the improvement of register accuracy for the gravure printed electronic equipment. Therefore, this paper presents an integrated decoupling control strategy based on feedforward control and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) to solve the strong coupling, strong interference, and time-delay problems of multilayer <b>register</b> <b>system.</b> First of all, a coupling and nonlinear model is established according to the multilayer register working principle in gravure printing, and then a linear model of the <b>register</b> <b>system</b> is derived based on the perturbation method. Secondly, according to the linear model, a decoupling control strategy is designed based on feedforward control and ADRC for the multilayer <b>register</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, the results of computer simulation show that the proposed control methodology can realize a decoupling control and has good control performance for multilayer <b>register</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} on {{a comparative}} basis the purpose, principles, functioning {{and effectiveness of}} the land registration systems in two EU member states - England and Slovakia. The comparative study aims to provide reflections “de lege ferenda” offering suggestions for statutory amendments. The thesis also examines the effect of land registration on the security and speed of conveyancing process in each state. In order to accomplish a comprehensive and up-to-date comparative study I have utilized the research conducted {{in the field of}} property law in the selected countries in order to complete an in-depth review of the national legislations on a comparative basis. The objective was to produce a comprehensive and scientifically accurate comparative study, not a mere „manual“. Therefore the thesis is based on a careful analysis of primary and secondary resources, such as national statutory provisions, journal articles, monographys, textbooks, case. The thesis challenges the argument that land registration represents an unnecessary state intervention. It also provides persuasive arguments for the superiority of the <b>registered</b> <b>system</b> of conveyancing over the unregistered conveyancing...|$|E

The paper {{brings the}} {{activities}} of the French administration during the Illyrian provinces, in Dalmatia, namely Split and its surroundings from 1812 to 1814. The 16, 120 preserved documents, books and legal acts reveal the functions, competences and fields of activity of the government’s Royal sub-delegation in Split. The administrative organization of the sub-delegate’s bureau and administration was reconstructed following the original <b>registered</b> <b>system</b> of the central French administration on the lower administrative level.

50|$|Many {{register}} {{languages are}} tonal. However, tone {{is not a}} universal distinguishing feature among <b>register</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>register</b> complexes are not a component of most tonal languages. In fact, tonal languages can employ either a <b>register</b> tone <b>systems</b> or a contour tone systems. Mandarin has a contour tone system, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (their pitch shapes or contours, such as rising, falling, dipping, or peaking) rather than simply their pitch relative {{to each other as}} in a <b>register</b> tone <b>system.</b> <b>Register</b> tone <b>systems</b> are found in Bantu languages and throughout Africa. In some <b>register</b> tone <b>systems,</b> there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine register and contour tones, such as the Kru languages, though in such cases the register tones may be analysed as being 'level' (unvarying pitch) contour tones. Furthermore, often the term 'register,' when not in the phrase 'register tone,' is used to indicate vowel phonation combined with tone in a single phonological system. Burmese, Khmer and possibly Vietnamese are register languages. Burmese is usually considered a tonal language and Khmer a vowel-phonation language, but in both cases differences in relative pitch or pitch contours are correlated with vowel phonation, so that neither exists independently.|$|R
