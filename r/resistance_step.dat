While magnetization reversal of all-perpendicular Co/Ni spin valves at ambient temperatures is typically marked by a single sharp step change in resistance, low temperature measurements can reveal a series of resistance steps, consistent with non-uniform magnetization configurations. We propose a model that consists of domain nucleation, propagation and annihilation to explain the temperature dependence of the switching fields.

40|$|The {{means for}} judging optimal tension during tendon {{transfers}} are approximate {{and not very}} quantifiable. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively assessing muscular mechanical properties intraoperatively using ultrasound elastography (shear wave elastography [SWE]) during extensor indicis proprius (EIP) transfer. We report two cases of EIP transfer for post-traumatic rupture of the extensor pollicis longus muscle. Ultrasound acquisitions measured the elasticity modulus of the EIP muscle at different stages: rest, active extension, active extension against resistance, EIP section, distal passive traction of the tendon, after tendon transfer at rest and then during active extension. A preliminary analysis was conducted of the distribution of values for this modulus at the various transfer steps. Different shear wave velocity and elasticity modulus values were observed at the various transfer steps. The tension applied during the transfer seemed close to the resting tension if a traditional protocol were followed. The elasticity modulus varied by a factor of 37 between the active extension against <b>resistance</b> <b>step</b> (565. 1  kPa) and after the tendon section (15. 3  kPa).

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, with driving currents, {{the power}} reduces as the resistance decreases. This {{means that a}} process can be designed whereby as the welding completes, the heat automatically subsides, leading to a self-executing welding process. As Tohmyoh showed [14], there is a threshold of power at which the heat applied is enough for welding yet low enough not to cause to damage to the nanowires. Current ramps serve {{as a method of}} finding the appropriate current quickly, without having to incrementally adjust a constant current measurement. While resistance is still high, small current steps must be used because large steps can burn the nanowire. However, when using small steps, it takes an impractically long time to reach a sufficiently high current to complete the weld (and current-source units often have a maximum limit to the number of measurement steps). That is why multiple current ramps, each with larger step sizes, are thus used to lower the contact <b>resistance</b> <b>step</b> by step. During each current ramp, before welding begins and resistance changes, power and heat increase along with the increasing current. As the heat approaches the breakdown temperature of the intermediate layer, the layer partly dissolves and the resistance decreases, which is observed as a drop in the voltage response. Since the power decreases as the intermediate layer becomes ineffective, the complete dissolution of the intermediate layer does not typically occur until a current on the order of 1  mA is reached. At this point, the heat at the junction is also high enough for local melting of the silver and thus for welding to occur. As found in other works on Joule heat welding of metallic nanowires [14], the power required for welding was not dependent on nanowire length since the resistance of the junction is much larger than the resistance of the nanowires themselves [26]. Once melting is achieved, the junction exhibits a linear voltage–current response. The completion of welding is evident with further measurements. This is done by first leaving the junction to settle without current for several minutes and then running a current ramp. A linear response would confirm the completion of the weld, while a surge response with a voltage spike {{at the start of the}} measurement would show an uncompleted weld. The typical electrical response to such current ramp sweeps is shown in Fig.  3 b, and an image of a typical overlapped junction after welding is shown in Fig.  3 c. The image shows that the morphology of the nanowires is minimally affected away from the junction, including next to either electrodes.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} set of {{experimental}} results concerning the current noise produced during the resistive transition in a MgB 2 polycrystalline thin film. Measurements of the power spectrum of the current noise, observed when the temperature is slowly changed across its critical value, are given and discussed. During the transition a large electrical noise component is generated, having a power spectrum of the 1 /fn type (n ≅ 3) over a quite wide range of frequencies. This noise may be considered as generated by the abrupt creation of resistive strips across the specimen constituted by grains which have undergone the resistive transition. A computer model, based on this assumption, has been developed to simulate the resistive transition and to evaluate the noise power spectrum. The specimen has been represented as a two dimensional film characterized by randomly oriented grains having slightly different critical currents characterized by a gaussian distribution. When the temperature is incresed and reaches its critical value, resistive strips are formed according to a percolative process, giving rise to <b>resistance</b> <b>steps</b> which are at {{the origin of the}} noise.

40|$|The {{excess noise}} {{observed}} during the resistive transition of a superconducting material {{can be used}} to shed light on the microscopic processes underlying the transition itself. In a previous paper it has been proposed a model to explain the large noise observed during the resistive transition of MgB 2 superconducting films, obtained by slowly increasing the specimen temperature across its critical value when a d. c. bias current is applied. The amplitude and frequency behaviour of the noise power spectrum, simulated with this model, are in good agreement with the experimental data. The model is based on the onset of correlated transition of large sets of grains forming resistive layers through the specimen cross section, giving rise to <b>resistance</b> <b>steps.</b> It is assumed that these events produce the large noise, of 1 /f 3 type in the low frequency range, observed in the experiments. To compare this model with alternative ones, based on dissipative effects produced by fluxoid dynamics, new results, obtained by producing the transition by varying an applied magnetic field, are reported in this paper. The fact that the transition noise remains practically unchanged, even if the fluxoid density is much increased by the magnetic field, suggests that the transition mechanism proposed in the described model is more appropriate than the one based on fluxoid dynamic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While {{conventional}} {{electronic devices}} rely on electrostatic potentials to accelerate and confine charge carriers, a novel type of device {{has been proposed}} that uses inhomogeneous magnetic fields to channel and filter electrons. The stray fields emanating from ferromagnetic stripes fabricated at {{the surface of a}} two dimensional electron gas were used to deflect the ballistic electrons underneath. Magnetotransport experiments reveal a resistance resonance due to the formation of two types of magnetic edge states that drift in opposite directions perpendicular to the magnetic field gradient. A systematic study of Ni, Fe and Dy devices shows that the peak position increases proportionally to the amplitude of the magnetic modulation. The magnetic origin of the resonance is further evidenced by the collapse of channelling above the Curie temperature of dysprosium. Its helical/ferromagnetic phase transition provides an original means for switching on the magnetic modulation independently of the applied magnetic field by changing the temperature. We use this effect to demonstrate that the magnetoresistance due to snake orbits is one order of magnitude higher that the magnetoresistance due to the stripe being magnetised while the modulation remains uniformly positive. Experiments in tilted magnetic fields demonstrate that both the resonant peak and the ratio of the Hall resistance upon the Hall resistance of the bare 2 D electron gas scale with the perpendicular component of the applied magnetic field. This demonstrates that the Hall resistance measures the trapping of electrons in or out of magnetic edge states rather than the average magnetic field in the Hall junction. Both results were expected from a simple drift-diffusion picture. Discrete <b>resistance</b> <b>steps</b> obtained when changing the electron density are tentatively assigned to the formation of quantum confined 1 D snake subbands. The gate bias dependence of the resonant peak is discussed in relation to the realistic modulation profile...|$|R

Figure 3 a illustrates that the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model and the E–J power law based model both respond almost simultaneously to the occurrence of a short-circuit fault. However, as the SFCL needs ~ 2 ms to fully quench due to its E–J characteristic and dynamic temperature (Fig. 3 d), the first peak reduction gained onto the <b>step</b> <b>resistance</b> model is overestimated by 11 % (7.6 and 6.5  kA for the two SFCL models, respectively. 10  kA without SFCL), as shown in Fig. 3 b.

40|$|Electrical {{detection}} of spin transport in a semiconductor (SC) channel {{is one of}} the key requirements to realize spintronics devices. Among various SC materials, the high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) confined in a modulation doped quantum well structure (MODQW) is of particular interest for device applications. This is because the high mobility promises for a long spin diffusion length of coherent transport as well as large spin signal for easy sensing. Meanwhile, the effective spin manipulation is achievable either by enhanced Rashba spin-orbit interaction from an asymmetric E-field structure, or by direct control of discrete density of states (DOS) within the quantum well structure. Despite of these merits, very few studies of direct electrical spin injection into 2 DEG have been reported so far, mainly because of the difficulty in making reliable ferromagnetic (FM) contacts to the buried 2 DEG channel. In literature, only a few reports in Si/SiO 2 and III-V matrices are available up to now; however, electrical {{detection of}} spin transport in the high-mobility 2 DEG in a Si/SiGe MODQW has not been reported. To make continuous progress of Si-based spintronics and to take full advantage of current CMOS technology, there is an urgent need to develop Si-based spintronics devices. In this thesis we present two related projects: first is spin injection in Ge; second is spin injection in Si two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) system. It is the knowledge built up from the Ge project helps us successfully demonstrate electrical spin injection in Si 2 DEG in a Si/SiGe MODQW using FM Mn-germanosilicide (Mn(Si 0. 7 Ge 0. 3) x) end contacts, which is a new approach to circumvent the difficulty of etching process adopted for the typical spin valve devices. The experiments show that the spin-polarized electrons could be laterally injected into one side of the 2 DEG confined at the Si/SiGe interface, and subsequently detected from the other side by the magnetoresistance (MR) of a FM/ 2 DEG/FM spin valve.

The heating process up to sintering temperature, plays a major role, the major proportion of densification occurs during the heating process. The composites produced were subjected to the following tests: densification, Vickers micro hardness, microstructure using SEM and X-ray diffraction analysis.

5000|$|As Dynasty {{begins on}} January 12, 1981, {{powerful}} oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) {{is about to}} marry the younger Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans), his former secretary. Beautiful, earnest, and new to Blake's world, Krystle finds a hostile reception in the Carrington household — the staff patronizes her, and Blake's headstrong and promiscuous daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) resents her. Though devoted to Krystle, Blake himself is too preoccupied with his company, Denver-Carrington, and blind to Krystle's predicament. Her only ally is her stepson Steven (Al Corley), whose complicated relationship with Blake stems from their fundamental political differences and Steven's <b>resistance</b> to <b>step</b> into his role as future leader of the Carrington empire. Meanwhile, Fallon, better suited to follow in Blake's footsteps, is (as a woman) underestimated by and considered {{little more than a}} trophy to her father. She channels her energies into toying with various male suitors, including the Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane (Wayne Northrop). At the end of the three-hour premiere episode [...] "Oil", Steven finally confronts his father, criticizing Blake's capitalistic values and seemingly-amoral business practices. Blake explodes, revealing the secret of which Steven thought his father was unaware: Blake is disgusted by Steven's homosexuality, and his refusal to [...] "conform" [...] sets father and son at odds for some time.|$|R
30|$|After {{the first}} step, the patient usually {{experiences}} tenderness of the bonded teeth, which disappears in 20 to 30  min. After the second step, tenderness lasting 10 – 15 min then shifts to the palatal incisor area and, finally, following the third step, to the suture area. A decrease in tenderness of the bonded teeth and/or tenderness in the sutural area {{may indicate that}} the maxillary halves have been separated. However, a successful separation can only be confirmed by occlusal radiograph, before and after maxillary expansion. In the event of increased palatal suture <b>resistance,</b> a fourth <b>step</b> with two additional turns may be performed. In this case, tenderness in the temporo- and fronto-zygomatic areas may be experienced. The number of steps and associated turns therefore depends on suture intercuspidation.|$|R
