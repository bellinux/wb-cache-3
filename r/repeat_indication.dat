25|$|It {{has already}} been {{discussed}} that qin music has a rhythm, {{and that it is}} only vaguely indicated in the tablature. Though there is an amount of guesswork involved, the tablature has clues to indicate rhythm, such as <b>repeating</b> motifs, <b>indication</b> of phrases or how the notation is arranged. Throughout the history of the qinpu, we see many attempts to indicate this rhythm more explicitly, involving devices like dots to make beats. Probably, one of the major projects to regulate the rhythm to a large scale was the compilers of the Qinxue Congshu tablature collection of the 1910s to 1930s. The construction of the written tablature was divided into two columns. The first was further divided into about three lines of a grid, each line indicating a varied combination of lyrics, gongche tablature, se tablature, pitch, and/or beats depending on the score used. The second column was devoted to qin tablature.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{propensity}} for heavy fog {{in some parts}} of the British Isles, fog signal rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly up to each signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators – small explosive charges that could be strapped to the rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to <b>repeat</b> the <b>indication</b> of the signal using his lantern; the semaphore arm was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the distant signal were displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the distant signal were clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed.|$|R
40|$|The soybean cyst {{nematode}} (SCN) resistance locus Rhg 1 is a tandem repeat of a 31. 2 kb unit of the soybean genome. Each 31. 2 -kb unit contains four genes. One allele of Rhg 1, Rhg 1 -b, is responsible for protecting most US soybean production from SCN. Whole-genome sequencing was performed, and PCR assays were developed to investi-gate allelic variation in sequence and copy number of the Rhg 1 locus across a popula-tion of soybean germplasm accessions. Four distinct sequences of the 31. 2 -kb repeat unit were identified, and some Rhg 1 alleles carry up to three different types of repeat unit. The total number of copies of the repeat varies from 1 to 10 per haploid genome. Both copy number and sequence of the repeat correlate with the resistance phenotype, and the Rhg 1 locus shows strong signatures of selection. Significant linkage disequilib-rium in the genome outside {{the boundaries of the}} repeat allowed the Rhg 1 genotype to be inferred using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of 15 996 accessions. Over 860 germplasm accessions were found likely to possess Rhg 1 alleles. The regions surrounding the <b>repeat</b> show <b>indications</b> of non-neutral evolution and high genetic variability in populations from different geographic locations, but with-out evidence of fixation of the resistant genotype. A compelling explanation of these results is that balancing selection is in operation at Rhg 1...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} variables {{associated with}} failure of gastroenterologist directed moderate sedation (GDS) during {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP) and derive a predictive model for use of anesthesiologist directed sedation (ADS) in selected patients. METHODS: With institutional review board approval, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive records of all patients who underwent ERCPs between July 1, 2009 to October 1, 2011 to identify patient related and procedure related factors which could predict failure of GDS. For patient related factors, we abstracted and analyzed data regarding the age, gender, ethnicity, alcohol and illicit drug use habits. For procedure related factors, we abstracted data regarding initial or <b>repeat</b> procedures, <b>indication</b> for performing ERCP, the interventions performed during ERCP, and the grade d difficulty of cannulation as defined in the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines. Our outcome of interest was procedural success. If the procedure was not successful, the reasons for failure of procedures were recorded along with immediate post procedure complications. Multivariate analysis was then performed to define factors associated with failure of GDS and a model constructed to predict requirement of ADS. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of patients undergoing GDS could not complete the procedure due to intolerance and 2 % due to cardiovascular complications. Substance abuse, male gender, black race and alcohol use were significant predictors of failure of GDS on univariate analysis and substance abuse and higher grade of procedure remained significant on multivariate analysis. Using our predictive model where the presence of substance abuse was given 1 point and planned grade of intervention was scored from 1 - 3, only 12 % patients with a score of 1 would require ADS due to failure of GDS, compared to 50 % with a score of 3 or higher. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ERCP under GDS is safe and effective for low grade procedures, and ADS should be judiciously reserved for procedures which have {{a higher risk of}} failure with moderate sedation...|$|R

METHODS: Prospective intention-to-treat analysis of patients referred for biliary cannulation following recent unsuccessful ERCP. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (35 female; mean age: 62. 5 years; age range: 40 - 87 years) with previous failed biliary cannulation were referred for <b>repeat</b> ERCP. The <b>indication</b> for ERCP was primarily choledocholithiasis (45 %) or pancreatic malignancy (18 %). Successful biliary cannulation was 100 %. The precut needle knife sphincterotomy (NKS) rate was 27. 4 %. Complications occurred in 3. 9 % (post-ERCP pancreatitis). An identifiable reason for initial unsuccessful biliary cannulation was present in 55 % of cases. Compared to a cohort of 940 naïve papilla patients (female 61 %; mean age: 59. 9 years; age range: 18 - 94 years) who required sphincterotomy over the same time period, there was no statistical difference in the cannulation success rate (100 % vs 98 %) or post-ERCP pancreatitis (3. 1 % vs 3. 9 %). Precut NKS use was more frequent (27. 4 % vs 12. 7 %) (P = 0. 017). CONCLUSION: Referral to a high-volume center following unsuccessful ERCP is associated with high technical success, with a favorable complication rate, compared to routine ERCP procedures...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to detail the early experience after infrainguinal atherectomy using the Silverhawk plaque excision catheter for the treatment of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease. MethodsA prospective database was established in August 2004 in which data for operations, outcomes, and follow-up were recorded for patients undergoing percutaneous plaque excision for peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) ischemia scores and femoropopliteal TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) criteria were assigned. A follow-up protocol included duplex ultrasound surveillance at 1, 3, and 6 months and then yearly thereafter. Standard statistical analyses were performed. ResultsDuring a 17 -month period, 66 limbs of 60 patients (37 men [61. 7 %]) underwent 70 plaque excisions (four <b>repeat</b> procedures). <b>Indications</b> included tissue loss based on SVS ischemia at grades 5 and 6 (25 / 70), rest pain at grade 4 (22 / 70), and claudication at grades 2 to 3 (23 / 70). The mean lesion length was 8. 8 ± 0. 7 cm. The technical success rate was 87. 1 % (61 / 70). Adjunctive treatment was required in 17 procedures (24. 3 %), consisting of 14 balloon angioplasties and three stents. Femoropopliteal TASC criteria included 5 TASC A lesions, 14 TASC B lesions, 32 TASC C lesions, and 19 TASC D lesions. Although 17 plaque excisions included a tibial vessel, no patient underwent isolated tibial atherectomy. The mean increase in ankle-brachial index was 0. 27 ± 0. 04 and in toe pressure, 20. 3 ± 6. 9 mm Hg. Mean duplex ultrasound follow-up was 5. 2 months (range, 1 to 17 months). One-year primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency was 61. 7 %, 64. 1 %, and 76. 4 %, respectively. Restenosis or occlusion developed in 12 patients (16. 7 %) and was detected at a mean of 2. 8 ± 0. 7 months. Restenosis or occlusion was significantly more common (P <. 05) in patients with TASC C and D lesions compared with patients with TASC A and B lesions. Six (8. 3 %) of 12 patients underwent reintervention on the basis of duplex ultrasound surveillance results. Four (33. 3 %) of 12 patients experienced reocclusion during the same hospitalization, and amputation and open revascularization were required in two patients each. ConclusionsPercutaneous plaque excision is a viable treatment option for lower extremity revascularization. Outcomes are related to ischemia and lesion severity. Patency and limb salvage rates are equivalent to other endovascular modalities...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In today’s obstetric {{practice}} {{we encounter}} {{increasing number of}} post caesarean pregnancies because of rise in primary caesarean due to multi factorial reasons. There is increasing concern by obstetricians for managing these cases for medical and legal point of view. Present study was undertaken to decide appropriate mode of delivery and to conduct the proper management of patients with previous lower segment caesarean section. Study design: This is a prospective {{study carried out on}} 50 women with previous lower segment caesarean section. From December 2010 to December 2012 at private hospital Ahmedabad. Patient enrolled in study are with previous lower segment caesarean section (classical CS), Inverted T incision other medical complications (Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anemia, heart disease, cardiac disease patients excluded.) Patients were evaluated thoroughly by history and examination and mode of delivery was decided. Informed consent was taken of the patients who were fit for VBAC (Vaginal Birth after caesarean section). Women who were given trial ofVBAC, they progressed into labour spontaneously. Labour was constantly supervised by competent staff and meticulously monitored by cardiotocography. Results and discussion: Out of 50 cases, 40 (80 %) patients had history of previous 1 cesarean section, 8 (16 %) patients had history of previous 2 cesarean section and 2 (4 %) had history of previous 3 cesarean section.  Number of previous cesarean section has an important effect on outcome of labour as number of previous cesarean section increases, a repeat LSCS increases.  Amongst 8 (16 %) patients with history of previous 2 LSCS and 2 (4 %) patients with previous 3 LSCS, repeat LSCS was done in all 10 patients as there is no policy to give trial in patients of previous two or more caesarean sections.  In present study, out of 40 patients with history of previous 1 cesarean section, in 20 patients repeat LSCS was done without giving trial of labour. Out of 20 patients who were given trial of labour, 12 patients had vaginal delivery and repeat LSCS was done in 8 patients  Out of 50 patients, 12 patients delivered withvaginal delivery while 38 patients underwent repeat LSCS.  Repeat LSCS rate is higher due to trend towards less trial of labour and early decision of <b>repeat</b> LSCS.  <b>Indication</b> of previous LSCS {{plays an important role in}} taking decisions and an outcome in present pregnancy. Patients with non-recurrent indication had more chance of delivering vaginally as compared to those with recurrent indications.  In present study, commonest <b>indication</b> for <b>repeat</b> LSCS was previous two LSCS followed by CPD and fetal distress.  Vaginal delivery is more likely when there is past history of vaginal delivery before and after previous LSCS.  Abandoning of a trial was mainly due to fetal distress and non-progress of labour in majority of cases. Conclusion: For successful delivery after a previous cesarean section, the obstetrician requires to have the expertise to carefully select the patients, for trial of vaginal birth because rupture of scar can endanger the life of the mother and the child.  VBAC should be considered in cases of previous one caesarean section done for non recurrent <b>indications.</b> <b>Repeat</b> LSCS rate is higher due to trend towards less trial of labour and early decision of repeat LSC...|$|R

The extent and determinants of disease progression in this patient subset remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate general risk factors for late outcomes among patients ≤ 50 years old who underwent PCI. Coronary aRtery diseAse in younG adults (CRAGS) is a multicenter European retrospective registry that enrolled 1617 patients (age ≤ 50 years) who underwent PCI over the years 2002 - 2012. The median follow-up was 3. 0 years. The majority of patients were smokers who were nevertheless prescribed adequate secondary prevention medication, including statins, aspirin, beta blockers and/or ACE inhibitors/AT blockers. At 5 years, survival was 97. 8 %, while freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 74. 1 %, from repeat revascularization 77. 8 % and from myocardial infarction 89. 9 %. Altogether 13. 5 % of patients exhibited disease progression that indicated a need for <b>repeat</b> revascularization. Other <b>indications</b> for <b>repeat</b> revascularization were restenosis (7. 1 %) and stent thrombosis (2. 1 %) at the 5 -year follow-up. Independent post-PCI predictors of disease progression were multivessel disease, diabetes and hypertension. PCI is associated with excellent survival in patients ≤ 50 years old. Nevertheless, despite guideline-adherent medication, every eighth patient underwent repeat revascularization due to disease progression diagnosed at the median follow-up of three years, underscoring the need for more effective secondary prevention than currently available...|$|R
30|$|In total, 25 {{surgical}} patients underwent abdominal NPT {{during the}} period from 2007 to 2012. In three patients, home-made systems were used. Since 2010, vacuum-assisted abdominal closure systems ABThera™ (KCI® Riga, Latvia) were applied to the 22 patients who were prospectively included in the study. The indication for NPT was complicated intra-abdominal infection with severe sepsis due to total purulent peritonitis and/or ACS. The decision to apply NPT in cases of advanced peritonitis was based on evidence that complete source control would require a <b>repeated</b> laparotomy. The <b>indication</b> for decompressive laparotomy was a sustained increase of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) > 25 mmHg for more than 24 h despite aggressive complex conservative therapy including continuous veno-venous haemofiltration and percutaneous drainage of the intra-abdominal fluid collections if indicated [6]. During the application of the NPT systems, all patients were treated in the ICU. Before the operation, the patient's condition and severity of sepsis were assessed by calculation of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score on admission and assessment of organ dysfunction according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [7]. After the operation, the Mannheim peritonitis index (MPI) was calculated to predict the individual risk of death due to peritonitis [8]. Dynamic assessment of organ dysfunction and clinical course of sepsis was done by daily calculation of the SOFA score. IAP was measured with the patient in supine position, instillation of 20 mL of sterile saline solution and the linea axillaris media and crista iliaca cross point as the zero point. IAP was measured twice daily during the patients' ICU stay. IAH was defined by a sustained or repeated pathological elevation in IAP ≥ 12 mmHg. ACS was diagnosed when sustained increase of the IAP > 20 mmHg and one new organ dysfunction were detected [9]. Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) was calculated in all patients with IAH and defined as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the IAP. The decision to discontinue negative-pressure therapy and to perform permanent closure of the abdominal cavity was based on preoperative evidence of stable regression of the inflammatory response, regression of organ dysfunction and sepsis. Intraoperative evidence of a visually clean abdomen (absence of abscesses or purulent exudate, disappearance of fibrin) and well-perfused bowels with recovered transit determined the decision to close the abdomen. Bacteriological samples from the abdominal cavity were taken during all operations; however, we did not wait until all intraoperative cultures would become negative. Blood cultures from the abdominal effluent were collected until regression of sepsis and stable decrease of the C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood were achieved. Positive blood culture was defined as septicaemia. The complication rate, hospital and ICU stay and main outcomes were analysed for all patients. Application of NPT was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained according to institutional practice. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0. All data have been changed to median values and range.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} yield and clinical value of early <b>repeat</b> colonoscopies for <b>indications</b> other than colorectal cancer (CRC) screening/surveillance. METHODS: A retrospective review {{of patients who}} {{had more than one}} colonoscopy performed for the same indication within a three year time frame at our tertiary care referral hospital between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2010 was conducted. Exclusion criteria included repeat colonoscopies performed for CRC screening/surveillance, poor bowel preparation, suspected complications from the index procedure, and incomplete initial procedure. Primary outcome was new endoscopic finding that led to an endoscopic therapeutic intervention or any change in clinical management. Clinical parameters including age, sex, race, interval between procedures, indication of the procedure, presenting symptoms, severity of symptoms, hemodynamic instability, duration between onset of symptoms and when the procedure was performed, change in endoscopist, withdrawal time, location of colonic lesions and improvement of quality of bowel preparation were analyzed using bivariate analysis and logistic regression analysis to examine correlation with this primary outcome. RESULTS: Among 19 &#x 2005;&#x 2005; 772 colonoscopies performed during the above mentioned period, 947 colonoscopies (4. 79 %) were repeat colonoscopies performed within 3 years from the index procedure. Out of these repeat colonoscopies, 139 patient pairs met the inclusion criteria. The majority of repeat colonoscopies were for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (88. 4 %), change in bowel habits (6. 4 %) and abdominal pain (5 %). Among 139 eligible patient pairs of colonoscopies, only repeat colonoscopies that were done for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain produced endoscopic findings that led to a change in management [25 out of 123 (20. 33 %) and 2 out of 7 (28. 57 %), respectively]. When looking at only recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding cases, new endoscopic findings included 8 previously undetected hemorrhoid lesions (6. 5 %), 7 actively bleeding lesions requiring endoscopic intervention, which included 3 bleeding arterio-venous malformations (2. 43 %), 2 bleeding radiation colitis (1. 6 %), and 2 bleeding internal hemorrhoids (1. 6 %), 5 previously undetected tubular adenomas [4 were smaller than 1 cm (4. 9 %) and 1 was larger than 1 cm (0. 8 %) ], 3 radiation colitis (2. 43 %), 1 rectal ulcer (0. 8 %), and 1 previously undetected right sided colon cancer (0. 8 %). Of the 25 new endoscopic findings, 18 (72 %) were found when repeat colonoscopy was done within the first year after the index procedure. These findings were 1 rectal ulcer, 3 radiation colitis, 4 new hemorrhoid lesions, 3 previously undetected tubular adenomas, and 7 actively bleeding lesions requiring endoscopic intervention. Of all parameters analyzed, only the interval between procedures less than one year was associated with higher likelihood of finding a clinically significant change in repeat colonoscopy (odds ratios of interval between procedures of 1 - 2 year and 2 - 3 year compared to 0 - 1 year were 0. 09; 95 %CI 0. 01 - 0. 74, P = 0. 025 and 0. 26; 95 %CI 0. 09 - 0. 72, P = 0. 010 respectively). No complications were observed among all 139 colonoscopy pairs. CONCLUSION: There is clinical value of repeating a colonoscopy for recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding, especially within the first year after the index procedure...|$|R
