40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, bemoaning the many roadblocks to {{reforming}} important aspect of German politics has become commonplace. Explanations emphasize formal and informal veto points, such as the role of political institutions {{and the lack of}} elite and societal support for reform initiatives. Against this background, I was interested in factors that place policy issues on the political agenda and follow up with concrete courses of action; i. e., in factors that lead to a disentangling of the <b>reform</b> <b>gridlock.</b> I emphasize the importance of agenda setting in the emergence of higher education reform in Germany. Globalization, European integration and domestic pressures combined to create new pressures for change. In response, an advocacy coalition of old and new political actors has introduced a drawn-out and ongoing process of value reorientation in the direction of competition, including international competition, and greater autonomy. The result has been a burst of activities, some moderate, some more far-reaching in their potential to restructure German higher education...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model for}} analysing dynamics in higher education politics (DHEP). Theoretically the model draws on the conceptual history of political contingency, agenda-setting theories and previous research on higher education dynamics. According to the model, socio-historical complexity can best be analysed along two dimensions: the political situation and political possibilities. Politics as a situation connotes {{the idea of an}} opportune moment when politics can be changed, and political possibilities concern the different alternatives the actors see in different situations. Depending on whether the situation is favourable or unfavourable to change, and on whether the possibilities are politicised or settled, the DHEP model introduces four types of dynamic: <b>reform,</b> <b>gridlock,</b> consensual change and friction. On the empirical level the model has been tested and developed in the context of Finnish higher education by means of interviews and documentary material. It was found, in the Finnish context, that four policy threads functioned according to each of the dynamics. It appears from the empirical findings that dynamics in higher education politics are strongly related to changes that are external to the higher education political system, the changing positions of the actors in different policy threads and the unexpected nature of the dynamics. The DHEP {{can also be used to}} shed light on the effects of the silent, settled possibilities that may enable or disable other policy threads within a higher education system...|$|E
40|$|In Dahl’s (1967) terminology, Germany’s {{opposition}} {{has become more}} competitive since the Greens gained representation in the Bundestag in 1983. It {{was only then that}} the opportunities arising from the Federal Republic’s parliamentary reforms starting in the late 1960 s were actually utilised. The increasing fragmentation of the party system left of the political centre led to more competition amongst centre-left and left-wing parties and a larger ideological range in the party system overall. This tendency was further enhanced {{by the fact that the}} Greens (during the 1980 s) and the PDS/Die Linke since 1990 were at least initially treated as outsiders by the established parties. As such, they were not included in the relatively co-operative negotiations typical of Germany’s government-opposition relations. Their only chance to make a mark was to do so by seeking publicity in the chamber and media. In addition to behavioural changes, the main institutional sources of opposition strength in the German Bundestag are, firstly, organisational: The parliamentary parties receive relatively generous resources to support their work; their internal organisation is highly diversified, and policy expertise is rewarded through the distribution of leadership positions; and the parliamentary parties’ working groups are closely linked with the standing committees of the Bundestag. Secondly, the opposition’s strength in the German Bundestag is derived from parliament’s external environment. In particular, the importance of the Bundesrat and the usual incongruence of Bundestag and Bundesrat majorities force the government to negotiate with the opposition, or with federal states governed by the opposition. Similarly, the {{opposition has}} direct access to the Federal Constitutional Court to challenge government legislation. These external factors, in particular, have been simultaneously problematic, however. They have contributed to <b>reform</b> <b>gridlock</b> on the one hand and (due to the obvious discrepancy between adversarial rhetoric in the chamber and co-operative policy making in practice) and may also have exacerbated public cynicism about parliament on the other...|$|E
40|$|Last night President Obama {{gave his}} annual State of the Union address {{to a joint}} session of Congress, against the {{backdrop}} of a troubled rollout for his signature healthcare <b>reform,</b> and Congressional <b>gridlock</b> over issues such as the minimum wage and immigration reform. James D. Boys writes that the speech may have been Obama’s best chance at reinvigorating a beleaguered administration, but that it largely failed to do so. He writes that Obama’s State of the Union had little new to offer, save for small postures and restated positions, and that his stated willingness to act by Executive Authority will do nothing to assist bi-partisanship...|$|R
