5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates.

Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate.
