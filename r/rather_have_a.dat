According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were not satisfied with the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new apartment than the money.|$|E

5|$|After {{unsuccessful}} litigation to {{stop the}} project, the Big Four Bridge was converted into a pedestrian and bicycle bridge as part of Louisville Waterfront Park and the ongoing revitalization of the Louisville riverfront. This conversion had been proposed and planned since the 1990s. The Indiana Department of Transportation pledged $1million for the project to build a ramp to the Big Four Bridge on the Indiana side, on Riverside Drive, and Jeffersonville pledged $200,000; early estimates were that the Indiana ramp would cost $2.8million, but was likely to increase. The Kentucky ramp was expected to cost $4million; the ramp foundation is already done. Fixing the Big Four Bridge was expected to cost $3million and take 18months. The only other facility still standing that was owned by the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway is the Spring Street Freight House. However, the mayor of Jeffersonville, Tom Galligan, called for a redesign of the entrance ramp to the bridge on the Indiana side, stressing that the proposed ramp would be unattractive and that {{the building of the}} column on a flood plain would probably not be possible. Galligan pointed out that neither the United States Coast Guard nor the Army Corps of Engineers had approved of the planned rampway. Galligan said he would <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> ramp that reached over the floodwall and ended on Mulberry Street, causing a less severe incline on and off the bridge. Previous plans to access the Big Four Bridge included building an elevator.|$|E

[...] "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. [...] "If you are down-and-out, would you <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?"

Despite their influences from other genres, the band was most inspired by country music, which is most evident in their [...] "harmonies, songwriting, and approach." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that the band is [...] "indebted to country, particularly the Bakersfield sound of Merle Haggard, and the sound of Nashville pop." [...] The band echoed its country upbringing in one of its first trade articles: [...] "We're country first and crossover second.

500|$|An early {{draft of}} the script {{attributed}} to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house {{in the guise of}} Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish for her brother to be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this {{draft of the}} script, and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would [...] "much <b>rather</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Queen" [...] than [...] "a little goblin prince." [...] The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, her blows causing him to transform into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas in the film she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas in the film there is none (although there is in the novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualized.|$|E
