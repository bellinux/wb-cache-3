5|$|Sophie/Dogface Victoria <b>Reade</b> (born 18 May 1989) is a glamour {{model from}} Nantwich, Cheshire, has {{appeared}} in Hot Shots Calendar and was {{the winner of the}} series. <b>Reade</b> changed her name by deed poll to Dogface, to become a house-mate during the show's first week. On Day 33 Big Brother told <b>Reade</b> that she had to remain silent until 2am as punishment for discussing nominations; she failed to keep quiet and therefore faced the public vote. <b>Reade</b> had a romantic relationship with Kris in the House. On Day 39 she and Siavash were punished by Big Brother for talking about nominations, and told they were not allowed to swear before 3pm; they both failed and faced eviction. On Day 72, as a special prize, Dogface (<b>Reade)</b> legally changed her name back to Sophie. Since Day 88, Sophie was the bookies' favourite to win. She left the house to huge cheers and a lively crowd chanting her name.|$|E

5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had {{confessed to}} the murders of Pauline <b>Reade</b> and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided that nothing would be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|The {{police were}} {{initially}} aware {{of only three}} killings, those of Edward Evans, Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride. The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady {{was reported in the}} press as having confessed to the murders of Pauline <b>Reade</b> and Keith Bennett. Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist the police in their search for the graves, both by then having confessed to the additional murders.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brady {{allegedly}} {{confessed to}} Fred Harrison, a journalist working for The Sunday People, {{that he had}} also {{been responsible for the}} murders of Pauline <b>Reade</b> and Keith Bennett, something that the police already suspected, as both children lived in the same area as Brady and Hindley and had disappeared {{at about the same time}} as their other victims. The subsequent newspaper reports prompted the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to reopen the case, in an investigation headed by Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Topping, who had been appointed head of GMP's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) the previous year.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reade's</b> novels were popular, and he {{was among}} England's highest-paid novelists. However, many {{libraries}} refused to carry his works {{on the grounds that}} they were indecent.|$|R
5|$|Joan <b>Reade,</b> Pauline Reade's mother, was {{admitted}} to Springfield Mental Hospital in Manchester. She was present, under heavy sedation, at the funeral of her daughter on 7 August 1987. Five years after their son was murdered, Sheila and Patrick Kilbride divorced. Ann West, mother of Lesley Ann Downey, died in 1999 from cancer of the liver. Since her daughter's death, she had campaigned to ensure that Hindley remained in prison, and doctors said that the stress had contributed to the severity of her illness. Winnie Johnson, mother of Keith Bennett, continued to visit Saddleworth Moor, where {{it is believed that}} the body of her son is buried. She died in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Moors murders {{were carried}} out by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley between July 1963 and October 1965, in and around Manchester, England. The victims were five {{children}} aged between 10 and 17—Pauline <b>Reade,</b> John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans—at least four of whom were sexually assaulted. Two {{of the victims were}} discovered in graves dug on Saddleworth Moor; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial. The body of a fourth victim, Keith Bennett, is also suspected to be buried there, but despite repeated searches remains undiscovered.|$|E
5|$|When in 2002 {{another life}} {{sentence}} prisoner challenged the Home Secretary's power to set minimum terms, Hindley {{and hundreds of}} others, whose tariffs had been increased by politicians, looked likely {{to be released from}} prison. Hindley's release seemed imminent and plans were made by supporters for her to be given a new identity. Home Secretary David Blunkett ordered Greater Manchester Police to find new charges against her, to prevent her release from prison. The investigation was headed by Superintendent Tony Brett, and initially looked at charging Hindley with the murders of Pauline <b>Reade</b> and Keith Bennett, but the advice given by government lawyers was that because of the DPP's decision taken 15 years earlier, a new trial would probably be considered an abuse of process.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline <b>Reade</b> was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E

While the 'woman-hating' character of Vizard has to be persuaded of Rhoda's potential to do good, <b>Reade's</b> own attitude is sympathetic: [...] " [...] [...] [...] it matters greatly to mankind whether the whole race of women are to be allowed to study medicine and practice it".|$|R
