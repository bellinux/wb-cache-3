40|$|At the Baltic {{coast of}} Germany, {{approximately}} 50 groynes are replaced or newly built {{every year in}} average. Since the use of tropical wood was introduced, the costs for groyne piles have extremely increased. Costs are directly depending on the <b>ramming</b> <b>depth,</b> which is determined by an empirical approach based on a single parameter only – the water depth- since more than hundred years. New approaches and more scientific rules for the dimensioning of the <b>ramming</b> <b>depth</b> of wooden groyne piles are needed to save costs, if possible. This paper provides an insight into a 4 years research work on loads and holding forces of groyne piles in shallow water. Movement of piles under wave impact, resulting liquefaction effects and vertical ice loads were investigated. The basics of recommendations for the dimensioning of wooden groynes are presented. These recommendations include results of investigations of the subsoil properties and scour effects. ...|$|E

UC-47 was <b>rammed</b> and <b>depth</b> charged by British patrol boat P-57, {{under the command of}} H.C. Birnie, off Flamborough Head on 18 November 1917. UC-47 went down with all hands.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} two were fired in Sydney Harbour by the midget M-21. The timing of their firing and their target, if any, are unknown. M-21 had been <b>rammed</b> and <b>depth</b> charged by HMAS Yandra {{at the entrance}} to Sydney Harbour around 2300 on May 31, but managed to recover sufficiently to enter the harbour at 03:01 on June 1. M-21 was eventually cornered and sunk at 05:15 on June 1 in Taylors Bay inside Sydney Harbour. When the wreck was raised on June 4, both torpedoes had been fired. However the bow caps covering the torpedo tubes failed to drop clear, instead remaining caught in the buckled bow cage of the submarine. The No. 1 torpedo travelled approximately three feet clear of the tube before jamming. The No. 2 torpedo travelled 18 inches before it too jammed.|$|R
5000|$|When the Japanese {{attacked}} Pearl Harbor, Curtiss got underway immediately, {{firing at}} the Japanese planes. At 08:36, she sighted a periscope and opened fire. A torpedo from the submarine narrowly missed the Curtiss, smashing into a dock at Pearl City. Four minutes later, the Japanese midget submarine surfaced and was further damaged by gunfire before diving again, {{after which the}} destroyer [...] took over with a <b>ramming</b> and <b>depth</b> charge attack. Curtiss {{turned her attention to}} the air again. At 09:05, she hit a Japanese plane which crashed into her No. 1 crane and burned. Three minutes later, she splashed a plane, then began firing at a dive bomber. A bomb from this plane struck Curtiss in the vicinity of her damaged crane and exploded below decks, setting the hangar and main decks and No. 4 handling room on fire, as the plane splashed off her port beam. Despite 19 dead and many wounded, Curtiss crew quenched the fires, then turned to for emergency repairs.|$|R
5000|$|... === Attack on Japanese {{submarine}} === Five {{minutes before}} sunrise on 20 November, while on patrol station number 4, Vigilance sighted a small wake 700 yd broad on the starboard quarter.

50|$|Mason joined Task Force 64 at Norfolk, Virginia, on 17 December. Two {{days later}} she sailed in convoy for Europe, passing by Gibraltar on 4 January 1945 to be {{relieved}} of escort duties. Continuing to Algeria, she entered Oran on 5 January {{for the formation}} of TG 60.11. The escort ship cleared Oran 7 January. Four days later the Mason made radar contact with a surface target. She rang up full speed with all battle stations manned to attack the presumptive submarine, <b>rammed,</b> and dropped <b>depth</b> charges. Unable to regain contact, the ship returned to the contact point, where searchlight revealed the target—a wooden derelict about 100 by 50 ft. Mason then steamed to Bermuda for repairs, entering St. George's Harbor on 19 January. Five days later she reached the New York Navy Yard.|$|R
5000|$|C16 {{was built}} by Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard, laid down on 14 December 1906 and was {{commissioned}} on 5 June 1908. The boat collided with [...] south of Cromer, Norfolk on 14 July 1909 when the steamer Eddystone drove through the flotilla - colliding with and sinking [...] C16 was undamaged and participated in the Lord Mayor's Pageant (17-24 July 1909). C16 was sunk after being <b>rammed</b> at periscope <b>depth</b> by destroyer [...] off Harwich on 16 April 1917. The boat bottomed out at 60 ft. A Mate - Samuel Anderson - was fired through a torpedo tube to try to escape, but unfortunately drowned. The captain - Lieutenant Harold Boase - tried to flood the boat {{in an effort to}} escape through the fore hatch, but the fender jammed the hatch, so the crew was trapped. The escape attempts were recorded by the commanding officer, and were found corked in a bottle found lying near him when the hull was salvaged. All the crew of C16 died. C16 was salvaged and recommissioned. C16 was finally sold on 12 August 1922.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{artificial}} neural network {{was used as a}} modeling tool for simulation and prediction of extrusion pressure and product deflection of extrudes of lead alloys. An extensive experimental program was undertaken to extrude a lead (Pb) alloy on ELE Compact- 1500 compression machine. The neural model of extrusion pressure and product deflection was developed based on groups of experiments carried out as samples, Eight (8) die bearing parameters (die bearing length, radius of curvature, slip angle, die angle, die ratio <b>ram</b> displacement, pocket <b>depth</b> and die diameter) were used as inputs into the network architecture of 8 [4 - 3] 2 2 in predicting the extrusion pressure and product deflection. After series of network architectures were trained using different training algorithms such as Levenberg-Marquardt, Bayesian Regulation, Resilient Backpropagation using MATLAB 7. 9. 0 (R 20096, the LM 8 [4 - 3] 2 2 was selected as the most appropriate model. Prediction of the neural model exhibited reasonable correlation with the experimental extrusion pressure and product deflection. The predicted extrusion pressure and product deflection gave reasonable errors and higher correlation coefficients indicating that the model is robust for predicting extrusion pressure and product deflection...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} in sheep has {{two major}} limiting factors: the poor quality of frozen-thawed ram semen and the convoluted {{anatomy of the}} sheep cervix that does not allow transcervical passage of an inseminating catheter. It has been demonstrated that in the ewe during estrus, there is a degree of cervical relaxation mediated by ovarian and possibly gonadotrohic hormones, and {{we set out to}} investigate factors that might enhance cervical relaxation. Five experiments were conducted on ewes of different breeds to determine: 1) the pattern of cervical penetration during the periovulatory period in ewes of several breeds (Welsh Mountain, Ile-de-France, Vendeenne, Romanov and Sarda); 2) the effect of the "ram effect" a socio-sexual stimulus, on cervical penetration; and 3) the effects of the intracervical administration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), oxytocin and a prostaglandin E agonist (misoprostol) on the depth of cervical penetration during the periovulatory period. The results showed that during the periovulatory period in all breeds examined, there was increased penetration of the cervical canal (P < 0. 05) by an inseminating catheter. Cervical penetration increased to a maximum 54 h after the removal of progestagen sponges and then gradually declined. Furthermore, the depth of cervical penetration but not its pattern, was affected (P < 0. 05) by the breed of ewe. The maximum depth of cervical penetration was lower (P < 0. 05) in the Vendeenne breed compared to the Ile-de-France and Romanov breeds, which did not differ from one another. In the presence of <b>rams,</b> the <b>depth</b> of cervical penetration was increased at 48 and 54 h after removal of sponges (P < 0. 05) and reduced at 72 h (P < 0. 05). The local administration of hormones FSH, misoprostol (a PGE agonist) and oxytocin alone and in various combinations did not have any significant effect on the depth of cervical penetration during the periovulatory period. In conclusion, the natural relaxation of the cervix observed in ewes of several breeds occurs at a time during estrus, 54 h after the removal of progestagen sponges, which is the most suitable for artificial insemination. The effect was enhanced by the presence of a ram but not by the local intracervical administration of FSH, misoprostol and oxytocin even though oxytocin and PGE(2) are involved in cervical function. The time of maximum cervical penetration in the preovulatory period (54 h) coincides with high LH and estradiol concentrations suggesting they might be responsible for the relaxation of the cervix probably through an oxytocin-PGE mediated pathway...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 24 February 1944 Tally-Ho was ordered back to the Sembilan Islands, and while zig-zagging on the surface at night {{charging}} the batteries, lookouts spotted two wakes ahead. Believing {{there was a possibility}} of the two vessels being friendly (both [...] and [...] being in the area), Tally-Ho immediately altered course to avoid a collision with the rapidly approaching vessels. On making a challenge with the Aldis lamp the vessels responded by altering course straight towards them and dropping depth charges, leaving no doubt they were unfriendly vessels. At this point the closest ship fired a shell which passed dangerously close over Tally-Hos conning tower before the attacker passed closely by the submarine and then turned for another attack. During this encounter Tally-Ho had been unable to dive due to the proximity of the attackers and the shallowness of the waters in the straight, in addition, diving would have presented the attacking ships with the opportunity to <b>ram</b> or <b>depth</b> charge the submarine. In the darkness Tally-Ho manoeuvred to a parallel course to the approaching attacker and the enemy vessel passed closely by the submarine, a loud hammering and tearing noise being heard as the ship passed, the vessel being identified as a Hayabusa-class torpedo boat of 600 tons. As the attacker disappeared in the murk Tally-Ho took on a list to port and assumed a marked bow-down attitude. Bennington decided that the batteries would have sufficient charge to risk diving which Tally-Ho then did. Before closing the conning tower hatch, he noticed that the submarine had taken on a 12-degree list. Once submerged, the crew took stock of the damage, and apart from smashed light bulbs and gauge dial glasses, Tally-Ho appeared to be seaworthy, and she remained submerged until 06:30 of 24 February when Bennington brought Tally-Ho to periscope depth and observed his attacker making unusual manoeuvres apparently searching for the submarine on the starboard quarter some 4 mi off. Tally-Ho remained dived for the following 12 hours before surfacing after dark at 18:25. Upon surfacing it was noticed that the submarine's list had increased to 15 degrees, and it was possible to see the damage to the submarine's port ballast tanks which were all open at the top and beyond further use. With transfer of fuel and water from various tanks and moving of stores and torpedoes, the bow-down attitude was reduced to 4 degrees, and the three-day journey to Trincomalee commenced. This was uneventful apart from encountering a monsoon during the passage of the Bay of Bengal and the possibility of encountering a Japanese submarine close to home. Arriving at Trincomalee harbour on 29 February 1944, Tally-Ho missed her escort and found herself amongst Admiral James Sommerville's battle fleet at exercises. Later, upon examination in dry dock prior to repairs, the extent of the damage to Tally-Hos port ballast tanks became apparent. The rotating screws of the torpedo boat had run the length of the tanks, chewing large holes in them, phosphor bronze fragments of the attacker's propeller blades being discovered inside. Post-war enquiries learned that their attacker's behaviour after the attack had been due to a combination of Tally-Hos lowered port bow hydroplane having pierced the torpedo boat's hull, and the vessel's port screw having been shorn of its blades almost down to the hub.|$|R
