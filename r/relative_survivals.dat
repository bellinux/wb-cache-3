40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} main {{results of the}} first {{population-based}} cancers survival study gathering all French registry data. Survival data on 205, 562 cancer cases diagnosed between 01 / 01 / 1989 and 31 / 12 / 1997 were analysed. Relative survival was estimated using an excess rate model. The evolution of the excess mortality rate over the follow-up period was graphed. The analysis emphasised the effect of age at diagnosis and its variation with time after diagnosis. For breast and prostate cancers, the age-standardised five-year <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> were 84 % and 77 %, respectively. The corresponding results in {{men and women were}} 56 % versus 58 % for colorectal cancer and 12 % versus 16 % for lung cancer. For some cancer sites, the excess mortality rate decreased to low values by five years after diagnosis. For most cancer sites, age at diagnosis was a negative prognostic factor but this effect was often limited to the first year after diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: In {{population-based}} cancer studies a cure fraction model classifies patients {{into those}} who survive the cancer {{and those who}} encounter excess mortality risk compared {{to the general population}} [1]. In this presentation we report the proportion cured and the relative survival pattern for patients diagnosed with uterine cancer in Canada over the period of 1992 - 2005. Methods: We used a non-mixture cure fraction model to estimate the cure fraction rate and the relative survival among â€œuncuredâ€ patients [1]. Then, we predicted the cure fraction rate and median survival for each age group based on the year of diagnosis. Results: Relative survival and cure fraction rate decreased with age but increased gradually over time. <b>Relative</b> <b>survivals</b> for Eastern Canada and Ontario were lower compared to the other regions. The same applies to the comparison between cure fraction rates between the geographical regions. Conclusion: This is the first study using cure fraction model for analysis of uterine cancer. Although there are some limitations attached to this model, it is flexible enough to be used with different parametric distributions and to include different link functions for relative survival analysis.

In this study, formalin-inactivated virus (FIV) was administered by injection, bath-immersion, or orally to determine levels of vaccination-mediated protection against the pathogenic white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Diets supplemented with alfalfa, methyl sulfonyl methane (MSM), or wheat grass were provided with or without FIV. Shrimp injected with FIV and challenged 3, 15, or 30 days after vaccination had cumulative and <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> of 83 %, 67 %, and 33 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Relative</b> <b>survival</b> {{estimates}} cancer {{survival in}} the absence of other causes of death. Previous work has shown that standard errors of non-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> may be substantially overestimated by the conventionally used method. However, evidence was restricted to non-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> estimates using Hakulinen’s method. Here, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of standard errors including age-standardised survival and estimation by the Ederer II method. METHODS: Five- and ten-year non-standardised and age-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> was estimated for patients diagnosed with 25 common forms of cancer in Finland in 1989 – 1993, using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry. Standard errors of mutually comparable non-standardised and age-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> were computed by the conventionally used method and compared with bootstrap standard errors. RESULTS: When using Hakulinen’s method, standard errors of non-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> were overestimated by up to 28 %. In contrast, standard errors of age-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> were accurately estimated. When using the Ederer II method, deviations of the standard errors of non-standardised and age-standardised <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> were generally small to negligible. CONCLUSION: In most cases, overestimations of standard errors are effectively overcome by age standardisation and by using Ederer II rather than Hakulinen’s method...|$|R

The higher <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> rates are observed in Scandinavian countries and the lower rates are observed in the UK and the countries of Eastern Europe. <b>Relative</b> <b>survival</b> is higher in women than in men, and decreases with age whatever the histological group.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) {{is much less}} prevalent in Asian countries. Whether {{there are differences in}} survival outcomes between the East and West, however, remain unclear. Methods: The survival data for CLL patients identified in the Taiwan Cancer Registry database between 1990 and 2004, together with corresponding data in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, were retrieved. The <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> (RS, adjusted for the expected survival in the general population) were estimated in patients diagnosed in three 5 -year periods of time. Results: CLL drastically shortened patients ’ life expectancy; more importantly, this negative impact in Taiwan was much larger than that in the US: the 5 -year RS in Taiwan and US were 59 % and 76 %, and the 10 -year RS, 45 % and 56 %, respectively. Nevertheless, survival in Taiwan was better in the periods after 1995 (5 -year RS, from 53. 0 % to 60. 6 %), a time period corresponding to the introduction of the Taiwan National Health Insurance scheme. Such improvement was largely due to decreased mortality in patients younger than 65 (5 -year RS, from 53. 5 % to 69. 1 %). Despite the improvement, patients ’ RS in Taiwan in recent periods remain steadily 15, 20 % inferior to that in the US in both younger and older patient groups.

40|$|Purpose: The {{incidence}} {{rates of}} colorectal cancer (CRC) in Korea have been increasing {{during the past}} decade. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the characteristics, including survival, of Korean CRC patients. The aim of this study was to use the nationwide cancer registry to evaluate the characteristics of Korean CRC, focusing on the survival, according to tumor location, sex, and specific age groups. Methods: Using the Korea Central Cancer Registry (KCCR), we analyzed a total of 226, 352 CRC cases diagnosed from 1993 to 2010. The five-year <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> were compared for the proximal colon, the distal colon, and the rectum. Sur-vival rates were compared between men and women and between patients of young age (less than 40 years old) and pa-tients of advanced age (70 years old or older). Results: The 5 -year survival rates were improved in all subsites between 1993 and 2010. Distal colon cancer showed favor-able survival compared to proximal colon or rectal cancer. Females demonstrated worse survival for local or regional can-cers, and this difference was significant in for patients in their seventies. Young patients (< 40 years old) showed better survival rates for overall and proximal colon cancer comparable to those for older patients (≥ 40 years old), but advanced age patients (≥ 70 years old) had worse survivals for all tumor subsites compared to their younger counterparts (< 70 years old). These trends were similar in distant CRC. Conclusion: Korean CRC has certain distinct characteristics of survival according to tumor location, sex, and age. Despit...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} compounds 8 -methoxy-psoralen and angelicin {{are two types}} of furocoumarins that intercalate into DNA and form mono-adducts when exposed to UVA light. However, 8 -methoxy-psoralen, is also capable of forming a DNA interstrand cross-link in addition to mono-adducts. These lesions change the structure of DNA and block the DNA polymerase during replication, leading to lethality, mutagenesis, or rearrangements if not repaired. The repair of monoadducts is known to be carried out by nucleotide excision repair. However, how interstrand DNA crosslinks are repaired is less clear. The repair of crosslinks has been proposed to involve a number of pathways, which include: homologous recombination, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and translesion synthesis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether a bacterial strain lacking all three translesion DNA polymerases is hypersensitive to these photosensitizing chemicals, and whether it is specifically hypersensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinks. Wild type, polB-dinB-umuDC (lacking the three polymerases), and uvrA mutants were each treated with either 8 -methoxy-psoralen or angelicin and irradiated with UVA light to determine their <b>relative</b> <b>survivals.</b> I found that the mutant lacking all three DNA polymerases was more sensitive to 8 -methoxy-psoralen than angelicin when compared to the wild type cells; yet, the overall sensitivity of the mutant was far less than that of the uvrA mutant. These observations suggest that translesion synthesis plays a role in the repair of interstrand crosslinks and could be consistent with models suggesting that translesion synthesis operates to fill gaps left following the incision of the initial strand...|$|E

40|$|A rubella virus (RUB) replicon, RUBrep/PAC, was {{constructed}} {{and used to}} map the 3 ′ cis-acting elements (3 ′ CSE) of the RUB genome required for RUB replication. The RUBrep/PAC replicon had the structural protein open reading frame partially replaced by a puromycin acetyltransferase (PAC) gene. Cells transfected with RUBrep/PAC transcripts expressed the PAC gene from the subgenomic RNA, were rendered resistant to puromycin, and thus survived selection with this drug. The relative survival following puromycin selection of cells transfected with transcripts from RUBrep/PAC constructs with mutations in the 3 ′ CSE varied. The 3 ′ region necessary for optimal relative survival consisted of the 3 ′ 305 nucleotides (nt), a region conserved in RUB defective-interfering RNAs, and thus this region constitutes the 3 ′ CSE. Within the 3 ′ CSE, deletions in the ∼ 245 nt that overlap the 3 ′ end of the E 1 gene resulted in reduced <b>relative</b> <b>survivals,</b> ranging from 20 to < 1 % of the parental replicon survival level while most mutations within the ∼ 60 -nt 3 ′ untranslated region (UTR) were lethal. None of the 3 ′ CSE mutations affected in vitro translation of the nonstructural protein open reading frame (which is 5 ′ proximal in the genome and encodes the enzymes involved in virus RNA replication). In cells transfected with replicons with 3 ′ CSE mutations that survived antibiotic selection (i. e., those with mutations {{in the region of}} the 3 ′ CSE that overlaps the E 1 coding region), the amount of replicon-specific minus-strand RNA was uniform; however, the accumulation of both plus-strand RNA species, genomic and subgenomic, varied widely, indicating that this region of the RUB 3 ′ CSE affects plus-strand RNA accumulation rather than minus-strand RNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer {{incidence}} {{has been}} increasing in most developed countries {{in the absence of}} similar trends in mortality, and with variable patterns in different areas of the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trends in incidence and mortality from prostate cancer for the period 1974 - 1994 were analysed using data from the Cancer Registries of the Swiss Cantons of Vaud and Neuchâtel. Of 5, 010 cases registered, 80 % were histologically or cytologically confirmed. RESULTS: Age-standardized incidence rates increased from 33. 1 to 48. 6 per 100, 000 (+ 47 %). The upward trends were greater in the most recent calendar periods, and in the younger age groups (+ 77 % at age 45 to 54; + 57 % at age 55 to 64). In contrast, mortality was stable, with an overall increase of only 3 % in age-standardized rates (from 20. 4 to 21. 0 per 100, 000), due to some increase in men aged 65 or above. Consequently, the incidence/mortality rate ratios increased from 1. 6 in 1974 - 1979 to 2. 3 in 1990 - 1994. Five-year observed and <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> increased from 26 % to 41 % and from 46 % to 58 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} survival of male breast cancer patients because the disease is extremely rare in men. Recent studies indicated there were no gender-differences in the 5 -year survival if patients ’ age and stage were matched. However, this problem has rarely been studied in Japan. Methods: Using the Osaka Cancer Registry’s data, the 5 -year survival was analyzed based on the reported 19 869 cases who lived in Osaka Prefecture excluding Osaka City and were diagnosed in 1975 – 1997, or who resided in Osaka City and were diagnosed in 1993 – 1997, because reliable follow-up information was available for them. Results: Breast cancer in males accounted for 0. 49 % of all cases during 1975 – 1997. The 5 -year <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> were 71. 1 % in men and 81. 6 % in women. The survival in males decreased over older groups due to a lower proportion of localized stage, but not in females. The survival of males in the regional stage was significantly lower than that of females (49. 1 versus 73. 7 %, P, 0. 05). Survival of males has increased since 1980 – 1984, while it has been stable in females. Compared with the survival of patients diagnosed in 1975 – 1979, male patients diagnosed in 1995 – 1997 had a noticeably lower risk of death after adjusting for age and cancer stage. Conclusions: The results suggest male breast cancer patients at the regional stage had a worse 5 -year survival rate compared to females. However, this gender-related difference seems to have disappeared with the increased survival of males during the 1990 s.

40|$|PURPOSE: Over 5100 {{colorectal}} cancers (CRCs) {{are diagnosed}} in the United Kingdom in 85 {{years and older}} age group per year but little is known of cancer progression in this group. We assessed clinical, pathological and molecular features of CRC with early and late mortality in such patients. METHODS: Data were analysed in relation to early mortality and long-term survival in 90 consecutive patients with CRC aged 85 years or older in a single hospital. RESULTS: Patients not undergoing operation, those with an ASA score of III or greater and those with advanced tumour stage {{were more likely to}} die within 30 days. Regression analysis showed that 30 day mortality was independently related to failure to undergo resection (odds ratio (O. R.), 10. 0; 95 % confidence interval [C. I. ], 1. 7 - 58. 2; p= 0. 01) and an ASA score of III or greater (O. R. 13. 0; 95 % C. I., 1. 4 - 12. 6; p= 0. 03). All cause three and five year survival were 47 % and 23 % respectively for patients who are alive 30 days after diagnosis. Three and five year <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> were 64 % and 54 %, respectively. Long-term outcome was independently related to tumour stage (relative risk [R. R. ], 2; 95 % C.

It is unclear whether the improved survival seen at high-volume centers applies to the general population and, more importantly, whether the improvement in lung cancer survival was just a consequence of improved screening work. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry was used to identify 405, 580  patients with NSCLC diagnosed from 1988 to 2008. The patients were divided into four groups according to the year of diagnosis. Trends of clinical characteristics were analyzed to reflect the progress of screening work. Five-year <b>relative</b> <b>survivals</b> in various subgroups were compared. The results indicated that proportion of aged, advanced, and non-surgical patients increased, whereas patients with lymph node metastasis and high histology grade decreased. Improvements in all stages of NSCLC patients were demonstrated, with relatively more significant gains for patients with localized and regional disease. After potentially curative surgical resection, remarkable improvements were observed in both cohorts with time (surgical: 52. 00 %– 63. 00 %; non-surgical: 6. 10 %– 13. 50 %). Specifically, patients who underwent pneumonectomy, lobectomy/bilobectomy, and partial/wedge/segmental resection all presented better survival rates.

All the clinical, histological and laboratory parameters were prognostically analysed for both overall and <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> This latter was calculated from the expected survival of the general population with identical age, sex and calendar years of observation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to the proportional hazards model. Liver metastases, age, lymph node involvement and depth of bowel wall involvement were independent prognosticators of both overall and <b>relative</b> <b>survival,</b> whereas carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was predictive only of <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> Increasing age was unfavourably related to overall survival, but mildly protective with regard to <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> Three out of the five prognostic factors identified are the cornerstones of the current staging systems, and were confirmed as adequate by the analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> The results regarding age explain the conflicting findings so far obtained from studies considering overall survival only and advise against the adoption of absolute age limits in therapeutic protocols.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effects of a}} number of factors that can potentially determine the optimal time for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and the observed and <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> after the operation. BACKGROUNDAortic valve replacement is performed in patients within a wide age span, but the proportion of elderly patients is increasing. In survival analyses, adjustment for the effects of age is therefore essential. Analysis of <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> provides additional information on excess or disease-specific mortality and its risk factors. METHODSSurvival was analyzed in 2, 359 patients (1, 442 without and 917 with concomitant coronary artery bypass graft surgery) undergoing their first AVR. By relating observed survival to that expected among the general Swedish population stratified by age, gender and five-year calendar period, the <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> and disease-specific survival were estimated. RESULTSEarly mortality after AVR (death within 30 days) was 5. 6 %. <b>Relative</b> <b>survival</b> rates (excluding early deaths) after 5, 10 and 15 years were 94. 6 %, 84. 7 % and 74. 9 %, respectively. There was an excess risk of dying during the entire follow-up period. Advanced New York Heart Association functional class, preoperative atrial fibrillation and pure aortic regurgitation were independent risk factors for observed and <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> Patients in the oldest age group showed decreased observed <b>survival</b> but excellent <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> CONCLUSIONSOld age was not a risk factor for excess mortality after AVR, whereas atrial fibrillation decreased <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> substantially...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Under certain assumptions, <b>relative</b> <b>{{survival}}</b> is {{a measure}} of net survival based on estimating the excess mortality in a study population when compared with the general population. Background mortality estimates are usually taken from national life tables that are broken down by age, sex and calendar year. A fundamental assumption of <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> methods is that if a patient did not have the disease of interest then their probability of survival would be comparable to that of the general population. It is argued, as most lung cancer patients are smokers and therefore carry a higher risk of smoking-related mortalities, that they are not comparable to a population where the majority are likely to be non-smokers. METHODS: We use data from the Finnish Cancer Registry to assess the impact that the non-comparability assumption has on the estimates of <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> {{through the use of a}} sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Under realistic estimates of increased all-cause mortality for smokers compared with non-smokers, the bias in the estimates of <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> caused by the non-comparability assumption is negligible. CONCLUSION: Although the assumption of comparability underlying the <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> method may not be reasonable, it does not have a concerning impact on the estimates of <b>relative</b> <b>survival,</b> as most lung cancer patients die within the first 2 years followin...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of methods for estimating HIV incidence {{is critical for}} tracking the epidemic and for designing, targeting and evaluating HIV prevention efforts. One method for estimating incidence is based on changes in HIV prevalence. That method is attracting increased attention because national population-based HIV prevalence surveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys, are being conducted throughout the world. Here, we consider some statistical issues associated with estimating HIV incidence from two population-based HIV prevalence surveys conducted at two different points in time. We show that the incidence estimator depends on the <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> rate. We evaluate the sensitivity of estimates to incorrect assumptions about the <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> rate, and show that small errors in the <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> can, in some situations, create large biases in HIV incidence.

40|$|Although {{survival}} rates {{are useful for}} monitoring progress in the early detection and treatment of cancer and are {{of particular interest to}} patients with new diagnoses, there are limited population-based estimates of long-term {{survival rates}}. We used data collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program for cases diagnosed during 1974 - 1991 and followed through 1992 to estimate <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> at 5, 10, and 15 years after diagnosis of cancer of the breast, prostate, colon and rectum, and lung. <b>Relative</b> <b>survival</b> after diagnosis of breast and prostate cancer continued to decline up through 15 years after diagnosis, whereas survival after diagnosis of lung and colon or rectal cancer remained approximately constant after S and 10 years, respectively. Age-specific patterns of survival varied by site, stage, and demographics. Among patients with localized breast and prostate cancer, women who were younger than age 45 at breast cancer diagnosis and men who were 75 years and older at prostate cancer diagnosis had the poorest <b>relative</b> <b>survival.</b> <b>Relative</b> <b>survival</b> among lung cancer patients decreased with age at diagnosis, regardless of stage or demographics, and age-specific patterns of <b>relative</b> <b>survival</b> for patients with cancer of the colon and rectum differed according to race.
