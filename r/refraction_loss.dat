40|$|POLARBEAR- 2 (PB- 2) is {{a cosmic}} {{microwave}} background (CMB) polarization experiment for B-mode detection. The PB- 2 receiver has a large focal plane and aperture that consists of 7588 transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers at 250 mK. The receiver consists of the optical cryostat housing reimaging lenses and infrared filters, and the detector cryostat housing TES bolometers. The large focal plane places substantial requirements on the thermal design of the optical elements at the 4 K, 50 K, and 300 K stages. Infrared filters and lenses inside the optical cryostat are made of alumina for this purpose. We measure basic properties of alumina, such as the index of <b>refraction,</b> <b>loss</b> tangent and thermal conductivity. All results meet our requirements. We also optically characterize filters and lenses made of alumina. Finally, we perform a cooling test of the entire optical cryostat. All measured temperature values satisfy our requirements. In particular, the temperature rise between the center and edge of the alumina infrared filter at 50 K is only 2 : 0 ± 1 : 4 K. Based on the measurements, we estimate the incident power to each thermal stage. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Tese de doutoramento em CiênciasKeratorefractive surgeries, such as {{photorefractive keratectomy}} and LASIK, have {{limitations}} when {{used for the}} correction of high refractive errors. Wound healing and biomechanical responses can occasionally lead to poor refractive predictability, prolonged visual recovery, and instability of <b>refraction,</b> <b>loss</b> of vision from corneal irregularity or scarring and when too much corneal tissue is removed with the laser it can induce progressive corneal ectasia. As understanding of these limitations has become more recognized, indications for corneal refractive surgery have narrowed. Intraocular refractive procedures offer many potential advantages such as reversibility, fast visual recovery and preservation of accommodation. The {{risks and benefits of}} pIOL implantation in appropriate patients may be more advantageous than other refractive surgery techniques; however, complications relating to pIOLs can be more disabling than those from keratorefractive surgery. Glaucoma, angle closure, cataract formation, corneal decompensation and endophthalmitis are potential complications after pIOL insertion. The main goal of this work was the evaluation and characterization of several parameters, including refractive and visual status, effectiveness, predictability, stability and safety, after posterior chamber pIOL (Visian ICL) implantation as well as the potential and factors that may be associated with the onset of complications with this type of pIOL implant. Therefore, the present Thesis is divided into four main issues, each of one reporting on important aspects on ICL implantation. 1) The first issue that includes chapters 2 to 5, concern to the measurement of separation between the central posterior surface of the ICL and the anterior crystalline lens surface (vault), comprising several methods of measurement and evaluation of that distance and their postoperative behavior over time. As observed, this distance is crucial on safety and success of ICL implantation. Postoperative vault shows a tendency to decrease overtime and it is frequently associated with the most related post-ICL complications. Parameters such as age, anterior chamber depth or white to white distance could potentially affect the amount of this postoperative distance. 2) The second issue evaluates the long-term results of the ICL for myopia correction as well the effectiveness and safety of the toric ICL implantation among different refractive ranges of astigmatism, being covered by chapters 6 to 9. The results are very good; the implantation of ICL for moderate to high myopia as well for moderate to high astigmatism is safe and effective and provides long-term predictable, stable refractive results, supporting the US FDA outcomes. The rotational stability of the toric ICL seems to be excellent. 3) The third issue evaluated the efficacy of the combination of procedures, including ICL implantation plus corneal laser treatment, for the correction of myopia with astigmatism and hyperopia (chapter 10 and 11). The ICL implant showed to be very stable when a second surgical procedure is applied and residual refractive error has been successfully addressed with a bioptics approach involving secondary LASIK or PRK. 4) The fourth issue (chapter 12) included an overview of the major complications often associated with phakic ICL implantation. The major complications are cataract formation, typically anterior subcapsular cataract. Whether the cataract is age-related or associated with the surgical procedure or the implant itself, in some cases it became visually significant enough to require cataract extraction. Surgeon learning curve and most inadequate vaulting over the natural crystalline lens, has been identified as the major causes of this induced cataract. Accurately measurement of the sulcus diameter and selecting the correct ICL size is important to ensure proper vaulting and avoid surgically related cataract formation. In conclusion, phakic IOL surgery is an efficacious technique for correcting refractive error in patients who would otherwise be poor candidates for corneal refractive surgery. The designs of pIOLs have progressed over many years. Most early designs have been abandoned because of high rates of complications. At present, Visian ICL is the only posterior-chamber pIOL that have received FDA approval in the United States, but several other lenses are undergoing trials. Many of the studies discussed in this thesis, suggest that their visual and refractive outcomes are, in the aggregate, very encouraging. However, as with any new surgical technology, significant challenges remain. Future preoperative assessment will likely combine increased skills of biometry, increased knowledge of lens vaulting dynamics, and preoperative computer simulation of pIOL position and thus improve ICL safety. All the information provided and new data that will become available rapidly the next years in this area of active research on pIOLs, will probably speed-up the learning curve for the surgeon and increase the knowledge about the behavior of the ICL, therefore making the outcomes f the procedure more safe and predictable and less surgeon-dependent...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{scale of}} cryogenic detector arrays for sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelength astrophysics {{has led to}} the need for large aperture, high index of <b>refraction,</b> low <b>loss,</b> cryogenic refracting optics. Silicon with n = 3. 4, low loss, and relatively high thermal conductivity is a nearly optimal material for these purposes, but requires an antireflection (AR) coating with broad bandwidth, low loss, low reflectance, and a matched coefficient of thermal expansion. We present an AR coating for curved silicon optics comprised of subwavelength features cut into the lens surface with a custom three axis silicon dicing saw. These features constitute a metamaterial that behaves as a simple dielectric coating. We have fabricated and coated silicon lenses as large as 33. 4 cm in diameter with coatings optimized for use between 125 - 165 GHz. Our design reduces average reflections to a few tenths of a percent for angles of incidence up to 30 degrees with low cross-polarization. We describe the design, tolerance, manufacture, and measurements of these coatings and present measurements of the optical properties of silicon at millimeter wavelengths at cryogenic and room temperatures. This coating and lens fabrication approach is applicable from centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths and can be used to fabricate coatings with greater than octave bandwidth.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents {{research of}} the optical properties of chip-based nonlinear waveguides to assess their suitability for all-optical processing in the telecommunications spectrum. Three related topics are presented: (1) enhanced continuous-wave four-wave mixing in AlGaAs waveguides; (2) a new method to characterize nonlinear <b>refraction</b> and <b>loss</b> in waveguides; and (3) the non-instantaneous optical nonlinearity of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon waveguide. For topic (1), enhancements of the continuous-wave four-wave-mixing efficiency and bandwidth are accomplished by engineering the growth and fabrication of AlGaAs waveguides. The bandgap of the core-layer alloy is tailored to suppress nonlinear absorption and the fabrication is optimized to produce small-mode-area, dispersion-engineered waveguides with sub-dB/cm propagation losses. A four-wave-mixing conversion efficiency of - 6. 8 dB is observed in an AlGaAs waveguide that exhibits a propagation loss of 0. 56 dB/cm. This conversion efficiency is among the highest reported for any passive semiconductor or glass waveguide. Another low-loss AlGaAs waveguide is featured, which is dispersion-engineered to produce a measured conversion-bandwidth of 63. 8 nm with a pump wavelength of 1550 nm. For topic (2), a new technique is described for accurately measuring the ratio between the imaginary part and the real part of a waveguide's third-order nonlinearity. Unlike most other methods, it {{does not depend on}} precise knowledge of the coupling efficiencies, the optical propagation loss, or the optical pulse shape. The method is applied to measure the nonlinear loss tangents of a GaAs waveguide, two bandgap-engineered AlGaAs waveguides, a large-area crystalline silicon waveguide, a crystalline silicon nanowire waveguide, and a hydrogenated amorphous silicon nanowire waveguide. For topic (3), pump-probe spectroscopy and continuous-wave cross-phase- and cross-amplitude-modulation measurements are used to study the optical nonlinearity of a hydrogenated amorphous silicon nanowire waveguide. The results are compared to those of a crystalline silicon waveguide of similar dimensions. The hydrogenated amorphous silicon nanowire shows essentially zero instantaneous two-photon absorption, but it displays a strong, long-lived non-instantaneous nonlinearity that is both absorptive and refractive. Power-scaling measurements show that the non-instantaneous nonlinearity of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon scales as a third-order nonlinearity. Phase-transient measurements show that the refractive component possesses the opposite sign to that expected for free-carrier dispersion...|$|R

[URL] To investigate whether unilateral vision loss reduced any aspects of quality of life in comparison with normal vision and to compare its impact with that of bilateral vision loss. Methods: This study used cluster stratified random sample of 3271 urban participants recruited between 1992 and 1994 for the Melbourne Visual Impairment Project. All predictors and outcomes were from the 5 year follow up examinations conducted in 1997 – 9. Results: There were 2530 participants who attended the follow up survey and had measurement of presenting visual acuity. Both unilateral and bilateral vision loss were significantly associated with increased odds of having problems in visual functions including reading the telephone book, newspaper, watching television, and seeing faces. Non-correctable by <b>refraction</b> unilateral vision <b>loss</b> increased the odds of falling when away from home (OR = 2. 86, 95 % CI 1. 16 to 7. 08), getting help with chores (OR = 3. 09, 95 % CI 1. 40 to 6. 83), and becoming dependent (getting help with meals and chores) (OR = 7. 50, 95 % CI 1. 97 to 28. 6).

The general theory is applied to manganese fluoride (MnF 2), a reasonably well studied antiferromagnet, in a configuration in which spins cant in response to applied magnetic fields. The work can be divided into three main strands. The first is to treat the surface reflection and illustrate how light beams can be laterally shifted from the position predicted by geometrical optics i. e., the so called Goos-Hänchen effect. In antiferromagnets these shifts can be controlled with an external magnetic field. Moreover, the possibility of nonreciprocal displacements is investigated, for both oblique and normal incidence, due to an inherent nonreciprocity of the polariton phase with respect to the propagation direction. Reciprocal displacements are also studied in the absence of an external field. The second strand of the work is a study of how all-angle negative refraction can occur in a uniaxial antiferromagnet close to the magnon resonance frequency. This behavior is based on the fact that, in such cases, the antiferromagnet acts as an indefinite permeability medium, i. e., not all its permeability tensor components are of the same sign. If an external magnetic field is applied, the angle of refraction becomes tunable, and can be made to change sign. The final part of this work proposes tunable slab lensing in natural magnetic media using an externally applied magnetic field. Natural hyperbolic magnetic materials not only display imaging obtained from slab lenses with plane parallel sides but also allow one to modify the focal length of a slab lens with an externally applied magnetic field. This is possible because antiferromagnets are gyrotropic and support magnetic polaritons whose frequencies are sensitive to magnetic fields. In addition, an investigation of the caustic formation in this type of lenses is presented for low temperatures, when damping should be small. Slab focusing is also studied at higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} year, {{there has been}} an {{advancement}} in the development of optical active and passive Silicon-On-Insulator for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) applications. Following the continuous miniaturisation trend in this technology the study of the loss performance of these devices also become an attractive subject. Among the many components silicon based optical modulators are specifically important for low loss and high bandwidth short reach interconnects. The general aim of this thesis is to design and computationally investigate the performance of a multilayer hybrid silicon modulator. The design involves a heterojunction structure that operates based on plasma dispersion effect taking the effect of surface roughness and scattering loss into account. For this purpose a novel numerical approach is developed to estimate scattering loss due to the roughness in general waveguide structures and also the proposed silicon based optical waveguide modulator in this work. The applicability can be however extended towards wider range of optical waveguide based devices including multilayer configurations. The method is based on 2 D Fourier transform technique that is widely used in Magneto Resonance Imaging technique. Firstly, the effect of three forms of roughness is investigated in a general strip waveguide structure; isotropic, anisotropic and the mixture of isotropic and anisotropic. In each case the generated sidewall roughness is implemented in various SOI high contrast refractive index waveguides. The waveguide dimensions have been chosen to cover a large variety of waveguide sizes to evaluate the accuracy of the modelling technique. Two SOI waveguide samples have been fabricated. The first sample is 100 nm, 1200 nm and 1400 nm in width and 500 nm in height which are single mode in Mid Infra Red (MIR) region. The second sample contains waveguide with 220 nm height and 330 nm widths that is single mode in Near Infra Read (NIR) wavelength. Other dimensions are chosen from several published works. The calculated losses using FDTD show good agreement with all measured fabricated waveguide and the referred experimental works in the literature. The three dimensional model successfully explains the scattering loss dependence on the width of a high aspect ratio waveguide when the result is compared with a published work. While the measurement shows the loss reduces from 32 dB/cm to 0. 8 dB/cm, the simulation results varies from 44 dB/cm to 1 dB/cm. The interdependence of scattering loss is also investigated against other theoretical approaches when the correlation length varies from 0 to 1000 nm. The relatively low aspect ratio waveguide is chosen to have a fixed dimension of 220 nm by 330 nm and 5 nm value. In order to study the scattering loss caused by roughness the roughness model is applied in the proposed modulator structure. The design involves a multimode strip like p doped silicon material wrapped by transparent ZnO as a naturally n doped active material. This forms a pn heterojunction that is implemented in one arm of a Mach Zehnder interferometer. The switch is designed to operate at 1. 55 µm and in depletion mode to avoid minority carrier life time effect in switching speed. The calculated capacitance switching speed of a pulse were less than 1 pf=cm and 90 ps respectively. The resistivity v is higher compared to a general form of heterojunction due to the relativity larger ZnO/Si contact area of the device. The phase shifter is implemented in Mach Zehnder structure to change from phase modulation to amplitude modulation using a MMI structure. The calculated extinction ratio was as high as 23. 7 dB with the insertion loss of 2. 5 dB. Further simulation results shows that the 100 nm change in the ZnO thickness can alter the effective index of <b>refraction</b> and <b>loss</b> performance of the devices. In an ideal situation, as the thickness increases from 50 nm to 150 nm the loss changes from 2 to 8 dB/cm for TE mode. The involvement of sidewall roughness results higher insertion loss by at least by 0. 2 dB when the rms of the sidewall roughness increases by 7 nm. As the ZnO coating thickness increases, the roughness effect is counterbalanced by almost 50 %...|$|R
