5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth <b>row</b> <b>at</b> {{the tip of the}} jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|From March through May, Raonic {{improved}} on his career-best {{performance at}} five consecutive ATP 1000 events. At the Indian Wells Masters, he beat No. 6 Murray {{to reach the}} quarterfinals, losing to Alexandr Dolgopolov. He lost in {{the quarterfinals of the}} Miami Masters to Nadal. He reached the quarterfinals for the third ATP 1000 tournament in a <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the Monte-Carlo Masters, before falling to Wawrinka. The result garnered Raonic a career-high ranking as world No. 9. Raonic lost in the third round of the Madrid Open to Nishikori. At the Italian Open, Raonic defeated Jérémy Chardy in the quarterfinals to reach his first Masters 1000 semifinal on clay. After winning the first set, he lost his semifinal match to eventual champion Djokovic. Although he had played Djokovic in the 2013 Davis Cup, this was their first ATP match against one another.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|Several species coined in genera {{other than}} Allosaurus are also now {{thought to be}} synonymous with A. fragilis.

5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth <b>row</b> <b>at</b> {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E

5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon in a <b>row</b> <b>at</b> once; Pokémon {{on the left}} or right side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the bottom of the four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent of the plans to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build {{and at the same time}} give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. To this day, he has never met his father or seen a picture of him. He became {{interested}} in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh <b>row</b> <b>at</b> ringside. He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize {{he wanted to be}} a wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help pay the bills. He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the energy cost of rowing with the Concept II wind {{resistance}} machine and to evaluate its potential for improving cardiovascular health for the fitness public. Ten male college students performed maximal tests on the treadmill and on the Concept II rowing machine. A submaximal test on the Concept II was also performed. The results demonstrated several significantly different physiological responses between the maximal running and rowing values. Running produced higher maximal VO 2 (4. 034 liters/min), heart rate (192 beats/min.), caloric cost (20. 1 kcals/min., an O 2 pulse (21. 1 ml/beats min.) values. Maximal rowing values included a VO 2 max of 3. 619 liters/min., a heart rate of 187 beats/min., a caloric cost of 18. 1 kcals/min., and an 02 pulse of 19. 5 ml/beat min. Submaximal <b>rowing</b> <b>at</b> speeds from 10 to 30 miles per hour required an oxygen uptake of. 933 to 3. 193 liters/min.

5|$|Headley {{made his}} Jamaica debut against Lord Tennyson's XI at Sabina Park on 9 February 1928, in a match won easily by the home team. Batting at number three, his first innings yielded 16 runs, {{but in the}} second innings, he scored 71, {{reaching}} fifty runs in as many minutes. In the second game against Lord Tennyson's XI which began in Kingston on 18 February, Headley scored his maiden first-class century. Having scored 22 not out after the first day's play, he reached 50 runs by playing very carefully but subsequently played more adventurous shots. He hit the bowling of Alan Hilder for four consecutive fours and twice hit Lord Tennyson for three fours in a <b>row.</b> <b>At</b> one point, thirteen of his scoring shots in a row went for four. He was finally out for 211, the highest score at the time by a West Indian batsman against an English team. After the innings, Tennyson compared Headley to Victor Trumper and Charlie Macartney, batsmen considered among the best who ever played. Headley concluded the series against Tennyson's team with innings of 40 and 71, {{to give him an}} aggregate of 409 runs at an average of 81.80. He also took his maiden first class wicket.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the team}} changed their name to Greaves Motorsport, {{and were the}} first team to use the new LM P2-class Zytek Z11SN-Nissan. With Ojjeh, Chalandon and Tom Kimber-Smith driving the car, the team won the LM P2 class and came third overall at the 6 Hours of Castellet, which was {{the first round of the}} season. Although the team {{struggled}} at the 1000km of Spa, finishing 37th overall, and eighth in class, the team won the LM P2 category of the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time, and finished eighth overall; Chalandon was replaced by Olivier Lombard from this event onwards. Another eighth place overall, and class victory followed, at the 6 Hours of Imola; the team then won the LM P2 class for the third race in a <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the 6 Hours of Silverstone, this time finishing tenth overall. The team finished the season with a fourth overall, and second in class, at the 6 Hours of Estoril; this meant that the team won the LM P2 Championship, with Kimber-Smith and Ojjeh being crowned as the LM P2 Driver's Champions.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{went out}} of the Malta Cup with a 3–5 loss to Michael Holt in the first round. He reached the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, but lost 4–5 against Neil Robertson. In his quarter-final match against Joe Swail at the Irish Masters, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} a maximum break {{on his way to a}} narrow 5–4 victory, the second 147 in any professional competition in Ireland. The initial maximum break prize of a Citroën Coupe, worth €20,000, was later withdrawn by the organisers. He then defeated John Higgins 6–5 in the semi-finals, and won the title by defeating Barry Hawkins 9–1 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the China Open, but lost 2–6 against eventual champion Graeme Dott. Just before the World Championship, in which he was to play a first-round match with Ding Junhui again, O'Sullivan claimed that the draw was fixed. This was subsequently denied by World Snooker, and O'Sullivan later retracted his accusation. In the end, O'Sullivan won the tie easily by 10 frames to 2. He also won his second-round match against Robertson 13–10 (despite losing six frames in a <b>row</b> <b>at</b> one point), before losing his quarter-final match 9–13 against eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E

5|$|Slender and firm-bodied, the quagga {{catshark}} has a {{short and}} flattened {{head with a}} pointed snout. The slightly protruding {{tip of the snout}} is not upturned like in some other Halaelurus species. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin. The small, horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have rudimentary nictitating membranes; below the eyes are thick ridges, and behind them are tiny spiracles. The rather large mouth is curved, with the upper teeth exposed when closed. There are short furrows at the corners of the mouth. The jaws contain 26–28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are three tooth rows at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and one <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the lower. The teeth have three cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than the level of the mouth; the fifth pair are smaller than the rest.|$|E
5|$|The 1978 season saw a {{succession}} of retirements for Villeneuve, often after problems with the new Michelin radial tyres. Early in the season, he started on the front <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the United States Grand Prix West, but crashed out of the lead on lap39. Despite calls in the Italian press {{for him to be}} replaced, Ferrari persisted with him. Towards the end of the season, Villeneuve's results improved. He finished second on the road at the Italian Grand Prix, although he was penalised a minute for jumping the start, and ran second at the United States Grand Prix before his engine failed. Finally at the season-ending Canadian Grand Prix, this time at the Circuit Notre Dame Island in Montreal (a circuit that was eventually named after him) Villeneuve scored his first Grand Prix win after Jean-Pierre Jarier's Lotus stopped with engine trouble. To date, he remains the only Canadian to win his home race.|$|E
5|$|The magpie is {{generally}} sedentary and territorial throughout its range, living in groups occupying a territory, or in flocks or fringe groups. A group may occupy {{and defend the}} same territory for many years. Much energy is spent defending a territory from intruders, particularly other magpies, and different behaviours are seen with different opponents. The sight of a raptor results in a rallying call by sentinel birds and subsequent coordinated mobbing of the intruder. Magpies place themselves {{either side of the}} bird of prey so that it will be attacked from behind should it strike a defender, and harass and drive the raptor to some distance beyond the territory. A group will use carolling as a signal to advertise ownership and warn off other magpies. In the negotiating display, the one or two dominant magpies parade along the border of the defended territory {{while the rest of the}} group stand back a little and look on. The leaders may fluff their feathers or caroll repeatedly. In a group strength display, employed if both the opposing and defending groups are of roughly equal numbers, all magpies will fly and form a <b>row</b> <b>at</b> the border of the territory. The defending group may also resort to an aerial display where the dominant magpies, or sometimes the whole group, swoop and dive while calling to warn an intruding magpie's group.|$|E
