5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> ambition {{is growing}} international concern about human-induced climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's proposal that {{carbon dioxide emissions}} should be reduced by 60% was incorporated into the UK government's 2003 Energy White Paper. The 2006 Stern Review proposed a 55% reduction by 2030. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report has further increased {{the profile of the}} issue.|$|E

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} as a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> behavior, {{but it does not}} make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive.

5|$|Part of the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is the {{extensive}} freeway {{system in the}} city, due {{to the majority of}} that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a half-cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways but no three-digit interstates.|$|E

5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is still not clear, but {{it is known that}} the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
5|$|The apparel {{industry}} dominates both Jordan's QIZs {{and total}} {{exports to the}} United States, accounting for 99.9% of all QIZ exports and 86% of all Jordanian exports to the United States. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> dominance is that QIZ products enter the United States free of duty, whereas, under the USJordan FTA, tariffs will not be fully eliminated {{until the end of}} the ten-year phase-in period, in 2011.|$|E

For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E

Although the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> invasion is uncertain, John of Worcester stated that the cause was Constantine's violation of the peace treaty made in 927. Æthelstan evidently travelled through Beverley, Ripon and Chester-le-Street. The army harassed the Scots up to Kincardineshire and the navy up to Caithness but Æthelstan's force was never engaged.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{is that when the}} solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
