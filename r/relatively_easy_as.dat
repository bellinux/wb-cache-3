5000|$|If kept as a pet, {{the care}} level is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> the fish has a {{peaceful}} temperament. The aquarium should be well planted and have many places to hide. Use round gravel or smooth sand for the aquarium because the barbels can be damaged easily. A community {{of at least}} six fish is ideal.|$|E
50|$|The coal {{is found}} at a shallow depth which made mining in the area <b>relatively</b> <b>easy.</b> <b>As</b> the coal {{outcrops}} around the Cheadle area, the seams that were heavily worked are the deeper seams in the North Staffs field, in many cases seams that were too deep to mine economically in North Staffordshire. However they were found in shallow depths around Cheadle.|$|E

50|$|The role of conductor, by contrast, {{can seem}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> {{involving}} <b>as</b> it does conversing {{with the audience}} as a group or individually, and generally involving no acting. However, it is recognised within the community of Playback performers as the most difficult role to fill successfully.|$|R
5000|$|Due to its glassy {{internal}} structure, obsidian is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to work, <b>as</b> {{it breaks}} in very predictable and controlled ways via conchoidal fracturing. This contributed to its prolific use throughout Mesoamerica. It is obtained by either quarrying source sites or in nodule form from riverbeds or fractured outcrops.|$|R
50|$|Expat's parsing events {{resemble}} the events {{defined in the}} Simple API for XML (SAX), but Expat is not a SAX-compliant parser. Projects incorporating the Expat library often build SAX and possibly DOM parsers on top of Expat. While Expat is mainly a stream-based (push) parser, it supports stopping and restarting parsing at arbitrary times, thus making {{the implementation of a}} pull parser <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} Centurion, Contentious was later up-gunned; first tested with the 84 mm 20 pounder, the Bovington example later gained a L7 105 mm gun, {{derived from the}} 20 pounder. The {{replacement}} was <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>as</b> the 105 mm is largely a rebarrelled version of the 84 mm and has a similar breech. Photographs of the prototype do show some change to the recoil cylinders between the two.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the line}} began in late March 1837 and {{progress}} east of Stratford was <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> the land was largely arable. Indeed, {{a good number of}} windmills had to be demolished {{in order to get the}} railway built. West of Stratford the line had to cross the unstable Bow Marshes and after that the built up nature of the area meant that the railway had to be built on expensive viaducts.|$|E
50|$|After the Somali {{national}} {{script was}} introduced, the government undertook a massive literacy campaign in villages and rural settlements {{across the country}} from 1974 to 1975. This effort was termed in the Somali language Ol Olaha Waxbarashada Reer Miyiga or Somali Countryside Literacy Campaign. The national campaign {{was carried out by}} young people, mostly elementary school teachers as well as high school students. This was a <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> undertaking <b>as</b> there was now an alphabet to learn.|$|R

50|$|During {{the reign}} of Mamluk Sultan Baibars al-Bunduqdari in the 13th century, Anabta served as a central staging point from which to supply the Muslim armies {{fighting}} Crusader and Mongol incursions. The location was chosen because it was considered <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to protect <b>as</b> the area is nestled between two large hills.|$|R
50|$|However, what {{eventually}} {{turned out}} to be recognised as poor design, workmanship and maintenance meant that the crescents introduced their own problems. Design flaws and unreliable 'system build' construction methods, as well as the 1970s oil crisis meant that heating the poorly insulated homes became too expensive for their low income residents, and the crescents soon became notorious for being cold, damp and riddled with cockroaches and other vermin. Crime and drug abuse became significant problems in Hulme, as police did not patrol the long, often dark decks, {{due to the fact that}} they were not officially considered streets. The decks made muggings and burglary <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>as</b> any crime could be carried out in almost total privacy, with no hope for quick assistance from police below.|$|E
50|$|It {{should also}} be reiterated that in the closing months of World War II {{crossing}} the Romanian-Yugoslav frontier was <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> (<b>as</b> already discussed above). Individuals who went to Romania, did not go only to see family members who took refuge there, but also to visit relatives who were Romanian citizens and lived across the border, or only to purchase necessary staples unavailable or scarce on the Yugoslav side. At the Romanian frontier, Romanian guards were tolerant toward the Yugoslav neighbors, and even helped the Romanians from the Yugoslav Banat. Since the Romanian-Yugoslav frontier agreement of November 1923, residents of frontier villages who possessed property {{on either side of}} the border, could legally cross into the other country without any difficulty. Thus, crossing the frontier was a mere formality.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the Norton Commando {{can be traced back}} to the late 1940s when the [...] Norton Model 7 Twin was {{designed}} by Bert Hopwood. The twin-cylinder design evolved into 600 cc, then the 650 cc Manxman and Dominator until superseded by 750 cc Atlas before being launched as the 750 cc Commando in 1967. [...] As well as having a radical new frame, the Commando's engine (which was mounted vertically in earlier models) was tilted forward. This was <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> the engine was [...] "pre-unit", that is, the gearbox was not integral with the crankcase, and the change gave three benefits: (i) the centre of gravity was moved further forward; (ii) this allowed more space behind the carburettors for the airbox; and (iii) it gave an attractive raked appearance to the motorcycle.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Venice into a {{relatively}} poor family and in his early years {{he worked as a}} tradesman, soon becoming {{one of the most important}} ones in the city. In 1494 he was created capitano da mar (sea commander-in-chief), a <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> task <b>as</b> he had to lead the Venetian operations along the Adriatic coast in a peaceful period. But when in 1499 a new war between Venice and the Ottoman Empire broke out, his lack of experience led to two crushing defeats (Sapienza, 19 August, and Zonchio, six days later).|$|R
50|$|In {{all there}} are ten marl cut caves {{in the near}} {{vicinity}} of Qumran: 4Qa, 4Qb, 5Q, 7Q, 8Q, 9Q, 10Q, an oval cave west of 5Q, and two caves to the north in a separate ravine. Their location necessitates a direct connection with the Qumran settlement. The three caves {{at the end of}} the esplanade could only be accessed via the settlement. These caves are thought to have been cut for storage and habitation. Marl is a soft stone and makes excavation <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> but <b>as</b> seen with Caves 7Q - 9Q they haven't survived well.|$|R
30|$|Our {{procedure}} requires minimal dissection and {{is therefore}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to master <b>as</b> {{it does not require}} complicated laparoscopic dissection. Intraoperative complications are likely to be lower {{due to the lack of}} dissection around the uterus, cervix and ureters. The occurrence of a successful pregnancy after this procedure, with preservation of the integrity of the prolapse repair 1  year post-delivery favours its use for women with uterovaginal prolapse who wish to retain their fertility.|$|R
5000|$|The Alum Cave Trail {{begins its}} ascent at 3834 ft by quickly {{crossing}} two streams: Walker Camp Prong and Alum Cave Creek, {{the latter of}} which flanks the trail for the first 1.3 mi of its length. This first leg of the trail leads the hiker through an old-growth forest, consisting largely of hemlock and yellow birch and is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>as</b> the climb is gradual and the footpath is well-maintained due to its heavy traffic. The first notable landmark comes 1.3 mi into the hike at {{what is known as}} [...] "Arch Rock", which is a large black slate rock that has, over millennia, come to create, as the name indicates, a large natural arch. Hikers maneuver easily through the cold, moist rock via stairs and steel cables acting as handrails which are placed at numerous points along the footpath.|$|E
5000|$|Nor was the B.E.12 [...] "rushed" [...] {{into service}} as {{would have been}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> it was a {{straightforward}} conversion of a type in production. Trials with the prototype continued through late 1915 and {{seem to have been}} mainly concerned with the development of the new RAF 4 engine, especially the design of a satisfactory air scoop. Cooling of the rear cylinders of the RAF 4, an air-cooled V12 and later the engine of the R.E.8, was always rather dubious. The type was also tested as a bomber. It was May 1916 (when the [...] "Fokker scourge", as a period of German air superiority was over) that it was decided to fit a synchronised Vickers gun to the type, armament trials had already been undertaken with upward-firing Lewis guns, similar to those used by the night fighter version of the B.E.2c.|$|E
5000|$|Though muddy in places, {{the walking}} is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>as</b> {{the highest point}} on the path is only 345 m (1130 ft) high [...] and for much of its length the path {{is more or less}} flat. Most of the Wall runs through remote {{countryside}} but there are sections that pass through the cities and suburbs of Newcastle and Carlisle. The path is well signposted. For most of the walk there are many signs of human activity, and many other walkers in summer. Though there are villages and farms near to the path, there are not many places to buy food and drink, especially in the middle sections. The section between Chollerford and Walton is the highest and wildest part of the path; it is also where the Wall is most visible, and includes several important Roman forts.|$|E

The fact that co-star and close friend John Bardon (who plays Jim) was recovering from a stroke in real life added extra pathos to the episode. In an interview on This Morning, {{she said it was}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> <b>as</b> there were no co-actors forgetting their lines. In 2009, Brown was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. She is the first actress to be nominated in the category for a role in a soap opera since Jean Alexander's nomination for playing Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street in 1988. Brown's nomination came {{as a result of her}} [...] "single-hander" [...] episode of EastEnders, the director of which she praised.|$|E
50|$|Aside from logging, {{the park}} faces other {{problems}} {{due to the}} large population that lives near it. Mining in Mexico State, mostly of sand and gravel, is concentrated {{in the area around}} the volcano and it is known that these materials have been mined illegally in the park itself. There are a number of roads in the park with are almost exclusively used by trucks which take out illegally mined sand and gravel with at least eight illegal open pit mines. While the area is legally only supposed to be forest, mining sand and gravel is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> it is near the surface. Some of these mines are on ejido land. Local government officials claim that they have been closing mines but environmental groups state that the practiced is tolerated by officials. Other problems are due to the many visitors the park receives, which can be as high as 10,000 per day. This includes the illegal dumping of trash and damage to the crater area by automobiles which had been allowed to drive onto the soft sandy soil here.|$|E
50|$|In 1947 Maté {{turned to}} boxing which came <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> {{all his life}} he had to fight to survive. In his early career he won {{numerous}} trophies and later became champion of Castile. In 1952 he turned professional and had a total of 32 bouts during his career. Maté was chosen {{to go to the}} 1952 Helsinki Olympics in the Light Welterweight (140 lb/63.5 kg) class. This golden opportunity never materialized as Spain pulled out of Olympics due to political reasons. As of late 1956, the Spanish Boxing Federation ranked him as a light welterweight contender, along with Fernando Bufala Gómez. A motorcycle accident in 1957 ruled him out of the ring for over half a year and on his return to the ring, he was no longer the same. He wanted to go to America to fight with Carlos Ortiz but was offered a blank contract which was refused. On the 12th March 1958, just before his 27th birthday, he faced Abdelkader Ben Buker II for the Spanish Welterweight title which he lost on points. He gave the ring another 2 bouts before falling ill and retiring from the sport.|$|E

500|$|King's men {{walked for}} fifty {{minutes at a}} time and then rested for ten. The going was <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> insofar <b>as</b> the ground was fairly flat, but the [...] high Kunai grass trapped the heat and {{humidity}} and the men were heavily loaded with ammunition. The company reached Ragitumkiap, a village within striking distance of Kaiapit, at 14:45. While his men had a brief rest, King attempted to contact the large Army No.11 Wireless Set he had left behind at Sangan—and from there Vasey back at Nadzab—with the new Army No.208 Wireless Sets he had brought with him. Unfortunately, King found that their range was insufficient. He also heard shots being fired in the distance and guessed that Maxwell's section had been discovered.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} of Chavigny and Vergennes in Lisbon {{was to keep}} Portugal from entering the War of the Austrian Succession {{on the side of}} Britain, a task that proved <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> the Portuguese had little interest in joining the war. In 1743 Vergennes accompanied his uncle to the court of Charles VII who was the ruler of Bavaria and also held the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Charles VII was a key ally of the French in the ongoing war against Austria, and they were charged with keeping him in the war by assauging his concerns which they accomplished successfully. They next were instrumental in the agreement of the Union of Frankfurt, a pact involving several German rulers to uphold Charles VII's interests. after Charles VII's sudden death in 1745, they strove to help his successor Maximilian III but were unable to prevent him from losing his capital at Munich and making peace with the Austrians at the Treaty of Füssen. In November 1745 Chavigny was relieved of his post, and returned to France accompanied by Vergennes. The following year they returned to Portugal to take up their previous posts there where they remained until 1749, unsuccessfully trying to negotiate a commercial treaty.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{concentrates on}} the means of defense against denial of service attacks. First, some possible and common denial of service attacks are described to give the reader {{a basic understanding of}} what is this type of the attacks. The main part of the project is the mechanism, tools and methods used to prevent the denial of service attacks. At the end a short case study along with the description of the small company network is given. When conducting the experiment we noticed that a successful attack on the networked system is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> the needed tools are free to download {{but at the same time}} the simple means of defense can be applied to make most of the attacks impossible. Key words: denial of service, distributed denial of service, worm, firewall, network protocols. ...|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of an almost complex structure is a topological question and is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to answer, <b>as</b> discussed above. The {{existence of}} an integrable almost complex structure, on the other hand, {{is a much more}} difficult analytic question. For example, it is still not known whether S6 admits an integrable almost complex structure, despite a long history of ultimately unverified claims. Smoothness issues are important. For real-analytic J, the Newlander–Nirenberg theorem follows from the Frobenius theorem; for C∞ (and less smooth) J, analysis is required (with more difficult techniques as the regularity hypothesis weakens).|$|R
50|$|The crater floor {{has been}} filled in with deposits, either from lava flows or ejecta from basin impacts, and is {{relatively}} flat and featureless {{in the northwest}} half. If there was a central peak, it has now become buried. The floor has a low albedo, making the crater <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to identify <b>as</b> {{it is one of}} the few craters in this region of the lunar surface that has a dark floor. Traces of bright ray material from Tycho, located to the west, can be seen across the floor.|$|R
