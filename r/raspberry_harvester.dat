40|$|Summary. Investigated was the {{influence}} of the “Natalia ” combine harvester forward speed (in the range of 0. 19 - 0. 37 m·s- 1) of on the harvest quality of the Canby raspberry. The most advantageous speed was found the lowest examined, i. e. 0. 19 m·s- 1, at which 71. 6 % of ripe fruit possible to be collected on the research day was collected. The ripe fruit which remained uncollected was not altogether lost because it could be collected during the next harvester round. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between the results obtained at the speeds of 0. 19 and 0. 37 m·s- 1 as well as 0. 29 and 0. 37 m·s- 1. Average losses caused by the fruit falling to the ground were below 7 % while the organic impurities in the harvested fruit approximated 0. 6 %.
