500|$|There are {{two types}} of costumed shows used by Chuck E. Cheese's: the LIVE! show and the <b>Road</b> <b>show.</b> The LIVE! show is {{performed}} {{at the front of the}} stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. The live show is a way of pumping up the crowd before a customized rendition of [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] is sung to the child that is celebrating the birthday ("I say Happy, you say Birthday..."). A costumed Chuck E. Cheese dances with the guests and sings, while being accompanied by the cast members. The <b>Road</b> <b>show</b> is a performance by a costumed Chuck E. Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself. Chuck E. Cheese wants the kids to dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all the kids that participated.
