The components that are aligned with the Kansas reading standards are phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. High stakes testing and test scores disaggregated by race creates accountability in meeting instructional <b>reading</b> <b>indicators</b> for all students, specifically African American students. With increased pressures to meet and exceed the reading standards and close the achievement gap between Black and White students, schools are searching for instructional factors supportive of to meeting No Child Left Behind requirements. This mixed method study was conducted in three urban school districts in the state of Kansas. The quantitative study was conducted by analyzing African American fifth grade state reading assessment scores before and during implementation of No Child Left Behind to determine whether No Child Left Behind is positively impacting test scores. Data analysis revealed that African Americans increased in being at or above the standard, while decreasing the number below the standard. Out of the 180 schools in the three districts, six high performing schools were identified based on the percentage of African American students in the school, average mean scores before and during No Child Left Behind, and percentage of students at or above the standard from 2000 - 2007. Data were collected through detailed observational field notes and interviews with fifth grade teachers and principals in order to determine their perceptions of the instructional factors impacting reading scores. Data analysis revealed the following instructional factors impacting reading scores: analysis of data, quality professional development, teacher collaboration, high expectations, and parental involvement. Instructional <b>reading</b> <b>indicators</b> were coded throughout the observation of fifth grade classrooms. Observed indicators taught were phonics, vocabulary, comprehension of text types and text structures.

40|$|Aims - To compare reading {{performance}} {{in children with}} and without visual function anomalies and identify the influence of abnormal visual function and other variables in reading ability. Methods - A cross-sectional study was carried in 110 children of school age (6 - 11 years) with Abnormal Visual Function (AVF) and 562 children with Normal Visual Function (NVF). An orthoptic assessment (visual acuity, ocular alignment, near point of convergence and accommodation, stereopsis and vergences) and autorefraction was carried out. Oral reading was analyzed (list of 34 words). Number of errors, accuracy (percentage of success) and reading speed (words per minute - wpm) were used as <b>reading</b> <b>indicators.</b> Sociodemographic information from parents (n= 670) and teachers (n= 34) was obtained. Results - Children with AVF had a higher number of errors (AVF= 3. 00 errors; NVF= 1. 00 errors; p< 0. 001), a lower accuracy (AVF= 91. 18 %; NVF= 97. 06 %; p< 0. 001) and reading speed (AVF= 24. 71 wpm; NVF= 27. 39 wpm; p= 0. 007). Reading speed in the 3 rd school grade was not statistically different {{between the two groups}} (AVF= 31. 41 wpm; NVF= 32. 54 wpm; p= 0. 113).

Children in 2 nd, 3 rd, or 4 th grades presented a lower risk of having reading impairment when compared with the 1 st grade. Conclusion - Children with AVF had reading impairment in the first school grade. It seems that reading abilities have a wide variation and this disparity lessens in older children. The slow reading characteristics of the children with AVF are similar to dyslexic children, which suggest the need for an eye evaluation before classifying the children as dyslexic...|$|R

A review of the literature reflects contrasting views on which specific pre-reading skill is most predictive of word reading success toward the end of kindergarten and the important role of CBM in such an analysis. Therefore, my research questions analyzed (a) the correlations between letter naming, letter sounds, phonemic segmentation, and word reading fluency in kindergarten; (b) the relative predictive relation of letter names, letter sounds, and phonemic segmentation measures to word reading fluency for kindergarten students; and, (c) the relation of non-academic variables of special education status, English language learner status, attendance, free-and-reduced-meals, and NonWhite Race to word reading fluency in kindergarten. Correlation results indicated the correlation between winter word reading fluency and spring word reading fluency in kindergarten was r =. 82, spring word reading and fall letter sounds was r =. 57, spring word reading and winter letter sounds was r =. 66, and spring word reading and spring letter sounds was r =. 58. All the non-academic variables weakly correlated to spring word reading, with the exception of fall attendance percentage showing a negative to low correlation range (- 0. 15 to 0. 11). In addition, regression results indicated that Winter Word Reading Fluency (Winter WRF) (β =. 64) was predictive of Spring Word Reading. Spring Letter Sounds (Spring LS) (β =. 29) also were predictive of Spring Word Reading as was Fall Letter Sounds (Fall LS) (β =. 11).
