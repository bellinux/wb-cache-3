Upon contact with water, these formulations {{have the capability}} to react with each other and liberate carbon dioxide gas resulting in the effervescent <b>action</b> (Pharmaceutical <b>Dosage</b> <b>Forms,</b> General Chapters, 2017; Bertuzzi, 2009; Shrewsbury, 2015). For some active ingredients that are not stable for compounding into liquid form, oral solution or suspension may be administered to the patients who have difficulties in swallowing by prior dissolution of the effervescent tablet or granules in a cup of water. This study investigated both rivastigmine tartrate and donepezil hydrochloride (HCl). Both model drugs are cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The approved <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for rivastigmine tartrate are capsules and extended release transdermal film loaded with free drug ([URL] 2017). However, rivastigmine tartrate liquid has been discontinued. The approved <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> for donepezil HCl are available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablet ([URL] 2017). This study aimed to investigate the substitution of commonly used effervescent acids (such as citric acid and/or tartaric acid) (Bertuzzi, 2009) with a less studied fruit acid (malic acid). This study suggests an improvement strategy.|$|R

40|$|Among all <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> tablet is {{the most}} popular <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> {{existing}} today because of its convenience of self administration, compactness and easy manufacturing; sometimes immediate onset of action is required than conventional therapy in many cases. So that to overcome these drawbacks, immediate release <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> has emerged as alternative oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms.</b> Immediate drug release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> disintegrate rapidly after administration with enhanced rate of dissolution. The basic approach used in development tablets is the use of superdisintegrants like Cross linked Polyvinylpyrrolidone or crospovidone (Polyplasdone), Sodium starch glycolate (Primogel, Explotab), carboxymethylcellulose (Croscarmellose) etc. These superdisintegrants provide instantaneous disintegration of tablet after administration in stomach. In this field immediate release liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and parenteral <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> have also been introduced for treating patients. In liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> can be suspensions with typical dispersion agents like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, AOT (dioctylsulfosuccinate) etc. The development of immediate release therapy also provides an opportunity for a line extension in the marketplace, a wide range of drugs e. g., neuroleptics, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics, antihistamines and other drugs can be considered candidates for this <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> As a drug entity nears the end of its patent life, it is common for pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop a given drug entity in a new and improved <b>dosage</b> <b>form.</b> A new <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> allows a manufacturer to extend market exclusivity, while offering its patient population a more convenient <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> or dosing regimen.

Then, the textbook of “Aulton's Pharmaceutics; the design and manufacture of medicines” was considered to compare the medieval knowledge of pharmaceutics with current ones. Overall, there were 226 different <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> which have been cited in traditional Persian pharmacy. Since many of them were related to the preparation method, the final list of <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> was shortened to nearly 60 items including solid, semisolid, liquid and gaseous forms.

Inclusion of the antioxidant, sodium ascorbate in the liquid <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> for captopril resulted in improved stability at 4 ºC. Hydralazine hydrochloride, isoniazid and phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride were adversely affected due to interactions with excipients in the formulation, while the effect of the preservative in lowering the pH in a levothyroxine sodium mixture resulted in decreased stability. Interestingly, the instability in these formulations is primarily due to interactions between the drug substance and the excipients rather than degradation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient by standard routes such as oxidation, hydrolysis, photolysis or thermolysis. This low percentage however illustrates the low risk associated with these <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> investigated.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pharmaceutical {{industry}} {{is no longer}} allowed to develop new medicines for use in adults only, as the 2007 Paediatric Regulation requires children to be considered also. The plans for such paediatric development called Paediatric Investigation Plans (PIPs) are subject to agreement by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Paediatric Committee (PDCO). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the key characteristics of oral paediatric medicines in the PIPs and the changes implemented as a result of the EMA/PDCO review. METHODS: All PIPs agreed by 31 December 2011 were identified through a proprietary EMA-database. PIPs were included if they contained an agreed proposal to develop an oral medicine for children 0 to 11 years. Information on the therapeutic area (EMA classification system); target age range (as defined by industry) and pharmaceutical characteristics (active substance, <b>dosage</b> <b>form(s)</b> as listed in the PIP, strength of each <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> excipients in each strength of each <b>dosage</b> <b>form)</b> was extracted from the EMA website or the EMA/PDCO assessment reports. RESULTS: A hundred and fifty PIPs were included corresponding to 16 therapeutic areas and 220 oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> in 431 strengths/compositions. Eighty-two PIPs (37 %) included tablets, 44 (20 %) liquids and 35 (16 %) <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> with a specific composition/strength that were stored as a solid but swallowed as a liquid e. g. dispersible tablets. The EMA/PDCO review resulted in an increase of 13 (207 to 220) oral paediatric <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and 44 (387 to 431) <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> with a specific composition/strength. For many PIPs, the target age range was widened and the excipient composition and usability aspects modified. CONCLUSION: The EMA/PDCO review realized an increase in the number of requirements for the development of oral <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> and a larger increase in the number of <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> with a specific composition/strength, both targeting younger children. Changes to their pharmaceutical design were less profound...|$|R
