5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys go before the city council, but their <b>request</b> <b>is</b> denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their <b>request</b> <b>is</b> then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E
5|$|At the end {{of season}} five, Ross and Rachel drunkenly get married while vacationing with their friends in Las Vegas. In season six, their {{annulment}} <b>request</b> <b>is</b> denied because of Rachel having leveled unfounded allegations against Ross, forcing the two to file for a divorce instead. In season seven, Ross and Rachel unwittingly conceive a child when their birth control fails. Rachel gives birth to a girl in season eight, naming the baby Emma Geller-Green; the name Emma is a gift from Monica, who had previously been reserving the name for her own child. Rachel and Ross live together as non-romantic roommates {{during the first half}} of season nine.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed.

This <b>request</b> <b>is</b> also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Dato Mogol died in 1620 and was {{succeeded by}} his eldest son, Sulaiman. A period of turmoil erupted {{ten years later}} when the Queen of Pattani branded the new ruler of Siam, King Prasat Thong, a usurper and tyrant. The queen {{withheld}} tribute and ordered attacks on Ligor (present-day Nakhon Si Thammarat) and Bordelongh (present-day Phatthalung); Ayuthaya responded by blockading Pattani with an army of 60,000 men, as well as enlisting {{the help of the}} Dutch people in capturing the City. Singora became involved in the dispute and in 1633 sent an envoy to Ayuthaya requesting help. The outcome of this <b>request</b> <b>is</b> not known, but Dutch records show that Singora was severely damaged and the pepper crop destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{synonyms}} {{is complicated by}} the type specimen of Allosaurus fragillis (catalogue number YPM 1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have noted that the type specimen, and thus the genus Allosaurus itself or at least the species A. fragillis, is technically a nomen dubium ("dubious name", based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). In an attempt to fix this situation, Gregory S. Paul and Kenneth Carpenter (2010) submitted a petition to the ICZN to have the name A. fragillis officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a neotype). This <b>request</b> <b>is</b> currently pending review.|$|E

40|$|The {{provision}} {{of a series}} of requests to which compliance is highly likely (high-probability requests) immediately antecedent to low-probability <b>requests</b> has <b>been</b> used to establish behavioral momentum of compliance. We evaluated a fading procedure for maintaining high levels of compliance obtained with high-probability requests. Fading involved a systematic {{reduction in the number of}} high-probability requests and an increase in the latency between the high- and low-probability requests. High levels of compliance for both “do” and “don't” <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> maintained for 16 weeks in a 5 -year-old boy with developmental disabilities after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence <b>was</b> faded. Similar maintenance was obtained for “do” requests in a 15 -year-old girl with developmental disabilities. For this subject, however, the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence <b>was</b> ineffective with “don't” requests. When “don't” <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> phrased as “do” requests, the high-probability request sequence produced high levels of compliance to the low-probability request. High levels of compliance to these “do” <b>requests</b> <b>were</b> maintained for 16 weeks after the high-probability <b>request</b> sequence <b>was</b> faded...|$|R
5|$|Salim {{rebels and}} amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is {{sentence}}d to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before her sentence is carried out, she begs {{to have a few}} hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her <b>request</b> <b>is</b> granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad <b>Request,</b> <b>is</b> told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases the memories of the inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E
