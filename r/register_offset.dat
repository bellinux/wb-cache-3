We propose a complexity effective runnahead processor, AVID, that will clear false memory dependencies and will hoist load instructions in safe and fast manner. Early load address resolution to run independent load ahead of store relies on register tracking. It will provide safe computation of effective address of memory references in the front end after the decoding stage. It is also complexity effective because it costs a storage of register state represented by base <b>register,</b> <b>offset</b> and a bit indicating the trackability of entry. In addition to disambiguation, AVID has a small adder to compute effective address of load based on the value of ‘known ’ state register. After the safe computation of effective address, AVID take over prefetching the data to hide the memory latency by caused cache miss. We simulated the AVID with simplescalar and analyze its performance results as well as potentials in front end. ...|$|E
