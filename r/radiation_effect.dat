25|$|In photon therapy, {{most of the}} <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> {{is through}} free radicals. Cells have {{mechanisms}} for repairing single-strand DNA damage and double-stranded DNA damage. However, double-stranded DNA breaks are {{much more difficult to}} repair, and can lead to dramatic chromosomal abnormalities and genetic deletions. Targeting double-stranded breaks increases the probability that cells will undergo cell death. Cancer cells are generally less differentiated and more stem cell-like; they reproduce more than most healthy differentiated cells, and have a diminished ability to repair sub-lethal damage. Single-strand DNA damage is then passed on through cell division; damage to the cancer cells' DNA accumulates, causing them to die or reproduce more slowly.|$|E
2500|$|The inelastic {{scattering}} of light was predicted by Adolf Smekal in 1923 (and in German-language literature {{it may be}} referred to as the Smekal-Raman effect). In 1922, Indian physicist C. V. Raman published his work on the [...] "Molecular Diffraction of Light," [...] {{the first of a series}} of investigations with his collaborators that ultimately led to his discovery (on 28 February 1928) of the <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> that bears his name. The Raman effect was first reported by C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan, and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam, on 21 February 1928 (that is why in the former Soviet Union the priority of Raman was always disputed; thus in Russian scientific literature this effect is usually referred to as [...] "combination scattering" [...] or [...] "combinatory scattering"). Raman received the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light.|$|E

5000|$|Radiation {{sensitivity}} is the susceptibility of {{a material}} to physical or chemical changes induced by radiation (see also: <b>radiation</b> <b>effect).</b> Examples of radiation sensitive materials are silver chloride, photoresists and biomaterials. Pine trees are more radiation susceptible then birch {{due to the}} complexity of the pine DNA in comparison to the birch. Examples of radiation insensitive materials are metals and ionic crystals such as quartz and sapphire. The <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> depends on the type of the irradiating particles, their energy and the number of incident particles per unit volume. Radiation effects can be transient or permanent. The persistence of the <b>radiation</b> <b>effect</b> depends on the stability of the induced physical and chemical change.
