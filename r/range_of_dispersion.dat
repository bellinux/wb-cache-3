He concluded: [...] "We have tried regulation ranging from heavy to central planning. None meaningfully worked. Do we wish to retest the evidence?"

50|$|Prunus rivularis is {{native to}} the United States; found in Arkansas, {{southern}} Illinois, south-eastern Kansas, Kentucky, northern Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, south-western Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. It {{can be found in}} a variety of places in nature: places like creeksides, wooden canyons, bottom of valleys and flooded plains. This plant grows on limestone-based woodland or sandy soil. The moisture of the soil can vary between dry and moist, though the soil has to be well drained. (In other words, water is readily removed from the soil). The preferred pH is slightly more alkaline (greater than 7.2). It is hardy to levels of 6-9 because of its varied distribution. This implies that the USDA zones, or geographically designated zones of temperature of which plants can grow under, are found in the southern part of United States. The temperature ranges between -10° and 30° Fahrenheit. Again, because of the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion,</b> the amount of precipitation this plant can experience is anywhere from 24 to 48 inches per year.|$|E

We found a well-defined correlation between {{the peak of the}} particle size distribution as outputted by the DLS instrument and the nanosheet length as measured by TEM.

The new functional is considerably simpler than its predecessors of a similar type. The functional has a tractable and robust analytic form that lends itself to efficient self-consistent implementation. When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium. Our model exhibits an outstanding precision at predicting equilibrium intermonomer separations in van der Waals complexes. It also gives accurate covalent bond lengths and atomization energies. Hence the functional proposed in this work is a computationally inexpensive electronic structure tool of broad applicability. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

With a GLM approach that takes advantage of exponential family properties, we discuss model estimation, inference, diagnostics, and interpretation, and present a test for determining the need for a COM-Poisson regression over a standard Poisson regression.

Different concentrations of glycols {{were added to}} these base dispersions (propylene glycol and glycerine) to investigate how the above physical properties change.
