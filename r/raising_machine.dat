50|$|A barbell, {{dumbbells}} or a smith machine may be {{used for}} resistance, and overhand, inside, outside, underhand or mixed grip can be used. The barbell can be held in front of the thighs, resting on the quadriceps, or behind, resting on the hamstrings. Using these excludes inside and outside grips. One or two dumbbells, kettlebells or resistance bands can also be used, together or opposite one another. A trapbar can also be used, necessitating an inside grip.

Many researchers have investigated neural activation during exercise, or the effects of muscle damage associated with eccentric exercise, but few have studied the prolonged effects of a bout of eccentric exercise on strength and motorneuron excitability. Eleven male and female subjects (aged 20 - 43 years) were tested to determine the effects of a fatiguing bout of eccentric exercise upon maximal isometric plantarflexion strength, motorneuron excitability, and neural activation of the soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG).

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the concept of}} shaft constructed by raise boring in underground mines, {{and the idea of}} inverse construction can be extended to other fields of underground engineering. The conventional raise boring methods, such as the wood support method, the hanging cage method, the creeping cage method, and the deep-hole blasting method, are analyzed and compared. In addition, the <b>raise</b> boring <b>machines</b> are classified into different types and the characteristics of each type are described. The components of a <b>raise</b> boring <b>machine</b> including the drill rig, the drill string and the auxiliary system are also presented. Based on the analysis of the raise boring method, the rock mechanics problems during the raise boring process are put forward, including rock fragmentation, removal of cuttings, shaft wall stability, and borehole deviation control. Finally, the development trends of raise boring technology are described as follows: (i) improvement of rock-breaking modes to raise drilling efficiency, (ii) development of an intelligent control technique, and (iii) development of technology and equipment for nonlinear raise boring...|$|R

40|$|Context: Eccentric {{exercises}} {{are increasingly being}} used to treat lower limb musculoskeletal conditions such as Achilles tendinopathy. Despite widespread clinical application and documented efficacy, mechanisms underpinning clinical benefit remain unclear. Positive adaptations in motor performance are one potential mechanism. Objective: To investigate how an eccentric loading intervention influences measures of stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) behaviour during a hopping task. Design: Within subjects repeated measures observational study. Setting: University motion analysis laboratory. Participants: Healthy adults. Interventions: A single intervention of 5 sets of 10 eccentric plantarflexion contractions at 6 RM using a commercial seated calf <b>raise</b> <b>machine.</b> Main outcome measures: Lower limb stiffness, sagittal plane ankle kinematics, and temporal muscle activity of the agonist (soleus) and antagonist (tibialis anterior) muscles, measured during sub-maximal hopping on a custom-built sledge-jump system. Results: Eccentric loading altered ankle kinematics during sub-maximal hopping; peak ankle angle shifted to a less dorsiflexed position by 2. 9 ° and ankle angle pre-contact shifted by 4. 4 ° (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Lower limb stiffness increased from 5. 9 to 6. 8 Nm- 1 (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), whilst surface EMG measures of soleus occurred 14 to 44...|$|R

A drain in the rear, {{at the bottom of}} the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out.

40|$|Children develop {{lower levels}} of muscle force, and at slower rates, than adults. Whilst {{strength}} training in children is expected to reduce this differential, a synchronous adaptation in the tendon must be achieved to ensure forces continue to be transmitted to the skeleton with efficiency whilst minimizing the risk of strain-related tendon injury. We hypothesized that resistance training (RT) would alter tendon mechanical properties in children concomitantly with changes in force production characteristics. Twenty prepubertal children (8. 9 ± 0. 3 years) were equally divided into control (non-training) and experimental (training) groups. The training group completed a 10 -week RT intervention consisting of 2 - 3 sets of 8 - 15 plantar flexion contractions performed twice-weekly on a recumbent calf <b>raise</b> <b>machine.</b> Achilles tendon properties (cross-sectional area, elongation, stress, strain, stiffness and Young’s modulus), electromechanical delay (EMD; time between the onset of muscle activity and force), rate of force development (RFD; slope of the force-time curve) and rate of EMG increase (REI; slope of the EMG-time curve) were measured before and after RT. Tendon stiffness and Young’s modulus increased significantly after RT {{in the experimental group}} only (~ 29 % and ~ 25 %, respectively); all other tendon properties were not significantly altered, although there were mean decreases in both peak tendon strain and strain at a given force level (14 % and 24 %, respectively (n. s)) which may have implications for tendon injury risk and muscle fiber mechanics. A ~ 13 % decrease in EMD was found after RT for the experimental group which paralleled the increase in tendon stiffness (r = - 0. 59), however RFD and REI were unchanged. The present data show that the Achilles tendon adapts to RT in prepubertal children and is paralleled by a change in EMD, although the magnitude of this change {{did not appear to be}} sufficient to influence RFD. These findings are of potential importance within the context of the efficiency and execution of movement...|$|R
