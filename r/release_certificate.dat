2500|$|On June 9, 2008, Jim Geraghty of the {{conservative}} website National Review Online suggested that Obama <b>release</b> his birth <b>certificate.</b> Geraghty wrote that <b>releasing</b> his birth <b>certificate</b> could debunk several false rumors circulating on the Internet, namely: that his middle name was originally Muhammad rather than Hussein; {{that his mother had}} originally named him [...] "Barry" [...] rather than [...] "Barack"; and that Barack Obama Sr. was not his biological father, as well as the rumor that Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen.|$|R

40|$|Public key {{infrastructure}} {{provides a}} promising foundation for verifying {{the authenticity of}} communicating parties and transferring trust over the internet. The key issue in public key infrastructure is how to process certificate revocations. Previous research in this aspect has concentrated on the tradeoffs {{that can be made}} among different revocation options. No rigorous efforts have been made to understand the probability distribution of certificate revocation requests based on real empirical data. In this study, we first collect real empirical data from VeriSign and derive the probability function for certificate revocation requests. We then prove that a revocation system will become stable after a period of time. Based on these, we show that different certificate authorities should take different strategies for <b>releasing</b> <b>certificate</b> revocation lists for different types of certificate services. We also provide the exact steps by which certificate authorities can derive optimal releasing strategies. ...|$|R

50|$|Caracostea {{was elected}} a titular {{member of the}} Romanian Academy in 1938, and presided over the forum's {{literary}} section for a time. During the summer of 1940, he served as Minister of National Education in two successive cabinets: under Ion Gigurtu from July 4 to September 4, and under Ion Antonescu from September 4 to 14, until {{the establishment of the}} National Legionary State. That autumn, the new regime appointed him head of Revista Fundațiilor Regale; as such, he suspended contributions from critics whom he deemed sympathetic toward Jewish literature. From April 1941 to May 1944. three months before the King Michael Coup, he headed the amalgamated Royal Foundations. His ascendancy under Romania's wartime regimes was not due to politics: he had participated neither in the main parties nor in pro-fascist groups, but remained loyal to the ideas of Nicolae Iorga. Instead, it stemmed from the Germanophilia that had begun during his Vienna days. Caracostea's activity at the magazine was curtailed {{by the fact that he}} had to issue a monthly report both to the Anglophile Royal House and to the pro-German Antonescu. Its situation was precarious: circulation had dropped to 800, issues appeared at delayed intervals and mobilization made contributors difficult to find. In 1948, the new communist regime stripped him of Academy membership. Initially tried and sentenced together with other officials who served until 1944, he was arrested in 1950 and held at Sighet prison until 1955, this time without trial. His <b>release</b> <b>certificate</b> does not feature an arrest warrant record or the motive for his detention, an implicit admission that there was no legal basis for his arrest or detention. In June 1964, aged 85, he was at home discussing with a former student about the latter's thesis. Suddenly feeling unwell, he died of an internal hemorrhage after half an hour.|$|E
