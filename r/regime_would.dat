5|$|With {{this new}} power he persuaded the chamber {{to pass the}} radical Ventôse Decrees, under which the <b>régime</b> <b>would</b> {{confiscate}} aristocratic émigré property and distribute it to needy sans-culottes. But these acts of wealth redistribution, arguably the most revolutionary acts of the French Revolution, never went into operation. The Committee faltered in creating procedures for their enforcement, and the frantic pace of unfolding political events left them behind.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{historians have}} come to believe that Khánh ordered that Nhung be {{liquidated}} and that the earlier reports were deliberately false material disseminated by Khánh through his subordinates. According to this now-established account, one of Khánh's men took Nhung to the garden of a Saigon villa and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot to the back of the head. Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Diệm's <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> be reinstated to positions of authority.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1864, Berro's term {{of office}} ended. The ongoing civil war {{prevented}} elections; therefore Atanasio Aguirre, president of the Uruguayan senate {{and a member of}} the Amapolas (the radical wing of the Blanco Party) replaced Berro, on an interim basis. In April, José Antônio Saraiva was appointed minister plenipotentiary by the Brazilian government and charged with quickly reaching an accord that would settle Brazil's claims and ensure the safety of Brazilian citizens. His focus soon shifted from satisfying Brazil's terms to a more immediate goal of hammering out a deal between the antagonists in the civil war, with the expectation that only a more stable <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> be able to reach a settlement with Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, the Socialist Party {{candidate}} Salvador Allende won {{the presidential}} election of 1970, becoming the first democratically elected Marxist {{to become president of}} a country in the Americas. The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973. Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). The Pinochet <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> go on {{to be one of the}} leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government.|$|E
5|$|In effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 {{adopted by}} the Cortes de Cadiz served {{as the basis for}} {{independence}} in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero.|$|E

30|$|A further {{consideration}} is patient experiences of retention and compliance with prolonged retention regimes; it is intuitive {{to expect that}} co-operation with retention <b>regimes</b> <b>would</b> decline over time. Moreover, both fixed and removable retainers are prone to breakage, loss, and degradation [2, 11]. Repeated breakage and requirement for replacement may have implications for the cost-effectiveness of both fixed and removable approaches. There is however limited evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of either approach [12, 13].|$|R
25|$|The coup {{subjected}} Brazil to {{a military}} regime politically aligned {{to the interests of}} the United States government. This <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> last until 1985, when Tancredo Neves was indirectly elected the first civilian President of Brazil since the 1960 elections.|$|E
25|$|Writing in 1969, Amalrik {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make 1980 as {{the date of the}} Soviet downfall, because 1980 was a round number, but Amalrik was persuaded by a friend to change it to the Orwellian inspired year of 1984. Amalrik predicted the collapse of the <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> occur between 1980 and 1985.|$|E
25|$|A severe {{economic}} downturn occurred {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991.

50|$|After {{the initial}} emigration, {{the number of}} Jews in Baghdad {{decreased}} from 100,000 to 5,000. Although they enjoyed {{a brief period of}} security during the reign of Abdul Karim Qassim, later <b>regimes</b> <b>would</b> seriously increase the persecution of Iraqi Jews. In 1968 there were only about 2,000 Jews still living there. On January 27, 1969 nine Jews were hanged on charges of spying for Israel causing most of the remaining community to flee the country. Today fewer than 100 Jews remain.|$|R

[...] Even if this new aristocracy were to have originated from among the ranks of the proletariat, Bakunin argued that their new-found power would fundamentally change their view of society and thus lead them to [...] "look down at the plain working masses." ...|$|R
25|$|The suddenness of the €85 billion bailout deal led to {{worries that}} Irish {{sovereignty}} had been lost, {{and that the}} Irish economy might not grow fast enough to afford the bailout costs.

50|$|Future Latin American revolutionaries {{shifted to}} guerrilla tactics, {{particularly}} following the Cuban Revolution. Arbenz fell when his military had deserted him. Since then, some future Latin American social revolutionaries and Marxists, most notably Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua made {{the army and}} governments parts of a single unit and eventually set up single party states. Overthrowing such <b>regimes</b> <b>would</b> require a war, rather than a simple CIA operation, the landing of Marines, or a crude invasion scheme like the Bay of Pigs Invasion.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} exchange rate regime {{for developing countries}} {{has been at the}} center of the debate in international finance for a long time. What are the costs and benefits of various exchange rate regimes? What are the determinants of the choice of an exchange rate <b>regime</b> and how <b>would</b> country circumstances affect the choice? Does macroeconomic performance differ under alternative <b>regimes?</b> How <b>would</b> an exchange rate adjustment affect trade flows? The steady increase in magnitude and variability of international capital flows has intensified the debate in the past few years as each of the major currency crises in the 1990 s has in some way involved a fixed exchange rate and sudden reversal of capital inflows. New questions include: Are pegged regimes inherently crisis-prone? Which <b>regimes</b> <b>would</b> be better suited to deal with increasingly global and unstable capital markets? While the debate continues, there are areas where some consensus is emerging, and there are valuable lessons from earlier experience for developing countries. This note provides a review of the main issues in selecting an appropriate regime, examines where the debate now stands, and summarizes the consensus reached and lessons learned from recent experience...|$|R

No regulatory regime currently used in practice accomplishes this goal, but a novel policy, which combines the “Dutch” and “Swedish” <b>regimes,</b> <b>would.</b> Our analysis offers guidance for empirical {{studies on the}} impact of prostitution laws, and is pertinent to the debate on decriminalization of prostitution...|$|R

25|$|The {{decision}} has been debated ever since {{but there is no}} evidence for allegations made later by exiles that there was panic in London on 6 December. Most historians agree that the Hanoverian <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> not have fallen even had the Jacobites reached London. The decision to retreat was validated by the Duke of Richmond, who was with Cumberland's army.

25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1920 it became {{increasingly}} clear that the Soviet <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the Whites, a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident {{groups such as the}} so-called Workers' Opposition and the Democratic Centralists emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the peasantry over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Why {{do so many}} African governments {{consistently}} impose high {{tax rates}} and make little investment in productive public goods when alternative policies could yield greater tax revenues and higher national income? We posit and test an intertemporal political economy model {{in which the government}} sets tax and R&D levels while investors respond with production. Equilibrium policy and growth rates depend on initial cost structure. We find that in many (but not all) African countries, low tax/high investment <b>regimes</b> <b>would</b> be time-inconsistent. For progrowth policies to become sustainable, commitment mechanisms or new production techniques would be needed...|$|R
25|$|In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a {{position}} {{to which he was}} appointed by Shermarke. Shermarke was assassinated two years later by one of his own bodyguards. His murder was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somalian Army seized power without encountering armed opposition. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army. The new <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> go on to rule Somalia for the next 21 years.|$|E
25|$|While {{not itself}} {{a part of}} the New Deal, the Roosevelt {{administration}} kept a close eye on the challenge to the 1934 Railroad Retirement Act, Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.. Its similarity with the Social Security Act meant the test of the railroad pension <b>regime</b> <b>would</b> serve as an indicator of whether Roosevelt's ambitious retirement program would be found constitutional. The railroad pension was designed to encourage older rail workers to retire, thereby creating jobs for younger railroaders desperately in need of work, although ostensibly Congress passed the act {{on the grounds that it}} would increase safety on the country's railways.|$|E
25|$|The East German {{government}} eventually {{sought to}} defuse the situation by relaxing the country's border controls.

Only four million GDR citizens had a passport, so only that number could take immediate advantage of such a change; the remaining 13million would have {{to apply for a}} passport and then wait at least four weeks for approval.
