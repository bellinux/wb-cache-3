50|$|<b>Relief</b> <b>displacement</b> is {{prominent}} when photographing {{a variety}} of elevations. This situation causes objects above sea level to be displaced outward from {{the centre of the}} photograph and objects below ground level to be displaced toward the centre of the image (Figure 2). The severity of the displacement is negatively associated with decreases in flight altitude and as radial distance from the centre of the photograph increases. This distortion can be minimised by photographing multiple swaths and creating a mosaic of the images. This technique creates a focus for the centre of each photograph where distortion is minimised. This error is not common in shoreline mapping as the relief is fairly constant. It is however important to consider when mapping cliffs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{integration}} of high spatial resolution airborne LiDAR and colour-infrared ortho-images provides excellent {{data for the}} automatic mapping of buildings in urban areas. However, there is still uncorrected <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> in the commonly available orthorectified aerial images. This can produce errors in building footprint extraction when combining the LiDAR images with the ortho-images. This paper describes a newly developed <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> correction method to correct for the leaning effect of the buildings and an object-based classification method to map buildings in urban areas. Using these methods, the building mapping accuracy is improved. Keywords: Urban, LiDAR, building extraction, high resolutio...|$|E
40|$|II Geometric {{correction}} of remote sensing imagery is indispensable {{for the purpose}} of data integration and applications. Conventional ortho-rectification only considers the {{correction of}} tilt <b>displacements</b> and terrain <b>relief</b> <b>displacements.</b> Since high-resolution imagery captures more detailed information, the abrupt changes of object elevation result in the <b>relief</b> <b>displacements</b> and occlusions in image space. In urban areas, high-rise buildings and multi-layer road systems of orthoimages cause serious image deformation. True-orthorectification procedures take account of ground objects for the correction of <b>relief</b> <b>displacements</b> and compensation of the hidden areas. Accordingly, the true orthoimages provide the exact position of land objects. This research focuses on the man-made constructions, including buildings and roads. Thus, the generation of true orthoimages is done by integration of building, road, and terrain models. The test data comprise three dimensional building models, road models and digital terrain models, and multi-view aerial images are employed for the compensation of hidden areas. The proposed scheme includes：(1) visibility analysis, (2) hidden detection, (3) hidden compensation, and (4) shadow enhancement. Three test sites includie...|$|R

40|$|So far, orthoimages are {{generated}} from aerial photographs by differential rectification {{to correct the}} effects of <b>relief</b> <b>displacements.</b> Digital Terrain Models (DTM) describe only the topographic surface but ignore trees, man-made objects, etc. Therefore, the effect of leaning buildings or bent bridges appears, especially in urban areas.

Now, recent developments of optoelectronic line-scanning cameras like HRSC or ADS 40 allow for a totally new approach for orthoimage generation.

40|$|Recently, {{automatic}} object extraction from Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) {{data has}} attracted great attention. The {{level of detail}} {{and the quality of}} the collected point cloud motivated the research community to investigate the possibility of automatic object extraction from such data. Prior accurate knowledge of terrain information is usually essential for the data to be usable in further processing, such as feature extraction, and to obtain better object detection results. In this paper, a new strategy for automatic terrain extraction from LiDAR data is presented. The proposed strategy is based on the fact that sudden elevation changes, which usually correspond to non-ground objects, will cause <b>relief</b> <b>displacements</b> in perspective views. The introduced <b>relief</b> <b>displacements</b> will occlude neighboring ground points. A Digital Surface Model (DSM) is first generated by resampling the irregular LiDAR point clouds to a regular grid. By using synthesized projection centers located above the DSM and analyzing the visibility maps in perspective images, we can classify the DSM into non-ground and ground hypotheses. Surface roughness and inherent noise in the point cloud will lead to some false hypotheses. By using a novel algorithm which combines plane fitting and statistical filtering to remove these false hypotheses, nonground and ground points can be separated. The algorithm has been tested using both simulated and real datasets. The results have demonstrated that our approach can perform well with highly complex data from an urban area. In a comparison with the results obtained with TerraScan software, our algorithm showed the capability of producing better results while being less sensitive to used parameters. 1...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well know}} that it is {{possible}} to use the vanishing point geometry to assess the orientation parameters of the photographic image. Here we propose a numerical or graphical procedure to estimate such parameters, assuming that in the imaged object are present planar surfaces, straight-line edges, and right angles. In addition, by means of the same estimated parameters, it is possible to project the same image onto a selected plane say to rectify the image. The advantages are that non-metric images, taken from archives or books also, provided a good geometry and quality, are suitable for the task. From one side the role of the classical line photogrammetry is taken more and more over by laser scanning, and on the other side, this simplified procedure enables the researcher to use photogrammetric techniques for stereoscopy and interpretation, thematic mapping, research. The convergent nonstereoscopic images rectified with digital photogrammetric techniques, are then made suitable for stereoscopy. In fact the rectification corrects for tilt displacement and not for <b>relief</b> <b>displacement,</b> but it is just <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> that enables stereoscopy.

From the application point of view, an interactive system for geometrical building modeling based on a semi-automatic approach is presented. A true-orthophoto rectification scheme based on the generated building models is also proposed. The data used in the proposed system are 3 -D visible roof-edges that have been manually measured from a stereo-model, or the 3 -D building outlines from a digital topographic map. The core technology is called the “Split-Merge-Shape ” (SMS) method. The SPLIT and MERGE steps are the two main procedures for topology reconstruction from non-related roof-edges. The SHAPE step uses the available roof-edge height information to define an appropriate rooftop. With the SMS method, the topographic mapping of buildings, and geometric building modeling, can be seamlessly integrated into a unified procedure. In a conventional ortho-rectification procedure using a digital terrain model, the correction of <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> due to buildings is not considered.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to show {{potential}} uses of very high resolution (VHR) image in an urban analysis of Bukavu in the Democratic Republic of Congo. As for many of the Third-World cities, Bukavu grew up during the last decades and available topographical information on Bukavu dates back to the middle of the twentieth century.

40|$|Digital {{orthophoto}} is {{an image}} where the <b>relief</b> <b>displacements</b> and the camera's tilt have been removed. So it is an efficient, inexpensive and accurate approach for purposes such as evaluation, analysis or measurement of the objects presented in the images. For this reason digital orthophoto has occupied an important place in spatial database in GIS. The traditional orthophoto is based on Digital terrain model {{and it does not}} include the man-made objects. Therefore, the orthophotos of urban areas do not have satisfactory accuracy. True orthophoto generation by using the digital surface model in rectification process and detecting occluded areas through the visibility analysis is the only solution. True orthophoto can be produced from close range as well as aerial and satellite images. In this paper, to simplify the true orthophoto generation process several close range images of a cubic object are used with a regularly spaced grid DSM. In close range Photogrammetry the distance between camera and object is small and as a result the occluded areas are extensive. Therefore, the occluded areas detection method must be efficient. In this research work the height-based raytracing method is used to detect the occluded areas. To restore the information of the occluded areas the seamless automatic mosaicking considering histogram equalization of images is applied. ...|$|R

40|$|Multi sensor image fusions, {{by which}} {{complementary}} information {{contents of the}} acquired images are combined, make image analysis easier for variety of applications. However, any subsequent application carried out on the fused images highly relies on the image fusion accuracy. In this regard, the image registration stage plays a crucial impact on the final accuracy. Inaccurate image registration disturbs the positional correspondences between the identical pixels and hence introduces uncertainties on the subsequent data analysis carried out over the integrated data. The common approach for the image to image registration employs a polynomial method using well distributed image points. However, for the images taken by different sensors, simple polynomial transformation for the registration may not give satisfactory result in the areas with excessive height undulation. This does not pose {{a real problem for}} the low resolution satellite images for the reason that the relief displacements in these images are more or less negligible. Nevertheless, for the high resolution satellite images, the <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> may not be negligible particularly in mountainous terrains where it may reach to several pixels. In these situations the only solution is to incorporate a DTM of the area to correct the <b>relief</b> <b>displacement.</b> However, polynomial transformation is not an optimal solution to perform this task. In this paper, an alternative approach for the image registration is proposed based on a joint RPC/ 3 D-Affine transformation. The proposed solution is applied to the IRS P 5 and P 6 satellite images. The main characteristic of this approach is that instead of performing a direct image to image registration, the geometric transformation is carried out first from the image to ground via the P 5 supplied RPCs. This is then followed by a 3 D affine transformation from the ground to the P 6 image space. The second stage requires the parameters of the 3...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent seamline {{selection}} for image mosaicking {{is an area}} of active research in the fields of massive data processing, computer vision, photogrammetry and remote sensing. In mosaicking applications for digital orthophoto maps (DOMs), the visual transition in mosaics is mainly caused by differences in positioning accuracy, image tone and <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> of high ground objects between overlapping DOMs. Among these three factors, <b>relief</b> <b>displacement,</b> which prevents the seamless mosaicking of images, is relatively more difficult to address. To minimize visual discontinuities, many optimization algorithms have been studied for the automatic selection of seamlines to avoid high ground objects. Thus, a new automatic seamline selection algorithm using a digital surface model (DSM) is proposed. The main idea of this algorithm is to guide a seamline toward a low area {{on the basis of the}} elevation information in a DSM. Given that the elevation of a DSM is not completely synchronous with a DOM, a new model, called the orthoimage elevation synchronous model (OESM), is derived and introduced. OESM can accurately reflect the elevation information for each DOM unit. Through the morphological processing of the OESM data in the overlapping area, an initial path network is obtained for seamline selection. Subsequently, a cost function is defined on the basis of several measurements, and Dijkstra’s algorithm is adopted to determine the least-cost path from the initial network. Finally, the proposed algorithm is employed for automatic seamline network construction; the effective mosaic polygon of each image is determined, and a seamless mosaic is generated. The experiments with three different datasets indicate that the proposed method meets the requirements for seamline network construction. In comparative trials, the generated seamlines pass through fewer ground objects with low time consumption...|$|E

For easier image interpretation, multispectral (4 m) and panchromatic (1 m) images were fused together by means of the LMVM algorithm. Depending on the object, the Computer Aided Photo Interpretation (CAPI) uses or does not use the near infrared information (true or false colour composite). For a more detailed interpretation about the city morphology we draped the 1 m multispectral fused image over the 1 m resolution DEM grid. The Built-up Area Index (BAI) computed on the urban mask obtained by CAPI and classification of the vegetation, was compared with the 1954 situation interpreted from topographic maps. The present city shows higher BAI values and in the same time the centre of the city has clearly shifted southward. Statistical analyses are also done on built-up versus slope data. The lack of good GCP’s and the use of DEM produced inaccurate orthorectification which was not adequate for topographical features extraction. Nevertheless the present extensions of Bukavu built-up areas are more than the double of those observed at the beginning of the last half century. New constructions are located on steeper slopes where landslides are frequents. More features could be extracted from the Ikonos image if good GPS measurements were made and if verification by the city authorities was possible.

40|$|Digital {{orthoimage}} (or orthophoto) {{is a type}} of information-rich digital {{products and}} has found applications in many fields. However, digital orthoimage itself is a 2 -dimensional product and therefore it is insufficient for many applications. On the other hand, the traditional stereo model of photogrammetry formed from a pair of overlapping aerial photographs offer the possibility of both 3 D measurement of terrain surface and terrain objects. However, it cannot be used a plan like the case of digital orthoimage and the model size is usually limited to the stereo pair. To take the advantage of both, the concept of stereomate was introduced by Collins in 1968. It is a new image with additional <b>relief</b> <b>displacement.</b> The total amount of <b>relief</b> <b>displacement</b> at each point of the stereomate is exactly the same as the sum of two relief displacements at the same position on both images of the stereo pair. That is, if this stereomate is used together with the orthoimage, one is still able to reconstruct a 3 D surface of the area precisely. The main limitation with the current practice is that if more than one stereo pairs are used to generate the stereo orthophoto pair, the solution is not rigorous and thus leads to low accuracy of 3 D measurement in highly mountainous areas although reasonable accuracy of 3 D measurement can be achieved in areas with low relief. This paper introduces the concept of “measurable seamless stereo model”, which is formed by a mosaic orthoimage and a mosaic stereomate (i. e. mosaics of a whole block of aerial photographs), with the lineage (image coordinates on original photograph and the orientation parameters of the original photograph) of each pixel on both mosaic orthoimage and a mosaic stereomate recorded.

Three of the lines traversed the margins of the northern segment of the ridge near Jones-boro, Arkansas, and the other two were located south of Jonesboro across the margins of the southern segment. All five lines revealed sub-surface faulting of the Paleozoic through Eocene (Wilcox) sections beneath the ridge margins. The data did not resolve the uppermost 0. 1 s of two way travel time so {{it is not possible to}} determine if the Pliocene and younger sediments have been faulted. Thus, we can not determine if the ridge truly owes its topographic <b>relief</b> to fault <b>displacement</b> or if Tertiary faulting controlled subsequent Quaternary river incision. At one site, however, it does appear that the ridge margin is a fault scarp because the ridge height is the same as the structural relief on the ridge-bounding fault and fault displacement can be traced into the shal-lowest reflectors (0. 15 s) ...|$|R
40|$|The fringes {{observed}} in repeat pass interferograms are expressions of surface <b>relief</b> and relative <b>displacements.</b> The limiting condition {{in the application}} of spaceborne radar interferometry to the remote sensing of the sea ice cover is the large magnitude of motion between repeat passes. The translation and rotation of ice floes tend to decorrelate the observations rendering radar interferometry ineffective. In our study, we have located three images in the high Arctic during a period when there was negligible motion between repeat observations. The fringes obtained from these images show a wealth of information about the sea ice cover which is important in atmosphere-ice interactions and sea ice mechanics. These measurements provide the first detailed remote sensing view of the sea ice cover. Ridges can be observed and their heights estimated if the interferometric baseline allows. We have observed ridges with heights greater than 4 m. The variability in the phase measurements over an area provides an indication of the large scale roughness. Relative centimetric displacements between rigid ice floes have been observed. We illustrate these observations with examples extracted from the interferograms formed from this set of ERS- 1 SAR images...|$|R
