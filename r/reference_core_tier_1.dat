50|$|The 2012-2013 Cypriot {{financial}} crisis resulted in financial difficulties at CPB. The Cypriot state recapitalized CPB on 30 June 2012 {{with the result}} that the government acquired 84% of the bank's equity.

If setting CET1 Ratio and Total Capital Ratio (fully loaded basis) targets at 8% and 11.5% respectively even in the adverse scenario in 2018, it would mean the bank would have a capital shortfall of €8.8 billion (<b>core</b> <b>tier</b> <b>1,</b> additional <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> and <b>tier</b> 2 capitals combined), [...] according to European Central Bank publication on 29 December 2016.|$|R

The technical implementation deadline for Basel III is 2019, but recent developments in the banking market have suggested that even stricter rules may be applied by a later framework, which has been dubbed [...] "Basel 4". The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative paper, seeking out views on the Committee's plan to change how capital requirements and market risks are calculated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{starts with}} the {{observation}} that the average issue size during 2012 of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds was more than $ 1 bn. Typically a CoCo is converted in shares when a pre-defined capital ratio such as the <b>core</b> <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> ratio (CT 1) drops below a minimum level. In some other cases, the contingent convertibles investors will suffer from a pre-defined haircut in stead of a conversion into shares. Investors could dynamically hedge the equity exposure embedded within a contingent convertible by taking an offsetting short position in the underlying shares. This dynamic hedging can in some circumstances {{have a negative impact}} on the share price of the bank. It could indeed lead to a spiral of falling share prices. This so-called death spiral effect can only be avoided if the size of the contingent convertible is moderate compared to the amount of outstanding public traded shares. In this contribution we advocate the use of contingent debt where there is more than one conversion trigger. Banks should move away from one large single CoCo issue towards issues with multiple accounting triggers spread across an extended range. This will alleviate the death spiral risk. The expected dynamic behavior of a CoCo bond has been modeled using a credit derivates approach. From these models we then quantify the equity sensitivity and the negative gamma resulting from the design of a contingent convertible and illustrate the possible pitfalls of a death spiral on the share price. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|A {{major health}} concern for {{nanomaterials}} is their potential toxic effect after inhalation of dusts. Correspondingly, the <b>core</b> element of <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> in the currently proposed Integrated Testing Strategy (ITS) is a short-term rat inhalation study (STIS) for this route of exposure. STIS comprises a comprehensive scheme of biological effects and marker determination {{in order to}} generate appropriate information on early key elements of pathogenesis, such as inflammatory reactions in the lung and indications of effects in other organs. Within the STIS information on the persistence, progression and/or regression of effects is obtained. The STIS also addresses organ burden in the lung and potential translocation to other tissues. Up to now STIS was performed in research projects and routine testing of nanomaterials. Meanwhile rat STIS results for more than 20 nanomaterials are available including the representative nanomaterials listed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials (WPMN), which has endorsed a list of representative Manufactured Nanomaterials (MN) {{as well as a}} set of relevant endpoints to be addressed. Here, results of STIS carried out with different nanomaterials are discussed as case studies. The ranking of different nanomaterials potential to induce adverse effects and the ranking of the respective NOAEC is the same among the STIS and the corresponding sub-chronic and chronic studies. In another case study, a translocation of a coated silica nanomaterial was judged critical for its safety assessment. Thus, STIS enables application of the proposed ITS, as long as reliable and relevant in vitro methods for the <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> testing are still missing. Compared to traditional subacute and subchronic inhalation testing (according to OECD test guidelines (TG) 412 and 413), STIS uses less animals and resources and offers additional information on organ burden and pro-/regression of potential effects.

40|$|We {{performed}} a two-tiered, whole-genome association study of Parkinson disease (PD). For <b>tier</b> <b>1,</b> we individually genotyped 198, 345 uniformly spaced and informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 443 sibling pairs discordant for PD. For tier 2 a, we individually genotyped 1, 793 PD-associated SNPs (P<. 01 in <b>tier</b> <b>1)</b> and 300 genomic control SNPs in 332 matched case–unrelated control pairs. We identified 11 SNPs that {{were associated with}} PD (P<. 01) in both <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> and <b>tier</b> 2 samples and had the same direction of effect. For these SNPs, we combined data from the case–unaffected sibling pair (<b>tier</b> <b>1)</b> and case–unrelated control pair (tier 2) samples and employed a liberalization of the sibling transmission/disequilibrium test to calculate odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and P values. A SNP within the semaphorin 5 A gene (SEMA 5 A) had the lowest combined P value (P= 7. 62 × 10 - 6). The protein encoded by this gene {{plays an important role}} in neurogenesis and in neuronal apoptosis, which is consistent with existing hypotheses regarding PD pathogenesis. A second SNP tagged the PARK 11 late-onset PD susceptibility locus (P= 1. 70 × 10 - 5). In tier 2 b, we also selected for genotyping additional SNPs that were borderline significant (P<. 05) in <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> but that tested a priori biological and genetic hypotheses regarding susceptibility to PD (n= 941 SNPs). In analysis of the combined <b>tier</b> <b>1</b> and <b>tier</b> 2 b data, the two SNPs with the lowest P values (P= 9. 07 × 10 - 6; P= 2. 96 × 10 - 5) tagged the PARK 10 late-onset PD susceptibility locus.
