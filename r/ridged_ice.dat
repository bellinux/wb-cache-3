50|$|From an {{offshore}} engineering and naval perspective, {{there are three}} reasons why pressure ridges are a subject of investigation. Firstly, because the highest loads applied on offshore structures operating in cold oceans by drift ice are associated with these features. Secondly, when pressure ridges drift into shallower areas, their keel may {{come into contact with}} the seabed, thereby representing a risk for subsea pipelines (see Seabed gouging by ice) and other seabed installations. Thirdly, they {{have a significant impact on}} navigation. In the Arctic, <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> makes up about 40% of the overall mass of sea ice.|$|E

While the ice in the northern parts of the Gulf of Bothnia does not get thicker than about 1 m even during the hardest winters, the high icebreaking capability allows the vessel to operate efficiently in all prevailing ice conditions, particularly heavily <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> fields, and maintain a high average escort speed through the winter.

50|$|Polaris {{features}} a novel propulsion system consisting of three electrically driven ABB Azipod propulsion units, {{one of which}} is located in the bow of the vessel.

Each ice-strengthened Azipod unit has a four-bladed stainless steel propeller with removable blades and weighs 135 tons. This new type of propulsion system was selected to fulfill the strict operational capability requirements set by the Finnish Transport Agency particularly in <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> fields.

50|$|The number, {{type and}} {{location}} of the propellers depends on the power, draft and intended purpose of the vessel. Smaller icebreakers and icebreaking special purpose ships {{may be able to}} do with just one propeller while large polar icebreakers typically need up to three large propellers to absorb all power and deliver enough thrust. Some shallow draught river icebreakers have been built with four propellers in the stern. Nozzles may be used to increase the thrust at lower speeds, but they may become clogged by ice. Until the 1980s, icebreakers operating regularly in <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> fields in the Baltic Sea were fitted with first one and later two bow propellers to create a powerful flush along the hull of the vessel. This considerably increased the icebreaking capability of the vessels by reducing the friction between the hull and the ice, and allowed the icebreakers to penetrate thick ice ridges without ramming. However, the bow propellers are not suitable for polar icebreakers operating in the presence of harder multi-year ice and thus have not been used in the Arctic.|$|E

This report presents a comprehensive investigation of five ridges sampled during the March 1999 program. The ice microstructure of the ridges is correlated to the bulk physical properties (temperature, salinity and density) and consolidated layer {{thickness of the}} <b>ridged</b> <b>ice.</b> The ridges had a maximum sail height that ranged from 1. 5 to 3. 8 m. The consolidated layer thickness of the <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> ranged from 0. 7 to 2. 1 m and the total ice thickness varied from 1. 8 to 5. 0 m. The temperature of the ice cores was just below 00 C. The average bulk ice salinity ranged from 3. 6 to 4. 1 2 ̆ 030, with a maximum of 6 2 ̆ 030. Ice densities from the examined ridge site ranged from 0. 85 to 0. 93 Mg/m 3. The warm temperatures, high porosity and low density of the ice indicated temperate ridges in a deteriorated state.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} ship's resistance caused by sea ice ridge keels is revised {{and used as}} a part of a method for predicting performance of ships in <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> conditions. The resistance method is based on a continuum plasticity model of ridge rubble and is simple to compute. The performance prediction method combines deterministic simulations of ship motion with probabilistic modelling of <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> fields.

In order to evaluate the dual-pol data, ice thickness and surface roughness measurements and optical remote sensing data were compared to backscatter signatures observed in the SAR data. The study found that: i) dual-pol data provide improved separation of ice and open water, particularly at steep incidence angles and high wind speeds; ii) the contrast between new, young and first-year (FY) ice types is reduced in the cross-pol channel; and iii) large areas of heavily deformed ice can reliably be separated from level ice in the dual-pol data, but areas of light and moderately <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> cannot be resolved and the thickness of heavily deformed ice cannot be determined. These results are limited to observations of new, young and FY ice types in winter conditions.

40|$|Sea ice deforms under {{convergent}} and shear motion, causing rafting and ridging. This {{results in}} thicker ice {{than could be}} formed by thermodynamic growth only. About two-thirds of the Arctic sea ice volume consists of deformed sea ice. Three different approaches to simulating the formation of pressure ridges in a dynamic-thermodynamic continuum model are considered. They are compared with and evaluated by airborne laser profiles of the sea ice surface roughness. The different ridging schemes are (1) an additional prognostic equation for the deformation energy from which ridge parameters are derived, (2) a redistribution model with two ice categories, level and <b>ridged</b> <b>ice,</b> combined with a Monte Carlo simulation of ridging and (3) additional prognostic equations for ridge density and height resulting {{in the formation of}} <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> volume. The model results show that the ridge density is typically related to the state of ice motion whereas the mean sail height is related to the thickness of the ice involved in the ridging. In general, all of the three models reproduce realistic spatial distributions of ridges. Finally, the second ridging scheme is regarded to be best appropriate for climate modelling while the third scheme has advantages in sea ice forecasting...|$|E
40|$|This work aims to {{increase}} {{our understanding of the}} nature of large scale features of sea ice from a dynamics point of view. Sea ice plays an important part in the exchange of heat and humidity between sea and air and thus is an important component of the climate system. Its physical presence also directly impacts the various forms of life such as diatoms, polar bears and humans alike. The dynamics of sea ice affect both weather and climate, through the large scale drift in the Arctic from the Siberian coast towards Fram Strait, through creation of cracks in the ice called leads or polynyas, and through ridging and other mechanical deformations of ice floes. In this work, we have focused on modelling of <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> for a number of reasons. Direct observations of the internal ice state is very difficult to perform and in general, observations of sea ice are either sparse or of limited information density. <b>Ridged</b> <b>ice</b> can be seen as the memory of high ice stress events, giving us a view on these highly dynamic events. Ridging is of major importance for the ice thickness distribution, as the thickest ice can only be formed through mechanical processes. Further, <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> is of direct interest for anyone conducting shipping through seasonal or perennial ice covered seas as it can form impenetrable barriers or in extreme even cases crush a ship caught within the ice pack. To this end, a multi-category sea ice model, the HELsinki Multi category Ice model (HELMI), was implemented into the Rossby Centre Ocean model (RCO). HELMI has explicit formulations for ridged and rafted ice, as well as sub-grid scale ice thickness distribution (a feature shared with other multi category models) and an ice strength based on energetics. These features give RCO better representation of sub-grid scale physics and gives us the possibility to study the deformed ice in detail. In paper I we look at the change in behaviour in the Arctic as the ice becomes more mobile, leading to a slight increase in modelled <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> volume in the central Arctic, despite a general trend of a decreasing ice cover. Paper II takes us to the Baltic Sea and the possibilities of modelling ridge ice concentration with a statistical model. In Paper III we investigate how the diminishing ice cover in future scenarios affects the biological activity in the Baltic Sea. Finally Paper IV investigates how the ice stress and the internal ice force can be interpreted in terms of ice compression on the ship scale.

40|$|Canadian Hydraulics Centre of National Research Council of Canada (NRC-CHC) in {{collaboration}} with Canadian Ice Service (CIS) of Environment Canada developed an ice forecasting model. Development of this model was initiated to respond to CIS navigation requirements for shipping and navigation in Canadian Arctic. The ice conditions in Canadian Arctic Archipelago are unique due to presence of multi-year ice, ridging, rafting, formation and collapse of ice bridges in the narrow and converging channels, leads opening, and ice pressure build up. Since ice thickness redistribution due to deformation of ice cover is {{an essential component of}} high resolution ice forecasting, a parameterization of all the complex processes must be used in order to account for thickness redistribution and lead openings. The NRC-CHC ice forecasting model deals with these processes through thickness distribution model. That model is {{an important component of the}} ice forecasting model. It accounts for continuous evolution of ice thickness and concentration and for the transfer from level to <b>ridged</b> <b>ice.</b> Convergence and shear deformation of the ice cover are considered to transfer part of the level ice into <b>ridged</b> <b>ice.</b> This report presents validation of the NRC-CHC ice thickness redistribution model with field data.

Increased activities in arctic environments have lead to a demand for knowledge of different ice regimes and their affection on offshore structures and vessels. The purpose of this master thesis {{is to create a}} simulation tool for interaction between an <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> and a marine vessel and to propose a special purpose DP-system for use in arctic environment. The thesis has been divided into two parts. First an <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> model was created in order to realistically simulate an interaction between a marine vessel and an <b>ice</b> <b>ridge.</b> Secondly several DP-tactics for station keeping in arctic environment was proposed and tested against the <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> model. Different theories and calculation methods regarding resistance from an <b>ice</b> <b>ridges</b> have been discussed. An <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> model was proposed and discussed, and a parameter analysis of the <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> model was performed. Ridge size, ridge velocity and vessel dimensions were varied to investigate the total resistance. Simulations showed that that the ice resistance varied with the different parameters. It was shown that increased vessel width will gave an increased bow resistance, while the mid body resistance remained unchanged. Comparison with available literature proposes that the keel and sail contribution of the total resistance is small. Drawbacks with the <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> model have been discussed and further work proposed. An open-water DP-system was created and supplied with different ice breaking features to ensure station-keeping in a ridge-vessel collision. Five different features was described and discussed. Simulations of station keeping have been performed using the <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> model. Simulations of the open-water DP-system were used as a reference and for comparison with the special purpose DP-system. The different ice breaking features were then discussed and compared. The simulation study indicated that the open-water control system may not offer optimal performance when exposed to <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> forces and that a special purpose controller should be considered.

40|$|In the Arctic sea ice grows {{thermodynamically}} {{until an}} equilibrium thickness of 2 - 3 m is reached. This formation of level ice is disturbed by deformation processes, which evolve under convergent and shear conditions of sea ice motion. Rafting and ridging {{of the ice}} cover occur. This builds thicker ice, accounting for {{about two-thirds of the}} Arctic sea ice volume. It is important to describe these dynamical deformation processes in numerical models, which are used to investigate climate change in Arctic and Subarctic regions. Efforts have been made during the last thirty years to implement these deformation processes to numerical models based on very different theories. In this study three different approaches to model a deformed sea ice cover are compared. These approaches include (1) an additional prognostic equation for ice roughness from which ridge parameters are diagnostically derived, applicable to single ice class models, (2) a redistribution model with two ice categories, level and <b>ridged</b> <b>ice,</b> including a statistical derivation of ridge parameters, and (3) a set of prognostic equations for ridge parameters, i. e. ridge density and sail height, from which a <b>ridged</b> <b>ice</b> class is finally derived.

The ridges were initially divided according to age (first year or multi-year), and further sub-divided by location (Beaufort or temperate regions). The cross-sectional profiles for each ridge were digitized and information such as sail area, keel area, ridge width, etc. was extracted and put in tabular form. An analysis of the <b>ice</b> <b>ridge</b> data showed a relationship between keel depth and sail height, and the keel depth and ridge width. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
