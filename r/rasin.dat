40|$|This Bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the problematics of rewards and punishments in {{educational}} process in nursery schools for children with special educational needs. The theoretical part focuses on <b>rasining</b> children, various ways of raising, on education, teaching, personal qualities of teachers and their competences. The following two chapters deal with the rewards, punishments and {{the risks associated with}} them. The next chapter concentrates on preschool children´s development and preschool education as well as the characteristics of nursery schools. Last chapter focuses on children with special educational needs, special needs education and special education consulting. The practical part deals especially with the research results which were gained through the qualitative research, an in-depth interview consisting of eight questions. The questions were answered by six respondents, the pedagogical workers in nursery schools for children with special educational needs in České Budějovice. The aim of this Bachelor´s thesis is to find out which rewards and punishments are used in the educational process in nursery schools for children with special educational needs, what are their effects, how often they are used and the reasons why they are used. The research shows that almost the only and the most used reward is a praise and the most used punishments are mainly an oral rebuke or the restriction of some activities for {{a certain period of time}} until the child realizes their bad behaviour. Children are pleased and are positively motivated when they are praised but soon they forget about it. Rebukes are also not effective from the same reason. However, these are common educational ways used by everybody pedagogical worker all the time. Application of other educational ways of rewards and punishments are very limited in nursery schools and another problem might also be the way of raising the child in the family itself. The children are mostly used to a completely different approach to their behaviour in their family than in the nursery school. The pedagogical workers use the mentioned rewards and punishments in the nursery school daily and most of the teachers regard them as essential. This Bachelor´s thesis might be benefitial for the pedagogical workers who raise and educate children in the nursery schools for children with special educational needs and for students who deal with these issues...|$|R

2500|$|Richard Morse {{describes}} the band's musical style as [...] "Vodou rock and roots". [...] The mizik <b>rasin</b> movement began {{soon after the}} exile of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1987. [...] Under the regimes of Jean-Claude and his father, François Duvalier, the government appropriated for itself {{the authority of the}} Vodou religious traditions and made extensive use of religious leaders and traditions to assert its brutal authority and impose order over the population. [...] When Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country, a widespread dechoukaj uprooted the most oppressive elements of the former regime and liberated the Vodou religion from its entanglements with the government. [...] Unable to do so under the Duvaliers, musicians were eager to adopt traditional Vodou folk music rhythms, lyrics, and instrumentation into a new sound that incorporated elements of rock and roll and American pop music. [...] This style of modern music reaching back to the roots of Vodou tradition came to be called mizik <b>rasin</b> in Creole or musique racine in French.|$|E

2500|$|Haitian music {{combines}} {{a wide range}} of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island. It reflects French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola and minor native Taino influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from Vodou ceremonial traditions, Rara parading music, Twoubadou ballads, Mini-jazz rock bands, <b>Rasin</b> movement, Hip hop Kreyòl, Méringue, and Compas. Youth attend parties at nightclubs called discos, (pronounced [...] "deece-ko"), and attend Bal. This term is the French word for ball, as in a formal dance.|$|E
2500|$|First {{performed}} {{during that}} same Carnival concert in 1992, RAM began regularly playing a song entitled [...] "Fèy", the Creole word for [...] "leaf". [...] The lyrics for the song were of Vodou folkloric origins, adapted to <b>rasin</b> music. [...] Despite no overt references to the political situation, it was widely played {{on the radio and}} immediately taken up throughout the country as an unofficial anthem of support for Aristide. [...] By the summer of 1992, playing or singing the song was banned under military authority, and Morse was subjected to death threats from the regime. [...] In one particular instance, Morse was summoned before Evans François, the brother of Colonel Michel François, who told Morse that any number of assassins would be willing to kill him for as little as fifty cents in payment. [...] Nevertheless, the band continued to play [...] "Fèy" [...] live at their weekly concerts at the Oloffson. [...] The band would later document the François death threat in the mixed-language ballad [...] "Gran Bwa", released in 1997 on their second album, Puritan Vodou.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{times during}} its history, the band has become intimately {{involved}} in Haitian politics. [...] During {{the years of the}} military junta led by Raoul Cédras from 1991 to 1994, provocative music and art thought to have hidden messages of support for Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his political party, Lavalas, frequently met with persecution from the regime. [...] During Carnival in Port-au-Prince in 1992, RAM was ordered by the regime to perform on the Champs du Mars, a large open park {{in the center of the}} city. [...] The regime was determined to have a <b>rasin</b> band playing during Carnival to lend an air of normalcy to the event. [...] Before a crowd of over 10,000 people, the band sang an old folk ballad with the refrain [...] "Kote moun yo? Pa wè moun yo." [...] ("Where are the people? [...] We do not see them.") [...] When they realized the song was a parable about the exiled president-elect Aristide, uniformed soldiers cut off electricity to the stage. [...] The junta hesitated to arrest or physically harm the band, however, as RAM's existence was useful for presenting an appearance of legitimacy to the outside world, and because Morse was a United States citizen.|$|E
