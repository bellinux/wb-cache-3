In this study, we performed a meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of <b>ramosetron</b> versus ondansetron {{in the prevention of}} postoperative nausea and vomiting using the most recently published randomized controlled clinical studies. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of <b>ramosetron</b> and ondansetron. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5. 3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Dichotomous outcomes are presented as the relative risk (RR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 898 patients from nine selected studies were treated with antiemetics after surgery, including 450 patients who received ondansetron 4 mg and 448 patients who received <b>ramosetron</b> 0. 3 mg. The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} with regard to prevention of postoperative nausea (PON) during different time periods in the 48 hours after surgery. When comparing the efficacy of <b>ramosetron</b> and ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative vomiting (POV), at various time intervals in the 24 hours after surgery, <b>ramosetron</b> was significantly more efficient than ondansetron: 0 – 6 hours (RR 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 24 – 0. 92; P= 0. 03), 0 – 24 hours (RR 0. 72, 95 % CI 0. 52 – 1. 00; P= 0. 05), and 6 – 24 hours (RR 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 31 – 0. 84; P= 0. 008). At other time periods between 24 and 48  hours after surgery, <b>ramosetron</b> did not show better efficacy than ondansetron. When comparing the safety profiles of <b>ramosetron</b> and ondansetron, fewer side effects were recorded in the <b>ramosetron</b> group (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 47 – 0. 91; P= 0. 01).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionUp to 75 % of the {{patients}} undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy develop postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Both <b>ramosetron,</b> a serotonin subtype 3 (5 -HT 3) antagonist, and dexamethasone are effective for PONV prophylaxis following laparoscopic cholecystectomy but their combined effect has not been investigated. We investigated the efficacy and tolerance of <b>ramosetron</b> alone and <b>ramosetron</b> with dexamethasone for PONV prophylaxis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MethodsSeventy six patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to receive either intravenous (i. v.) 0. 3  mg <b>ramosetron</b> (group R), or 8  mg dexamethasone plus 0. 3  mg <b>ramosetron</b> (group D). Standardized anesthesia with desflurane and remifentanil was used in all patients. Postoperative nausea, retching, vomiting, rescue antiemetics, pain scores, rescue analgesics and side effects were assessed at 0 – 2, 2 – 24 and 24 – 48  h postoperatively. ResultsSeventy two patients were randomized. The overall incidence of PONV did not differ (p =  0. 31) but fewer patients needed rescue antiemetics in group D than in groups R (3 vs. 13 patients, respectively; p =  0. 01) during 0 – 48  h postoperatively. Additionally, pain scores were significantly lower in group D {{during the study period}} (p <  0. 01) and rescue analgesics were required less often in group D during 2 – 48  h postoperatively (p <  0. 01).

40|$|Postoperative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} is a distressing complication of surgery, and 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists are often prescribed to prevent it. Ondansetron is the agent typically administered to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although <b>ramosetron</b> has a longer duration of action than ondansetron, {{it remains unclear}} whether <b>ramosetron</b> is the more effective medication. We performed an updated meta-analysis on the comparative efficacy of <b>ramosetron</b> and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. We searched six databases for all trials that randomly assigned patients to <b>ramosetron</b> or ondansetron groups. The primary outcome was postoperative nausea or vomiting in the early, late, and next-day periods. The secondary outcomes were side effects of the medications. We used the random-effects model to combine the results. Trial sequential analyses were performed to correct for repetitive testing in the updated meta-analysis. Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials with 3, 811 patients {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. The combined results of <b>ramosetron</b> vs. ondansetron efficacy in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting were as follows: Risk ratio [95 % confidence interval] = 0. 82 [0. 69 - 0. 98] for early postoperative nausea, 0. 76 [0. 65 - 0. 89] for late postoperative nausea, 0. 69 [0. 57 - 0. 84] for next-day postoperative nausea, 0. 78 [0. 63 - 0. 98] for early postoperative vomiting, 0. 57 [0. 45 - 0. 72] for late postoperative vomiting, and 0. 61 [0. 43 - 0. 86] for next-day postoperative vomiting. Dizziness was significantly lower in <b>ramosetron</b> groups than in ondansetron groups (risk ratio [95 % confidence interval] = 0. 81 [0. 66 - 0. 98]). Trial sequential analysis revealed that the results for late postoperative nausea, late postoperative vomiting, and next-day postoperative nausea were conclusive. <b>Ramosetron</b> is more effective in preventing late postoperative nausea, late postoperative vomiting, and next-day postoperative nausea than ondansetron.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Postoperative {{vomiting}} occurs frequently after strabismus {{surgery in}} children. Granisetron, a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3  receptor antagonist, is effective {{for the prevention}} of vomiting following paediatric strabismus surgery. <b>Ramosetron,</b> another new antagonist of 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3  receptor, has more potent and longer acting properties than granisetron against cisplatin induced emesis. This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of granisetron and <b>ramosetron</b> {{for the prevention of}} vomiting following strabismus surgery in children.  METHODS—In a randomised, double blinded manner 80  children, aged 4 - 10 years, received intravenously granisetron 40  µg/kg or <b>ramosetron</b> 6  µg/kg (n= 40 each) at the end of surgery. A standard general anaesthetic technique and postoperative analgesia were used. Emetic episodes and safety assessment were performed during the first 24  hours and the next 24  hours after anaesthesia.  RESULTS—The percentage of patients who were emesis free during 0 - 24 hours after anaesthesia was 85 % with granisetron and 90 % with <b>ramosetron,</b> respectively (p =  0. 369); the corresponding rate during 24 - 48 hours after anaesthesia was 70 % and 95 % (p =  0. 003). No clinically serious adverse events caused by the study drug were observed in any of the groups.  CONCLUSION—Prophylactic antiemetic therapy with <b>ramosetron</b> is comparable with granisetron for the prevention of vomiting during 0 - 24 hours after anaesthesia in children undergoing strabismus surgery. During 24 - 48 hours after anaesthesia, <b>ramosetron</b> is more effective than granisetron for prophylaxis against postoperative vomiting. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{the advent}} of 5 -HT 3 antagonists, control of delayed {{gastrointestinal}} adverse events with cancer chemotherapy is still not optimal. This open label, active controlled, multicentric clinical trial was undertaken to assess the comparative efficacy and safety of <b>ramosetron</b> with ondansetron {{for the prevention of}} acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in adult patients in India. Materials and Methods: Enrolled patients received treatment with <b>ramosetron</b> hydrochloride 0. 1 mg or ondansetron hydrochloride 4 mg tablets once daily in the morning for 5 days starting 1 h before the start of chemotherapy. Severity grades of nausea and vomiting were recorded on a daily basis for a period of 5 days and complete response rate (CRR) and effective rate (ER) were calculated. Clinical adverse events were recorded and hematological and biochemical investigations were performed for safety assessment. Results: A total of 114 patients in <b>ramosetron</b> group and 100 patients in ondansetron group completed the study and were eligible for efficacy and safety analysis. CRR and ERs show that while <b>ramosetron</b> is non-inferior to ondansetron in the control of early nausea and vomiting (occurring during the first 24 h) after the treatment with emetogenic chemotherapy, it is superior to ondansetron in the control of delayed nausea and vomiting (occurring after the first 24 h). The proportion of patients achieving a cumulative complete response (for the entire study period) is significantly greater in <b>ramosetron</b> group as compared to ondansetron group (27. 2 % vs. 7. 0 %; P < 0. 001). <b>Ramosetron</b> was well tolerated by all the study participants.

Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 -HT]) plays important physiological roles in the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle. Intraluminal distension of the intestine is known to stimulate the release of endogenous 5 -HT from enterochromaffin cells, activating 5 -HT 3 receptors located on primary afferent neurons and leading to increases in intestinal secretions and peristaltic activity. <b>Ramosetron,</b> a potent and selective 5 -HT 3 -receptor antagonist, has been in development for use in patients suffering from diarrhea-predominant IBS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 418 patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS-D, once-daily 5 µg and 10 µg doses of <b>ramosetron</b> increased the monthly responder rates of IBS symptoms compared to placebo. In a 12 -week randomized controlled trial of 539 patients, a positive response to treatment was reported by 47 % of a once-daily 5 µg dose of ramosetron-treated individuals compared to 27 % of patients receiving placebo (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, the responder rate was increased in the oral administration of 5 µg of <b>ramosetron</b> for at least 28 weeks (up to 52 weeks), and long-term efficacy for overall improvement of IBS symptoms was also demonstrated. The rate was further increased subsequently. Adverse events were reported by 7 % in <b>ramosetron</b> treatment. No serious adverse events, eg, severe constipation or ischemic colitis, were reported for long-term treatment with <b>ramosetron.</b> In conclusion, further studies to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of <b>ramosetron</b> are warranted {{in the form of}} randomized controlled trials.

Therefore, a combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron is commonly used for middle ear surgery. This study was conducted to compare the combination of ondansetron and dexamethasone with <b>ramosetron</b> for early and late PONV up to 48 h after middle ear surgery. Methods: One hundred and twenty adults scheduled for middle ear surgery were allocated to receive either dexamethasone 8 mg and ondansetron 4 mg (n= 60) or <b>ramosetron</b> 0. 3 mg (n= 60). General anesthesia with inhalation agents was used for all the patients. The incidence and severity of PONV, administration of rescue antiemetic, and the side effects of the antiemetic were documented during the first 48 h after surgery. Results: The incidence of nausea was significantly lower in the dexamethasone and ondansetron group compared to the <b>ramosetron</b> group between 2 and 24 h.

40|$|Background & AimsRamosetron, a {{serotonin}} (5 -hydroxytryptamine) - 3 receptor antagonist {{with high}} selectivity, reduced stress-induced diarrhea and defecation caused by corticotropin-releasing hormone in rats. However, {{there have been}} no clinical trials of its effect in patients with diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether <b>ramosetron</b> reduces diarrhea in these patients. MethodsOur study included 296 male outpatients with IBS-D treated at 52 centers in Japan. Patients were given 5 μg oral <b>ramosetron</b> (n = 147) or placebo (n = 149) once daily for 12 weeks after a 1 -week baseline period. The primary end point was increased stool consistency in the first month. Secondary end points included relief of overall IBS symptoms and increased IBS-related quality of life. ResultsMore patients given <b>ramosetron</b> (74, 50. 3 %) than those given placebo (29, 19. 6 %) reported improved stool consistency in the first month (P <. 001).

40|$|AbstractBackground: Thyroidectomy is {{associated}} with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), ranging from 51 % to 76 %. Because these symptoms are distressing for patients, prophylactic medication to avoid or reduce PONV is recommended. Objective: The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the efficacy of <b>ramosetron,</b> dexamethasone, and a combination of <b>ramosetron</b> and dexamethasone in preventing PONV in Korean women undergoing thyroidectomy. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, consecutive adult female patients who were scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy under general anesthesia at the Kyungpook National University Hospital (Daegu, Korea) were randomly assigned to receive <b>ramosetron</b> 0. 3 mg alone, dexamethasone 8 mg alone, or a combination of <b>ramosetron</b> 0. 3 mg and dexamethasone 8 mg administered intravenously as a single dose immediately after induction of anesthesia. The primary end point of this study was the total PONV rate up to 24 hours postanesthesia. The secondary end points were the incidence of nausea, incidence of vomiting, severity of nausea (0 = no nausea to 10 = nausea as bad as it could be), use of rescue antiemetic drugs, and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) determined through interview or spontaneous patient report for 24 hours postanesthesia. Results: A total of 198 female patients were approached for study inclusion, 18 of whom were excluded. Therefore, 180 Korean women (mean [SD] age, 46. 5 [12. 6] years; height, 159. 8 [2. 7] cm; weight, 53. 2 [3. 6] kg) were enrolled and completed the study. The total PONV rates up to 24 hours postanesthesia were 35 %, 13 %, and 10 % in the dexamethasone, <b>ramosetron,</b> and combination groups, respectively. The PONV rate was significantly lower in the combination group than in the dexamethasone alone group (P = 0. 006). The PONV rate was not significantly different in the combination group compared with the <b>ramosetron</b> alone group. The PONV rate in the dexamethasone alone group was significantly higher than that in the <b>ramosetron</b> alone group (P = 0. 03). The severity of nausea (median [25 th– 75 th percentiles], 0 [0 - 0] vs 0 [0 – 4]; P = 0. 009) and rate of use of rescue antiemetic drugs (5 % vs 27 %; P = 0. 006) were significantly lower in the combination group than in the dexamethasone alone group, whereas the severity of nausea (median [25 th– 75 th percentiles], 0 [0 - 0] vs 0 [0 - 0]) and rate of use of rescue antiemetic drugs (5 % vs 7 %) were not significantly different between the combination and <b>ramosetron</b> alone groups. The severity of nausea (median [25 th– 75 th percentiles], 0 [0 – 4] vs 0 [0 - 0]; P = 0. 033) and the rate of use of rescue antiemetic drugs (27 % vs 7 %; P = 0. 018) were significantly higher in the dexamethasone alone group than in the <b>ramosetron</b> alone group. The rates of AEs (headache: 15 %, 20 %, and 18 %; dizziness: 18 %, 22 %, and 15 %) were not significantly different in the dexamethasone alone, <b>ramosetron</b> alone, or combination groups, respectively.

This study was conducted to evaluate the antiemetic efficacy of <b>ramosetron</b> in comparison with ondansetron in patients at a high risk of PONV. Methods: This was a prospective randomised double-blind study carried out over a 6 -month period in which 206 patients with at least two risk factors for PONV were randomised to receive <b>ramosetron</b> 0. 3 mg or ondansetron 8 mg, 30 min before the end of surgery. The incidence of PONV, severity of nausea and need for rescue antiemetic were recorded over the next 24 h. Primary outcome was the incidence of PONV. Secondary outcomes included severity of nausea and need for rescue. The data were analysed using the Predictive Analytics Software (PASW, version 18 : Chicago, IL, USA).

40|$|Background: Postoperative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (PONV) {{is a common}} complication after anesthesia and surgery; 5 -hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5 -HT 3) receptor antagonists have been considered as a first-line therapy. <b>Ramosetron</b> and palonosetron are more recently developed drugs and have greater receptor affinity and a longer elimination half-life compared with older 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine which drug is more effective for preventing PONV between <b>ramosetron</b> and palonosetron. Methods: We enrolled 100 patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery into this study. The subjects were divided into <b>ramosetron</b> group and palonosetron group. The medications were provided immediately before the induction of anesthesia. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting, severity of nausea according to a visual analogue scale, and rescue anti-emetic drug use were monitored immediately after the end of surgery and at 0 - 6 h, 6 - 24 h, and 24 - 48 h post-surgery. Results: The incidence of vomiting was significantly lower in the palonosetron group than in the <b>ramosetron</b> group during 0 - 6 h (6 % vs 26 %, P = 0. 012) and 0 - 48 h (14 % vs 34 %, P = 0. 034). The incidence of nausea and overall PONV, and the use of rescue antiemetic were not significantly different during all time intervals. The severity of nausea was not different between the two groups. Conclusions: In conclusion, the incidence of PONV between the <b>ramosetron</b> and the palonosetron group have not shown the difference during 0 - 48 h, although palonosetron results in a lower incidence of vomiting during 0 - 6 h post-surgery.

The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using RINVR were evaluated. Results. Seventeen, 15, and 18 patients received <b>ramosetron</b> at doses of 0. 3 [*]mg, 0. 45 [*]mg, and 0. 6 [*]mg, respectively. Tmax (h), Cmax (ng/mL), and AUClast (ng·h/mL) were associated with dose escalation significantly, showing a reverse correlation with the RINVR during chemotherapy. Acute CINV was observed in four patients (22. 2 %), two patients (14. 3 %), and one (5. 6 %) patient and a delayed CINV on day 7 was found in eight (47 %), three (21. 4 %), and five (27. 8 %) patients in each group.

40|$|Background: Post-operative {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} {{is one of}} the most common and distressing complications after anesthesia and surgery. It may lead to serious post-operative complications. <b>Ramosetron</b> is a newer 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist and has more potent and longer duration of antiemetic effects compared to first generation 5 HT 3 receptor antagonists. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of <b>Ramosetron</b> for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting with that of Ondansetron in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries under general anesthesia. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind study, 60 patients, 18 - 60 years of both genders falling under ASA I-II category scheduled for abdominal surgery were included. Group I received I. V <b>ramosetron</b> 0. 3 mg while group II received I. V Ondansetron 4 mg at the time of extubation. The standard general anesthetic technique was used throughout. Postoperatively the incidences of nausea, vomiting, and safety assessments were performed at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h during the first 24 h after surgery. Results: There were no differences between groups with respect to patient demographics. The percentage of patients who had complete response (no PONV, and no need for another rescue antiemetic) from 0 to 24 h after anesthesia was 56 % with <b>ramosetron</b> and 33 % with ondansetron. The corresponding rates at 1, 2, 6, and 24 h after anesthesia were 76 % and 63 %, 76 % and 50 %, 100 and 83 %, 100 and 93 %, respectively. Safety profiles of the two drugs were comparable, as no clinically serious adverse effects caused by study drugs were observed in either of the groups.

To identify biomarkers predicting effectiveness of the 5 ‐ HT 3 R antagonist (<b>ramosetron)</b> in IBS ‐D. Methods Irritable bowel syndrome‐D Japanese subjects received 2. 5 or 5   μ g of <b>ramosetron</b> once daily for 4  weeks. Colonic mucosal S 100 A and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) mRNA expression levels were measured before treatment. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and polymorphisms of TPH 1 and TPH 2 were analyzed. Key Results Forty‐two patients (27 men and 15 women, mean age 42  years) with IBS ‐D were included for analysis. Improvement of IBS symptoms was seen in 26 (61. 9 %). Baseline S 100 A 10 (p  =  0. 02) and TPH 1 (p  =  0. 02) expression were significantly higher in the <b>ramosetron</b> responders than in the non‐responders. The frequencies of the TPH 1 rs 4537731 G allele in linkage disequilibrium with the TPH 1 rs 7130929 T allele (11. 5 % vs 50 %, p  =  0. 003; OR : 12; 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 69) along with TPH 1 rs 211105 C allele (3. 8 % vs 43. 8 %, p  =  0. 0003; OR : 19; 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 181) were significantly lower in the responders than in the non‐responders. The mean scores of diarrhea at baseline were significantly higher (5. 2 vs 3. 7, p  =  0. 005) in patients with TPH 1 rs 211105 T/T than those with the G allele. Conclusions & Inferences TPH 1 gene polymorphisms and S 100 A 10 expression, which correlate with 5 ‐ HT signaling were associated with <b>ramosetron</b> effectiveness in IBS ‐D, and may possibly lead to prospective identification of the resistance to treatment.

Recent studies have suggested that the motility disorder, especially spastic hypermotility, seen in the neorectum following sphincter-preserving operations for rectal cancer may be the basis of the postoperative defecatory malfunction seen in these patients. We investigated the efficacy of 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists in patients suffering from severe low anterior resection syndrome. Patients and methods: A total of 25 male patients with complaints of uncontrollable urgency or fecal incontinence following sphincter-preserving operations were enrolled in this study. Defecatory status, assessed on the basis of incontinence score (0 – 20), urgency grade (0 – 3), and number of toilet visits per day, was evaluated using a questionnaire before and 1 month after the administration of the 5 -HT 3 antagonist <b>ramosetron.</b> Results: All the parameters assessed improved significantly after taking <b>ramosetron</b> for 1 month. The effect was more prominent in cases whose anastomotic line was lower, ie, inside the anal canal. Defecatory function was better in patients who commenced <b>ramosetron</b> therapy within 6 months postoperatively, as compared to those who were not prescribed <b>ramosetron</b> for more than 7 months postoperatively.
