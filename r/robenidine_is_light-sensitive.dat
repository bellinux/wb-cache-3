40|$|Tests for {{resistance}} to a recently introduced anticoccidial drug, <b>robenidine,</b> <b>were</b> performed on {{a strain of}} Eimeria tenella recovered from broiler chickens infected with acute cecal coccidiosis. The strain was identified previously and again confirmed by the timing of mortality of the infected chickens (five to six days postinfection), the appearance of lesions and parasites in ceca only, and the measurements (21. 6 +/- 1. 9 micron X 19. 8 +/- 2. 4 micron) of the oocysts. The tests showed that the strain of E. tenella could establish infections in chickens medicated with fourfold the recommended level of robenidine in feed but no oocysts could be recovered from the feces of infected chickens when the level of drug was increased to eightfold. The decrease in mortality, in the severity of lesions and oocyst output {{and the increase in}} the average weight gain of infected chickens followed closely the increase in the level of robenidine in feed. In contrast, no infections were found in chickens infected with a sensitive strain of E. tenella and maintained on feed mixed with the recommended level of robenidine. This and other findings discussed here show that resistance to <b>robenidine</b> <b>is</b> developing in coccidia commonly found in broiler houses...|$|R

50|$|In {{more recent}} years, Rosbash {{has been working}} on the brain-neuronal aspects of {{circadian}} rhythms. Seven anatomically distinct neuronal groups have been identified that all express the core clock genes. However, the mRNAs appear to be expressed in a circadian and neuron-specific manner, which his lab has taken interest in determining whether this provides a link to the distinct functions of certain neuronal groups. He has also research the effects of light on certain neuronal groups and has found that one subgroup <b>is</b> <b>light-sensitive</b> to lights on (dawn) and another <b>is</b> <b>light-sensitive</b> to lights off (dusk). The dawn cells have been shown to promote arousal while the dusk cells promote sleep.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of diclazuril in growing rabbits was investigated under experimental and field conditions. In a first experimental trial, the susceptibility of recent isolated French Eimeria field strains to in-feed use of diclazuril, salinomycin and <b>robenidine</b> <b>was</b> studied in fattening rabbits. Rabbits were challenged {{at the age}} of 31 d with a mixed inoculum of Eimeria magna, E. media and E. perforans. Production data and oocyst excretion were compared with an infected-untreated control group and an uninfected-untreated control group. Infection resulted in significantly lower production data and higher oocyst excretion in the infected-untreated control group. Salinomycin and diclazuril treated rabbits were able to control the infection, demonstrated also by comparable weight gain and final weight to those of the uninfected-untreated control rabbits and significantly higher than those of the infected-untreated control rabbits. Based on the production data and oocyst excretion, <b>robenidine</b> <b>was</b> not able to control the infection adequately. Economic performance (weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion) and oocyst excretion were significantly worse than in the uninfected-untreated controls. In a second trial, a 1 yr longitudinal study was carried out in Italy to evaluate the excretion of coccidia in growing rabbits from 8 meat farms applying a 2 -phase anticoccidial programme (diclazuril and robenidine). Parasitological parameters (oocyst counts and species identification) were measured monthly. Seven of the 11 known coccidial rabbit species were identified. Variable levels of oocysts per gram were detected in the farms, but on all farms lower oocyst per gram and a reduced number of Eimeria spp. in rabbit faeces were recorded in the 8 -mo treatment period with diclazuril. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The nervous tunic (or retina) {{is made up}} {{of cells}} which are {{extensions}} of the brain, coming off the optic nerve. These receptors <b>are</b> <b>light-sensitive,</b> and include cones, which <b>are</b> less <b>light-sensitive,</b> but allow the eye to see color and provide visual acuity, and rod cells, which <b>are</b> more <b>light-sensitive,</b> providing night vision, but only seeing light and dark differences. Since only two-thirds of the eye can receive light, the receptor cells do not need to cover the entire interior of the eye, and line only the area from pupil to the optic disk. The part of the retina covered by <b>light-sensitive</b> cells <b>is</b> therefore termed the pars-optica retinae, and the blind part of the eye is termed the pars-ceaca retinae. The optic disk of the eye, however, does not contain any of these light-sensitive cells, as it is where the optic nerve leaves to the brain, so is a blind spot within the eye.|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} survey was undertaken, {{of the effects}} of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide (in the presence of 20 per cent oxygen), in darkness and light, on the relative rates of respiration, mitosis, and interphase in pea root tips. The inhibition of respiration by carbon monoxide <b>was</b> <b>light-sensitive,</b> but the inhibition by hydrogen cyanide was light-stable. The inhibitions were presumably due to combination of the inhibitor with the iron of cytochrome oxidase, in its divalent and trivalent forms respectively. In contrast, the inhibitions of mitosis by both poisons proved to <b>be</b> <b>light-sensitive.</b> The light-sensitive inhibition of mitosis by carbon monoxide shows that an iron complex is responsible for the process. That the inhibition of mitosis by hydrogen cyanide is also light-reversible shows that, in contrast with cytochrome oxidase, the mitotic iron complex remains always in the divalent state. The relative affinities of the mitotic ferrous complex, in molar units, were 0. 68 for CO/O 2, and 0. 37 for HCN/O 2. The properties of the complex are analogous to, yet distinct from, Gastrophilus haemoglobin and reduced cytochrome oxidase.

25|$|A {{phototransistor}} <b>is</b> a <b>light-sensitive</b> transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, <b>are</b> <b>light-sensitive</b> field-effect transistors.
