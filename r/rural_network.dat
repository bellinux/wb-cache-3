2500|$|Very {{little is}} known about the early life of Eugene Sharrer, except that he was by origin a German from Hamburg and claimed to be a British subject by naturalisation. He was {{described}} as of Jewish appearance, if not of Jewish origin, by a colonial official and became an archetypal colonial outsider, financially successful but disliked by officials because of his national and ethnic origins. He arrived in what is today Malawi in 1888, before the country had become a British protectorate, with a consignment of trade goods and he initially joined forces with John Buchanan who had been trading there since 1881, but soon started trading on his own account. Sharrer was involved in the trade in ivory, until 1893 the main export product of the area, and from this trading venture there developed the wholesale and retail Kubula Stores Ltd. When the ivory trade declined as the elephants were killed off, he diversified, acquiring considerable landholdings and building up a successful transport and agricultural concern. Kubula Stores Ltd failed to compete with the <b>rural</b> <b>network</b> of [...] "Mandala" [...] village stores of the African Lakes Company and was sold to this rival in the 1920s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Rural</b> health <b>networks</b> are a {{potential}} way for rural {{health care systems}} to improve access to care, reduce costs, and enhance quality of care. Networks pro-vide a means for rural providers to contract with managed care organizations, develop their own managed care entities, share resources, and structure practice opportunities to support recruitment and retention of rural physicians {{and other health care}} professionals. The results of early network development initiatives indi-cate a need for state officials and others interested in encouraging network develop-ment to agree on common <b>rural</b> health <b>network</b> definitions, to identify clearly the goals of network development programs, and to document and analyze program out-comes. Future network development efforts need to be much more comprehensive if they are to {{have a significant impact on}} rural health care. This article analyzes pub-lic policy issues related to integrated <b>rural</b> health <b>network</b> development, discusses current efforts to encourage <b>network</b> development in <b>rural</b> areas, and suggests actions that states may take if they desire to support <b>rural</b> health <b>network</b> development. These actions include adopting a formal <b>rural</b> health <b>network</b> definition, providing network...|$|R

50|$|A {{combination}} of the increasing road competition facing all railways and a change in patterns of economic activity caused by the partition of Ireland reduced the GNRI's prosperity.

In Dundalk at the GNR Works the railway engineers developed railbuses for use on sections of the <b>rural</b> <b>network.</b> Nevertheless, by the 1950s the GNRI had ceased to be profitable and in 1953 the company was jointly nationalised by the governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
