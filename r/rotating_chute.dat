40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{model of}} spherical glass particles flowing down a <b>rotating</b> <b>chute</b> is validated against high quality experimental data. The simulations are {{performed in a}} corotating frame of reference, taking into account Coriolis and centrifugal forces. In view of future extensions aimed at segregation studies of polydisperse granular flows, several validation steps are required. In particular, {{the influence of the}} interstitial gas, a sensitivity study of the collision parameters, and the effect of system rotation on particle flow is investigated. Shirsath et al. have provided the benchmark laboratory measurements of bed height and surface velocities of monodisperse granular flow down an inclined <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> With a proper choice of the friction coefficients, the simulations show very good agreement with our experimental results. The effect of interstitial gas on the flow behavior is found to be relatively small for 3 -mm granular particles...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{particle}} tracking velocimetry (3 D-PTV) is {{a promising}} technique {{to study the}} behavior of granular flows. The aim {{of this paper is}} to cross-validate 3 D-PTV against independent or more established techniques, such as particle image velocimetry (PIV), electronic ultrasonic sensor measurements for bed height, and the discrete element model (DEM), for the complicating circumstance in which granular particles are flowing down a <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> 3 D-PTV was used to gain access to Lagrangian trajectory data of surface particles in such flows, from which independent measurements of both the surface velocity and the bed height in the chute were derived. The 3 D-PTV method was based on imaging and tracking colored tracer particles that were introduced in the granular material, which are viewed from three directions. The three cameras collected consecutive frames a known time interval apart and the PTV algorithm for locating and tracking particles was used to determine particle trajectories and velocities. We found that the 3 D-PTV results are in good agreement with PIV results with regard to the streamwise and spanwise surface velocity of particles in the <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> The particle bed height obtained from 3 D-PTV was also found to be in good agreement with data from an ultrasonic bed-height sensor. The experimental findings from PTV for the non-rotating case were used to tune the friction coefficient in our DEM simulations. The simulation method was validated by the good agreement between experimental findings and simulations at all rotation rates studied...|$|E

A crossed tracked vehicle is proposed to overcome the problem of possible overturning The vehicle {{is equipped with a}} frontal TV camera and communicates with its off-board control, placed outside the vessel, by means of an umbilical cord which includes signal and power cables and can be used to recover the vehicle in case of failure. Since the inspection will be performed without venting the vessel, all components must be compatible with UHV condition. An insertion system made up of two telescopic elements and a <b>rotating</b> <b>chute</b> was also designed to introduce the vehicle into the vessel in safe condition...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{behavior}} of spherical particles flowing down a three-dimensional chute, inclined at fixed angle, is commonly simulated by a discrete element method (DEM). DEM is nowadays a standard tool for numerical studies of e. g. gas-solid fluidized beds. We have modified DEM for the simulation of rotating granular flows. In view of future extensions aimed at, for example, segregation studies of (rotating) bi- and polydisperse granular flows or mixtures of {{two kinds of}} granular particles with different densities, several validation steps are required. In a first step we compare DEM simulations with experiments of monodisperse spherical glass particles flowing through a <b>rotating</b> semi-cylindrical <b>chute</b> inclined at a fixed angle and constant flow rate. Different measurement techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry and Particle Tracking Velocimetry are {{used to measure the}} averaged surface velocity of the particles and the bed height in the chute. We observe that the prevailing flow patterns depend strongly on the rotation rate of the chute. The streamwise and the spanwise particle velocities are influenced by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces, where with increasing rotation rate the particles are moving increasingly sideways. We find that the details of the particle feeding pattern are important only for the particle flow near the entrance of the chute, whereas after a relatively short distance the particle flow depends only on other factors such as the mass rate, inclination angle and rotation rate. Our DEM model predictions agree well with the experimental measurements for bed height and surface velocity...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow and}} {{transport}} of granular media {{have been of}} major importance in commerce and industry for a long time; materials such as coal, ore, cement, grain, soap granules, sugar, sand, gravel, etc., flow in hoppers, bins, <b>chutes,</b> <b>rotating</b> drums, and moving bands. The desire to improve such transportation equipment and to reduce the energy expenditure has motivated interest in understanding the fluid mechanics of such bulk flows (Wieghardt [25] 1). Though transport, heat transfer, and other processes are often effected by fluidization we are concerned here with those situations in which the flow takes place with direct physical contact between the grains. Indeed the simplest situation is that in which the interstitial fluid (usually air) has a negligible effect on the equations of motion. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a comparison of experimental data and analysis for the flow of dry granular media through a two-dimensional or wedge-shaped hopper. It will be seen that the analytical solution which begins with the constitutive postulates suggested by Jenike and Shield [9] of (i) intergrain Coulomb friction and (ii) isotropy produces results which are in good agreement with the experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the iron}} making industry, the blast furnace {{is charged with}} coke and ore (metallic) {{particles}} {{by means of an}} inclined <b>chute</b> <b>rotating</b> about its vertical axis. For each rotation, the particles fall on the sloping burden and form a circular ring. Charging of this metallic ore burden over the layer of coke causes a portion of the coke layer to get dislodged from its original position. This phenomenon is known as coke collapse. We have studied these phenomena in a quasi two dimensional rectangular bin on a smaller scale. In-order to get the desired density difference between the pouring media, stainless-steel balls (representing the ore) and glass- beads (representing the coke) are used as the model granular materials. The parameters varied in the experiments are the volume of pouring and the size of particles (steel balls). Varying quantities of these particles are poured into the experimental unit and the resulting pattern thus formed is then captured using a Nikon-DX camera. The images are analyzed using computer code to determine the position of each particle (steel ball and glass bead). The results presented here are in terms of concentration of steel balls by making bins of 5 x 5 mm in size. The interface (stock line) between the steel balls and the glass beads has been analyzed separately and plotted for all data sets. Each experiment has been repeated three times in-order to get an average data...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} element model (DEM) is used {{to investigate}} the behavior of spherical particles flowing down a semicylindrical <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> The DEM simulations are validated by comparing with particle tracking velocimetry results of spherical glass particles flowing through a smooth semicylindrical chute at different rotation rates of the chute. The DEM model predictions agree well with experimental results of surface velocity and particle bed height evolution. The validated DEM model {{is used to}} investigate the influence of chute roughness on the flow behavior of monodisperse granular particles in rotating chutes. To emulate different base roughnesses, a rough base is constructed out of a square close packing of fixed spherical particles with a diameter equal to, smaller, or larger than the flowing particles. Finally, the DEM model is used to study segregation in a binary density mixture for different degrees of roughness of the chute...|$|E
40|$|In blast furnaces, {{particles}} like coke, sinter and pellets enter from {{a hopper}} and are distributed on the burden surface by a <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> Such particulate flows suffer occasionally from chocking and particle segregation at bottlenecks, which hinders efficient throughflow. To {{get a more}} fundamental insight into these effects, we started a combined experimental and numerical program to investigate such particulate flows. For this purpose we employ discrete particle model simulations of granular monodisperse and bidisperse particles flowing down inclined rotating chutes. In these simulations, non-inertial effects due to rotation are implemented through Coriolis and centrifugal forces. A rolling resistance model is also implemented to study {{the effect of a}} non-spherical shape of the particle. In addition, a granular chute flow set-up has been constructed for experimental validation of the model. Different measurement techniques will be used to measure the solid fraction, particle velocity, granular temperature and bed height in the chute, which are compared with the results from discrete particle model simulations. The influence of polydispersity, non-uniformity of particles, rotation speed and angle of inclination of the chute will bestudied. Here we present results obtained from preliminary simulations for the averaged particle velocity, bed height and granular temperature along the length of chute for different rotation speeds. We find an interesting interplay between the Coriolis force, which pushes the granular flow to the sidewall of the chute and decelerate the flow, and centrifugal forces that accelerate the flow...|$|E
40|$|In blast furnaces, {{particles}} like coke, sinter and pellets enter from {{a hopper}} and are distributed on the burden surface by a <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> Such particulate flows suffer occasionally from particle segregation during transportation caused by differences in density or size. To {{get a more}} fundamental insight into these effects, we started an experimental study to investigate the effect of rotation on such particulate flows. Here, as a first step, we present an experimental study of granular flow of monodisperse 3 mm spherical glass particles flowing with a constant mass rate through a rotating smooth rectangular chute, which is inclined at a fixed angle. Experiments are performed for a sufficiently long time to study steady (but streamwise accelerating) flow. Particle image velocimetry (PIV), electronic ultrasonic height sensors, and a dynamic weighing scale are {{used to measure the}} surface velocity of the particle stream, the particle bed height and mass flow rate in the chute, respectively. The influence of rotation speed and angle of inclination of the chute is studied. We find an interesting interplay between the Coriolis force, which pushes the granular flow to the sidewall of the chute and tends to diminish the acceleration of the flow, and centrifugal forces that accelerate the flow. The velocity components display a complex dependence on the spanwise and streamwise position in the chute. The bed height in the chute is also influenced by these effects of system rotation. These measurements provide a well-defined set of observations for refining and validating computer simulations of granular flows, and point out some important limitations of physical experiments. We present preliminary three-dimensional discrete particle simulations, which show that the experimental measurements of bed height and surface particle velocity in a chute inclined at 30 ° can be predicted nearly quantitatively both without and with rotation of the chute...|$|E
40|$|Segregation is a {{major problem}} for many solids {{processing}} industries. Differences in particle size or density can lead to flow-induced segregation. In the present work, we employ the discrete element method (DEM) – one type of particle dynamics (PD) technique – to investigate the mixing and segregation of granular material in some prototypical solid handling devices, such as a <b>rotating</b> drum and <b>chute.</b> In DEM, one calculates the trajectories of individual particles based on Newton’s laws of motion by employing suitable contact force models and a collision detection algorithm. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} segregation in particle mixers can be thwarted if the particle flow is inverted at a rate above a critical forcing frequency. Further, it has been hypothesized that, for a rotating drum, the effectiveness of this technique can be linked to the probability distribution of the number of times a particle passes through the flowing layer per rotation of the drum. In the first portion of this work, various configurations of solid mixers are numerically and experimentally studied to investigate the conditions for improved mixing in light of these hypotheses. Besides rotating drums, many studies of granular flow have focused on gravity driven chute flows owing to its practical importance in granular transportation and to the fact that the relative simplicity of this type of flow allows for development and testing of new theories. In this part of the work, we observe the deposition behavior of both mono-sized and polydisperse dry granular materials in an inclined chute flow. The effects of different parameters such as chute angle, particle size, falling height and charge amount on the mass fraction distribution of granular materials after deposition are investigated. The simulation results obtained using DEM are compared with the experimental findings and a high degree of agreement is observed. Tuning of the underlying contact force parameters allows the achievement of realistic results and is used as a means of validating the model against available experimental data. The tuned model is then used to find the critical chute length for segregation based on the hypothesis that segregation can be thwarted if the particle flow is inverted at a rate above a critical forcing frequency. The critical frequency, fcrit, is inversely proportional to the characteristic time of segregation, ts. Mixing is observed instead of segregation when the chute length L < Uavg*ts, where Uavg denotes the average stream-wise flow velocity of the particles. While segregation is often an undesired effect, sometimes separating the components of a particle mixture is the ultimate goal. Rate-based separation processes hold promise as both more environmentally benign as well as less energy intensive when compared to conventional particle separations technologies such as vibrating screens or flotation methods. This approach is based on differences in the kinetic properties of the components of a mixture, such as the velocity of migration or diffusivity. In this portion of the work, two examples of novel rate-based separation devices are demonstrated. The first example involves the study of the dynamics of gravity-driven particles through an array of obstacles. Both discrete element (DEM) simulations and experiments are used to augment the understanding of this device. Dissipative collisions (both between the particles themselves and with the obstacles) give rise to a diffusive motion of particles perpendicular to the flow direction and the differences in diffusion lengths are exploited to separate the particles. The second example employs DEM to analyze a ratchet mechanism where a current of particles can be produced in a direction perpendicular to the energy input. In this setup, a vibrating saw-toothed base is employed to induce different mobility for different types of particles. The effect of operating conditions and design parameters on the separation efficiency are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{ironmaking}} {{process in}} blast furnace is complicated, and coupled with multiphase flow, chemical reaction and heat transfer, which make {{it one of}} the most complicated systems in industry. The process of ironmaking is very difficult to control but only few approaches are available, for example, improve the quality of the raw material, optimize burden distribution, and maximize coal combustion. The burden distribution significantly affects the blast furnace operation efficiency. The void fraction, gas flow distribution and burden descending behaviour depend on the burden distribution. Thus, understanding blast furnace burden distribution is very important for blast furnace operation. In most previous numerical studies, particle shape is not considered. Hence, in the first component, a discrete element method (DEM) based framework is established, aiming to bridge particle shape gap between simulation and practice. Spherical particle surface properties are adjusted by angle of repose to make spheres behave as non-spherical particles in practice. Then experimental results are used to validate DEM in the present study, showing a good agreement. Then variables related to burden distribution are investigated, such as particle surface properties, chute angles and discharge rate. Chute wear prediction has always been a problem for blast furnace schedule maintenance. In the second part, chute flow is analyzed in great details, and the microscopic information is generated to get better understanding of chute flow and thus used to predict the wear issue for <b>rotating</b> <b>chute.</b> Then size segregation phenomenon is also studied for both chute flow and in burden profiles. And finally, a practice case is simulated to further prove the capability of present DEM model, indicating DEM is capable to use for practice application. The purpose of taking control of burden distribution is taking control of the gas distribution in blast furnace thus can obtain smooth operation. In the third part, practice cases are simulated and analyzed. A thin sector frame is introduced to reduce total particle number in the system thus multi-layer burden profiles are studied, showing burden profile keeping changing in the charging process. Gas flow is simulated by coupling DEM with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and its distribution for different burden profiles are analyzed qualitatively. Hopper is the essential feeding mechanic for blast furnace, thus fundamental study is required in this area. In the fourth part, ellipsoidal particles are simulated in a rectangular hopper to study hopper flow phenomenon. The focus is particle shape effect on wall stress, meanwhile flow patterns and discharge rate have also been studied. The results indicate that particle shape changes the internal properties thus bulk material properties hence make impact on wall stress. The particles discharged from hopper can naturally form a pile, and the particle shape effect on angle of repose and force distributions are investigated. Furthermore, varies factors’ effects on stress dip phenomenon have been investigated...|$|E
