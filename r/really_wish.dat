500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have no apologies for it, but I <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> we hadn't found it necessary and I wish there were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am not so sure. You shoot {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} pure keeping ability, Berry was rated {{extremely}} highly, particularly his ability [...] "keeping up" [...] both to leg-spinner Shane Warne and to medium (and even fast-medium) paced bowlers. Warne, his Victorian teammate, said that [...] "Darren Berry {{up to the}} stumps has probably been the best keeper that I've {{ever seen in my}} time... I <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> he did get the opportunity to show how good a keeper he was, with a baggy green cap playing for Australia." [...] Berry has often talked about his leg-side stumping off the bowling of paceman Paul Reiffel as one of his best achievements.|$|E

2500|$|Allen {{was said}} to be {{sensitive}} about having one green eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of The Burns & Allen Show in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did to please him, in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, [...] "You know, I <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> George would cheat on me again. I could use a new centerpiece." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few human creatures would {{consent to}} be changed {{into any of the}} lower animals, for a promise of the fullest {{allowance}} of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs… [...] A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence… It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question… ...|$|E
2500|$|Maroney and Wieber were {{credited}} {{for changing}} the team's nickname from the [...] "Fab Five" [...] to the [...] "Fierce Five" [...] {{a few days before}} their gold medal win at the Olympics. [...] "I guess (Fab Five) was taken by some basketball team or something," [...] Maroney said, referring to the five members of the Michigan college basketball team recruited in 1991. Jalen Rose, a former Michigan Fab Five member, complained about the gymnastics team being dubbed the Fab Five as well. [...] "To use the nickname just points and screams of lazy journalism by the national media, that's really what it is," [...] Rose said. [...] "It's no fault at all of the young gymnasts. But I <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> they would have come up with an even more creative tag for them and their gold medal pursuit." [...] Maroney and Wieber decided for that reason to [...] "come up with an even more creative" [...] name while on the bus to a training session. They reportedly started searching on their phones for words that started with F that described the team. The top choices were feisty and fierce. Maroney and Wieber opted for [...] "fierce", as they said it described their floor routines, {{and the rest of the}} team concurred. Maroney also stated, [...] "There have been Fab Fives in the past but I like Fierce Five because we are definitely the fiercest team out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1763 to 1765, Hume {{was invited}} to attend Lord Hertford in Paris, where he became {{secretary}} to the British embassy. Hume was well received in Paris, and while there he met with Isaac de Pinto In 1766, Hume left Paris to accompany Jean-Jacques Rousseau to England. [...] Once in England, Hume and Rousseau fell out. Hume was sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau (who is generally believed to have suffered from paranoia) to have authored {{an account of the}} dispute, which he titled, appropriately enough [...] "A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau." [...] In 1765, he served as British Chargé d'affaires, writing [...] "despatches to the British Secretary of State". He wrote of his Paris life, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>wish</b> often for the plain roughness of The Poker Club of Edinburgh... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness". In 1766, upon returning to Britain, Hume encouraged Lord Hertford to invest in a number of slave plantations, acquired by George Colebrooke and others in the Windward Islands. In 1767, Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here he wrote that he was given [...] "all the secrets of the Kingdom". In 1769 he returned to James' Court in Edinburgh, and then lived, from 1771 until his death in 1776, at the southwest corner of St. Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's New Town, at what is now 21 Saint David Street. A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence, suggests the street may have been named after Hume.|$|E
