5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{in the face}} of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976. While the <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{slightly}} {{better in the}} 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won {{more than two-thirds of}} the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.|$|E
5|$|The Radical <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{create some}} {{improvement}} within the state. Levees were constructed and railroads were built. Also, Arkansas' first {{public school system}} was created. The administration and its supporters formed the Arkansas Industrial University, {{the basis for the}} future University of Arkansas in Fayetteville; what would become the Arkansas School for the Deaf; and the Arkansas School for the Blind, which relocated from Arkadelphia to Little Rock. However, state debt increased dramatically. The state had a budget surplus when Clayton came to office, {{but by the end of}} his term, the state debt had increased to $5 million.|$|E
25|$|On January 28, 2009, the House {{passed the}} bill by a 244–188 vote. All but 11 Democrats {{voted for the}} bill, and 177 Republicans voted against it (one <b>Republican</b> <b>did</b> not vote).|$|R

50|$|Today, {{the state}} {{legislature}} is overwhelmingly Democratic, and has been since the early 2000s. As of December 2016, there are over 860,000 more registered Democrats than <b>Republicans.</b> Democrats <b>do</b> well in the populous counties closer to New York City and Philadelphia, like Essex and Camden counties {{as well as in}} Mercer County, which has the state capital Trenton. <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> well along the Jersey Shore and in northwestern counties, like Morris and Hunterdon.|$|R
5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 1904, Barkley {{declared}} his candidacy for county attorney of McCracken County {{well before the}} March 1905 Democratic primary. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not nominate a candidate, so the Democratic primary was the de facto general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah Police Court Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received more votes than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County's rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This {{was the only time}} Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the major}} party candidates, Weaver {{planned to take}} the field himself, giving speeches around the country. His running mate, Chambers, was to do the same, until a fall from a train in July {{disabled}} him {{for the duration of}} the campaign. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, he hoped to make inroads in that region. Weaver's path to victory, already unlikely, was made more difficult by his refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans. His party's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South, as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles the <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement.|$|E

25|$|Disappointed by the {{acceptance}} {{on the part}} of the King, Alfonso XIII, of the coup d'état by General Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923, Alcalá-Zamora did not collaborate with the new regime. After the departure of the dictator in 1930, he declared himself a republican in a meeting that took place on 13 April in the Apolo theatre of Valencia. He was one of the instigators of the Pact of San Sebastián. The failure of the military uprising (Revolt of Jaca) in Aragon of that same year sent him to prison, as a member of the revolutionary committee, but he left jail after the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. In these elections, although the monarchist candidates won more overall votes than the <b>republicans</b> <b>did,</b> the <b>republicans</b> <b>did</b> so well in the provincial cities that Alfonso soon abandoned power. Without waiting for a fresh election, Alcalá-Zamora put himself at the head of a revolutionary provisional government, becoming the 122nd Prime Minister, which occupied the ministries in Madrid on 14 April and which proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{are divided}} {{on how to}} confront illegal {{immigration}} between a platform that allows for migrant workers and a path to citizenship (supported by establishment types), versus a position focused on securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants (supported by populists). In 2006, the White House supported and Republican-led Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform that would eventually allow millions of illegal immigrants to become citizens, but the House, also led by <b>Republicans,</b> <b>did</b> not advance the bill.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1995, Garland {{received}} a {{hearing before the}} United States Senate Judiciary Committee. In Senate confirmation hearings Garland said that the Supreme Court justices whom he most admired were Justice Brennan, for whom he clerked, and Chief Justice John Marshall. Garland also expressed admiration for the writing style of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.. Senate <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not then schedule a vote on Garland's confirmation, not because of concerns over Garland's qualifications but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.|$|E

25|$|Republicans {{held onto}} {{the seat in}} 1920 by nominating Néstor Montoya, the county clerk of Bernalillo County and former Speaker of the New Mexico Territorial Legislature. Montoya won with a {{combination}} of Hispanic voters and coat-tails from the election of President Warren Harding. <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not renominate him in 1922, choosing instead suffragist Adelina Otero-Warren, the niece of former territorial Governor, Miguel Otero, and the first woman to run for statewide office in New Mexico. Otero-Warren was defeated by Democrat John Morrow, an educator and lawyer from northeast New Mexico. Morrow would win consecutive re-elections in 1924 and 1926, but lost re-election in 1928 to Albert G. Simms, an Albuquerque businessman, on the coat-tails of the election of President Herbert Hoover.|$|E
25|$|After the Republicans {{took control}} of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On the issue of abortion, Traficant voted with the {{position}} of the National Right to Life Committee 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton. After he voted for Republican Dennis Hastert for Speaker of the House in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because the <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century—outside the top leadership—to lack a single committee assignment.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} Bush tax cuts. The deal also permanently indexed the alternative minimum tax for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the Bush tax cuts.|$|E

50|$|Historically, Onondaga County was a Republican stronghold. The GOP {{carried the}} county {{in all but}} one presidential {{election}} from 1952 to 1988. However, it has become friendlier to Democrats in recent years; it has gone Democratic in every presidential election since 1992. At the state and local level, however, it is more of a swing county. Generally, Democratic strength is concentrated in Syracuse itself, while <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> well in the suburbs.|$|R
50|$|Oregon's {{politics}} are largely {{divided by the}} Cascade Mountains, with much of western Oregon leaning Democratic and eastern Oregon leaning <b>Republican.</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> have some strongholds {{in the western part}} of the state, however, such as Linn County, where the Republican presidential candidate has won in every election since 1980. Southern Oregon is also a Republican stronghold, except in Jackson County, which frequently votes for both Republican and Democratic candidates.|$|R
500|$|While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were {{energized}} and did {{especially well}} in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> maintain their majorities in Congress {{and in the}} major states, except New York. The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were [...] "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".|$|E
500|$|A {{longtime}} Democratic activist, Willkie {{changed his}} party registration to Republican in late 1939. He {{did not run}} in the 1940 presidential primaries, but positioned himself as an acceptable choice for a deadlocked convention. He sought backing from uncommitted delegates, while his supporters [...] many youthful [...] enthusiastically promoted his candidacy. As German forces under Hitler rampaged through western Europe in 1940, many <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not wish to nominate an isolationist like Thomas E. Dewey, and turned to Willkie, who was nominated on the sixth ballot over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft. Willkie's support for aid to Britain removed it as {{a major factor in}} his race against Roosevelt, and Willkie also backed the president on a peacetime draft. Both men took more isolationist positions {{towards the end of the}} race. Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term, taking 38 of the 48 states.|$|E
500|$|Tariff {{policy was}} a source of {{conflict}} in late 19th-century American politics. During the Civil War, Congress raised protective tariffs to new heights. This was done partly to pay for the war, but partly because high tariffs were popular in the North. A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive, which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically. Republicans supported high tariffs as a way to protect American jobs and increase prosperity. Democrats generally condemned them as a source of higher prices for goods, whereas the higher revenues that they generated for the federal government were not needed after the conclusion of the Civil War. [...] Many Northern Democrats supported high tariffs, however, for the same economic reasons that Northern <b>Republicans</b> <b>did.</b> In the interest of party unity, they often sought to avoid the question as much as possible.|$|E
50|$|The CBS News poll {{conducted}} July 9-12, 2010 also reported the strong partisan divide over the war. The 73% majority of Democrats want a timetable set for withdrawal, {{while the majority}} 66% of <b>Republicans</b> <b>do</b> not. The nearly-three-quarters majority, 74%, of Democrats want most U.S. troops to be withdrawn {{within a year or}} two, while a majority 52% of Republicans want them to stay longer than another two years.|$|R

500|$|The 1993 Republican alternative, {{introduced}} by Senator John Chafee as the Health Equity and Access Reform Today Act, contained a [...] "universal coverage" [...] requirement with a penalty for noncompliance—an individual mandate—as well as subsidies {{to be used}} in state-based 'purchasing groups'. Advocates for the 1993 bill included prominent Republicans such as Senators Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Bob Bennett and Kit Bond. Of 1993's 43 Republican Senators, 20 supported the HEART Act. Another Republican proposal, introduced in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision; however, Nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill, stating he had decided [...] "that government should not compel people to buy health insurance". At the time of these proposals, <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not raise constitutional issues with the mandate; Mark Pauly, who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for George H. W. Bush, remarked, [...] "I don't remember that being raised at all. The way it was viewed by the Congressional Budget Office in 1994 was, effectively, as a tax." ...|$|E
500|$|Northern Illinois University {{political}} science professor Barbara Burrell's 2000study found that Clinton's Gallup poll favorability numbers broke sharply along partisan lines throughout her time as first lady, with 70 to 90percent of Democrats typically viewing her favorably while only 20 to 40percent of <b>Republicans</b> <b>did.</b> University of Wisconsin–Madison {{political science}} professor Charles Franklin analyzed her record of favorable versus unfavorable ratings in public opinion polls and {{found that there was}} more variation in them during her first lady years than her Senate years. The Senate years showed favorable ratings around 50percent and unfavorable ratings in the mid-40percent range; Franklin noted that, [...] "This sharp split is, of course, one of the more widely remarked aspects of Sen. Clinton's public image." [...] McGill University professor of history Gil Troy titled his 2006 biography of her Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady and wrote that after the 1992 campaign, Clinton [...] "was a polarizing figure, with 42percent [...] saying she came closer to their values and lifestyle than previous first ladies and 41percent disagreeing." [...] Troy further wrote that Clinton [...] "has been uniquely controversial and contradictory since she first appeared on the national radar screen in 1992" [...] and that she [...] "has alternately fascinated, bedeviled, bewitched and appalled Americans." ...|$|E
