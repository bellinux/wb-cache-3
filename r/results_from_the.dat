5000|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> {{point of}} view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a species, such as between {{different}} breeds.Single cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cross between two true-breeding organisms which produces an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.Double cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cross between two different F1 hybrids (i.e., there are four unrelated grandparents).Three-way cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cross between an F1 hybrid and an inbred line.Triple cross hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crossing of two different three-way cross hybrids.Top cross (or [...] "topcross") hybrids <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crossing of a top quality or pure-bred male and a lower quality female, intended {{to improve the quality of}} the offspring, on average.|$|R

Screen-detected carcinomas were carcinomas diagnosed among the screening attendees within six months after the previous population-based mammography test with a positive <b>result</b> both <b>from</b> <b>the</b> test and the recall examinations.

5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E

5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915.

It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
