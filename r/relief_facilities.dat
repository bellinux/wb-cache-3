25|$|The United States National Library of Medicine {{credits the}} {{hospital}} {{as being a}} product of medieval Islamic civilization. Compared to contemporaneous Christian institutions, which were poor and sick <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> offered by some monasteries, the Islamic hospital was a more elaborate institution with {{a wider range of}} functions. In Islam, there was a moral imperative to treat the ill regardless of financial status. Islamic hospitals tended to be large, urban structures, and were largely secular institutions, many open to all, whether male or female, civilian or military, child or adult, rich or poor, Muslim or non-Muslim. The Islamic hospital served several purposes, as a center of medical treatment, a home for patients recovering from illness or accidents, an insane asylum, and a retirement home with basic maintenance needs for the aged and infirm.|$|E

40|$|The study {{presented}} here reviews activities of NGOs in Sudan. That was a disputable issue {{that resulted in}} a mass expulsion of many in 2009. However¸ there were precedents of such expulsions in previous and following years. The paper discusses humanitarian work in Sudan, positive and negative sides. Reasons are that part of the hypothetical framework here is that their activities in the country are indispensible. The country still faces many humanitarian suffering in most of its regions and international aid is direly required. Thus, it is essential to rectify their modus operandi to be consistent with the culture of the country's people. The conclusions of the paper emphasize that such their humanitarian <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> are inadequate and that educational efforts are more needed to support a build-up of human capital. Malnutrition, inadequate homes and sanitation facilities are also common issues that should be within their aid targets. Those are axial factors that should be focused upon specially with escalating economic distress and secession of the Southern Sudan. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine debt dynamics of highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs) and identify key factors responsible for their protracted debt crisis. For this purpose, we first evaluate economic conditions of debt sustainability in the context of the intertemporal borrowing model, the growth-cum-debt model and the gap models. After reviewing other concepts of debt dynamics, such as liquidity problem and insolvency condition, we analyse mechanisms whereby a debt burden becomes unsustainable and debt forgiveness is a rationale choice for both creditors and debtors to overcome the ensued debt overhang condition. In the light of these theoretical expositions, we present empirical evidence as to how debt dynamics has evolved over the last two decades in selected HIPCs and question the effectiveness of ex post debt <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> applied so far. In the concluding section, we present our proposal to use a state-contingent debt contract as an ex ante debt relief mechanism, as opposed to the current ex post debt relief embedded in the HIPC initiative, which we view as an ineffective mechanism for debt-crisis prevention and management...|$|E
40|$|Recent weather events, {{particularly}} in the southeastern United States, have brought issues of hurricane disaster planning {{to the forefront of}} public policy. Efficient distribution of relief goods to populations after severe weather events is one of many challenges faced by governing bodies. This paper focuses on provision of hurricane disaster relief and develops a flexible network flow model that provides efficient transport linkages between critical elements of the relief goods supply chain. The model identifies accessible locations in which to place intraurban distribution sites for relief goods. Flexibility inherent in the model structure allows the pursuit of multiple policies, including the ability to trade off the costs paid for constructing various components of the goods supply chain. The model is linked to a geographic information system and can be used to visualize relief planning scenarios. The results of model tests with sample spatial data demonstrate how average population time to <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> (accessibility) varies substantially depending on the cost structure input into the model. Conclusions and several suggestions for future research are provided...|$|E

Communify runs an emergency food <b>relief</b> <b>facility</b> for people who find themselves in a crisis or temporarily unable to afford groceries. Over a period of five months, we did several field visits to the centre and carried out 21 short in-situ interviews, with a mix of Communify clients and volunteers.

40|$|Women {{are gaining}} {{increased}} access to small military cockpits. This shift has stimulated {{the search for}} practical urine containment and disposal methods for female aircrew. There are no external urine collection devices (UCD) for women that are comfortable, convenient, and leak free. We describe a prototype UCD that begins to meet this need. Materials used to make custom aviator masks were adapted to mold a perineal mask. First, a perineal cast (negative) was {{used to make a}} mold (positive). Next, a perineal mask made of wax was formed to fit the positive mold. Finally, a soft, pliable perineal mask was fabricated using the wax model as a guide. The prototype was tested for comfort, fit, and leakage. In the sitting position, less than 5 cc of urine leakage occurred with each 600 cc of urine collected. Comfort was mostly satisfactory, but ambulation was limited and the outlet design could lead to kinking and obstruction. We concluded that a perineal mask may serve as a comfortable and functional external UCD acceptable for use by females in confined environments. Changes are needed to improve comfort, fit, and urine drainage. Integration into cockpits, pressure suits, chemical defense gear, and environments where access to <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> is restricted is planned...|$|E

Includes bibliographical refences. In this study, the {{location}} of disaster response and <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> in Istanbul is investigated in view of a possible earthquake. Our objective is to determine and analyze the assignments of demand nodes to shelter nodes. We propose two mathematical models for this purpose. Model 1 is a path based model, in which the possible paths are determined by preprocessing the network data to assign demands to shelters while obeying path capacities. Model 2 is an arc based model that uses the network data directly and creates the paths as a byproduct of the solution. Both of the models ensure that each demand node is served by at least a shelter node in accordance with road and shelter capacities. We {{examine the effect of}} the shelter capacity, the number of shelters, and the road capacities on the results in different cases. In these cases, we find out that the shelter capacity, number of shelters, and road capacities influence the shelters to be opened, the assignment of the demand nodes to these shelters and the used arcs/paths in this assignment.

40|$|This diploma paper {{deals with}} {{watercourse}} protection and sizing of the containment pools {{in the area}} of the Grosuplje–Šmarje - Sap sewage system. The introductory part of the paper describes the researched area (topographic and hydrographical characteristics) and the current state of the sewage system. The watercourse characteristics and their pollution are dealt with in detail. The main part of the diploma paper describes the containment pools and their design according to German guidelines ATV-A 128. The guidelines demand a large number of data which has to be previously analysed. The necessary capacity is determined on the basis of the yearly stress on the drainage system, the concentrations of which have to be within accepted tolerance limits. In the last part, the design and sizing of the containment pools {{in the area of}} the Grosuplje–Šmarje - Sap sewage system is described. The sewage system is mostly of mixed type and contains 11 <b>relief</b> <b>facilities</b> which relieve mixed drainages into watercourses of the Grosuplje field and consequently pollute the Krka river. The first wave of the relieved drainages has to be contained and transported to the processing facility in its entirety, especially after longer dry periods in spring and autumn, when concentrations of pollutants reach alarming values. In the Grosuplje–Šmarje - Sap sewage system, I provided a containment pool next to every relief facility and set their necessary effective capacities. In the case of the Šmarje - Sap containment pool I presented the sizing and placement in detail. I also constructed a cost estimate and work list for the construction of the Šmarje - Sap containment pool...|$|E

40|$|Refugee {{camps are}} {{an example of}} ‘post crisis’ rehabilitative systems, which vainly attempt to restore {{stability}} {{in a state of}} disaster (Azmara, 2012). Uprooted from their homes and thrust into volatile and unfamiliar surroundings, civil conflict and natural disasters have left millions of refugees around the world destitute in their host countries, stripped of their identity and humanity and left with only the clothes on their backs. Unlike in rural settlements, the urban settlement patterns of refugees in Johannesburg have demonstrated a unique gravitational shift from reliance on local government assistance to a strong and long standing affiliation with various religious fraternities in the urban centres. This has then resulted in the inquisitorial search of how well have these urban churches served the needs of the urban displaced communities? By opening up their church buildings to refugees as a place sanctity and solace, how has this spiritual affiliation effected the reception, protection and rehabilitation of psychologically and physically traumatized refugees and asylum seekers? Subsequently has Johannesburg as a city, made provision for the sheltering and protecting of refugees, should there ever again be a crisis of violent xenophobic turmoil in the city’s townships? This thesis seeks to explore the underlying differences between designing a post crisis emergency shelter and specifically developing a transitory sanctuary tailored for urban refugees. By merging the dissimilar approaches assumed by secular refugee aiding organisations and the religious fraternities, the design starts to illustrate the symbolic connection between refuge and solace; spirituality and rehabilitation, as well as making note of the harmonies that exist within humanitarian architecture and sacred architecture. By understanding these fundamental parallels, a premise is formed {{for the development of a}} unique and prototypical urban refugee centre, located in Hillbrow, at the heart of Johannesburg’s eclectic foreign national communities. The centre is comprised of several emergency <b>relief</b> <b>facilities,</b> rehabilitative programmes as well as an adaptive form of transitional accommodation all encompasses within a spiritual, yet nondenominational Christian church establishment; a gesture which serves to highlight the ‘curative’ relationship between the spirituality, architecture and the user...|$|E
