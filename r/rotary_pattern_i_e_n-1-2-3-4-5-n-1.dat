In this article, a new {{algorithm}} called Sequence Alignment Method extended with an Interestingness Measure (SAM I) {{is illustrated}} for mining navigation patterns {{on a web}} site. Through log file analysis, SAMI distinguishes interesting <b>patterns</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> unexpected, surprising <b>patterns</b> contradicting with {{the structure of the}} web site or direct hyperlinks between web pages) from uninteresting <b>patterns</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> expected, known, obvious patterns resulting from the structure of the web site or direct hyperlinks between web pages) and provides information about the order of visited web pages. The algorithm is validated using real data sets of the Music Machines web sit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, two {{essential}} {{problems that}} belong to language parsing and have arisen from dialogue management are discussed and solved by implementing {{a variant of the}} well-known context-free parsing algorithm [1]. The first problem is the use of partly specified <b>patterns,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> the use of wildcards in the right-hand-sides of the rewriting rules of a context-free grammar. The second one is the use of priority <b>patterns,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> the assignment of priority values to rewriting rules. These problems are not handled in the majority of the state-of-the-art dialogue systems. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a dialogue system core application called CAML Core [7], that is used to implement dialogue systems in several domains like conversational and multimodal interfaces for help desk applications, and chat bots...|$|R
40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that highly skilled throwers and strikers employ a sequential pattern of intersegmental coordination (Bunn, 1972; Kreighbaum & Barthels, 1990; Morehouse & Cooper, 1950). That is, "movements proceed from base to free end, from proximal to distal " (Kreighbaum & Barthels, p. 625) and "each [distal] segment comes forward as {{the movement of}} its proximal segment reaches its greatest angular velocity " (Kreighbaum & Barthels, p. 604). There is little agreement, however, concerning the coordination of less skilled throwers and strikers. According to Kreighbaum and Barthels, novice or immature performers typically display simultaneous or nearly simultaneous <b>patterns</b> of coordination (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> proximal and distal segments contribute to the movement {{at about the same}} time). In addition to the "optimal " sequential pattern of coordination, Morehouse and Cooper described two sub-optimal sequential patterns: the "early " <b>pattern</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> distal segments initiate forward movement before proximal segments reach peak angular velocity) and the "late " <b>pattern</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> distal segments initiate forward movement after proximal segments reach peak angular velocity).

40|$|Two {{approaches}} for mining function-call usage patterns from source code are compared. The first approach, itemset mining, {{has recently been}} applied to this problem. The other approach, sequential-pattern mining, has not been previously applied to this problem. Here, a call-usage pattern is a composition of function calls that occur in a function definition. Both approaches look for frequently occurring patterns that represent standard usage of functions and identify possible errors. Itemset mining produces unordered <b>patterns,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> sets of function calls, whereas, sequentialpattern mining produces partially ordered <b>patterns,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> sequences of function calls. The trade-off between the additional ordering context given by sequential-pattern mining and the efficiency of itemset mining is investigated. The two approaches are applied to the Linux kernel v 2. 6. 14 and results show that mining ordered patterns is worth the additional cost. 1...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{autonomous}} dynamical pattern recognition and learning system which can learn new patterns without any external observer. For realizing "I don't know" {{state as a}} novel filter, we constructed the network from Lorenz systems. First, we find a parameter which affects the network dynamics from the evolution equation. A series of computer simulations show the dependence of the network dynamics on the parameter. Then we find a critical region of the network dynamics. In this critical region, when the embedded <b>pattern,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> the known <b>pattern,</b> {{is given to the}} network, the output pattern of the network immediately goes to the relevant embedded pattern and the state of network reduces to the oscillatory state at once.

40|$|We proposes an {{autonomous}} dynamical pattern recognition and learning system. It is demonstrated that, first, when the embedded <b>pattern,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> known <b>pattern,</b> {{is given to}} the network, the firing pattern of the network immediately goes to the relevant embedded pattern and the network state reduces to the oscillatory state at once. Second, when no embedded <b>pattern,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> unknown <b>pattern,</b> {{is given to the}} network, the network state oscillates chaotically. It is considered as "I don't know" state proposed by Freeman and coworkers. Finally, when Hebb rule is applied to the network under the external stimuli that are unknown patterns, the internal state of the network is inversely bifurcated from the chaotic state to the periodic state according to the progress of learning. By using this phase transition as an index of the progress of learning, the network can learn new patterns without any external observers. 1.

40|$|A {{recurrent}} {{neural network}} is considered that can retrieve {{a collection of}} patterns, as well as slightly perturbed versions of this `pure' set of patterns via fixed points of its dynamics. By replacing the set of dynamical constraints, <b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> the fixed point equations, by an extended collection of fixed-point-like equations, analytical expressions are found for the weights w_ij(b) of the net, which depend on a certain parameter b.

40|$|There are two {{theories}} of stellar spiral arms in isolated disc galaxies that model stellar spiral arms with different longevities: quasi-stationary density wave theory, which characterises spirals as rigidly rotating, long-lived <b>patterns</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> steady spirals), and dynamic spiral theory, which characterises spirals as differentially rotating, transient, recurrent <b>patterns</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> dynamic spirals). In order {{to discriminate between}} these two spiral models observationally, we investigated {{the differences between the}} gas velocity patterns predicted by these two spiral models in hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the azimuthal phases of the velocity patterns relative to the gas density peaks (<b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> gaseous arms) differ between the two models, as do the gas flows; nevertheless, the velocity patterns themselves are similar for both models. Such similarity suggests that the mere existence of streaming motions does not conclusively confirm the steady spiral model. However, we found that the steady spiral model shows that the gaseous arms have radial streaming motions well inside the co-rotation radius, whereas the dynamic spiral model predicts that the gaseous arms tend to have tangential streaming motions. These differences suggest that the gas velocity patterns around spiral arms will enable distinction between the spiral theories. Comment: accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
