60|$|Captain Blossom {{was called}} and more {{lanterns}} were lit, {{and then a}} Bengal light, and Tom was seen to be holding fast to a rope which had in some manner fallen overboard and become entangled in the <b>rudder</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
60|$|Still weak, {{and with}} the flying spray {{drenching}} his face, Walter could not answer, and in a second more the questioner had disappeared amid the gloom, smoke, and flying water. Again came a lurch of the collier, and Walter was hurled flat and sent spinning against the smoke-stack. As he arose he saw Lieutenant Hobson and his men climbing over the starboard rail. Realizing, even in his bewildered state of mind, {{that he could not}} do better than to follow them, he, too, made for the rail, going over at one point as the courageous commander of the expedition went over at another. The crew were swimming for the catamaran, which had been shoved off from the Merrimac's side, and Walter came after them. Hardly had the catamaran been gained, than, with a final lurch and quiver, the Merrimac went down, partly across the narrow channel, but not exactly in the position in which she would have been placed had not the <b>rudder</b> <b>chain</b> been shot away.|$|E
50|$|As {{the ferry}} headed to Değirmendere, high waves {{raised by the}} storm blowing at 130 km/h rocked the small vessel. The bridge broke off and fell into water, taking the captain and the {{boatswain}} with it. The <b>rudder</b> <b>chain</b> broke leaving the ferry uncontrollable. Water filled the engine room and the front passenger department after breaking the window glass.|$|E
50|$|For courageous {{conduct in}} {{going over the}} stern of the U.S.S. Constitution at sea, 13 February 1879, during a heavy gale, and cutting the {{fastenings}} of the ship's <b>rudder</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
50|$|Serving {{on board}} the U.S.S. Constitution, at sea, 13 February 1879, Horton showed courageous conduct in going over the stern during a heavy gale and cutting the {{fastenings}} of the ship's <b>rudder</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two hours {{out from}} Lyttelton, on a smooth sea, Muriel ran into fog. She was moving inwards {{to pick up}} the Godley Head signal. She then struck Sumner Bar, Christchurch. One of the <b>rudder</b> <b>chains</b> carried away and she was helpless.|$|R
50|$|Off Punta Angamos at 09:25 h. Grau {{opened fire}} over Cochrane, {{beginning}} the engagement. Latorre didn't answer, focused on approaching to Huáscar from its stern. About 15 minutes later, Cochrane retaliated from about 2,200 meters. Her three starboard cannons provoked serious {{damage on the}} monitor right from the start. The very first shot pierced Huáscars turret, wounding the twelve crew members manning the 300-pound cannons. Another shot perforated the armor just above the waterline, cutting the left <b>rudder</b> <b>chain</b> and leaving Huáscar temporarily adrift. Meanwhile, Cochrane sustained little damage. Grau's flagship was now listing hard to starboard and was hampered also by a deformation in the hull acquired when she rammed Prat's Esmeralda at Iquique five months ago. However, barely ten minutes later an emergency rudder {{was set up by}} Huáscars crew.|$|E
50|$|Captain Durham {{claimed that}} she was the fastest 74-gun ship in the British fleet. Nonetheless Defiance was placed at the rear of Admiral Collingwood’s line, and the battle was well {{advanced}} before she fired her first broadside. After exchanging fire with the Spanish Principe de Asturias (112 guns) Defiance engaged the French L’Aigle, already badly damaged by HMS Bellerophon. After silencing her, Defiance drifted away, and her master’s mate James Spratt offered to lead a boarding party that would have to swim across because all the boats had been destroyed. Spratt was well known on Defiance as an excellent swimmer, who had saved two men from drowning, and a fighter of some reputation, who had been appointed by Captain Durham to lead any boarding party and swimming across to L’Aigle. Armed only with a cutlass, Spratt climbed the <b>rudder</b> <b>chain,</b> entered through the stern ports, and was engaged in cutting down the French ensign on the stern before the crew of L’Aigle realised who he was. There was a short sharp fight but Defiance managed to draw alongside and L’Aigle surrendered, though not before Spratt was severely wounded in one leg. A full prize crew was now put aboard, but in the storm that followed on 22 October L’Aigle drifted away from her captor, who {{had not been able to}} take her in tow, and the French crew regained control and managed to take her into Cadiz.|$|E
5000|$|Matthews {{was born}} 1849 in Malta. After immigrating to the United States, {{he joined the}} navy. He was {{stationed}} aboard the [...] as captain of the top when, on February 13, 1879, he risked his life to cut the fastenings of the ship's <b>rudder</b> <b>chains</b> in a heavy gale. For his actions, he received the Medal of Honor on October 18, 1884.|$|R
5000|$|Horton {{was born}} in 1850 in Boston, Massachusetts and after joining the Navy was {{stationed}} aboard the [...] as captain of the top. On February 13, 1879 he risked his life along with two other sailors to repair the ship's rudder during a storm. Horton was lowered over {{the stern of the}} ship and cut the fastenings of the ship's <b>rudder</b> <b>chains,</b> allowing the <b>rudder</b> itself to be repaired. For his actions he received the Medal of Honor March 20, 1905.|$|R
60|$|Kit looked about, {{but could}} not see the launch. The dark mass was a thick belt of trees, but he did not know, and did not think Mayne knew, where they were, and the easy motion {{indicated}} that the tide was carrying the steamer on. Much to his relief, the indistinct wall of forest seemed to bend back, away from the sea. It looked as if they were entering the lagoon; and then he heard the telegraph and the rattle of <b>rudder</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The balance was tilted finally {{when two}} {{monitors}} arrived. Tennessee was already almost motionless, her smokestack shot away and so unable {{to build up}} boiler pressure. Her <b>rudder</b> <b>chains</b> were parted {{so that she could}} not steer. Furthermore, some of the shutters on her gun ports were jammed, rendering the guns behind them useless. Chickasaw took up position at her stern, and Manhattan began to pummel the ram with her [...] guns. The heavy shot bent in the iron shield and shattered its oak backing.|$|R
50|$|Iphigenia {{arrived at}} Kealakekua Bay in Hawaii on July 20, where the Hawaiians {{attempted}} {{to capture the}} ship, probably with Kamehameha's approval. By July 28 Iphigenia was anchored at Waikiki on Oahu. Completely out of articles of trade the crew began cutting up <b>rudder</b> <b>chains</b> to exchange for provisions. After cruising to other islands and stocking up on fresh water and yams, Douglas had Iphigenia set sail for China on August 10. The voyage to Macau was uneventful and Iphigenia arrived on 5 October 1789.|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} the Delaware arrived at around 7 am, the Phoenix had burned to the waterline. The Delaware found only three survivors: the ships clerk and a {{passenger}} clinging to the <b>rudder</b> <b>chains,</b> and an engineer clinging to a door. The boat from the Liberty arrived soon after, followed {{by one of the}} Phoenixs lifeboats. The Delaware retrieved five bodies from the water, then took the hull of the Phoenix and the Libertys lifeboat in tow. The Delaware towed the wreck to Sheboygan, where it was beached by the citys north pier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your ladder--" [...] he murmured, after a silence. [...] "Who'd {{have thought}} of finding a ladder hanging over at night in a ship {{anchored}} out here! I felt just then a very unpleasant faintness. After the life I've been leading for nine weeks, anybody would have got out of condition. I wasn't capable of swimming round as far as your <b>rudder</b> <b>chains.</b> And, lo and behold! there was a ladder to get hold of. After I gripped it I said to myself, 'What's the good?' When I saw a man's head looking over I thought I would swim away presently and leave him shouting--in whatever language it was. I didn't mind being looked at. I--I liked it. And then you speaking to me so quietly--as if you had expected me--made me hold on a little longer. It had been a confounded lonely time--I don't mean while swimming. I was glad {{to talk a little}} to somebody that didn't belong to the Sephora. As to asking for the captain, that was a mere impulse. It could have been no use, with all the ship knowing about me and the other people pretty certain to be round here in the morning. I don't know--I wanted to be seen, to talk with somebody, before I went on. I don't know what I would have said.... 'Fine night, isn't it?' or something of the sort." ...|$|R
50|$|Airglow is {{currently}} being worked on by a small team of pilots and engineers using Airglow as a flying test bed for HPA improvements. Airglows modular design allows refinement of different sections of the aircraft (propeller, <b>rudder,</b> elevator, drive <b>chain,</b> wings etc.) without requiring major work {{to the rest of}} the aircraft.|$|R
60|$|And in this {{lies the}} {{grotesque}} horror of this sombre story. The last extremity of sailors, overtaking {{a small boat}} or a frail craft, seems easier to bear, because of the direct danger of the seas. The confined space, the close contact, the imminent menace of the waves, seem to draw men together, in spite of madness, suffering and despair. But there was a ship--safe, convenient, roomy: a ship with beds, bedding, knives, forks, comfortable cabins, glass and china, and a complete cook's galley, pervaded, ruled and possessed by the pitiless spectre of starvation. The lamp oil had been drunk, the wicks cut up for food, the candles eaten. At night she floated dark in all her recesses, and full of fears. One day Falk came upon a man gnawing a splinter of pine wood. Suddenly he threw the piece of wood away, tottered to the rail, and fell over. Falk, too late to prevent the act, saw him claw the ship's side desperately before he went down. Next day another man did the same thing, after uttering horrible imprecations. But this one somehow managed {{to get hold of}} the broken <b>rudder</b> <b>chains</b> and hung on there, silently. Falk set about trying to save him, and all the time the man, holding with both hands, looked at him anxiously with his sunken eyes. Then, just as Falk was ready to put his hand on him, the man let go his hold and sank like a stone. Falk reflected on these sights. His heart revolted against the horror of death, and he said to himself that he would struggle for every precious minute of his life.|$|R
5000|$|Spratt {{was born}} in Harold's Cross, Dublin, on 3 May 1771 and {{at the age of}} 25 in 1796 he joined the Royal Navy. His father was Spratt Esq., of Ballybeg, near Mitcheltown and his {{brother-in-law}} was John Abel Ward, Esq., a judge in the Admiralty Court in Nevis. After some years in the merchant service, he joined the navy as a first class volunteer. He was promoted midshipman in 1798 aboard HMS Bellona and he was at the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801. He gained fame for his exploits at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, aged 34. He was a master's mate on Captain Philip Charles Durham's ship, the 74 gun HMS Defiance. The ship was attempting to board a French ship, the L'Aigle. After the first attempt the log records that:A certain Mr.Spratt, an active young master's mate, took his cutlass between his teeth and his battle-axe in his belt, called to the 50 other boarders he was leading to follow, lept over board and swam to the L'Aigle, followed by a few men; he got in at the stern gun port up the <b>rudder</b> <b>chains</b> and was met by some of the crew, who resisted. He swung on a rope to avoid three grenadiers, then killed two with his cutlass and pushed the third down onto a lower deck where the soldiers neck was broken, Spratt landing on top was uninjured. He succeed in cutting his way through and hauled down the Frenchman's colours, and in the act of doing so, was shot through the leg after having deflecting the shot down from his chest with his cutlass.Upon being rescued by his shipmates he dragged himself {{to the side of the}} ship, and holding his bleeding limb over the railing, called out, [...] "Captain, poor Jack Spratt is done up at last!" [...] Captain Durham was able to warp alongside, and Spratt was slung on board. He had also saved a French officer's life before being shot, officers being reserved for ransom or exchange.Spratt, who was badly hit, with both the tibia and fibula being shot through, refused to have his leg amputated, and the surgeon, feeling the operation was essential, asked the captain for a written order to authorise him to take the leg off. This was refused, though Durham promised to argue the matter with James, despite having three wounds himself. Spratt held out his other leg, which was a very good one, and said: [...] "Never; if I lose my leg, where shall I find a match for this?" [...] Spratt was made a lieutenant after the action, and did not in fact lose his leg, although it was three inches shorter than the other.|$|R
60|$|The great {{difference}} in appearance between these packets and ours, is, {{that there is}} so much of them out of the water: the main-deck being enclosed on all sides, and filled with casks and goods, like any second or third floor in a stack of warehouses; and the promenade or hurricane-deck being a-top of that again. A part of the machinery is always above this deck; where the connecting-rod, in a strong and lofty frame, is seen working away like an iron top- sawyer. There is seldom any mast or tackle: nothing aloft but two tall black chimneys. The man at the helm is shut up in a little house in the fore part of the boat (the wheel being connected with the <b>rudder</b> by iron <b>chains,</b> working the whole length of the deck); and the passengers, unless the weather be very fine indeed, usually congregate below. Directly you have left the wharf, all the life, and stir, and bustle of a packet cease. You wonder for a long time how she goes on, for there seems to be nobody in charge of her; and when another of these dull machines comes splashing by, you feel quite indignant with it, as a sullen cumbrous, ungraceful, unshiplike leviathan: quite forgetting that the vessel you are on board of, is its very counterpart.|$|R
