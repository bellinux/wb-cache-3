It is therefore important to identify regions where the probability of exceeding those limits is high. We propose a two-step procedure for estimating the probability of exceeding the legal limits that combines smoothing in the time domain with spatial interpolation.

40|$|A multi-risk {{approach}} {{should allow}} having {{a better understanding}} of the variety of risks over a territory. This raises though conceptual, methodological, operational issues: a multi-risk analysis cannot result from the simple aggregation of single risks maps. An objective multi-risk assessment raises difficulties due to the problems of comparing hazards, vulnerabilities and risks among them. The review of existing risk mapping practices in Europe shows that methodologies often provide simplified maps where the potential number of deaths or of economic losses has been chosen as common unit of comparison. This does not allow any qualitative assessment of multi-risks situations. Therefore, we think that a way to address the complexity of multi-risk situations is to replace the use of this concept within the decision-making process, integrating stakeholders' perceptions in the definition of multi-risk maps. A multi-risk approach should not be seen as a way to replace single risks approaches but as a way to improve the understanding of the complexity of risks over a territory. The example of the project carried out in the <b>Region</b> <b>Piemonte</b> allows illustrating these issues, and shows a possible way to address them. It helps also reflecting about the accuracy and limits of a multi-risk approach. JRC. G. 7 -Traceability and vulnerability assessmen...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{consider}} a hierarchical spatio-temporal model for particulate matter (PM) {{concentration in the}} North-Italian <b>region</b> <b>Piemonte.</b> The model involves a Gaussian Field (GF), affected by a measurement error, and a state process characterized by a first order autoregressive dynamic model and spatially correlated innovations. This kind of model is well discussed and widely used in the air quality literature thanks to its flexibility in modelling the effect of relevant covariates (i. e. meteorological and geographical variables) as well as time and space dependence. However, Bayesian inference-through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques-can be a challenge due to convergence problems and heavy computational loads. In particular, the computational issue refers to the infeasibility of linear algebra operations involving the big dense covariance matrices which occur when large spatio-temporal datasets are present. The main goal of this work is to present an effective estimating and spatial prediction strategy for the considered spatio-temporal model. This proposal consists in representing a GF with Matérn covariance function as a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) through the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approach. The main advantage of moving from a GF to a GMRF stems from the good computational properties that the latter enjoys. In fact, GMRFs are defined by sparse matrices that allow for computationally effective numerical methods. Moreover, when dealing with Bayesian inference for GMRFs, {{it is possible to}} adopt the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm as an alternative to MCMC methods giving rise to additional computational advantages. The implementation of the SPDE approach through the R-library INLA (www. r-inla. org) is illustrated with reference to the Piemonte PM data. In particular, providing the step-by-step R-code, we show how it is easy to get prediction and probability of exceedance maps in a reasonable computing time...|$|E

40|$|Italy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} prone areas to study the CO 2 behavior underground, the caprock integrity to the CO 2 leakage, mostly in presence of pervious/geochemically active faults, due to a wide availability of CO 2 rich reservoirs at a depth between 1 and 10 km, as highlighted by recent literature. These deep CO 2 reservoirs generate at least 200 leakage areas at surface throughout Italy which have been defined “Diffuse Degassing Structures” (DDS) by INGV. These are widely studied by INGV institutionally by a long term convention with the Civil Protection Department (DPC) with the aim to catalog, monitor and assess the Natural Gas Hazard (NGH, namely the probability of an area to become a site of poisonous peri – volcanic gas exhalation from soils). More than 150 researcher of INGV are involved in monitoring areas affected by the CO 2 presence underground and at surface, by continuous monitoring on-line networks (around 40 stations throughout Italy, including the Etna area, Aeolian Islands, Umbria <b>region,</b> <b>Piemonte</b> region, etc…) and discretely (9 groups of research were involved in the last years to localize, define and monitor almost all the DDSs in Italy), by sampling and analyzing chemical and isotopic compounds, useful to discriminate the origin, evolution and natural gas hazards of the examined DDS. In this paper, we will discuss some DDS catalogued and studied by a Rome INGV Research Unit (UR 11) which focused its work in Central Italy, throughout different DDS, also in relation to the diverse seismotectonic settings, to discover buried faults as possible gas leakage pathways, mostly if they are “geochemically” activated. In particular we discuss, among the discrete monitoring techniques exploited by INGV, soil gas surveying, which consists in a collection of gas samples from the soil zone not saturated (dry zone) to measure the geogas gaseous species both in fluxes (CO 2, CH 4, 222 Rn) and in concentration (He, H 2, H 2 S, helium, hydrogen, CO 2, CH 4, 222 Rn), that permeate the soil pores. The total CO 2 flux budget was calculated as “baseline” degassing rate of these “CO 2 analogues”. A good discrete areal monitoring is prerequisite to design sound continuous monitoring network to monitor CO 2 related parameters in liquid/gas phases, to review the protocol of the Annex II of the European Directivity on CCS...|$|E

A retrospective analysis of hospital discharge records, matched with the laboratory database, was also undertaken in nine hospitals in these two regions to determine the frequency of use of blood cultures and its impact on IPD incidence estimate. For children under 2 years of age, the incidence rates of IPD were 11. 3 per 100, 000 and 5. 9 per 100, 000 in Piemonte and in Puglia, respectively; for subjects 65 years of age and over the incidence rates were 5. 7 per 100, 000 and 0. 2 per 100, 000, in the two regions, respectively. The number of blood cultures performed was six times higher in Piemonte than that in Puglia. About 96 % of isolates from IPD patients, aged 65 years and over, belonged to serogroups included in the 23 -valent polysaccharide vaccine, whereas about 79 % of strains isolated from patients under 5 years of age were related to serotypes included in the 7 -valent conjugate vaccine. The estimate of the incidence of IPD is affected greatly by the different attitudes in performing blood cultures, especially in older patients.
