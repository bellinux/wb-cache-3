It may also be conducted during substantial optimization of an existing process or the development of a second-generation process. According to their resulting risk ratings, process parameters can be ranked for importance and important variables for process development, characterization, or validation can be identified. LAY ABSTRACT: Health authorities around the world ask pharmaceutical companies to manage risk during development and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. The so-called failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is an established risk analysis tool that has been used for decades in mechanical and electrical industries. However, the adaptation of the FMEA methodology to pharmaceutical processes that use modern biotechnology (biopharmaceutical processes) brings about some difficulties, because those biopharmaceutical processes differ from processes in mechanical and electrical industries. The proposal presented here explains how a biopharmaceutical process FMEA can be conducted. It includes a detailed 1 -to- 10 -scale FMEA <b>rating</b> <b>table</b> for occurrence, severity, and detectability of failures that has been especially designed for typical biopharmaceutical processes. With the help of this guideline, different details of the manufacturing process can be ranked according to their potential risks, and this can help pharmaceutical companies to identify aspects with high potential risks and to react accordingly to improve the safety of medicines...|$|E

The regional recharge map adequately captured the magnitude and distribution compared to a local map constructed using HELP (42 mm/yr); However, regional recharge results were higher compared to a local map constructed using the MIKE-SHE code (6 mm/yr).

Methods: Fifty healthy children (n= 21 boys; 9. 4 ± 0. 9 y) completed a continuous, incremental protocol until the attainment of V?O 2 peak. Oxygen uptake (V?O 2) was measured continuously, and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were estimated {{at the end of each}} exercise stage using the CERT and the EP Scale. Ratings up to- and including RPE 5 and 7, from both the CERT (CERT 5, CERT 7) and EP Scale (EP 5, EP 7), were linearly regressed against the corresponding V?O 2, to both maximal RPE (CERT 10, EP 10) and terminal RPE (CERT 9, EP 9). Results: There were no differences between measured- and predicted V?O 2 peak from CERT 5, CERT 7, EP 5 and EP 7 when extrapolated to either CERT 9 or EP 9 (P >. 05). Pearson’s correlations of r=. 64 -. 86 were observed between measured- and predicted V?O 2 peak, for all perceptual ranges investigated. However, only EP 7 provided a small difference when considering the Standard Error of Estimate, suggesting that the prediction of V?O 2 peak from EP 7 would be within 10 % of measured V?O 2 peak. Conclusions: Although robust estimates of V?O 2 peak may be elicited using both the CERT and EP Scale during a single CPET with children, the most accurate estimates of V?O 2 peak occur when extrapolating from EP 7...|$|E
40|$|Discharge time series' {{are one of}} {{the core}} data sets used in {{hydrological}} investigations. Errors in the data mainly occur through uncertainty in gauging (measurement uncertainty) and uncertainty in determination of the stage–discharge relationship (rating curve uncertainty). Thirty-six flow gauges from the Namoi River catchment, Australia, were examined to explore how rating curve uncertainty affects gauge reliability and uncertainty of observed flow records. The analysis focused on the deviations in gaugings from the rating curves because standard (statistical) uncertainty methods could not be applied. Deviations of greater/lesser than 10 % were considered significant to allow for a measurement uncertainty threshold of 10 %, determined from quality coding of gaugings and operational procedures. The deviations in gaugings were compared against various factors to examine trends and identify major controls, including stage height, date, month, <b>rating</b> <b>table,</b> gauging frequency and quality, catchment area and type of control. The analysis gave important insights into data quality and the reliability of each gauge, which had previously not been recognized. These included identification of more/less reliable periods of record, which varied widely between gauges, and identification of more/less reliable parts of the hydrograph. Most gauges showed significant deviations at low stages, affecting the determination of low flows. This was independent of the type of gauge control, with many gauges experiencing problems in the stability of the rating curve, likely as a result of sediment flux. The deviations in gaugings also have widespread application in modelling, for example, informing suitable calibration periods and defining error distributions. This paper demonstrates the value and importance of undertaking qualitative analyses of observed records. 18 page(s...|$|E
