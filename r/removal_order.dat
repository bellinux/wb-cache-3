5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to see the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak {{for more than an hour}} about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the <b>removal</b> <b>order</b> would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2008, ICE {{successfully}} removed Sarafat Mohamed to Egypt. Mohamed was an Imam for the Hoda Islamic Center in Gainesville, Florida. Mohamed {{entered the}} United States on October 26, 1999 on a non-immigrant religious worker visa. He later obtained a special immigrant religious worker visa. He applied {{to become a}} lawful permanent resident in 2001. The FBI interviewed Mohamed in 2005. Mohamed confessed to the FBI {{that he was a}} founding member of Takfir wal-Hijra (TWH). TWH was an Egyptian-based terrorist organization responsible for the 1977 kidnapping and murder of the Egyptian Minister of Islamic Endowment, Mohamed Hussain al-Zahabi. TWH was notable because, unlike many other radical Islamic groups, it did not refrain from murdering other Muslims. Though Mohamed denied any role in the murder, he admitted to being a recruiter for TWH. He also admitted that he served as the religious leader for TWH. After the murder, Egyptian authorities arrested many members of TWH, including Mohamed. He was convicted for his membership in the organization and served a 20-year prison sentence. Mohamed failed to include his arrest and conviction in his application to become a lawful permanent resident of the United States. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services denied Mohamed’s residency application and placed him in removal proceedings, charging him with lying in order to gain an immigration benefit. ICE vigorously sought a <b>removal</b> <b>order</b> in immigration court. Over the strong objections of ICE, an immigration judge in Miami granted Mohamed’s request to become a lawful permanent resident. ICE successfully appealed this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The Board agreed with ICE and reversed the ruling of the immigration judge. The Board ordered the removal of Mohamed on July 30, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Even {{with the}} {{treaties}} of 1837 and 1842, leaders worried about Ojibwa removal. Buffalo kept in constant {{contact with the}} other bands to ensure the Ojibwa upheld their obligations. He sent runners to all the bands to report back on any conduct by the Ojibwa that could construed as grounds for removal. Nothing was reported. But, President Zachary Taylor signed the <b>removal</b> <b>order</b> on February 6, 1850, under corrupt circumstances, claiming to be protecting the Ojibwa from [...] "injurious" [...] whites. [...] The Wisconsin legislature resisted the order and put aside plans for removal. Alexander Ramsey, the territorial governor of Minnesota, and Indian sub-agent John Watrous conspired {{on a plan to}} force the Ojibwa to Minnesota anyway, as the two men stood to gain personal economic and political benefits from removal.|$|E

2500|$|When a court {{establishes}} that {{a public}} authority's decision has breached a legitimate expectation, it may annul {{the decision and}} order that the authority fulfil the expectation. A decision is invalidated by the issuance of a quashing order (also known as certiorari), {{one of the more}} common prerogative orders, and often results in the issue returning to the original body to be reconsidered afresh. For example, in Ng Yuen Shiu, a representation was made by the Director of Immigration that each illegal entrant to Hong Kong from Macau, of whom the applicant was one, would be interviewed with each case treated on its merits before a decision was made whether to deport the entrant. However, the applicant was not given an opportunity to make any representations. The Director's failure to provide the applicant with this chance was deemed a sufficient ground for quashing the decision. The Court of Appeal of Hong Kong had ordered a prohibition restraining the removal orders from being executed. However, the Privy Council [...] decided that a prohibition was excessive and issued a certiorari instead. It noted that the latter order did not prevent the Director from making a fresh <b>removal</b> <b>order</b> following a fair inquiry at which the applicant had been given an opportunity to explain why he should not be deported.|$|E

40|$|Part One of this Comment {{will examine}} the {{developments}} of the writ of habeas corpus {{throughout the history of}} the United States, beginning with the importance the Founding Fathers placed on the writ. This section will also examine the recent changes in federal court review of alien <b>removal</b> <b>orders,</b> beginning with the 1996 legislation and continuing with the REAL ID Act, along with the federal courts’ responses to those acts. Part Two will then examine the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush, addressing the meaning and purpose that Justice Kennedy attached to the writ of habeas corpus and the analytical approach he set forth to determine if a substitute is “adequate and effective. ” Part Three will then analyze whether the current system for review of alien <b>removal</b> <b>orders</b> comports with the guidelines set forth by Justice Kennedy in Boumediene. This section will draw comparisons between the Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) that the Court examined in Boumediene and the immigration hearings concerning alien <b>removal</b> <b>orders.</b> This section will then contrast the level of review provided to courts of appeals when reviewing alien <b>removal</b> <b>orders</b> with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia’s level of review over the CSRTs’ decisions. Finally, this section {{will examine the}} courts of appeals’ decisions since the passage of the REAL ID Act to determine whether the current system provides for adequate review in light of Boumediene. Part Four recommends the restoration of the right of aliens to seek habeas review of their <b>removal</b> <b>orders</b> due to the deficiencies in the earlier proceedings and the lack of “adequate and effective” review in the courts of appeals...|$|R

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of a withdrawal of {{application for admission}} is that it constitutes consent on the alien's part to the charges made in the Form I-275, and therefore {{makes it harder for}} the alien to challenge or appeal the finding.

50|$|Like {{withdrawal}} of {{application for admission}} and voluntary return, voluntary departure requires the alien to leave the United States, but does not put a <b>removal</b> <b>order</b> on the alien's record, thereby avoiding the bars to entry that a <b>removal</b> <b>order</b> would create. However, voluntary departure differs from the other processes in that its scope is not merely limited to arriving aliens. It can also apply to aliens who were admitted to the United States lawfully or entered unlawfully. Any days of unlawful presence acquired are not removed if the alien undergoes voluntary departure.|$|E
