40|$|It {{is common}} in {{evolutionary}} ecology to interpret body-condition indices as indicators of individual quality, but this hypothesized relationship has been questioned and remains poorly validated. Here, we test {{one of the fundamental}} predictions of this condition-quality hypothesis, that relative-condition indices are repeatable within individuals, that is, that the index score of an individual relative to others is consistent over time. We sampled crimson finches (Neochmia phaeton) for seven commonly used condition indices and tested whether individual condition relative to conspecifics in the same context (e. g., breeding stage) was repeatable. We calculated the relative indices’ repeatability across several temporal scales, from short (within breeding season) to long (more than 2 yr) time periods, as well as without consideration of timescale. Most relative-condition indices were repeatable when sampled without consideration of timescale, all were repeatable within a short time period, and none were repeatable over the longest time period. This provides only partial support for the condition-quality hypothesis, because although relative-condition indices were generally repeatable, this was primarily attributed to short-term, instead of long-term, <b>repeatability.</b> <b>Condition</b> indices may be meaningful indicators of short-term survival or fitness potential, but our findings are inconsistent with the idea that condition indices are indicators of inherent individual quality...|$|E

In order to enable the deployment of this measuring system in the developed procedure and in agreement with the centrality of metrology mentioned above, an investigation of white light interferometric microscopy has been carried out from a user perspective. In particular, two sources of variability were identified and experimentally quantified and the precision in <b>repeatability</b> <b>conditions</b> was estimated when measuring length along the z-axis in a pre-specified micro-metric range. A critical analysis of the calibration procedure built in the investigated microscope has also been conducted. In order to overcome the pitfalls discovered in such an analysis, a spline-based calibration procedure has been developed and demonstrated. In addition, the control methods needed for the practical usage of the proposed calibration procedure have been developed. Calibration studies are made possible by the provision of traceable reference materials. Therefore, a cost-effective and versatile {{procedure for}} the build ing of traceable reference samples of length in the micrometric range was developed. The proposed method used standard gauge blocks commonly found in metrology laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the reproducibility of the sphero-cylindrical prescriptions provided by 40 optometrists. Methods: Forty registered optometrists {{were randomly selected}} from the cities of Oxford and Westminster in the UK to perform a sphero-cylindrical refraction on an asymptomatic 29 -year-old male subject. The 95 % limits of reproducibility for each component of refraction were assessed and are presented together with scatterplots, distribution ellipsoids and polar profiles of dioptric power. Results: The mean stigmatic (spherical equivalent) refraction for the right eye was) 0. 83 D (S. D. = 0. 28 D) with 95 % limits of agreement) 1. 38 and) 0. 28 D. The 95 % reproducibility limits for stigmatic data [1 : 96 ð ffiffiffi 2 p ÞðS. D. Þ] was 0. 78 D. The average inter-ocular difference in the stigmatic components of refraction was) 0. 044 D (S. D. = 0. 20 D) but estimates ranged from) 0. 50 to + 0. 50 D. Mean ortho- and oblique antistigmatic refractions were) 0. 23 D (S. D. = 0. 084 D) and) 0. 14 D (S. D. = 0. 086 D) respectively. Conclusions: The findings of this paper suggest that refractions performed by multiple optometrists on a single eye will differ in their stigmatic component by over 0. 78 D on average not more than once in 20 refractions. The reproducibility of refractions reported here, approximately twice as variable as those reported under <b>repeatability</b> <b>conditions,</b> has profound implications for the analysis of refractive data collected by multiple optometrists over the course of replication, longitudinal and epidemiolog-ical studies...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} CCQM-P 60 {{pilot study}} involving 8 national metrological institutes was organised to investigate if the quantification of GM maize powder by real-time PCR {{was affected by}} the DNA extraction methods applied. Four commonly used extraction methods were compared for the extraction of DNA from a corn Bt 176 maize powder. Extracts were assessed for DNA yield using a fluorescent-based DNA quantification assay and for quality measuring their absorbance ratios at 260 nm / 280 nm and 260 nm / 230 nm. The CTAB-based method yielded the highest quantity and DNA template quality. A difference in the 260 nm / 230 nm absorbance ratio was observed among the different extraction methods. Real-time amplification of endogenous genes zein and hmg as well as trangenic sequences covering th cryIAb gene and a plant-Bt 176 junction fragment {{were used to determine}} the GM percentage. The detection of the transgenic gene was affected by {{the quantity and quality of}} template used for the PCR reaction. An underestimation of the GM percentage was observed by all laboratories for the highest concentration of DNA template suggesting an inhibition in the amplification of the GM targets. That inhibition could be avoided by additional clean up of the DNA template. The Bt 176 percentages measured on diluted or purified templates were statistically different depending on the extraction method applied. The relative measurement uncertainty under <b>repeatability</b> <b>conditions</b> was lower than 25 % and represents most probably the best level which can be presently achieved for such amplification technologies.

40|$|Estimation of the {{uncertainty}} is an essential requisite for high-end measurement systems. In this communication we derive an expression to evaluate the standard uncertainty of the phase-difference measurements resulting from Fourier and quasi-Fourier transform digital holographic interferometry. We apply the law of propagation of uncertainty, as defined in the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement” (GUM), to the digital reconstruction of two holograms by Fourier transformation and to the subsequent calculation of the phase change between the holographic reconstructions. The resulting expression allows the evaluation of {{the uncertainty}} of the phase difference at every pixel in the reconstruction plane in terms of the measured hologram brightness values and their uncertainty at the whole of the pixels of the original digital holograms. This expression is simplified by assuming a linear dependence between the uncertainty and the local value of the original holograms; in that case, the local uncertainty of the phase difference can be evaluated from the local complex values of the reconstructed holograms. We assess the behavior of the method by comparing the predicted standard uncertainty with the sample variance obtained from experiments conducted under <b>repeatability</b> <b>conditions,</b> and found a good correlation between both quantities. This experimental procedure can be also used to calibrate the parameters of the linear function relating the uncertainty with the local value of the digital holograms, for a given set of operational conditions of the acquisition device.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the intermachine reliability attained from devices used to measure the common variables in sports performance. <b>Repeatability</b> <b>conditions</b> were established by creating a similar set of conditions under which the measurements were taken from both devices. The objectives of this research were to demonstrate the reliability between two devices in a bench press movement—the linear position measuring device (LPM) isoinertial dynamometer (T-Force) and the 3 D (Myotest) accelerometer (AC) —and to compare the existing correlations between maximum velocity, maximum estimated strength, and peak power estimate variables in the bench press exercise. Forty bench press exercise trials were analyzed simultaneously, performed by 3 different subjects (age: 26. 74 ± 1. 2 years, height: 175. 74 ± 4. 04 cm, weight: 78. 7 ± 3. 35 kg) at maximum velocity (25 kg additional load). Three simple linear regression models were developed, supplied by the LPM on the basis of the AC data. The assumption of independence of errors was compared by means of the Durban-Watson test, and partial autocorrelation coefficients were established at an overall p < 0. 05 significance level. It has not been possible to confirm the presence of a general correlation between the measurements of both devices. Regarding the assumption of independence of errors, the presence of generalized autocorrelation was confirmed. Linear regression analysis revealed an intermachine correlation in one of the nonconclusive cases, (peak power) variable and subject 1, r (10) = 0. 640, p = 0. 024. No partial autocorrelation was found. The devices should not be used interchangeably as instruments...|$|R
