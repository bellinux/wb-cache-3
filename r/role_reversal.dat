5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to be commentary on Apartheid in South Africa, using gender <b>role</b> <b>reversal.</b> However, there were problems between the cast and director during filming, and Patrick Stewart sought to have the sexist nature of the episode changed. The resulting episode was not well liked by members of the production team, and the response from reviewers was negative.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Murray {{appeared}} in their seventh and fourth Masters final and 19th and 17th career finals respectively. Djokovic led the head-to-head tally against Murray, but Murray {{had won the}} last two encounters between them. In the match, Murray moved into a 4–0 lead in the first set. Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A <b>role</b> <b>reversal</b> in the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4–1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5–5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win {{of the season and}} eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved fitness for his win. Djokovic, who had struggled with excessive heat in the past, struggled once again to assimilate with the temperature. He admitted that he was impatient early in the match, which resulted in him making too many unforced errors.|$|E

40|$|In “Thought Experiments and Utilitarianism”, {{which is}} a comment on my “Utilitarianism by Way of Preference Change?”, Krzysztof Saja delineates three {{alternative}} ways in which one might interpret Richard Hare’s famous thought experiments involving <b>role</b> <b>reversals.</b> He suggests that each of them would underwrite Hare’s claim that moral deliberation transforms an interpersonal conflict of preferences into an intrapersonal one, which obtains between the deliberator’s own preferences. In this reply to Saja (“Role Reversals”), I discuss the three proposals in turn and argue that the first two do not solve the problem. The third one, which was already considered in my original paper, is based on Zeno Vendler’s suggestion that <b>role</b> <b>reversals</b> in moral thought-experiments are merely different ‘takes’ on {{one and the same}} real situation, as seen from different subjective perspectives. I argue that, in order to succeed in transforming interpersonal preference conflicts into intrapersonal ones, this proposal requires equating empathy with sympathy, which Hare would not be prepared to do...|$|R
25|$|It is {{the first}} game to feature Princess Peach as the main playable character. In the game, Bowser has kidnapped Mario, Luigi, and Toad instead of Peach and holds them hostage on Vibe Island, but Toad escapes from Vibe Island to the Mushroom Kingdom. In a {{reversal}} of the damsel in distress trope, Princess Peach must go through eight worlds on Vibe Island to rescue Mario and Luigi. Despite being praised for its <b>role</b> <b>reversal</b> in the plot, the game was criticized for the nature of how Peach attacked, as well as the simple gameplay.

25|$|Feminist authors Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf {{write that}} women's sexual liberation led women to a <b>role</b> <b>reversal,</b> whereby they viewed men as sex objects, {{in a manner}} similar to what they criticize about men's {{treatment}} of women. Psychologist Harold Lyon suggests that men's liberation is a necessary step toward woman's liberation. This was especially apparent during the girl power era of the 1990s and early 2000s. Men are often objectified by other men. Research has suggested that the psychological effects of objectification on men are similar to those of women, leading to negative body image among men.|$|E

The French had attempted diversions with the bombardment of Brussels, but despite Boufflers' stout defence Namur finally fell on 5 September. The siege had cost the Allies {{a great deal in}} men and resources, and had pinned down William III's army through the whole summer campaign; but the recapture of Namur, together with the earlier prize of Huy, had restored the Allied position on the Meuse, and had secured communications between their armies in the Spanish Netherlands and those on the Moselle and Rhine.|$|E

25|$|This version {{agrees with}} all other {{versions}} of the legend of Hrothgar (Roas) and Halga (Helgo) by making them sons of Healfdene (Haldan) and by presenting Hrothgar as the uncle of Hroðulf (Rolfo). It agrees with Beowulf and Hrólfr Kraki's saga by mentioning {{that they had a}} sister, and by dealing with their feud with Froda (Frodo) and Ingeld (Ingjaldus), although there is a <b>role</b> <b>reversal</b> by making Ingeld the father of Froda instead of the other way round. It agrees with the other Scandinavian versions by treating Halga's incestuous relationship with his own daughter Yrsa. Moreover, it agrees {{with all other}} versions, except for Hrólfr Kraki's saga, by presenting Hrothgar as a king of Denmark, although it agrees with Hrólfr Kraki's saga by marrying Hrothgar to an Anglo-Saxon woman. Another agreement with Hrólfr Kraki's saga is the information that their sister was married to a Sævil Jarl, and that they had to hide on an island fleeing their kin-slaying uncle, before they could kill him and avenge their father.|$|E
25|$|The {{findings}} of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were released on March 2, 1993. Ultimately the investigation determined that the crew lost situational awareness, and though unsure of the air traffic control services being provided or their position, began an approach to Runway 5 from an excessive altitude and airspeed without completing the published approach procedures. Though critical of the performance of the flight crew, the report ultimately concluded that the probable cause was the failure of senior management of GP Express to provide adequate training and operational support for the startup of the southern operation, which resulted in the assignment of an inadequately prepared captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer in revenue passenger service and the failure of the flight crew to use approved instrument flight procedures, which resulted in a loss of situational awareness and terrain clearance. Contributing to the cause of the accident was GP Express’ failure to provide approach charts to each pilot and to establish stabilized approach criteria. Also contributing were the inadequate crew coordination and a <b>role</b> <b>reversal</b> {{on the part of the}} captain and first officer.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the typical}} adult club, dancing the [...] "opposite part" [...] is {{relatively}} uncommon.

30|$|Although {{biologists}} routinely {{label the}} animals as predator or prey, {{there are many}} examples of <b>role</b> <b>reversals</b> in predators and prey (anti-predator behaviors) [1 – 3]. That is, juvenile prey that escape from predation and become adult can counterattack juvenile predators, and adults just kill the juveniles but do not consume them, which can serve to reduce future predation risk [4]. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to evaluate the cyclic dominance for predator–prey interactions when anti-predator behaviors occur.|$|R
500|$|In psychodrama, {{participants}} explore internal conflicts {{by acting}} out their emotions and interpersonal interactions on stage.

25|$|Saturnalia is {{the best-known}} of several festivals in the Greco-Roman world {{characterized}} by <b>role</b> <b>reversals</b> and behavioral license.

30|$|But {{it is also}} {{a global}} {{experience}} that families are more diverse.

500|$|... "Milagro" [...] was {{inspired}} by the idea of someone thinking of something so much that it becomes a reality, a topic Shiban later noted was [...] "familiar" [...] to anyone who had written a script. The part of Phillip Padgett had been written specifically for the actor John Hawkes. In addition, the production for [...] "Milagro" [...] was decidedly low-budget due to its [...] "intimate and personality-driven" [...] nature. The episode's title means [...] "miracle" [...] in Spanish. The episode has been analyzed for its use of symbolism, its exploration of motive, and the <b>role</b> <b>reversal</b> of Mulder and Scully.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{presents}} a temporary <b>role</b> <b>reversal</b> for Mulder and Scully. When discussing {{the lack of}} evidence at the crime scenes, Scully points out that [...] "a crime is only as perfect as the man [...] Even if he made not one mistake, there still is a motive. If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E
500|$|The term sexual {{inversion}} implied gender <b>role</b> <b>reversal.</b> Female inverts were, to {{a greater}} or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally male pursuits and dress; according to Krafft-Ebing, they had a [...] "masculine soul". Krafft-Ebing believed that the most extreme inverts also exhibited reversal of secondary sex characteristics; Ellis's research had not demonstrated any such physical differences, but he devoted a great deal of study to the search for them. The idea appears in The Well in Stephen's unusual proportions at birth and in the scene set at Valerie Seymour's salon, where [...] "the timbre of a voice, the build of an ankle, the texture of a hand" [...] reveals the inversion of the guests.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to NEQUA and other early feminist works, The Sultana's Dream (1905), by Bengali Muslim feminist Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain, engages with the limited {{role of women}} in colonial India. Through depicting a gender-reversed purdah in an alternate technologically futuristic world, Hussain illustrates the potential for cultural insights through <b>role</b> <b>reversals</b> early on in the subgenre's formation. Along these same lines, Charlotte Perkins Gilman explores and critiques the expectations of women and men by creating a single-sex world in Herland (1915).|$|R
50|$|Chantek also {{demonstrated}} self-awareness, by grooming {{himself in a}} mirror and by using signs in mental planning and deception. Rather than simply exhibiting conditioned responses, as critics of primate intellect contend, Chantek learned roles - and <b>role</b> <b>reversals</b> - in games like 'Simon Says'. Like many other orangutans who have demonstrated problem solving skills, Chantek exhibited certain intuitive and thinking character traits comparable to the rationality used in human engineering. His intellectual and linguistic abilities made some scientists, including Miles and Dawn Prince-Hughes, regard him as possessing personhood.|$|R
