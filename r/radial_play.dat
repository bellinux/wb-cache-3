Assembly and in situ service requirements necessitate a radial expanding seal design; which is preloaded to generate enough radial pressure {{so that there is}} no leakage {{and at the same time}} control its expansion so as not deform into plastic range and thus hinder seal extraction in service. The objective of this paper is to put forward, a mathematical relationship between clamp load and radial / axial bearing pressure which allows design engineer to assess effect of <b>radial</b> <b>play,</b> friction, seal wedge angle and the preload requirement. A design engineer will be able to decide on dimensions and the taper angle along with the bolt system dimensions at a very early stage of design and be sure of his design concept.

To remove backlash, an anti-backlash mechanism insures that the teeth are always in contact. A circular tube passes through two large bearings, allowing the device to rotate. These bearings are preloaded to reduce bearing <b>radial</b> <b>play.</b> The preload mechanism also allows for differential temperature expansion between the rotating tube and the device's mounting plate.

However, most of these works are performed in laboratory environments and there are hardly any published works on in-service application. In this study, we present an experience in diagnosis of a helicopter gearbox bearing using actual service data gathered from AH 64 D helicopters belonging to the Republic of Singapore Air Force. A number of helicopters have been found with grease leak and <b>radial</b> <b>play</b> in the tail rotor gearbox output shaft during field maintenance. Subsequent tear-down inspections of the tail rotor gearboxes revealed that they had similar defects of bearing race spalling and widespread pitting of the rolling elements. Spectral analysis was carried out on the accelerometer data from these helicopters and correlated with the tear-down inspection findings. The fault patterns exhibited correspond well to progressing stages of bearing wear and are consistent across defective gearboxes from different helicopters. It is demonstrated that simple spectral analysis can be effective in tracking progressive stages of bearing damage using both low-frequency and high-frequency bandwidths. The observed fault patterns are extracted as features for diagnosis and used to determine the bearings' estimated time to failure for maintenance planning...|$|E
