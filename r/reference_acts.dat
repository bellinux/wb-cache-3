The trial of Paul is generally assumed {{to be in the}} earlier part of Gallio's tenure, based on the <b>reference</b> (<b>Acts</b> 18:2) to his meeting in Corinth with Priscilla and Aquila, who had been recently expelled from Rome based on Emperor Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome, which is dated to AD 49-50.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{traditionally}} {{claimed by}} some western {{scholars such as}} the Universalist historian George T. Knight (1911) and Pierre Batiffol (English translation 1914) that a form of universal salvation could be found among some theologians in early Christianity. Origen interpreted the New Testament's <b>reference</b> (<b>Acts</b> 3:21) to a [...] "restoration of all things", (Greek: apocatastasis of all things), as meaning that sinners might be restored to God and released from Hell, returning the universe to a state identical to its pure beginnings. This theory of apocatastasis could be easily interpreted to imply that even devils would be saved, {{as was the case}} during the later Origenist controversies. Greek orthodox scholars do not count Gregory of Nyssa (A.D. 331-395) as a believer in Universal Salvation.|$|E
50|$|Theoretical {{lexicography}} {{concerns the}} same aspects as lexicography, but aims to develop principles that {{can improve the}} quality of future dictionaries, for instance in terms of access to data and lexicographic information costs. Several perspectives or branches of such academic dictionary research have been distinguished: 'dictionary criticism' (or evaluating the quality of one or more dictionaries, e.g. by means of reviews (see Nielsen 1999)), 'dictionary history' (or tracing the traditions of a type of dictionary or of lexicography in a particular country or language), 'dictionary typology' (or classifying the various genres of reference works, such as dictionary versus encyclopedia, monolingual versus bilingual dictionary, general versus technical or pedagogical dictionary), 'dictionary structure' (or formatting the various ways in which the information is presented in a dictionary), 'dictionary use' (or observing the <b>reference</b> <b>acts</b> and skills of dictionary users), and 'dictionary IT' (or applying computer aids to the process of dictionary compilation).|$|E

50|$|Chickering in {{addition}} to helping facilitate the rehabilitation of women at the Dedham Asylum, continued to visit women in prisons and correctional institutions all over the State of Massachusetts. During her visits, Chickering continued to witness the lack of reform, degrading treatment and minimal security provided to female inmates, particularly the treatment of female prisoners {{at the hands of}} male guards as well as the male inmates caught her attention. Chickering argued that treatment of women prisoners by the officers and male inmates was degrading, a term used specifically by 19th century women prison reformers to <b>reference</b> <b>acts</b> of rape and sexual assault. For these reasons, Chickering saw the urgent need for separate prison facilities for women, which she argued should employ an all female staff to ensure not only protection from sexual attack, but to facilitate the rehabilitation programs for the female prisoners during their incarceration. On November 27, 1869, Chickering held a public meeting at St. Paul's Chapel in Dedham, to propose the need for separate prisons for women, it was at this meeting that a committee of five men and two women was formed to help see Chickering's proposal realized. The Committee finally presented their proposed plan for a women's prison in February 24, 1871, at a hearing before the Massachusetts Legislative Prison Committee at the State House in Boston. The bill for separate prisons for women finally passed 1874, after previously being defeated many times and many signed petitions, Chickering had succeeded in her efforts. However, Chickering's work was not over, as she was very involved in the execution and planning of what would ultimately be the opening in 1877 of the Reformatory of Women at Sherborn, MA.|$|E

40|$|In an explorative {{study on}} German oral corpus data we {{investigate}} recognitional use of proximal demonstratives {{as a means}} of explicit speaker-hearer interaction shaping the discourse structure. We show that recognitionals mark tentative <b>reference</b> <b>acts</b> in that speakers suggest - or pretend - mutual knowledge of the referent, at the same time appealing to the hearers to accept the reference. Hearers may tacitly or explicitly accept the referential act or deny it asking for clarification, in the latter case making speakers change the intended local discourse topic. On these grounds we argue against a differentiation between recognitional and indefinite demonstratives, subsuming both as kinds of recognitional use under ‘pretended’ cognitive proximity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{emphasizes}} the importance of empirical research on dictionary users and, in particular, investigates the effect of the so-called "menu " (a list of definitions {{at the beginning of a}} polysemous article) on EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners ' dictionary look-up pro-cesses. The menu has been increasingly popular in English leamer's dictionaries in Japan, but no empirical evidence has ever shown that it is really effective for <b>reference</b> <b>acts.</b> Two groups of sub-jects with different levels of reference skills were observed looking up given information in two different types of mini-dictionaries, one with and the other withnut the menu. The results showed that the menu was not so effective for skilled users, but that it helped the less skilled users find the appropriate information...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} examine the possible impact of an engineering design and problem solving process overview document on knowledge management and capture. A process overview document was first created. Next, two multi-disciplinary design teams worked over a two-week span to develop concepts to address a problematic opportunity. One group {{had access to the}} overview document, while the control group did not. Two hypotheses, related to the number of times individuals checked available reference material, were tested. In particular, groups that had access to the overview document were expected to have more <b>reference</b> <b>acts.</b> Results of the hypotheses tests found an absence of statistical significance. Additionally, data gathered to answer five research questions indicate some favorable characteristics to the overview document’s diffusion as an innovation. An experimental model was established upon which future generalizable experiments can be based, and a second design process model was developed for further study...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{functions}} of language is to refer to objects in a shared scene. Modeling reference with continuous representations is challenging because it requires individuation, i. e., tracking and distinguishing an arbitrary number of referents. We introduce a neural network model that, given a de nite description and a set of objects represented by natural images, points to the intended object if the expression has a unique referent, or indicates a failure, if it does not. The model, directly trained on <b>reference</b> <b>acts,</b> is competitive with a pipeline manually engineered to perform the same task, both when referents are purely visual, and when they are characterized by a combination of visual and linguistic properties.
