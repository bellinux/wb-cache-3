Joey Castillo played for Eagles of Death Metal on their Heart On tour.

Josh Homme formed supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones. After Them Crooked Vultures finished touring in June, the band toured and released a two-CD deluxe edition of Rated R on August 3, 2010. This edition featured the original CD along with six B-sides and live recordings from the band's <b>Reading</b> <b>performance</b> in 2000.|$|E
25|$|When <b>reading</b> <b>performance</b> {{figures it}} {{should always be}} borne in mind that weight, the {{aerodynamic}} drag generated by different external fittings, {{the condition of the}} airframe and/or engine, and all sorts of other factors could influence how an aircraft performed. For example, the P-51's laminar flow wings needed to be kept as clean and smooth as possible; even relatively minor damage on the wing leading edges could drastically reduce top speed. The most accurate performance figures for the P-51 came from tests carried out at facilities such as the USAAF's Flight Test Engineering Branch, based at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio and, for the RAF, the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A), based at Boscombe Down. North American Aviation carried out their own performance tests, as did the only other manufacturer of the P-51, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) of Australia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Data {{deduplication}} {{has recently}} become common-place in most secondary storage {{and even in}} some primary storage for the capacity optimization purpose. Aside from its write <b>performance,</b> <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> of the deduplication storage has been gaining in significance {{with a wide range}} of its deployments. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> in reconstituting a data stream from its unique and shared chunks physically dispersed over deduplica-tion storage. We newly introduce a <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> indicator called Chunk Fragmentation Level (CFL). We also validate that the CFL is very effective to indicate <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> of dedu-plication storage through a developed theoretical performance model and extensive experiments. Finally, we articulate further research issues. Keywords-storage; deduplication; read performance; frag...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to propose {{improvements}} in long-term disk <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> for large-scale high-end storage systems. To accomplish this goal, we first describe access patterns in long-term data.

To address this issue, we develop a new layout policy and demonstrate that it improves <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> over other commonly used layout policies. Finally, we discuss trends in high-end storage systems and how the file system-storage system interface can be improved based on the observed access patterns. ...|$|R

30|$|Although {{performance}} is often considered an isolated quality attribute, <b>read</b> and write <b>performance</b> can be different. This difference {{is reflected in}} our table, and {{it is interesting to}} analyse the performance quality attribute as a whole with the data presented in the table. Most NoSQL databases polarize on performance characteristics, either having high ratings on <b>read</b> or write <b>performance</b> (Cassandra, Couchbase, HBase and MongoDB), but there are some exceptions. Aerospike provides a balance between write and <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> without reaching the “Great” rating in either of these quality attributes. On the other hand, Voldemort provides high write performance (“Great”) and good <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> (“Good”), while Couchbase offers good write performance (“Good”), but high <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> (“Great”). This implies that software engineers can look to Voldemort, Couchbase and Aerospike as “balanced” systems in terms of performance, with Voldemort and Couchbase tending slightly towards more specific write or read scenarios, respectively.|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2013. Major: Computer science. Advisor: David Hung-Chang Du. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 41 pages. Data deduplication, an efficient technique to eliminate redundant bytes {{in the data}} to be stored, is largely used in data backup and disaster recovery. This elimination is achieved by chunking the data and identifying the duplicate chunks. Along with data reduction it also delivers commendable backup and restore speeds. While backup process pertains to write process, the restore process defines the read process of a dedupe system. With much emphasis and analysis being made to expedite the write process, the <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> of a dedupe system is still a slower process comparatively. This work proposes a method to improve the <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> by investigating the recently accessed chunks and their locality in the backup set (datastream). Based on this study {{of the distribution of}} chunks in the datastream, few chunks are identified that need to be accumulated and stored to serve the future read requests better. This identification and accumulation happen on cached chunks. By this a small degree of duplication of the deduplicated data is introduced, but by later caching them together during the restore of the same datastream, the <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> is improved. Finally the <b>read</b> <b>performance</b> results obtained through experiments with trace datasets are presented and analyzed to evaluate the design...|$|R

We show by simulations that our algorithm yields more than 99 % of tags being successfully identified, along with trying to maximize the average speed of the conveyor belt. In addition, the algorithm can be applied for different reader’s ranges. C I...|$|R
