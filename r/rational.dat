5|$|Kant {{believed}} that morality is the objective law of reason: just as objective physical laws necessitate physical actions (apples fall {{down because of}} gravity, for example), objective <b>rational</b> laws necessitate <b>rational</b> actions. He thus {{believed that}} a perfectly <b>rational</b> being must also be perfectly moral because a perfectly <b>rational</b> being subjectively finds it necessary {{to do what is}} rationally necessary. Because humans are not perfectly <b>rational</b> (they partly act by instinct), Kant believed that humans must conform their subjective will with objective <b>rational</b> laws, which he called conformity obligation. Kant argued that the objective law of reason is a priori, existing externally from <b>rational</b> being. Just as physical laws exist prior to physical beings, <b>rational</b> laws (morality) exist prior to <b>rational</b> beings. Therefore, according to Kant, <b>rational</b> morality is universal and cannot change depending on circumstance.|$|E

5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} <b>rational</b> nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the <b>rational</b> nexus test, as a classification can still bear a <b>rational</b> relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E

5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be <b>rational</b> or participation in a generally <b>rational</b> species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not <b>rational</b> because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a <b>rational</b> adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} <b>rational</b> beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, {{requiring}} that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A <b>rational</b> being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a <b>rational</b> necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all <b>rational</b> agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being <b>rational</b> agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being <b>rational</b> agents; therefore, <b>rational</b> moral principles apply to all <b>rational</b> agents at all times.|$|E

5|$|Kant's Formula of Autonomy {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their <b>rational</b> will, rather than any outside influence. Kant {{believed}} that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a <b>rational</b> will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly.

5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that women should be educated in a <b>rational</b> manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of <b>rational</b> or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of <b>rational</b> thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E
