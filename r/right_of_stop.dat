60|$|I would I {{might give}} you some notion of the great artery of London in those days, for it has changed much since I went down it that heavy morning in April, 1770, {{fighting}} my way. Ay, truly, fighting my way, for the street then {{was no place for}} the weak and timid, when bullocks ran through it in droves on the way to market, when it was often jammed from wall to wall with wagons, and carmen and truckmen and coachmen swung their whips and cursed one another to the extent of their lungs. Near St. Clement Danes I was packed in a crowd for ten minutes while two of these fellows formed a ring and fought for the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> way, <b>stopping</b> the traffic as far as I could see. Dustmen, and sweeps, and even beggars, jostled you on the corners, bullies tried to push you against the posts or into the kennels; and once, in Butchers' Row, I was stopped by a flashy, soft-tongued fellow who would have lured me into a tavern near by.|$|R

40|$|René Tarin : L'Esclavage des noirs and Olympe de Gouges' Guilty Conscience. In December 1789 the Théâtre de la Nation staged L'Esclavage des noirs ou l'heureux naufrage, by Olympe de Gouges. This {{production}} {{was not a}} success, but like all her works the play was noteworthy for the unrest and scuffles it occasioned. The colonial lobby {{saw it as a}} threat. Some denounced the author's subversive aims; did men declared free by the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>stop</b> being free in the colonies ? Olympe de Gouges' play is part of the debate on the colonial issue, a major political question in the period 1789 - 1794, and it illustrates what was at stake and the contradictions of the debate.

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis is still evolving, {{at least from}} the point of view of some features making the entire process of its reversing very difficult - uncertainties, confusions and lack of investors` trust. More then that, every rim of the Atlantic Ocean has its own opinion as to the timing of the exit stimulus measures. There are prevailing risks taken into consideration when we talk about the next stage of the economic growth e. g. its sustainability on a log run or inflaming the inflation. It is for sure, that according to the core economic policies practiced either in USA or Europe, in Europe what count most is the danger of the inflation, if the <b>right</b> time <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> the flood <b>of</b> the governmental funds to the real economy is not well chosen. The economic situation in Europe, as all over the world, in spite of some signs that the economy is on the right track (South East Asia, USA or Germany), there are a lot of doubts as to the assurance that recession is over and there is no way for an immediate return. Notabilities in economics see that governmental intervention should be continued, just because the economic growth consigned by statistics is not convincing. Convictions, if they exist, are blended with a lot of obsessions which in my opinion are making up a serious agenda of the debates in Europe: budgetary deficit in excess, danger of the inflation, new regulation of the financial sector, credibility of the euro zone. Romania has to be involved in all these debates as it is passing through all the mentioned difficulties which need solutions within the frame of European standards, as a member of the EU. ...|$|R

500|$|The New Zealand advance was {{obstructed}} by uncut {{barbed wire}} on the Wallemolen spur; the creeping barrage was very thin, as some guns were bogged {{and others had}} been knocked out by German artillery.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamp intensity, area, and aspect ratio on reaction time. Recent trends in auto body styling have begun to incorporate center high-mounted stop lamps (CHMSLs) into spoilers and trunk lids. These developments, brought on in part by technical advances in automotive lighting, have resulted in questions about the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps whose effective luminous area is long and narrow. Subjects in this study were asked to perform a computer-based tracking task to control their eye fixations, and to provide the approximate cognitive loading associated with driving, while responding to the onset <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps <b>of</b> varying characteristics. The results of this laboratory study indicate that aspect ratio and intensity <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps, as well as their interaction, influence reaction time. Specifically, subject reaction times to the onset <b>of</b> simulated <b>stop</b> lamps were longer when the stimulus intensity was low and the aspect ratio was large. These results suggest that further empirical investigation that examines intensity, area, and aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps in the context of the total rear-signaling system is required to determine whether regulation affecting the aspect ratio <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> lamps or CHMSLs is warranted...|$|R

However, these genes are much shorter (average 848 bp, 50 % G+C) than those in the left two-thirds of the genome (average 1462 bp, 70 % G+C). Whole genome alignment of several viruses indicates that the initial ultra-low G+C region appeared in the common ancestor of the genera Cytomegalovirus and Muromegalovirus, and that the lowering of G+C in the right third has been a subsequent process in the lineage leading to RCMV. The left two-thirds <b>of</b> RCMV has <b>stop</b> codon occurrences at 67. 5 % of their expected level, based on a modified Markov chain model <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> codon distribution, and the corresponding figure for the right third is 78 %.

2500|$|Another {{major issue}} {{surrounding}} the use <b>of</b> <b>stop</b> signs {{pertains to the}} public's variegated understanding of their meaning. One prolific source of crashes is the misconception of law that every motorist who attempts to enter a main highway from a side road, does so {{at his or her}} peril.
