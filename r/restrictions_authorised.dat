The reduced rainfall impacted negatively on urban water supplies for the area. In 2009 the Member of the Executive Committee (MEC) for Local Government in the province requested that George Municipality draw up specific measures to be implemented when water resources (in dams and rivers) dropped to certain levels. Plans for possible future drought situations, periods of low rainfall, or insufficient raw water resources, have been done put in place for the needs of the residents of the focus area. The research problem of this study encompasses the assessment of the interventions put in place to address the shortage of water, particularly the implementation thereof, and the strategies and mitigations that contributed to the alleviation of the water shortage. The core objective of the research was to investigate the implementation of the water interventions (water <b>restrictions)</b> <b>authorised</b> to address the water shortages in George, in November 2009. This study employed a qualitative research approach where in-depth interviews were conducted with purposely selected individuals employed in the George Municipality Civil Engineering Services Department, and its Water Services and Disaster Department sections as they could provide first-hand information on the measures implemented to alleviate the problem and on the water shortage status. The research findings indicate that many short-term strategies provided a substantial reduction in overall water usage. The implementation of the strategies and mitigation measures were useful to the various departments in the George Municipality in tangible ways to help manage the water shortages. George Municipality should continue to market water restriction awareness to the public even though the George is no longer experiencing water shortages. The Municipality should adapt to deal with longer and more frequent periods of water shortages. Available tools (e. g. drought policy and by-laws) should be revised and adapted to establish appropriate measures under changing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Preterms and {{neonates}} on a neonatal {{intensive care}} unit are particularly susceptible to colonization and subsequent endogenous infection with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Due to numerous factors of these patients that could inhibit decolonization (nasogastric tubes, arterial/venous lines etc.), {{it is unclear how}} effective an attempt of MRSA decolonization in the hospital setting could be. Potential drugs for decolonization are not, or only with <b>restrictions,</b> <b>authorised</b> for preterms and neonates. The aim of this paper was to identify parameters that can influence the MRSA-status in the initial phase of colonization and to determine the effect of an attempt of decolonization on the MRSA-status and prevention of infection. Possible side effects will be analysed. Methods The retrospective analysis included 50 preterms and neonates with detection of MRSA of Charité University Medicine Berlin´s neonatal units. A portion of the children were treated with the following drugs for decolonization for five days: 0, 05 % octenidine-solution as a whole body wash and rinse of the oral cavity, mupirocin nasal ointment and for 10 days oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Side effects were documented on special surveillance sheets. Part 1 : Retrospective cohort study: Comparison of MRSA-negative children (at least 3 negative swabs) with still MRSA-positive children on day 14 after first detection of MRSA on the basis of possible influencing parameters Part 2 : Retrospective cohort study: Comparison of all children with an attempt of decolonization regarding subsequent MRSA-status and prevention of infection Part 3 : Analysis of potential side effects Results 11 of 50 children (22 %) lost the pathogen by the 14 th day after first detection. 8 of 11 (73 %) preterms and neonates that were MRSA-negative on that cut off date had undergone an attempt of decolonization in the period before (vs. 20 of 39 (51 %) children being MRSA-positive on that date). This result is not significant in univariate and multivariate analysis. 3 out of 22 children (14 %) without any attempt of decolonization also lost the pathogen within the first two weeks. That can be compared to 8 out of 28 children (29 %) with an attempt of decolonization in this period of time. 9 of 34 children (26 %) with an attempt of decolonization became MRSA-negative afterwards, only 4 (12 %) of them stayed negative until the end of follow-up (lasting for 291 days as a median after start of decolonization). The analysis of possible risk factors for decolonization failure showed no significant result. The whole body wash reduced the children´s body temperature by 0, 4 °C as a median (p< 0, 001). This effect could be observed in spite of thermoprotective measures but it was without clinically relevant consequences. Obstructed nasal airways and skin reactions appeared during decolonization, but a control group was missing. Conclusion MRSA decolonization of preterms and neonates in a hospital setting seems to be less promising for the individual child than previously reported. Children have to be protected against loss of body temperature during the body wash of the decolonization regimen. Decolonization of preterms and neonates might have a lot of potential regarding a reduction of colonization pressure and prevention of infection...|$|E
