40|$|The molar {{fractions}} of guanine plus cytosine (GC) in DNA were determined for 36 yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) which almost completely cover human chromosome band Xq 28, a terminal <b>reverse</b> <b>band,</b> corresponding to about 8 Mb of DNA. This allowed {{the construction of}} the most complete compositional map to date of a chromosomal band; three regions were observed: (i) a proximal 3. 5 -Mb region formed by GC-poor L and GC-rich H 1 isochores; (ii) a middle 2, 2 -Mb region essentially formed by a GC-rich H 2 isochore and a very GC-rich H 3 isochore separated by a GC-poor L isochore, YACs from this region being characterized by a striking compositional heterogeneity and instability; and (iii) a distal 1. 3 -Mb region exclusively formed by GC-poor L isochores. Gene and CpG island concentrations increased with the GC levels of the isochores, as expected. Xq 28 exemplifies a subset of <b>reverse</b> <b>bands</b> which are different from the two other subsets, namely from telomeric bands, which are characterized by specific cytogenetic properties and by the predominance of H 2 and H 3 isochores, and from the majority of <b>reverse</b> <b>bands,</b> which do not contain H 2 and H 3 isochores...|$|R

40|$|The {{bi-directional}} {{use of frequencies}} {{allocated for}} space communications {{has the potential to}} double the orbit/spectrum capacity available. The technical feasibility of <b>reverse</b> <b>band</b> use (RBU) at C-band (4 GHz uplinks and 6 GHz downlinks) is studied. The analysis identifies the constraints under which both forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>band</b> use satellite systems can share the same frequencies with terrestrial, line of sight transmission systems. The results of the analysis show that RBU satellite systems can be similarly sized to forward band use (FBU) satellite systems. In addition, the orbital separation requirements between RBU and FBU satellite systems are examined. The analysis shows that a carrier to interference ratio of 45 dB can be maintained between RBU and FBU satellites separated by less than 0. 5 deg, and that A carrier to interference ratio of 42 dB can be maintained in the antipodal case. Rain scatter propagation analysis shows that RBU and FBU earth stations require separation distances of less than 10 km at a rain rate of 13. 5 mm/hr escalating to less than 100 km at a rain rate of 178 mm/hr for earth station antennas in the 3 to 10 m range...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} {{has been}} used to demonstrate the differential distribution of interspersed repetitive elements in the genome of Mus musculus domesticus.

Because prophase and prometaphase chromosomes are more extended than metaphase chromosomes, the number of bands observable for all chromosomes increases from about 300 to 450 to as many as 800. This allows the detection of less obvious abnormalities usually not seen with conventional banding.|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{eukaryotic}} nuclei contain 10 – 30 prominent domains (referred to here as SC- 35 domains) {{that are}} concentrated in mRNA metabolic factors. Here, we show that multiple specific genes cluster around a common SC- 35 domain, which contains multiple mRNAs. Nonsyntenic genes are capable of associating with a common domain, but domain “choice” appears random, even for two coordinately expressed genes. Active genes widely separated on different chromosome arms associate with the same domain frequently, assorting randomly into the 3 – 4 subregions of the chromosome periphery that contact a domain. Most importantly, visualization of six individual chromosome bands showed that large genomic segments (∼ 5 Mb) have striking differences in organization relative to domains. Certain bands showed extensive contact, often aligning with or encircling an SC- 35 domain, whereas others did not. All three gene-rich <b>reverse</b> <b>bands</b> showed this more than the gene-poor Giemsa dark bands, and morphometric analyses demonstrated statistically significant differences. Similarly, late-replicating DNA generally avoids SC- 35 domains. These findings suggest a functional rationale for gene clustering in chromosomal bands, which relates to nuclear clustering of genes with SC- 35 domains. Rather than random reservoirs of splicing factors, or factors accumulated on an individual highly active gene, we propose a model of SC- 35 domains as functional centers for a multitude of clustered genes, forming local euchromatic “neighborhoods. ...|$|R

The C-banding patterns that were obtained with the standard BSG technique revealed only few minor bands on heterologous positions of the L. longiflorum and L. rubellum chromo-somes. FISH of the 5 S and 45 S rDNA probes on L. longiflorum metaphase complements showed overlapping signals at proximal positions of the short arms of chromosomes 4 and 7, a single 5 S rDNA signal on the secondary constriction of chromosome 3, and one 45 S rDNA signal adjacent to the 5 S rDNA signal on the subdistal part of the long arm of chromosome 3. In L. rubellum, we observed co-localisation of the 5 S and 45 S rDNA sequences on the short arm of chromosomes 2 and 4 and on the long arms of chromosomes 2 and 3, and two adjacent bands on chromosome 12. Silver staining (Ag–NOR) of the nucleoli and NORs in L. longiflorum and L. rubellum yielded a highly variable num-ber of signals in interphase nuclei and only a few faint silver deposits on the NORs of mitotic metaphase chromo-somes.
