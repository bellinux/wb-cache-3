5000|$|A corner {{reflector}} antenna {{is a type of}} directional antenna used at VHF and UHF frequencies. It was invented by John D. Kraus in 1938. It consists of a dipole driven element mounted in front of two flat rectangular <b>reflecting</b> <b>screens</b> joined at an angle, usually 90°. [...] Corner reflectors have moderate gain of 10-15 dB, high front-to-back ratio of 20-30 dB, and wide bandwidth. They are widely used for UHF television receiving antennas, point-to-point communication links and data links for wireless WANs, and amateur radio antennas on the 144, 420, and 1296 MHz bands.

Because its huge circular <b>reflecting</b> <b>screen</b> looks like a circular fence, the antenna has been colloquially referred to as the elephant cage.

50|$|A {{planar array}} with a <b>reflecting</b> <b>screen</b> {{is related to}} a radar absorber. Both are {{supposed}} not to reflect incoming radiation of the desired wavelength. Radar absorbers have the advantage {{that they can use}} magnetic materials to avoid reflections at the interface to air at least for some frequencies. For antennas to be broadband, the transition from air (vacuum) to the metal of the screen has to be a gradual one. Radar absorbers have the advantage {{that they do not have}} to collect the received energy. The antenna needs a 3D tree of twin-leads and chokes to connect a single cable to a large number of micro antennas. Micro dipole antennas are only resonant at a single high frequency, to be broadband the arms of adjoining antennas have to be connected.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{before the}} First World War, Standard Elektrik Lorenz {{had been the}} main {{supplier}} of communication equipment for the German military and was the main rival of Telefunken. In late 1935, when Lorenz found that Runge at Telefunken was doing research in radio-based detection equipment, they started a similar activity under Gottfried Müller. A pulse-modulated set called Einheit für Abfragung (DFA - Device for Detection) was built. It used a type DS-310 tube (similar to the Acorn) operating at 70 cm (430 MHz) and about 1 kW power, it had identical transmitting and receiving antennas made with rows of half-wavelength dipoles backed by a <b>reflecting</b> <b>screen.</b> In early 1936, initial experiments gave reflections from large buildings at up to about 7 km. The power was doubled by using two tubes, and in mid-1936, the equipment was set up on cliffs near Kiel, and good detections of ships at 7 km and aircraft at 4 km were attained. [...] The success of this experimental set was reported to the Kriegsmarine, but they showed no interest; they were already fully engaged with GEMA for similar equipment. Also, because of extensive agreements between Lorenz and many foreign countries, the naval authorities had reservations concerning the company handling classified work. The DFA was then demonstrated to the Heer (German Army), and they contracted with Lorenz for developing Kurfürst (Elector), a system for supporting Flugzeugabwehrkanone (Flak, anti-aircraft guns).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} here an optimization {{procedure to}} shape the radiation pattern of planar two-dimensional (2 -D) leaky-wave antennas. The structures under investigation are superstrate configurations made by partially <b>reflecting</b> <b>screens</b> (impedances sheets) over a ground plane and excited by open-ended waveguides. The antenna configuration providing the required radiation pattern is obtained by resorting to an ad hoc optimization procedure that minimizes the mean squared error between the target pattern and the actual radiated far field. The radiated field is analytically evaluated using a Green's function spectral approach {{to speed up the}} optimization process. Several kinds of radiation patterns can be obtained using the proposed algorithm. In this work, we focus our attention on flat-topped radiation patterns, suitable as element pattern for phased array antennas covering a limited angular field of view such as those considered for space applications. The proposed procedure is validated by full-wave results and measurements...|$|R

In contrast, the Sternheimer model is shown to describe accurately the calculated EFG at the nucleus of the Na+ cation.

40|$|The {{coherent}} diffraction radiation {{technique has}} been for the first time intentionally employed in the bunch length measurements at the TTF linac. Diffraction radiation (DR) is emitted as a beam passes through an aperture in a highly <b>reflecting</b> <b>screen</b> and, therefore, in contrast to transition radiation (TR), is a really non-intercepting tool- a very attractive feature to diagnose high-power beams of small transverse and longitudinal dimensions. In our measure-ments, the radiation produced by a 225 MeV electron beam centred in an adjustable rectangular slit was analysed by means of the autocorrelation method using a Martin Pu-plett interferometer in the millimetre range. Effects of the slit width and the beam displacement with respect to the centre of the slit on the radiation intensity and spectrum were studied {{in the context of the}} bunch length retrieval. In particular, we did not observed any perceptible influence of these factors on bunch length measurements. The pre-sented results reveal that coherent diffraction radiation can be successfully used in beam diagnostics. ...|$|E

40|$|This simple investigation, {{and results}} from many other {{experimental}} measurements and theoretical investigations demonstrate the following: a) There is a region {{close to the}} parasitic element where the electric field strength is greatly reduced and the magnetic field is greatly increased. b) The spatial rate of change of the field strength is very high. Small changes in distance can result in very large changes in electric field strength. This effect is observed in many transmitter situations. c) The presence of an additional conductor in this zone will influence the near fields and so can influence the overall effectiveness of the antenna. These conclusions are important because: a) Grounded towers used in VLF, LF and HF antennas show small regions where the measured and modeled quasi-static fields are greatly reduced. Such regions might be defined as "safe" when radiation exposure standards [6] are applied. b) The near field zone immediately behind Yagi-Uda antennas is not as "safe" as that predicted from far field to near field transform approximations (Ebersbach, Thiel and Leckenby [4]). c) Antenna isolation from nearby conductors using parasitic elements placed close to the driven elements is not particularly effective when compared to a large <b>reflecting</b> <b>screen.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|A functional-structural {{model for}} a tomato crop, {{situated}} in a greenhouse, was developed to calculate the most efficient lamp (HPS, LED) positions and crop structure, with the objective to reduce energy consumption and improve light use efficiency. The model was built within the GroIMP platform and written using the dedicated modelling language XL. The entire production system {{is described as a}} 3 D scene including a virtual greenhouse with the crop and light sources (natural light and lamps). The pathways of individual light rays were modelled multi-spectrally with an inversed path tracer. Plant organs (leaves, internodes, flowers, fruits) are the basic units of the multi-scaled, fully object-oriented model. Surface textures and colours were included for all 3 D objects. For the current objective a static 3 D mock-up of an existing crop was used. Measured 3 D distribution pattern and spectrum of light emitted by the lamps were fed into the model. The modelled horizontal light distribution agreed well with measurements. Effects of different positions, reflector types, and spectra of lamps, and plant architectural and optical properties on light distribution and photosynthesis were evaluated. In total 10 illumination scenarios were simulated to quantify crop absorption and loss of light. In summary, a more efficient illumination strategy was predicted when the light was more focused on the crop by lamp reflectors, at inter-lighting (LEDs), and with a <b>reflecting</b> <b>screen</b> above the lamps. The inter-lighting strategy also resulted in a relative increase of light intercepted by fruit and stems relative to lighting {{from the top of the}} crop...|$|E
