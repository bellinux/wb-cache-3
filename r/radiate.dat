5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} <b>radiate</b> its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still <b>radiate</b> at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E

5000|$|Effective <b>radiated</b> {{power and}} {{effective}} isotropic <b>radiated</b> power both measure {{the amount of}} power a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) <b>radiates</b> in a specific direction: {{in the direction of}} maximum signal strength (the [...] "main lobe") of its radiation pattern. [...] This maximum <b>radiated</b> power is dependent on two factors: the total power output and the radiation pattern of the antenna - how much of that power is <b>radiated</b> in the desired direction. The latter factor is quantified by the antenna gain, which is the ratio of the signal strength <b>radiated</b> by an antenna to that <b>radiated</b> by a standard antenna. For example, a 1000 watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4 (6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4000 watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 (0 dBi). So ERP and EIRP are measures of <b>radiated</b> power that can compare transmitters with different antennas on an equal basis.|$|R

The resonant frequency of the noise <b>radiating</b> element is tuned by an expandable ring embedded in the noise <b>radiating</b> element.

5|$|The {{companion}} star is a dense {{white dwarf}} star.

5|$|The {{degenerate}} matter {{that makes up}} the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low opacity, because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high thermal conductivity. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 107K. An outer shell of non-{{degenerate matter}} cools from approximately 107K to 104K. This matter radiates roughly as a black body. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to <b>radiate</b> at about 107K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 107 K but cannot <b>radiate</b> through its normal matter shell.|$|E

In <b>radiating</b> Bondi flows the gas temperature increases at large radii, as in the cores of many galaxy groups and clusters, allowing <b>radiating</b> Bondi flows to merge naturally with gas arriving from their cluster environments.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>radiated</b> {{electromagnetic}} disturbances {{produced by}} operating electromotor equipments in coal mines have some {{effects on the}} electromagnetic environment in coal mines. Based on {{the analysis of the}} Chinese national EMC standard on rotating electrical machines and the operation characteristics of the electromotor equipments in coal mines, it can be concluded that frequency spectrum of the <b>radiated</b> disturbances resulting from AC motors ranges from 9 kHz to 1 GHz. The <b>radiated</b> electromagnetic disturbances in the pumping house underground mines have been measured. The results show that the <b>radiated</b> emissions above 30 MHz produced by the normal running electromotor system are quite low, which are comparable to the <b>radiated</b> emission limits set in the Chinese national standard GB 755 - 2008 ； the maximum <b>radiated</b> field strength reaches about 0. 56 V/m under 30 MHz. However, when motors start or stop, the <b>radiated</b> field strength can reach about 1. 26 V/m or higher. Therefore, some shielding measures for monitoring and communication equipments should be taken to reduce the radiation interference from AC motors...|$|R
