40|$|Background: Internet {{support groups}} (ISGs) for mental ill-health are common but {{little is known}} about the {{characteristics}} of users, the usage and predictors of ISG usage and if and how these change over time. Aim: This study evaluated the attributes of a publically accessible ISG for depression and other mental disorders including: (1) the demographic and other characteristics of its users; (2) their patterns of usage; and (3) the factors which predict posts to and <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the ISG. Method: User characteristics (gender, age, user type, country and location of residence) were collected at the time of registration on the ISG BlueBoard (blueboard. anu. edu. au). All board log data were downloaded for the period October 2008 to May 2014. Predictors of post frequency and <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the <b>board</b> were examined using logistic regressions. Other data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: 2932 users contributed 131, 004 posts to the ISG. The majority were female, aged 20 to 34  years, and mental health consumers. Although most users were city dwellers, 19 % resided in rural or remote regions. Frequency of posts and <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the <b>board</b> varied across users, with a moderate association between retention and number of posts. Growth in posts substantially exceeded the growth in new users over the monitoring period. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that consumers posted more often and remained longer than carers or others, and that younger users posted less often; however, the model predicted very little of the variance. Conclusions: A small minority of active users are sufficient to ensure the sustainability and growth of an online mental health ISG. Further research is required to understand why so many support group members limit their contributions to one or a very small number of posts and what factors predict and promote active engagement and long-term retention in virtual mental health communities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the career paths of 245 newly elected employee directors from 1997 to 2001 and estimates {{the role of}} employee <b>board</b> member characteristics <b>on</b> career outcome one, three, and five years after appointment. Career outcomes examined are succession to CEO, exit (departure or retirement), and <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the <b>board</b> of directors in a non-CEO capacity. Given actual career outcomes and factors influencing career outcomes, this paper {{examines the}} abnormal returns associated with the announcement of an employee director appointment. We find employee director career outcomes differ largely with respect to titles held with CFO hurting and Vice Chairman and President titles helping succession. Looking at actual candidate outcomes, evidence reported suggests that market reactions are positive for succession, negative for departing, positive for non-succession outcomes. These findings indicate that markets recognize and embrace succession and non-succession candidates <b>on</b> a <b>board</b> {{as a source of}} value. However, predictive characteristics for career outcome provide weak insight into to market reactions...|$|R
40|$|<b>On</b> <b>boarding,</b> {{also known}} as {{organizational}} socialization, plays {{a vital role in}} building the initial relationship between an organization and an employee. It also contributes to an employees’ satisfaction, better performance and greater organizational commitment thus increasing an employees’ effectiveness and productivity in his/her role. Therefore, it is essential that <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> process of an organization is efficient and effective to improve new employees’ <b>retention.</b> Generally this <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> process is done manually which is time consuming and monotonous. To enhance this process, the proposed solution automates the <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> or joining process. It will enable HR, ADMINISTRATOR and IT to complete this process by robot which will automatically perform the actions taken to complete the <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> process. To complete this process direct access is given to applications, where as in automation, robot will perform all the actions taken to complete the process, which is a secured way to access applications. This will thus improve the timeframe and efficiency to complete the <b>on</b> <b>boarding</b> or joining process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesApproximately {{two-thirds of}} the {{patients}} with newly diagnosed partial epilepsy remained on their first antiepileptic drug (AED) for 2 years in clinical practice. We aimed to analyze <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the first AED for 2 years in newly diagnosed cryptogenic partial epilepsy patients in clinical practice and whether the presence of epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG was a predictor {{of the failure of}} <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the first AED. MethodsFor the purpose of this study, we retrospectively reviewed epilepsy database. On the Epilepsy Database, we found 495 newly diagnosed epilepsy patients who had been followed up for at least 2 years. Of these 495 newly diagnosed epilepsy patients, 172 patients had cryptogenic partial epilepsy. The outcome of this study was the retention rate for the first AED for 2 years. In addition, we analyzed the <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> first AED according to {{the presence or absence of}} epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. ResultsOverall, <b>retention</b> rate <b>on</b> the first AED for 2 years was 51 %. The main lesion of retention failure was a lack of tolerance. The presence of epileptiform discharges on the initial EEGs was significantly related to the failure of <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the first AED (p= 0. 003). ConclusionsIn newly diagnosed cryptogenic partial epilepsy, overall <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the first AED was not significantly different from that in newly diagnosed partial epilepsy. In clinical practice, epileptiform discharges on the initial EEG could predict the failure of <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the first AED for 2 years...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} pointed out that {{different}} financial environments would affect the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the various functions provided by bankers on board: monitoring, expertise and (or) certification. During the two years of research period, we plan to analyze empirically the relationships between bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s debt ratio and loan terms in order to clarify the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> for global banks. First, since the firm』s debt ratio is an endogenous variable and would interact with bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> we will employ the simultaneous regression models to estimate the relations between the debt ratio and bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> In addition, the estimation will be further divided into some regressions with different dependent variables, including the lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> non-lending bankers <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> insurance companies <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> investment banks <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> other investors <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> to detail and compare their relations with the firm』s debt ratio. Finally, we also expect to explore the effects of the tenure of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s financial distress on the role of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> For the first year, the roles of bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> and the firm』s borrowing terms will be analyzed, and we plan to investigate how bankers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> influence the firm』s debt ratio in the second year of this research project. 許多研究指出不同的金融環境會影響銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的角色，本文將嘗試探討在全球國家中，銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種功能：監督、專業評估與（或）認證。在本計畫的兩年時間，我們預計實證分析全球的銀行進入企業董監事會與企業的負債比例以及銀行放款契約條件之間的關係，以釐清銀行在企業董監事會所扮演的各種可能角色。首先，由於銀行在企業董監事會與企業的負債比例為內生變數且彼此會相互影響，故在方法上將使用聯立迴歸模式（simultaneous regression models）同時考慮企業負債與銀行進入董監事會的關係。此外，本文除了考慮銀行進入企業董監事會之虛擬變數外，也將進一步探討董事銀行比例、非董事銀行比例、保險公司與投資銀行比例、其他投資者比例與企業負債比例之關係，以暸解上述董監事會成員之間的關係是否具有替代或互補關係。最後，本文也預計探討銀行進入企業董監事會的持續時間（tenure）及加入企業財務危機對銀行在董監事會所扮演的角色之影響，因為企業財務危機也可能會影響銀行加入企業董監事會的行為。本研究計畫預計在第一年首先進行銀行在企業董監事會與放款契約條件關係之研究，第二年則將進ㄧ步探討銀行在企業董監事會與企業資本結構之關係...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Despite {{the rise}} in grade {{retention}} in China recently, little {{work has been done}} to understand the impact of grade <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> the educational performance of students in China. This paper seeks to redress this shortcoming and examines this impact on 1649 students in 36 elementary schools in Shaanxi province. With a dataset that was collected from a survey designed specifically to capture school performance of students before and after they were retained, we use Difference-in-Difference, Propensity Score Matching and Difference-in-Difference Matching approaches to analyze the effect of grade <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> school performance. Although the descriptive analysis shows that grade retention helps to improve the scores of the students that were retained, somewhat surprisingly, the results from the multivariate analysis consistently show that there is no significant positive effect of grade <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> school performance of the students. In fact, in some cases (e. g., for the students who repeat grade 2), grade retention is shown to hurt school performance. ...|$|R

A new method to describe the steady-state condensation has been suggested and a new mathematical model to represent the force balance of retained condensate developed. The mass of condensate retained has been measured experimentally under various operating conditions of a direct expansion (DX) air cooling and dehumidification system. The influences of air dry-bulb temperature, moisture content and Reynolds Number <b>on</b> condensate <b>retention</b> are discussed. The model developed relates the mass of condensate retained to condensing rate, and is successful in predicting the trends of condensate retention under normal operating conditions for air cooling applications.

40|$|The {{retention}} behaviour of {{a series}} of 28 monosubstituted benzenes, representing a diverse range of functional groups and substituent shape, were investigated using porous graphitic carbon (PGC) and octadecyl-bonded silica (ODS) stationary phases. For the majority of analytes <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> PGC was greater than on ODS, and in most cases this effect occurred at both pH 2. 5 and 7. 0. The main trends observed on PGC (in comparison with ODS) were: (i) similar or reduced retention of low polarity molecules such as the hydrocarbon and halogenated analytes; (ii) increased retention of conjugated analytes with extended planarity; (iii) increased retention of polar and charged species; and (iv) substantial increases in retention for selected polar and negatively charged analytes, including some ionised and unionised acid analytes. Poor retention of positively charged analytes was observed on both stationary phases. Molecular modelling studies have explored the geometry of pi-pi stacking interactions in <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> PGC and have highlighted the strong retention of large conjugated analytes, with extended planar conformations, which can interact with the graphite surface with cofacial geometry. Quantitative structure-retention relationships showed the importance of hydrophobic (pi) and electronic factors (e. g. mean polarisability and LUMO energy) in <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> PGC, whilst <b>retention</b> <b>on</b> ODS was correlated to hydrophobicity (log P and pi).
