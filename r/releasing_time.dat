40|$|A 3 -D Lagrangian {{particle}} dispersion model, {{including the}} photochemical reaction developed by Song et al. (Atmos. Environ. 37 (2003) 4607), {{has been applied}} to the data obtained from the Southern Oxidants Study field campaign to examine the effect of the intermixing process between the superposed Lagrangian particles on the spatial distribution of the non-reactive pollutant Of SO 2 and the photochemical compound Of O- 3 with several different Lagrangian particle <b>releasing</b> <b>time</b> intervals. It is found that the intermixing process tends to disperse the centerline maximum concentration of the non-reactive gas toward the edges of the plume and to enhance the entrainment rate into the plume, thereby reducing the maximum concentration {{at the center of the}} plume and widening the width of the plume. The Lagrangian particle <b>releasing</b> <b>time</b> interval of up to 5 min does not significantly affect the non-reactive SO 2 concentration across the plume within 49 km (T 4 traverse) in the downwind direction from the source. However, a much shorter <b>releasing</b> <b>time</b> interval (an order of minute) is required to simulate the reactive pollutant Of O- 3 concentration compared to the non-reactive SO 2 concentration due to excessive entrainment of the background reactive pollutant into the plume center and the overweighed mass of each Lagrangian particle. This result suggests that the present model with the Lagrangian particle <b>releasing</b> <b>time</b> interval of one minute and with the intermixing process between the superposed Lagrangian particles can be used more practically to simulate concentration of both the non-reactive SO 2 and the photochemical compound Of O- 3. close 1...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Objectives of the Study: On June 30, 1977, Oregon {{passed a}} law authorizing five hours per week of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> for {{religious}} instruction {{on the high school}} level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to seek answers to five general questions: (1) What was the level of awareness of released-time programs? (2) What level of interest existed for the establishment of extended programs of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> for religious instruction? (3) What might be the impact of extended <b>released</b> <b>time</b> on the public high school? (4) What might be the impact of establishing extended released- time programs on churches? (5) What impact might released-time programs have on church-school interaction? Research Procedures: Three groups selected from Polk and Marion counties were administered a questionnaire which was developed for this research. The three groups were: citizens, public high school teachers, and church leaders. Of the 1, 978 questionnaires distributed, 830 useable returns were received. This was a response rate of 43. 4 percent. Because of this low response rate, generalizations beyond the actual respondents should be made with extreme care. The one-way analysis of variance statistic (F test) was used to determine significant differences among the responses of the three groups to the questionnaire. * The Least Significant Difference (LSD) statistic was used to identify where these differences occurred. An analysis of variance according to selected demographic data was also conducted. The demographic areas were: sex, age, marital status, annual income, highest education level completed, personal enrollment in <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs, enrollment of children in <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs, religious preference, and extent of church activity. For teachers, an analysis was conducted based on size of faculty at the high school where they were teaching. Conclusions: All five of the null hypotheses were rejected at the. 05 level of significance. There were significant differences among the three groups for each of the five areas of this study. Specifically this study found: 1. Teachers are less in favor of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> than are citizens or church leaders. 2. Church leaders are more in favor of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> than are teachers or citizens. 3. There was a general lack of awareness of <b>released</b> <b>time</b> programs. 4.
