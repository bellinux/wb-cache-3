40|$|Abstract Background To date, 35 human diseases, some {{of which}} also exhibit anticipation, have been {{associated}} with unstable <b>repeats.</b> Anticipation has been reported in a number of diseases in which <b>repeat</b> expansion may have a role in etiology. Despite the growing importance of unstable <b>repeats</b> in disease, currently no resource exists for the prioritization of <b>repeats.</b> Here we present Satellog, a database that catalogs all pure 1 – 16 <b>repeat</b> unit satellite <b>repeats</b> in the human genome along with supplementary data. Satellog analyzes each pure <b>repeat</b> in UniGene clusters for evidence of <b>repeat</b> polymorphism. Results A total of 5, 546 such <b>repeats</b> were identified, providing the first indication of many novel polymorphic sites in the genome. Overall, polymorphic <b>repeats</b> were over-represented within 3 '-UTR sequence relative to 5 '-UTR and coding sequence. Interestingly, we observed that <b>repeat</b> polymorphism within coding sequence is restricted to trinucleotide <b>repeats</b> whereas UTR sequence tolerated a wider range of <b>repeat</b> period polymorphisms. For each pure <b>repeat</b> we also calculate its <b>repeat</b> length percentile rank, its location either within or adjacent to EnsEMBL genes, and its expression profile in normal tissues according to the GeneNote database. Conclusion Satellog provides the ability to dynamically prioritize <b>repeats</b> based on any of their characteristics (i. e. <b>repeat</b> unit, class, period, length, <b>repeat</b> length percentile rank, genomic co-ordinates), polymorphism profile within UniGene, proximity to or presence within gene regions (i. e. cds, UTR, 15 kb upstream etc.), metadata of the genes they are detected within and gene expression profiles within normal human tissues. Unstable <b>repeats</b> associated with 31 diseases were analyzed in Satellog to evaluate their common <b>repeat</b> properties. The utility of Satellog was highlighted by prioritizing <b>repeats</b> for Huntington's disease and schizophrenia. Satellog is available online at [URL]. </p...|$|R

The frequency of each <b>repeat,</b> especially Ala, Leu, Pro, and Glu <b>repeats,</b> varies greatly in each category.

40|$|Trinucleotide <b>repeats</b> can {{be highly}} unstable, mutating far more {{frequently}} than point mutations. <b>Repeats</b> typically mutate by addition or loss of units of the <b>repeat.</b> CAG <b>repeat</b> expansions in humans trigger neurological diseases that include myotonic dystrophy, Huntington disease, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. In human cells, diverse mechanisms promote CAG <b>repeat</b> instability, and in mice, the mechanisms of instability are varied and tissue-dependent. Dissection of mechanistic complexity and discovery of potential therapeutics necessitates quantitative and scalable screens for <b>repeat</b> mutation. We describe a GFP-based assay for screening modifiers of CAG <b>repeat</b> instability in human cells. The assay exploits an engineered intronic CAG <b>repeat</b> tract that interferes with expression of an inducible GFP minigene.

50|$|VNTRs are {{a type of}} {{minisatellite}} in {{that the}} size of the <b>repeat</b> sequence is generally ten to one hundred base pairs. Minisatellites are a type of DNA tandem <b>repeat</b> sequence, meaning that the sequences <b>repeat</b> one after another without other sequences or nucleotides in between them. Minisatellites are characterized by a <b>repeat</b> sequence of about ten to one hundred nucleotides, and the number of times the sequence <b>repeats</b> varies from about five to fifty times. The sequences of minisatellites are larger than those of microsatellites, in which the <b>repeat</b> sequence is generally two to five nucleotides. The two types of <b>repeat</b> sequences are both tandem but are specified by the length of the <b>repeat</b> sequence. VNTRs, therefore, because they have <b>repeat</b> sequences of ten to one hundred nucleotides in which every <b>repeat</b> is exactly the same, are considered minisatellites.
