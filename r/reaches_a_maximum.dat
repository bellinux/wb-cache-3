5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near {{the plane of the}} ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.|$|E
5|$|The {{plutonium}} {{present in}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 12% of 241Pu. Because it spontaneously converts to 241Am, 241Pu can be extracted and {{may be used to}} generate further 241Am. However, this process is rather slow: half of the original amount of 241Pu decays to 241Am after about 15 years, and the 241Am amount <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> after 70 years.|$|E
50|$|Istiblennius muelleri is {{a species}} of combtooth blenny found in the western Pacific ocean. Males of this species can <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 7 cm SL, while females can <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 5.5 cm SL.|$|R
50|$|Istiblennius colei is {{a species}} of combtooth blenny found in the western Pacific Ocean, around the Philippines. Males of this species can <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 11.8 cm SL, while females <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 10.3 cm SL.|$|R
50|$|Istiblennius flaviumbrinus is {{a species}} of combtooth blenny found in the western Indian Ocean, {{specifically}} the Red Sea. Males of this species can <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 9 cm SL, while females can <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 7.2 cm SL.|$|R
5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|Vega is {{only about}} {{a tenth of the}} age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its {{expected}} lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} body {{of water}} is a single basin 6.5 miles (9.7km) long, 2,052 acres (8.2km²) in area and <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> depth of 175 feet (53.3 m) near the dam. Mean depth is 73.8 feet (22.4 m). Elevation is 840 feet (256 m) above sea level.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{may account}} for 75% {{or more of the}} total volume. This means that the oil {{droplets}} become distorted from their normal, spherical shape. The close packing of the droplets also allow them to interact very strongly with one another. A combination of these factors gives traditional mayonnaise its high viscosity. The viscoelasticity of mayonnaise made with egg yolk <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> very quickly after preparation.|$|E
25|$|Sodium sulfate has unusual {{solubility}} {{characteristics in}} water. Its {{solubility in water}} rises more than tenfold between 0°C to 32.384°C, where it <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 49.7g/100 mL. At this point the solubility curve changes slope, and the solubility becomes almost independent of temperature. This temperature at 32.384°C, corresponding {{to the release of}} crystal water and melting of the hydrated salt, serves as an accurate temperature reference for thermometer calibration.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese seahorse (in Japanese, kitano-umi-uma and sangotatsu) or lemur-tail seahorse (Hippocampus mohnikei) is {{a species}} of fish in the Syngnathidae family. The Japanese seahorse <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> length of 8.0cm, is usually dark brown and has a {{relatively}} long tail, a ridgelike coronet and flattened spines. Many seahorse species look similar, so in addition to any distinguishing features, individual specimens are identified using a series of specific measurements and counts of anatomical features such as spines and tail rings.|$|E

25|$|Belonogaster petiolata {{belongs to}} the genus Belonogaster, of the {{subfamily}} Polistinae, and {{is closely related to}} B. juncea and B. grisea. Belonogaster wasps are part of the family Vespidae and the order Hymenoptera. Species in this family display a full range of social organization, from completely solitary to highly eusocial life cycles. Many of B. petiolata characteristics are very similar to those of B. grisea. In both species, the production of smaller, unmated worker offspring <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> before the production of larger queens who leave the nest and mate.|$|E
25|$|Colonies may {{be quite}} large, {{accommodating}} as many as 100,000 to 600,000 adult individuals. Each colony consists of a single queen, a brood of developing young, and many adult workers. The adult workers make {{up the majority of}} the population. There are four distinct physical worker castes. The queen usually copulates with 10–20 males, which leads to a colony with a large number of worker patrilines, which are full-sibling families with the same father and mother. When a colony's size <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum,</b> it can result in a split in the colony, with the old queen heading one resultant swarm and a daughter heading the other.|$|E
25|$|Blood vessels grow in {{the dental}} {{follicle}} and enter the dental papilla in the cap stage. Groups of blood vessels form {{at the entrance of}} the dental papilla. The number of blood vessels <b>reaches</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> {{at the beginning of the}} crown stage, and the dental papilla eventually forms in the pulp of a tooth. Throughout life, the amount of pulpal tissue in a tooth decreases, which means that the blood supply to the tooth decreases with age. The enamel organ is devoid of blood vessels because of its epithelial origin, and the mineralized tissues of enamel and dentin do not need nutrients from the blood.|$|E
