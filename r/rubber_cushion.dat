Stress-strain {{curves of}} {{some kinds of}} {{materials}} at high strain-rate conditions were able {{to be determined by}} a drop weight experiment system which has only to measure the force-time relation using a load-cell but not to measure directly the deformation or deformation-rate of specimen. To evaluate the strain-rate or the strain of the specimen it had been necessary to measure the motion, i. e. the velocity or the displacement of tup and anvil so far. In this new method the velocity and the displacement of the tup and the anvil which contacted the both end surfaces of specimen were calculated using a personal computer {{on the basis of the}} equations of motion for the tup and the anvil, respectively. The differential equations, in which the measured dynamic-force versus time characteristics were contained, were integrated by Runge-Kutta method using the personal computer. In the differential equation of motion of the anvil, a spring coefficient K for the <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> beneath the anvil is used. For the first approximation of the coefficient K is assumed to be the value determined by the oscillation method of cantilever beam. The spring coefficient K with high accuracy is determined when the computed strain of the specimen on the basis of the method described above is almost equal to the measured strain of it by using a micrometer caliper after the dynamic compression. The coefficient K with the higher accuracy can be obtained the incremental compression experiment using some kinds of hard stop ring in the prescribed height...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the effects of material, geometric and operational parameters on flat belt-drives steady-state belt stresses, belt slip, and belt-drive efficiency. The belt stresses include: belt rubber shear, normal, axial and lateral stresses; reinforcements tension force; and tangential and normal belt-pulley contact stresses. Belt slip is measured using the driven over driver pulleys’ angular velocity ratio. Each parameter was varied over a range to understand its impact on the steady-state belt-drive response. The material parameters studied are belt axial stiffness and damping, belt bending stiffness and damping, and belt-pulley friction coefficient. The geometric parameters studied are pulley center distance, pulleys diameter ratio, and belt thickness. The operational parameters studied are the driver pulley angular velocity and the driven pulley opposing torque (load). A high-fidelity flexible multibody dynamics parametric model of a two-pulley belt-drive system was created using a commercial multibody dynamics code. In the model the belt’s rubber matrix is represented using three-dimensional brick elements and the belt’s reinforcements are represented using one dimensional beam elements at the top surface of the belt. An asperity-based Coulomb friction model is used for the friction forces between the pulley and belt. The pulleys are modeled as rigid bodies with a cylindrical contact surface. The equations of motion are integrated using an explicit solution procedure. Unlike prior models which use one-dimensional truss or beam elements for the belt, the present model uses a three-dimensional belt model which introduces the effect of the thickness of the belt rubber matrix (modeled using brick elements). This enables a more accurate prediction of the belt stresses and slip than prior models. This thesis resolves in more details the complex stick-slip friction behavior of an axially flexible belt coupled with the shear effects of a flexible <b>rubber</b> <b>cushion</b> {{and at the same time}} shows the effect of the main system parameters on this stick-slip behavior. Some of the important conclusions of the thesis include: (1) the driver pulley has two distinct contact zones - a negative traction zone and a positive traction zone - while only one traction zone is present over the driven pulley; (2) the width of the negative traction zone on the driver pulley increases with the belt-pulley coefficient of friction and decreases with the belt axial stiffness; (3) the maximum belt tension and normal contact stress occur on the driver pulley and increase with the belt thickness, belt axial stiffness, and coefficient of friction; (4) belt-drive energy efficiency increases with the belt axial stiffness, and decreases with belt thickness, belt bending damping, belt operating speed, and operating torque load. The belt-drive modeling methodology presented in this thesis which enables accurate prediction of the belt stresses and slip can in turn be used to more accurately predict the fatigue life, wear life, and energy efficiency of belt-drives...|$|E
40|$|Within the BMBF project 'Unround Wheels', the unroundness, the {{mechanical}} properties and the microstructure of several wheel sets {{of different types}} have been analysed. The unroundness of <b>rubber</b> <b>cushioned</b> wheels is mainly influenced by the well-known threefold polygons which remain constant in shape and location during service-caused wear. No changes of {{the mechanical}} and microstructural properties of the tyres of the wheels in circumferencial direction have been found.

The analyses of the single wheels showed a modification of the microstructure at the positions of several radius minima. It {{has been found that}} this modified structure differs only slightly from the surrounding perlitic matrix and is moreover strongly confined to the regions close to the running surface.
