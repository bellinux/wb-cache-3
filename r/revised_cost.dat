40|$|Graduation date: 1955 Presentation date: 1955 - 03 - 18 The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{evaluate}} two methods of estimating 1953 costs of producing strawberries. To accomplish this the following steps were taken: 1. To estimate production costs in 1953 by using 1947 input data and 1953 prices for those inputs, (Method 1); 2. To compare {{the results of the}} preceding method with the index number method of <b>revising</b> the <b>cost</b> data, (Method 2); To evaluate the two methods of <b>revising</b> the <b>cost</b> data. By the use of Method 1 the production cost per pound was 16. 4 based on an average yield of 39609 pounds per acre. This amounted to an average total cost of 590. 30 per acre. Considerable variation existed among the 53 producers whose records were used, with the higher yielding producers tending to have lower costs. When the index number method was used, the cost was 16. 5 cents per pound. This is only 0. 1 cents more than <b>costs</b> <b>revised</b> with the actual prices paid for the inputs. Because these costs are nearly identical, no significant difference appears to exist between the results of the two methods. However, {{it must be noted that}} this comparison is for only one crop and one crop year. Different results may be obtained for different crops and for different years. 3. The following conclusions were drawn with respect to the two methods: 1. Method 1 is based on prices paid to produce the crop. This is in contrast to <b>costs</b> <b>revised</b> with indices which include items not actually used in the production of strawberries. 2. With Method 1 only prices prevailing in the production area are used. On the other hand, <b>costs</b> <b>revised</b> with index numbers are affected by state and/or national prices for commodities which may or may not be used to produce strawberries. 3. More computations are necessary to <b>revise</b> the <b>costs</b> in Method 1 than Method 2. <b>Costs</b> <b>revised</b> by Method 1 require about 25 computations to revise each producer's data plus about 20 more to determine the sample average. By contrast, only six computations are necessary to <b>revise</b> <b>cost</b> data with index numbers. 4. By using the principles of both methods it may be possible to retain some of the advantages of both methods. A cost index based on local prices would be more realistic than more general indices and would retain the simplicity of the index number method now used...|$|R

50|$|The trick here is {{to realize}} {{that this is not a}} sum of the money that the three people paid originally, as that would need to include the money the clerk has ($25).

Another way to say this is, the $27 already includes the bellhops tip. To add the $2 to the $27 would be to double-count it. So, the three guests cost of the room, including the bellhops tip, is $27.
