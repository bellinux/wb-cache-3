5|$|Room 5 is of {{identical}} proportions as rooms 2 and 4. It was extremely well preserved, including the <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> {{of the bench}} {{and the room was}} used as a model for investigations of the other rooms in Structure 4.|$|E
5|$|The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit {{consists}} of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into a rocky outcrop. Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two other}} {{historic}} churches in central Roskilde. St Ib's is located below the cathedral plateau near the harbour. Built in travertine around 1100, the Romanesque building was once richly decorated in frescos, remains {{of which can be}} seen on the <b>rear</b> <b>wall.</b> It is no longer a functioning church. St Jørgensbjerg Church stands on a little hill to the northwest of the old town, overlooking the fjord. With a nave and chancel in travertine dating from c. 1080, it is Denmark's oldest preserved stone building. It features a carved pulput from 1616.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the <b>rear</b> <b>wall,</b> on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{the rear of}} the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had {{appeared}} in the <b>rear</b> <b>wall,</b> and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters. Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United. In June 1995, new floodlights were installed, which were twice as powerful as the original floodlights.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNanocomposites of ultra-high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabrics with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in epoxy matrix were prepared {{in order to}} study their hypervelocity impact (HVI) characteristics. These nanocomposites were assessed for their use as bumper shields and as <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> in Whipple shield configurations at impact velocities in the 6. 5 - 7 km/s range. The HVI performances of the nanocomposites were compared against that of the epoxy/UHMWPE composites without nanotubes (or simply, neat composites) and aluminum (Al) sheets having areal density similar to both the composites. The {{results show that the}} nanocomposites and the neat composites perform better as <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> than the Al sheets, but are lesser effective bumper shields. Comparatively, the two composites perform similarly to one another as <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> and as bumper shields. For these epoxy/UHMWPE composite samples, the reinforcement with 0. 5 wt% of SWCNT has no noticeable effect on their HVI response...|$|R

5|$|The low granite block {{foundation}} {{of the house is}} more exposed {{on the west side of}} the house, allowing for a full-height door exiting from the cellar. The stone stack supports four fireplaces that each support the hall, hall chamber, parlor and the cellar. Also there is a smoke chamber in the stack in the attic. The original kitchen, now in the hall, features a large fireplace with bake oven in the <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> of the firebox. The attic once housed a large loom that was later moved down to the west side of the cellar. Amos G. Avery, who owned and restored the house prior to its 1992 National Register of Historic Places listing, removed a 1871 Victorian balustrade on the front staircase installed by the second Theophilus Avery.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
50|$|Both street facades have double-height {{full length}} verandahs which are {{supported}} by timber posts. Both street facades also have cross braced exposed timber framing, but the <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> are clad in chamferboard.|$|R
50|$|In a {{striking}} contrast, {{the side and}} <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> are completely plain and clad in fibrous cement sheeting. There are three plain rectangular windows placed high {{on both sides of}} the building towards the rear.|$|R
50|$|A {{grooving}} plane, plow plane, or plough {{plane is}} {{a plane to}} make grooves and (with some of the metal versions) some of them make small rabbets.They are traditionally used for drawer bottoms or <b>rear</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
5|$|The initial {{round of}} gunfire killed only the Emperor, the Empress and two male servants, and wounded Grand Duchess Maria, Dr Botkin and the Empress' maidservant, Demidova. At {{that point the}} gunmen {{had to leave the}} room because of smoke and toxic fumes from their guns and plaster dust their bullets had {{released}} from the walls. After allowing the haze to clear for several minutes, the gunmen returned. Dr Botkin was killed, and a gunman named Ermakov repeatedly tried to shoot Tsarevich Alexei, but failed because jewels sewn into the boy's clothes shielded him. Ermakov tried to stab Alexei with a bayonet but failed again, and finally Yurovsky fired two shots into the boy's head. Yurovsky and Ermakov approached Olga and Tatiana, who were crouched against the room's <b>rear</b> <b>wall,</b> clinging to each other and screaming for their mother. Ermakov stabbed both young women with his 8-inch bayonet, but had difficulty penetrating their torsos because of the jewels that had been sewn into their chemises. The sisters tried to stand, but Tatiana was killed instantly when Yurovsky shot her {{in the back of her}} head. A moment later, Olga too died when Ermakov shot her in the head.|$|E
5|$|In a later period, the two central {{cells of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> have been {{combined}} by breaking the partition in between to house the Ganesha image. The old entrance was also widened during the conversion to the Ganesha temple. There are two other smaller entrances to the hall. All entrances bear marks of sockets for fixing wooden doors, added during the conversion, and still have doors. The hall also has traces of plaster and paintings, both added during the conversion and renewed in later times - possibly {{as late as the}} 19th century. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1882) records that the hall was plastered and white-washed. The paintings depicted Ganesha's childhood, marriage preparations, battle with demons and so forth, along with scenes of other Hindu deities like Devi, Krishna, Vishnu and Shiva. Some of the cells fitted with wooden doors were used for storage. Nine Sati memorials were added on the left wall during the conversion, each is {{in the shape of a}} long pillar with an arched top, and to the right of each pillar a hand raised above the elbow, with an open palm, signifies Sati's blessing. While three panels were plain, the other memorials were sculpted. All of them are worn out, but one of them hints that its subject may be the immolation of Sati on her husband's funeral pyre.|$|E
25|$|The D Type pillbox {{is a type}} {{unique to}} Northumberland, the name coming from its D-shaped plan. Superficially it {{is similar to a}} Type 24 as the front has three {{similarly}} angled faces approximately 2m long. However, the side walls are very short (~1m) and parallel to each other with no embrasures. The <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> is approximately 5m long with two embrasures in the examples that are not partially buried. The entrance is in the centre of the <b>rear</b> <b>wall.</b> 17 extant examples of this type have been identified from the Defence of Britain Survey.|$|E
5000|$|After that, large {{portions}} of the <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> of some buildings were demolished to facilitate salvage. [...] The former brewery has been redeveloped into a modern, mixed-use building called The Gunther, much like other Canton buildings.|$|R
50|$|Stone from St John's Pro-Cathedral in William Street (demolished in 1904) was re-used for the {{foundation}} stones, {{and in the}} front and <b>rear</b> <b>walls.</b> The main doors, most of the gothic style windows and the roof trusses were also re-used.|$|R
50|$|During winter months, {{sunlight}} {{reaches the}} back wall of the cavern, creating viable conditions for some species of algae to survive at the lower limit of light availability for photosynthesis. These algae cover the <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> in a range of red hues.|$|R
25|$|Smith then {{returned}} to the fight operating with the other NZSAS personnel to blow a hole in a <b>rear</b> <b>wall,</b> allowing the CRU to storm the compound from a neighbouring building and rescue the hostages.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the style of architecture, five unique altars line the <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> behind the Main Altar. These altars are {{dedicated}} to: St. Patrick, St. Aloysius, Mary Immaculate, St. Anne, and St. Vincent de Paul, whose life work with the poor and needy inspired Father Baker.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} side is a small biclinium. It has some rare {{surviving}} Nabataean paintings on its <b>rear</b> <b>wall,</b> {{and so it is}} called the Painted Room. Opposite the room on the north is a large cistern, part of the water system built by the original inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|A doorway gains {{access to}} the {{verandah}} {{at the front of}} the room on the western side. The verandah contains evidence of hooks used for hanging school bags on its <b>rear</b> <b>walls.</b> There is a small storeroom located {{at the front of the}} verandah.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> of {{the east}} wing, the chimney and the north part of the {{classroom}} are made of brick, {{the rest of the}} madrasah is made of white stone. Although the inner walls of the cells are coated with plaster, the outer surfaces are not.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} {{all had a}} gravity-fed firebox with {{a hopper}} over the grate for one-man operation. It was possible to access the train directly from the locomotive via doors {{in the front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> and gangways. On several engines, the Reichsbahn later made modifications to the driver's cab.|$|R
25|$|In Surrey on parts the GHQ line {{there are}} a number of pillboxes that are an {{infantry}} variant of the Type 28. These are the same size and shape as a Type 28 but have the main embrasure replaced with a Bren gun embrasure, Bren gun embrasures in the side walls and a rifle embrasure in the <b>rear</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
25|$|The temenos, or {{sanctuary}} of Endymion, with pre-Greek origins, was rebuilt in Hellenistic times, and {{may still be}} seen on a rise {{to the south of}} the ancient city. The building faces the southwest; it has a cella with a horseshoe-shaped <b>rear</b> <b>wall</b> partly cut out of the bedrock, with an entrance hall and columned forecourt.|$|E
25|$|From the porch, paneled, glazed {{double doors}} lead {{into a small}} vestibule, which opens into a single large sanctuary. It is {{minimally}} decorated, with off-white plaster walls rising to a barrel-vaulted ceiling. The sanctuary is laid out following Eastern European traditions, with the bimah {{in the center and}} pews on three sides. The ark is behind the bimah on the <b>rear</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{insides of}} both the front and <b>rear</b> <b>walls</b> of the living room, dining room and bedroom are lined with bookshelves and other {{structures}} that create an effective wall thickness of over two feet (60 cm). The resulting deep window recesses have a moderating effect on sunlight and ventilation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{memorial}} {{consists of}} twin colonnaded buildings which {{face each other}} across the grass forecourt of the cemetery, between the entrance and the [...] "Stone of Remembrance." [...] The names of the men whose graves are unknown are inscribed in panels of Portland stone built into the <b>rear</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Landsbyen venue {{saw another}} {{expansion}} in 1929. The decorations were adapted to resemble tyrolean houses with balconies and murals of snow-capped mountains {{painted on the}} <b>rear</b> <b>walls.</b> An expansion of the stage created room both for an orchestra and soloists. The inspiration was Haus Vaterland on Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.|$|R
