40|$|The goal of {{technology}} assessment {{is to provide a}} larger view of the utility and potential impact of a class {{of technology}} for a set of potential uses. In this paper, the concentration is on technology for training. Some examples are given {{of technology assessment}}s conducted on behalf of the public by national agencies. This view of technology assessment and its methodology is more global than that of product evaluation. Technology assessment attempts to determine the full range of use, and consequently must address estimates of input, context, and conditions of implementation as well as the outcomes, and multiple measures of major dimensions must be used. An approach of this sort can be called a <b>training</b> technology <b>indicator</b> <b>system.</b> In the operational conduct of technology assessment, both empirical analysis through studies and expert analysis by panels of knowledgeable individuals have a place. The implications of this definition of technology assessment for short-term and long-term studies are discussed. Three tables and two figures are provided. A 25 -item list of references is included.

40|$|With rapid urban {{development}} in China, many cities are still {{concerned about the}} quantity of the economy growth while ignoring {{the quality of the}} growth; ecological systems face a challenging situation. How to evaluate and guide a sustainable devel-opment is a vitally important question to the government of China. The study was partly performed in cooperation with the Institute of Building Research (IBR), who was entrusted by Changsha government of the Hunan Province. To evaluate the sus-tainability of {{urban development}}, a comprehensive <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> was developed and applied, which was consistent to the policy of the so called "Two oriented socie-ty", which means Resource conservation and Environment friendly society. This pa-per shows a logic methodology to develop an <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> – through the re-search, from literature review to modern concept; it shows clearly the factors that are important to build a sustainable city. The <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> was derived and compared with other existing systems. The comparison showed that the <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> we developed for the city is operational and integrated with a consistent hierarchy. Thereafter, the established indicator sys-tem was evaluated using an Analytical Hierarchy Process methodology. Indictors of ecological aspects were evaluated using the data collected, including the Changsha green field map, wetland map and ecological control maps. The <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> was applied and the result was used as decision support in urban planning for 2020. How-ever, a main limitation lied in data collection: since the data we collected was not completely the data we expected. Besides, the <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> was developed on the base of the policy called the "Two oriented society",which has its preference and limi-tation itself. Still, in sum, the <b>indicator</b> <b>system</b> we built through the research provided a satisfactory framework to the government to guide the development of the society in a macro scale.
