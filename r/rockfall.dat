5|$|Gustav {{had only}} {{effects on the}} Lesser Antilles. Large swells, light rain, and gusty winds were {{reported}} along the outer fringes of the hurricane. On August30, the Egyptian motorship Raseltin encountered rough seas in relation to Gustav, and the hull of the ship was damaged. The remnants of Gustav severely impacted a seismic research operation {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom which took place between August25 and September12. The purpose of the operation was to collect seismic reflection profiles of the <b>Rockfall</b> Plateau. On September3, the members of the team had to quickly retrieve all buoys that were deployed to avoid damage to the sensors. However, some of the research tools were damaged before they were recovered. In all, the storm delayed the project by two days.|$|E
5|$|Arlene brought strong {{thunderstorms}} and showers to much {{of eastern}} Mexico, with gale-force winds along adjacent coastlines. Upon landfall in Veracruz, Arlene produced wind speeds to 60mph (100km/h) and up to 9.11in (231.5mm) of rainfall. The winds and rain uprooted trees and caused extensive flooding, prompting at least 1,786 people throughout the state to evacuate their homes. A total of 67 landslides {{took place in the}} state; one such landslide collapsed two houses in Tlalnelhuayocan, killing one inhabitant and injuring 10others. Mudslides and <b>rockfall</b> also uprooted trees and damaged eight cars in Banerilla, though no injuries were linked to the incident. In Tihuatlán, a rescue worker was killed during the passage of the storm. Overall, Arlene affected 3,358residences across 50municipalities in Veracruz; about 2,000homes were damaged in El Higo. Continued downpours brought on the overflow of 28rivers, as well as the isolation of 116communities statewide. Other effects in Veracruz included considerable infrastructural failure, localized land subsidence, and three damaged schools in Coacoatzintla. The costs of road reconstructions totaled Mex$126million (US$10.2million). In response to the devastation, the government {{declared a state of emergency}} for 65percent of the state; by July5, 62municipalities remained under alert.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for Harry and Ron, Hagrid left {{a set of}} {{instructions:}} {{to follow}} the spiders currently fleeing into the Forbidden Forest, which they do, {{only to find the}} monster blamed for the attacks fifty years before, a massive spider named Aragog, who explains to the duo that the real monster is one that spiders fear above all others. Hermione provides the last set of clues that inform them of the monster’s identity: It is a basilisk, (hence Harry’s ability to understand it,) that kills with a stare (although no one is dead because of various devices through which they indirectly saw the monster) and which spiders (such as Aragog and his offspring) fear above all others. Harry figures out from hints Aragog dropped that a student who died during the previous attacks is Myrtle, and when Ginny is apparently taken by the monster into the Chamber, they discover that the entrance is in the bathroom they’ve been using to make Polyjuice Potion. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter the Chamber, but the dunderheaded professor (who reveals that he’s a fraud) causes a <b>rockfall</b> upon attempt to modify the boys’ memories with Ron’s damaged wand, and Harry must enter alone. He arrives to find Ginny in a weakened state being watched over by a shadowy, ghostly Riddle, who explains that he is not only the heir of Slytherin, but also grew up to become Voldemort himself, before setting the basilisk upon Harry; Harry defeats the monster, with the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Sorting Hat, and destroys the diary, which makes Riddle disappear.|$|E

30|$|Inspections of post-earthquake optical Landsat 8 {{satellite}} images and photos {{taken in the}} field after the mainshock confirm {{that many of these}} low-coherence patches are either associated with large landslides and <b>rockfalls</b> or smaller but tightly clustered <b>rockfalls</b> (Fig.  3 c). Both the radar interferograms and the optical imagery and photographs show that most of the slope failures occurred where the flanks of Mt. Kinabalu are steeper than 30 ° (Fig.  3 d).

Climbers are increasingly electing to challenge the Eiger in winter, when the crumbling face is strengthened by ice.|$|E
25|$|The {{approaches}} to the Gotthard Tunnel are susceptible to rockfalls, regularly leading to closures of the railway line.

25|$|The large mass of rock, {{acted as}} a {{monolith}} (thus resembling high-angle asteroid impact), struck with great force the sediments at bottom of Gilbert Inlet {{at the head of}} the bay. The impact created a large crater and displaced and folded recent and Tertiary deposits and sedimentary layers to an unknown depth. The displaced water and the displacement and folding of the sediments broke and uplifted 1,300 feet of ice along the entire front of the Lituya Glacier at the north end of Gilbert Inlet. Also, the impact and the sediment displacement by the <b>rockfall</b> resulted in an air bubble and in water splashing action that reached the 1,720 foot (524 m.) elevation on the other side of the head of Gilbert Inlet. The same <b>rockfall</b> impact, in combination with the strong ground movements, the net vertical crustal uplift of about 3.5 feet, and an overall tilting seaward of the entire crustal block on which Lituya Bay was situated, generated the giant solitary gravity wave which swept the main body of the bay.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, 2014, <b>rockfall</b> {{events at}} the southeastern rim of the crater and {{heightened}} seismic activity caused PHIVOLCS to increase the alert level for Mayon from 2 to 3, which indicates relatively high unrest with magma at the crater, and that hazardous eruption is possible within weeks. The rockfalls and visible incandescence of the crater from molten lava and hot volcanic gas both indicated a possible incipient breaching of the growing summit lava dome.|$|E
25|$|Most {{avalanches}} occur spontaneously during storms under increased load due to snowfall. The {{second largest}} cause of natural avalanches is metamorphic {{changes in the}} snowpack such as melting due to solar radiation. Other natural causes include rain, earthquakes, <b>rockfall</b> and icefall. Artificial triggers of avalanches include skiers, snowmobiles, and controlled explosive work. Avalanches are not triggered by loud sound. The pressure from sound is orders of magnitude too small to trigger an avalanche.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRockfalls {{fundamentally}} {{affect the}} morphodynamics of high mountain rockwalls, and represent a great danger for both people and infrastructures, but still are poorly known. By comparing old, recent and new photographs, {{in addition to}} geomorphological field data, we propose an inventory of the <b>rockfalls</b> that occurred {{since the end of}} the 'Little Ice Age' on the north side of the Aiguilles de Chamonix (Mont Blanc massif), ranging in volume from 500 to 65 000 m 3. These 42 <b>rockfalls</b> occurred after 1947, of which > 70 % during the last two decades, with a maximal frequency during the warm summers, especially in 2003. Average elevation of scars (3130 m a. s. l.) close to the lower modelled permafrost limit, and the topography (e. g. spurs) of the affected rock faces enhancing lateral heat fluxes, suggest that a climatically driven permafrost degradation has triggered many of the recent <b>rockfalls</b> in high-Alpine steep rockwalls...|$|R
