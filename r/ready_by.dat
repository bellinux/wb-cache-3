5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 was <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 7 December 1962, and {{had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its wind tunnel in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} {{had been a}} failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included developing {{a new version of}} the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{construction}} the hospital was Scotland's largest ever NHS construction project, cost £300million to build, most of which was provided by a private finance initiative arrangement; it {{was built on the}} site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital. Originally to be called Forth Valley Hospital, it was granted royal status by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming Forth Valley Royal Hospital. It was hoped the new hospital would be <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 2009, but medical services did not start to be transferred until August 2010, when the first patients were admitted. The process was completed in June 2011, and the queen officially opened the hospital on 6July 2011.|$|E
5|$|Birch's tidy {{schedule}} was disrupted in December by Groves, who ordered Oppenheimer to {{give priority to}} the gun-type over implosion, so that the weapon would be <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 1 July 1945.

The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the cruiser , arriving 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son XerxesI. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. This expedition was finally <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 480 BC, and the second Persian invasion of Greece thereby began, {{under the command of}} Xerxes himself.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{regarding}} the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece, the artist, patron, place of installation and {{date of completion}} are all known. It was intended as the centrepiece for the chapel, and Rolin approached van der Weyden around 1443, when the hospital was founded. The altarpiece was <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 1451, the year the chapel was consecrated. Painted in van der Weyden's Brussels workshop– most likely {{with the aid of}} apprentices – the completed panels were then transported to the hospice. The altarpiece is first mentioned in a 1501 inventory, when it was positioned on the high altar.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next.

5|$|The Cathedral of St John the Evangelist {{was built}} in 1882 to {{accommodate}} Portsmouth's increasing Roman Catholic population, replacing a chapel built in 1796 to the west. Before 1791 Roman Catholic chapels in towns with borough status were prohibited. The chapel was opened after the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791 was passed and then replaced by the cathedral. Its construction was completed in phases: in 1882 the nave was complete; in 1886 the crossing was finished, and the chancel was <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 1893, eleven years after its opening. During the blitz, the cathedral was badly damaged when Luftwaffe bombing destroyed Bishop's House next door. It was restored in 1970, 1982, and 2001. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth was founded in 1882 by Pope Leo XIII.|$|E
5|$|The Sydney Hotel {{was built}} within the gardens. It {{later became the}} Holburne Museum. The {{original}} design for the hotel, prepared by Thomas Baldwin in 1794, was a two-storey building which would serve the pleasure gardens. After Baldwin was bankrupted his design for the hotel was not implemented. Instead a three-storey building was designed by Charles Harcourt Masters. The foundation stone was laid in 1796 and the building was <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 1799. Visitors entered the gardens through the Hotel. Projecting {{from the rear of}} the building at first floor level was a conservatory and a semi-circular orchestra with a wide covered loggia below. Two semi-circular rows of supper boxes projected from the sides of the building.|$|E

The battalion was divided into four assault groups, one for each of the casemates of the battery, and was <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> 04:30, when the gliders carrying the sappers arrived over the battery.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} work {{was carried out}} by over 5,000 workers, mostly German engineers drafted in from several companies including Mannesmann, Gute Hoffnungshütte, Krupp and the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, supplemented by 430 miners recruited from the Ruhr and Soviet prisoners of war who were used as slave labourers. The intensive Allied bombing campaign caused delays, but {{construction work}} continued nonetheless at a high pace underground. The original plans had envisaged having the first battery of five guns <b>ready</b> <b>by</b> March 1944 and the full complement of 25 guns by 1 October 1944, but these target dates were not met.|$|E
