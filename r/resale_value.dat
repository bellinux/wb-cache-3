25|$|Under a buyback {{program called}} the <b>Resale</b> <b>Value</b> Guarantee {{available}} in 37 U.S. states, a Tesla Model S sold before July 1, 2016 included {{the right to}} return it after three years with reimbursement of 43% to 50% of its initial price. This reimbursement matched the trade-in values of competitive German luxury cars of that age. In addition to maintaining the <b>resale</b> <b>value,</b> Tesla hoped to secure a supply of used cars to refurbish and re-sell with warranty. According to Automotive News, the profit margin on used car sales in the U.S. is about triple that on new cars, and Tesla's direct sales would allow it capture resale profits. Tesla ended the program in 2016 although they retained the Residual Value Guarantee on leased vehicles.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{explanation}} for the prominent role of manufacturers in the financing of their own product sales — so called “captive finance. ” By lending against their own product as collateral, durable goods manufacturers with market power can commit to restrict production and maintain <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> in future periods, preserving rents today. Using data on captive financing support by the manufacturers of heavy equipment, we find evidence that captive financed models retain higher <b>resale</b> <b>values,</b> especially when the manufacturer has pricing power. The higher <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> enjoyed by captive financed models also convey higher pledgeability and thus allow lower downpayments, even when machines are financed by banks. We find that models with a history of captive support are preferred by buyers when financing constraints are binding. Although motivated as a rent-seeking device, captive financing may generate positive spillovers if credit constraints are important...|$|R

25|$|Income {{tax refund}} {{anticipation}} loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower's income tax refund, not at his next payday), {{but they have}} similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower's car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a logbook loan secured against a car's logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.|$|E
25|$|This {{is due in}} part to the {{reduction}} in the costs of COE and PARF between 2000 and 2005, which has incentivised owners to purchase new cars before their ten years is up. Previously, the COE and PARF represented around 80% of the cost of a medium-priced car like the Honda Accord. With the COE and PARF less expensive than in the past, in some cases the yearly drop in the COE and PARF rebate becomes significant compared to the pre-tax (OMV) price of a new car. Furthermore, with the PARF rebate starting to diminish after a car is five years old, the net amount of credit (similar to <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> or trade-in value) compared to the OMV becomes less favourable for owners of older cars. In contrast, in countries with low taxes, the most economical ownership strategy is to keep a car as long as possible until repair costs exceed a new car's depreciation costs or financing costs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{degree of}} {{humidity}} is {{required in order to}} keep wines with cork enclosures from drying out. Even when wine bottles are stored on their sides, one side of the cork is still exposed to air. Should the cork begin to dry out, it can allow oxygen to enter the bottle, filling the ullage space and possibly causing the wine to spoil or oxidize. Excessive humidity can also pose the risk of damaging wine labels, which may hinder identification or hurt potential <b>resale</b> <b>value.</b> Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson note that 75% humidity is often cited as ideal but also that there is very little significant research to definitively establish an optimal range. Concern about humidity is one of the primary reasons why wine experts such as Tom Stevenson recommend that wine should not be kept in a refrigerator since the refrigeration process often includes dehumidifying, which can quickly dry out corks.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{because of}} its reputation, the demand for places in the school has outstripped capacity, and entry was selective. The school was zoned {{at least since the}} 1960s. Since 2000, school zoning is {{determined}} by a state school enrolment scheme, which gives first preference to students living in a designated home zone, and then to brothers of current students who live outside the zone. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. Research by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand shows there is a 30 percent premium ($257,000) on houses in-zone compared to those out of zone. In 2014, nearby One Tree Hill College and Selwyn College introduced enrolment schemes which initially planned to overlap parts of the Auckland Grammar zone. Both were forced to backtrack after opposition from parents in the overlapping areas, who feared it could ultimately lead to Auckland Grammar shrinking its zone and affecting the <b>resale</b> <b>value</b> of their homes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study {{intermediation}} {{in markets}} with an underlying network structure. A good is resold via successive bilateral bargaining between linked intermediaries {{until it reaches}} one of several buyers in the network. We characterize the <b>resale</b> <b>values</b> of all traders in the network. The seller’s profit depends {{not only on the}} number of intermediaries involved in trade, but on the entire set of competing paths of access to buyers brokered by each intermediary. Local competition shapes the outcomes of intermediation. A decomposition of the network into layers of intermediation power describes the endogenous structure of local monopolies and trading paths. Local competition permits full profit extraction in transactions within the same layer, while hold-up problems impose intermediation rents on exchanges across layers. Layers delimit monopoly power from intermediation power. Only players who serve as gateways to lower layers earn significant profits. <b>Resale</b> <b>values</b> decline exponentially with each progressive layer. Trade does not maximize welfare or minimize intermediation. We provide comparative statics with respect to the network architecture and the distribution of intermediation costs. The elimination of a middleman and vertical integration increase the seller’s profit, as does the transfer of costs downstream; horizontal integration has ambiguous effects. 1...|$|R
