40|$|Purpose: A {{low quality}} {{clinical}} trial could produce errors, and these errors could, in turn, distort the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the clinical <b>trial.</b> To avoid applying distorted <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> clinically, a quality analysis <b>of</b> clinical <b>trials</b> is needed. Materials and Methods: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about erectile dysfunction (ED) conducted in Korea using Medline and KoreaMed. Quality assessment of selected RCTs was performed using three assessment tools (Jadad scales, van Tulder scale, Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool [CCRBT]). Results: The first RCT about ED conducted in Korea {{was published in}} 2002. Since 2002, a total of 20 RCTs {{have been published in}} medical journals. Among the 20 articles, only 1 article was found to have a low risk of bias according to the CCRBT. On the Jadad scale, there were 17 high quality articles, while 19 articles were assessed as high quality by the VTS. Only 2 RCTs described the randomization method adequately. Only 1 RCT presented allocation concealment. Conclusions: A low quality clinical trial could produce errors, and these errors could, in turn, distort the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the clinical <b>trial.</b> To avoid applying distorted <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> clinically, a quality analysis <b>of</b> clinical <b>trials</b> is needed. The quality of RCTs was found to be high because almost all of the selected RCTs were double blinded studies. However, the quality of RCTs wa...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{emergence}} of trust behavior at both {{the individual and the}} population levels. At the individual level, in contrast to prior research that views trust as a fixed trait, we model {{the emergence of}} trust or cooperation as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> and error learning by a computer algorithm borrowed from the field of artificial intelligence (Watkins 1989). We show that trust can indeed arise as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> and error learning. Emergence of trust at the population level is modeled by a grid-world consisting of cells of individual agents, a technique known as spatialization in evolutionary game theory. We show that, under a wide range of assumptions, trusting individuals tend to take over the population and trust becomes a systematic property. At both individual and population levels, therefore, we argue that trust behaviors will often emerge as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> learning. Key words: cooperative game, evolutionary game theory, reinforcement learning, simulation spatia...|$|R
