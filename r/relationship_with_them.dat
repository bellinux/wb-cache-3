5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> {{since the dawn of}} man. Sometimes, these {{relationships}} are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E
5|$|While {{doing their}} job, they {{encounter}} {{the police force}} Shinsengumi several times, who normally ally with Odd Jobs Gin in their work since the jobs commonly involve dangerous criminals. They eventually meet some of Gintoki's former comrades from {{the fight against the}} Amanto's invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who maintains a friendly <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> despite his terrorist activities against the bakufu. On the other hand, Shinsuke Takasugi acts as a major antagonist throughout the series, as he wants to destroy the bakufu and sees his former comrades as enemies.|$|E
5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with {{a penchant for}} humiliating and bullying others. She was touted as a new student for Hollyoaks High and was the first character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Generally, her mother Frankie never had much time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E

5|$|Victoria fit in {{within the}} Russian {{aristocracy}} and {{the circle of}} her mother-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna. As French was frequently spoken in high circles, Victoria never completely mastered the Russian language. Although she was a first cousin of both Nicholas II, on her mother's side, and to Empress Alexandra, on her father's side, the <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> was neither close nor warm. As Kirill became a keen auto racer, the couple often took trips by car: a favorite pastime was traveling through the Baltic provinces. Victoria dreaded the long Russian winter with its short days, and she traveled abroad frequently visiting her sister Marie in Romania and her mother {{in the south of}} France or in Coburg. Victoria and her husband had a close relationship with their daughters, Maria and Kira. The family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the Gulf of Finland and were in Riga when the war broke out.|$|E

25|$|For one thing, {{we would}} no longer allow breeding. People could not create {{different}} breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals {{would have to be}} refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.|$|E
25|$|As Joan {{was growing}} up with her grandmother, her father was back in England, already {{arranging}} marriages for his daughter. He hoped to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter's marriage, so he conducted the arrangement in a very “business like style”. He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King Rudolph I of Germany. Edward then brought her home from France {{for the first time}} to meet him. As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she “stood in no awe of her parents” and had a fairly distanced <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smith's {{chapter on}} colonies {{in turn would}} help shape British {{imperial}} debates from the mid-nineteenth century onward. The Wealth of Nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's thirteen American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and, by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain {{would be able to}} develop and maintain a free-trade <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.|$|E

25|$|Lynn's {{relationship}} with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, beginning in 1960, helped Lynn become the number one female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She was still fighting to regain these rights 30 years after ending her business <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> but was ultimately denied the publishing rights. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of these contracts. Although Kitty Wells had become the first major female country vocalist during the 1950s, by the time Lynn recorded her first record, only three other women—Patsy Cline, Skeeter Davis, and Jean Shepard—had become top stars. Lynn joined The Grand Ole Opry on September 25, 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of the Shang dynasty in the middle Yangtze area came to a sudden end with the dynasty's destruction by the Zhou people in c. 1046 BC, who in turn established their own dynasty on the Central Plains. To {{the people of the}} Yangtze, however, the Zhou were not unknown. Indeed, the Records of the Grand Historian record that before the conquest of Shang, the ruler of Chu, Yuxiong, had traveled {{all the way to the}} Zhou court at Feng in Shaanxi to submit to King Wen of Zhou. Perhaps, speculates Ralph D. Sawyer, Yu Xiong had recognized that the Shang dynasty was crumbling or he simply wanted to ensure good relations with all powerful neighbors. Either way, he recognized the Zhou as promising upstarts and established a friendly <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Consequently, when the Zhou overthrew the Shang dynasty, Chu supported the former by supplying bows and arrows.|$|E
25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E

25|$|Grand Duchess Anastasia {{brought up}} her {{children}} with simplicity and more freedom than she received from her parents, and would {{keep a close}} <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> She spoke French {{to her husband and}} English with her children. She was a keen tennis player, with her own tennis court at the Villa Wenden. She loved Italian music, particularly the operas of Puccini, and the theater. Her extant letters reveal a warm, caring person, who always seems to have been happy about life. She frequented many other European royals who stayed at the Riviera; her parents and brothers were also frequent visitors. Her mother {{died of a heart attack}} in 1891, and Anastasia remained very close to her widower father and her brothers, particularly the two eldest Nicholas and Michael. Anastasia spent lavishly from the Grand Duke's income and her own dowry, for which she was widely criticized, but she loved to shock people who condemned her. She liked society and became a frequent visitor to the gambling tables of Monte Carlo, losing a large sum of money at the casino; but in spite of her extravagances, she never lost her husband's affection.|$|E

500|$|The {{first contact}} with Spanish explorers {{occurred}} in 1513 when Juan Ponce de León {{stopped at a}} bay he called Chequescha, or Biscayne Bay. Finding the Tequesta unwelcoming, he left {{to make contact with}} the Calusa. Menéndez met the Tequesta in 1565 and maintained a friendly <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> building some houses and setting up a mission. He also took the chief's nephew to Havana to be educated, and the chief's brother to Spain. After Menéndez visited, there are few records of the Tequesta: a reference to them in 1673, and further Spanish contact to convert them. The last reference to the Tequesta during their existence was written in 1743 by a Spanish priest named Father Alaña, who described their ongoing assault by another tribe. The survivors numbered only 30, and the Spanish transported them to Havana. In 1770 a British surveyor described multiple deserted villages in the region where the Tequesta had lived. Archeologist John Goggin suggested that by the time European Americans settled the area in 1820, any remaining Tequesta were assimilated into the Seminole people. Common descriptions of Native Americans in Florida by 1820 identified only the [...] "Seminoles".|$|E

He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: I had two young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> – was made impossible by my job.
