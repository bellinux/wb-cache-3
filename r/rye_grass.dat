25|$|The {{biggest change}} to Blackheath {{resulted}} from extensive mineral extraction in the 18th and early 19th centuries, when gravel, sand and chalk were extracted. This left large pits on {{many parts of}} the heath. In 1945, pits were filled in with bomb rubble from World War II, then covered with topsoil and seeded with <b>rye</b> <b>grass,</b> leaving only Vanbrugh Pits to the north-east side and Eliot Pits in the south-west. Infilled areas can be spotted easily, especially in late spring and early summer, because of the deeper green colour of the <b>rye</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Manning–Kamna Farm is {{a private}} farm {{adjacent}} to Hillsboro in Washington County, Oregon, United States. Settled in the 1850s, ten buildings built between 1883 and 1930 still stand, including the cross-wing western farmhouse. These ten structures comprise the buildings added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 {{as an example of}} a farm in the region from the turn of the 20th century. Until the 1950s the farm was used to grow seeds, including <b>rye</b> <b>grass</b> and vetch. Listed buildings on the property include a barn, smokehouse, pumphouse, woodshed, and privy.|$|E

50|$|Barley crown rust can infect rye {{as well as}} barley. In addition, it also infects {{a number}} of wild grasses {{including}} quackgrass (Elytrigia repens), slender wheatgrass (Elymus tranchycaulus), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), and several wheatgrasses (Elytrigia spp.) and wild <b>rye</b> <b>grasses</b> (Elymus spp. and Leymus spp.). The fungus readily forms telia on these hosts, which serve as a reservoir of overwintering teliospores. Quackgrass {{may be the most}} important reservoir for overwintering telia. This ubiquitous, perennial weed is very susceptible to the rust and is often found growing near Rhamnus.|$|R

The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s were made of dry, hollow, <b>rye</b> <b>grass.</b> Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E
25|$|The Kamnas {{had four}} children, though one {{died in an}} {{accident}} at the farm at age three. One son, Edgar, in time took over the farming on the farm. About 1910 the Kamna family built an addition to the barn, and around 1920 built a second addition to the barn. They continued adding buildings to the farm in the early 1900s including a woodshed, privy, pumphouse, chicken coop, smokehouse, potato shed, and a canning shed. The last addition was a garage in the 1920s. In the 1920s the family added indoor plumbing to the farmhouse, {{and in the process}} enclosed parts of two porches. The Kamnas grew oats, fescue, <b>rye</b> <b>grass,</b> vetch, and sub-clover on the farm and used the barn for sorting and packing the seeds, running the farm into the 1950s. As of 2007 the farm was owned by Wayne Reed and Petrina Pometto. On October 10, 2007, the Manning–Kamna Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture, creating the landscape of largely rectangular fields that characterises the Lowland Scottish landscape today.

Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters. There were also organisational changes that would have long term consequences, including the commutation of payments in kind for those in money, the granting of longer leases and the consolidation of smaller holdings.|$|E
25|$|As feudal distinctions {{declined}} in the early modern era, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged {{to form a new}} identifiable group, the lairds. With the yeomen, these heritors were the major landholding orders. Others with property rights included husbandmen and free tenants. Many young people left home to become domestic and agricultural servants. The English invasions of the 1640s {{had a profound impact on}} the Scottish economy. Under the Commonwealth, the country was relatively highly taxed, but gained access to English markets. After the Restoration customs duties with England were re-established. Economic conditions were generally favourable, as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle-raising. After the Union of 1707 there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Introductions included haymaking, the English plough, foreign grasses, <b>rye</b> <b>grass</b> and clover, turnips and cabbages. Lands were enclosed, displacing the run rig system and free pasture. Marshes were drained, lime was put down, roads built, woods planted, drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. The resulting Lowland Clearances saw hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly removed.|$|E
500|$|The psychoactive {{compounds}} {{are also}} present in the sclerotia: in one analysis, the levels of psilocybin obtained from sclerotia ranged from 0.31% to 0.68% by dry weight, and were dependent upon {{the composition of the}} growth medium. Sclerotia are sold under the nickname [...] "philosopher's stones". They have been described as [...] "resembling congealed muesli", and having a somewhat bitter taste similar to walnut. Strains existing as commercial cultivation kits sold originally in countercultural drug magazines are derived from the original fruit body found by Pollock in Florida. Methods were originally developed by Pollock, and later extended by Stamets in the 1980s to cultivate the sclerotia on a substrate of <b>rye</b> <b>grass</b> (Lolium), and on straw. Sclerotia prepared in this way take from 3 to 12weeks to develop. Pollock was granted a US patent in 1981 for his method of producing sclerotia.|$|E

It {{has been shown to}} cause minimal damage in fescues, bentgrasses and Kentucky bluegrass. The disease is of particular significance on the warm season St. Augustine grass and has been common in the Southern states since first being reported in 1971. Recently infections have been found as far north as Long Island, the lower Hudson Valley of New York State, and Pennsylvania. This disease is of great concern to mainly turf managers and less of a concern to homeowners. Infections and subsequent symptomatic tissue can appear quite quickly. Damage is usually noticed during the warmer months of August and September. Conditions favoring infection include hot days over 80 °F, nights with prolonged cloud cover when humidity is high, and prolonged leaf wetness. Infected leaves may have water soaked lesions and appear chlorotic. The youngest leaves often take on a characteristic fishhook shape. The disease is most severe on young seedlings. Gray to brown lesions range in size from 2 - 5 cm. At times, a yellow margin may surround the lesion and the leaf blades may have dark brown borders. The large amount of spores (Fig. 1) produced by the fungus creates a "felted " look to the leaf blades. Damaged spots of turf first appear reddish-brown in color and 2 - 5 centimeters in diameter.
