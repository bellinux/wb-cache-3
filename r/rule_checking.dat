50|$|Design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> or check(s) (DRC) is {{the area}} of {{electronic}} design automation that determines whether the physical layout of a particular chip layout satisfies a series of recommended parameters called design rules. Design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> is a major step during physical verification signoff on the design, which also involves LVS (layout versus schematic) check, XOR checks, ERC (electrical rule check) and antenna checks. For advanced processes some fabs also insist upon the use of more restricted rules to improve yield.|$|E

50|$|ECAD, Inc., {{based in}} Santa Clara, California, {{was an early}} vendor of {{electronic}} design automation software. The company was {{best known for its}} design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> product Dracula, but also produced IC layout and PC layout software.

50|$|CAD {{software}} {{was an important}} part of the VLSI effort. This led to major improvements in CAD technology for layout, design <b>rule</b> <b>checking,</b> and simulation. The tools developed in this program were used extensively in both academic research programs and in industry. The ideas were developed in commercial implementations by companies such as VLSI Technology, Cadnetix, and Synopsis.|$|E
50|$|The Electric VLSI Design System is an EDA tool {{written in}} the early 1980s by Steven M. Rubin. Electric is used to draw {{schematics}} and to do integrated circuit layout.It can also handle hardware description languages such as VHDL and Verilog.

50|$|Gradually, {{electronic}} {{design automation}} automated {{more and more}} of the place-and-route work.

50|$|The PCB Layout module is {{automatically}} given connectivity {{information in the}} form of a netlist from the schematic capture module. It applies this information, together with the user specified design rules and various design automation tools, to assist with error free board design. Design <b>Rule</b> <b>Checking</b> does not include high speed design constraints. PCB's of up to 16 copper layers can be produced with design size limited by product configuration.|$|E
50|$|The effort {{input to}} harden the soft IP means {{quality of the}} target technology, goals of design and the {{methodology}} employed. The hard IP has been proven in the target technology and application. E.g. the hard core in GDS II format is said to clean in DRC (Design <b>rule</b> <b>checking),</b> and LVS (see Layout Versus Schematic). I.e. that can pass all the rules required for manufacturing by the specific foundry.|$|E

50|$|ECAD {{was founded}} in August 1982 by Paul Huang and Glen M. Antle, who had worked at Texas Instruments, ITT, Teledyne, Data General, and (just before {{founding}} ECAD), the microelectronics products division of Systems Engineering Laboratories (SEL) in Sunnyvale, California. While developing a new computer design at SEL, the CAD group wrote a new (and very fast) algorithm for Design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> (DRC). These ideas eventually became the basis of ECAD's products.|$|E
5000|$|Given {{the final}} layout, circuit {{extraction}} computes the parasitic resistances and capacitances. In {{the case of}} a digital circuit, this will then be further mapped into delay information, from which the circuit performance can be estimated, usually by static timing analysis. This, and other final tests such as design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> and power analysis (collectively called signoff) are intended to ensure that the device will function correctly over all extremes of the process, voltage and temperature. When this testing is complete the photomask information is released for chip fabrication.|$|E
50|$|Transfer of {{schematics}} to a PCB is {{a straightforward}} process in CircuitMaker since PCB footprints are automatically attached to any component on the schematic that was picked from the Octopart library. PCB footprints may have simple 3D models or complex STEP models attached to them, enabling real time 3D {{rendering of the}} PCB during development. CircuitMaker supports design rule configuration and real time design <b>rule</b> <b>checking.</b> Some advanced features, including differential pair routing and polygon pour management, are also available. Production files can be exported directly, although an external Gerber viewer must be used to check the exports. The entire PCB can also be exported as a 3D STEP model for further use in mechanical 3D CAD software.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Electromigration {{is caused}} by high current-density stress in the {{metallization}} patterns and is {{a major source of}} break-down in electronic devices. It is, therefore, an important reliability issue to verify current densities within all stressed metallization patterns. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for hierarchical verification of current densities in arbitrarily shaped custom-circuit layouts as commonly used in analog circuits and analog blocks in mixed-signal ICs. Our approach includes a quasi-three-dimensional model to verify irregularities, such as vias and incorporates thermal simulation data to account for the tempera-ture dependency of the electrical field configuration and the elec-tromigration process. The described methodology, which can be integrated into any IC design flow as a design <b>rule</b> <b>check,</b> has been successfully tested and verified in commercial design flows.

5000|$|Figure 2 again {{looks at}} TCAD {{capabilities}} {{but this time}} more {{in the context of}} design flow information and how this relates to the physical layers and modeling of the electronic design automation (EDA) world. Here the simulation levels of process and device modeling are considered as integral capabilities (within TCAD) that together provide the [...] "mapping" [...] from mask-level information to the functional capabilities needed at the EDA level such as compact models ("technology files") and even higher-level behavioral models. Also shown is the extraction and electrical <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> (ERC); this indicates that many of the details that to date have been embedded in analytical formulations, may in fact also be linked to the deeper TCAD level in order to support the growing complexity of technology scaling.|$|E
50|$|The main {{objective}} of design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> (DRC) {{is to achieve}} a high overall yield and reliability for the design. If design rules are violated the design may not be functional. To meet this goal of improving die yields, DRC has evolved from simple measurement and Boolean checks, to more involved rules that modify existing features, insert new features, and check the entire design for process limitations such as layer density. A completed layout consists {{not only of the}} geometric representation of the design, but also data that provides support for the manufacture of the design. While design rule checks do not validate that the design will operate correctly, they are constructed to verify that the structure meets the process constraints for a given design type and process technology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{types of}} EDA routers were [...] "manual routers"—the drafter clicked a mouse on the endpoint of each line segment of each net.Modern PCB design software typically provides [...] "interactive routers"—the drafter selects a pad and clicks {{a few places}} to give the EDA tool an idea of where to go, and the EDA tool tries to place wires as close to that path as possible without violating design <b>rule</b> <b>checking</b> (DRC). Some more advanced interactive routers have [...] "push and shove" [...] features in an interactive router; the EDA tool pushes other nets out of the way, if possible, in order to place a new wire where the drafter wants it and still avoid violating DRC.Modern PCB design software also typically provides [...] "autorouters" [...] that route all remaining unrouted connections without human intervention.|$|E
