The distribution of separations p(s) is considered, and the normalized correlation length (i. e. the mean separation between stars, divided by the overall radius of the cluster) is {{shown to be a}} robust indicator {{of the extent to which}} a smooth cluster is centrally concentrated. For spherical clusters having volume-density n?r? (with between 0 and 2) decreases monotonically with, from ? 0. 8 to ? 0. 6.

However, for fractal star clusters (with fractal dimension D between 1. 5 and 3) decreases monotonically with D (from ? 0. 8 to ? 0. 6).
