40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} two {{mechanisms to}} procure differentiated goods: a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> and an English auction with bidding credits. In the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote,</b> each seller submits a {{price and the}} inherent quality of his good. Then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference in quality and price. In the English auction with bidding credits, the buyer assigns a bidding credit to each seller conditional upon {{the quality of the}} seller’s good. Then the sellers compete in an English auction with the winner receiving the auction price and his bidding credit. Game theoretic models predict the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> is socially efficient but the English auction with bidding credits is not. The optimal bidding credit assignment under compensates for quality advantages, creating a market distortion in which the buyer captures surplus {{at the expense of the}} seller’s profit and social efficiency. In experiments, the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> is less efficient than the English auctions with bidding credits. Moreover, both the buyer and seller receive more surplus in the English auction with bidding credits. ...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of dynamic}} auctions {{is a major}} {{component}} in many enterprises' e-procurement initiatives. In the case where suppliers offer goods and services of inherently different quality the traditional mechanism has been the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote.</b> In a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote,</b> suppliers submit a sealed bid and the fixed quality of their offering and then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference between quality and price. The winning seller receives a price equal to his submitted bid. The reverse auction has immerged as the most commonly adopted dynamic auction for this setting. In a reverse auction, suppliers first submit the qualities of their goods and then the suppliers participate in an auction with the same message space as an open outcry English auction (descending {{because this is a}} procurement auction.) However, the auction is only used to set each suppliers price. The last price a supplier submits in the auction becomes their actual submitted price. After, the auction the buyer selects the winning seller who offers the greatest difference between quality and actual submitted price. We provide a game theoretic analysis of both mechanisms. We also provide extensive experimental evaluation of the two mechanisms as wellReverse Auction, <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quote,</b> procurement...|$|R

Supplier qualification screening is costly for the manufacturer, for example involving reference checks, financial audits, and on-site visits.

While suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (pre-qualification), we allow the manufacturer to delay {{all or part of}} the qualification until after the auction (post-qualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis we analytically explore the tradeoffs between varying levels of pre- and post-qualification. While using post-qualification causes the expected contract payment to increase (bids from unqualified suppliers are discarded) we find that standard industrial practices of pre-qualification only can be improved upon by judicious use of post-qualification, particularly when supplier qualification screening is moderately expensive relative to the value of the contract to the buyer...|$|R

40|$|Considering {{multiple}} attributes while evaluating <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> (RFQs) {{responses from}} suppliers is gaining significant importance in industrial procurement. While price {{has traditionally been}} {{the most important factor}} in evaluating RFQ responses, incorporation of non-price attributes such as quality and delivery performance is becoming essential and critical. Research on multi-attribute RFQs has received significant attention in an auction format with models addressing issues relating to auction mechanism design, winner determination, and auction dynamics, primarily from a buyer's perspective. There have been few approaches, if any, that have investigated the issue of response to multi-attribute RFQs from a supplier's perspective, which is the focus of this paper. Such an approach will assist a supplier in effectively responding to RFQs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of winning future contracts. It also indirectly assists in supplier development and helps foster competition among suppliers, which benefits both the buyers and the suppliers.

40|$|We {{consider}} the problem faced by a seller in determining an optimal price to quote {{in response to}} a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quote</b> (RFQ) from a prospective buyer. The optimal price is determined by maximizing expected profit, given the underlying seller costs of the bid items and a computed probability of winning the bid as a function of price and other bid features such as buyer characteristics and the degree of competition. An entropy-based information-gain metric is used to quantify the contribution of the extracted features to predicting the win/loss label. A naive Bayes classification model is developed to predict the bid outcome (win or loss) as a function of these features. This model naturally generates the win probability as a function of bid price required to compute the optimal price. Results obtained by applying this model to a database of bid transactions involving computer sales demonstrate statistically significant lift curves for predicting bid outcome. A method for creating additional synthetic bids to improve computation of the win probability function is demonstrated. Finally, the computed optimal prices generated via this approach are compared to the actual bid prices approved by human pricing experts...|$|R

Improved technological and communication capabilities have allowed firms to maximize the efficiency of each step of their business process. This thesis aims to explore some aspects of this outsourcing trend by looking at a test scenario involving the manufacturing and shipping costs of the production of a test part. For this project an injection molded plastic plate made of polypropylene copolymer was chosen as a test part, and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> were sent to 64 plastic injection molding firms around the world. Shipping costs were calculated based on a test firm location of Chicago, Illinois. The further the manufacturer is from the test firm location, the higher the shipping costs are. The manufacturing costs are generally lower for Asian manufacturers than for European or American manufacturers, varying inversely proportionally to the distance from the test firm location. Overall, the combined manufacturing and shipping costs are approximately parabolic when expressed as a function of distance from the test firm location. by Linda Yu Liu. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|The {{procurement}} {{of transportation}} services {{is an important}} task for shippers {{because of the need}} to control costs {{at the same time as}} providing high service levels. When shippers with goods and/or materials to transport seek transportation services from outside companies they typically put out a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> from a set of carriers. They then assign contracts based on negotiated service charges. This process is similar to a simple sealed-bid auction in which each bidder submits a sealed bid for a single item. In the past, when shippers need to procure transportation services for a set of distinctive delivery routes (called lanes) they would obtain <b>quotes</b> <b>for</b> each lane individually and repeat the simple auction process for each lane. Alternatively, they might negotiate for bundles of lanes with a single carrier at a time. However, in the last few years software has been developed to allow shippers to make all lanes available for bidding simultaneously and to allow carriers to simultaneously bid upon combinations of individual lanes. This method of awarding contracts, conventionally called a combinatorial auction, has been reported to result in significant cost savings for shippers. Our research examines the benefits of combinatorial auctions primarily from the carrier's perspective. Preliminary findings, based on a simple simulation model suggest that benefits for carriers can also be significant. Urban Studies and Planning...|$|R

The goal is to enhance the shopping experience of the clients, increase the retention rate and grow the customer base of the company. We establish two logistic regression models. The first model is to predict the probability of suppliers winning an RFQ (<b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote).</b> From the calculated probabilities, {{we are able to}} rank all the suppliers and tell the buyers who may be the most qualified providers for them. Also, the suppliers will be aware of their odds of winning among all the competitors. Our model shows that price is the most decisive factor for winning, and geography and prior business relationships with the buyer are also important. The second model is used to estimate the probability of successfully awarding an RFQ. We model how likely the RFQ is to be awarded by the buyer. Such information will be especially helpful to suppliers. The process of the RFQ and the relation and intention of the buyer seem to be the most influential factors. by Shuo Tian. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design a {{prototype}} for a system that will increase business efficiency through improved electronic document management, improved procurement management and automation of repetitive tasks. This prototype is functional and is used as the primary system at present, {{with a view to}} develop it into a dedicated piece of software. The only software {{that could be used for}} development was the Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac package or any standard software that exists as part of the Macintosh OSX snow leopard operating system. The system consists of three main parts 1. File management system 2. Procurement and vendor analysis system 3. Task modules The file management system was developed using the Macintosh OSX file browser, ‘Finder’, as its backbone. The file management framework was developed using a template approach to promote consistency in the filing process. The vendor analysis system was developed using Microsoft Excel. It enables the user to manage the contact details of all vendors, the status of all quotes and automatically perform simple analyses on quotes. In addition, it also performs reports statistics such as exposure, opportunity, adjustment and coverage. The task modules are pieces of computer code written using the Applescript computer language. There are five modules: 1. New job. This automates the job registration process. 2. Close job. This automatically moves old jobs from the active job list while maintaining the functionality of all hyperlinks. 3. Update folders. This automatically creates folders within the file framework that match the package names in the vendor analysis system. 4. RFQ. This takes the contact information and bill of quantities from the vendor analysis system and automatically drafts a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> letter. It then automatically drafts an email and attaches the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> to it. 5. Return RFQ. This module reads the returned quote and automatically enters the prices into the vendor analysis system. Opportunities to use different parts of the system have varied considerably. The file management system, new job and close job task modules have been used several times with promising results. Jobs are now registered, filed and stored in a consistent manner and may be done so by any staff member quickly. The vendor analysis system has been used in practice twice. The system was very successful and proved to be a powerful tool for reporting on the procurement process. The system was designed to provide information at the end of the process, however, it was found to be extremely useful for progress reporting. The RFQ and Return RFQ task modules have not been used in practice as yet. Alpha testing gave hopeful results as far as the speed and accuracy with which this information is handled and transferred. It is too soon to realise the full impact of this system on business efficiency. More data will need to be collected over a number of jobs to confirm the preliminary results in this paper. This project can be expanded further to • Include a database for storing various vendor and job information • Develop a method that will notify vendors when new jobs are available and allow them to retrieve documents and submit quotes online. Chilli Project Services are investigating these ideas. ...|$|R
