Major influences come from new technologies like Location Based Services. Due to the small displays of mobile devices and specific mobile usage contexts selecting and presenting only the most relevant information is indispensable. The paper argues for considering further relevance types beyond positional <b>relevance</b> used <b>in</b> LBS. First general theories of relevance are discussed before showing the use of the <b>relevance</b> concept <b>in</b> mobile cartography. Based on the relation between mobile usage context and relevance a set of relevance types is derived. Approaches for computing compound relevance measures enable applying the relevance as a filtering criterion or as an attribute that can be visualised. Various graphical means for visualising differences <b>in</b> <b>relevance</b> demonstrate the practical use of <b>relevance</b> measures <b>in</b> mobile cartography and represent a point of departure for further research...|$|R

5|$|Another {{performance}} issue {{pertains to}} the choice of tempi, which is of special <b>relevance</b> <b>in</b> Schubert's major instrumental works, particularly in the opening movements. Schubert often notated his opening movements with moderate tempo indications, the extreme case being the Molto moderato of the B-flat piano sonata. The latter movement in particular, has been interpreted in vastly different speeds. Ever since the famous performances by Sviatoslav Richter, taking the opening movement at an extremely slow pace, similar tempo interpretations for this movement have been frequent. However, the majority of Schubert scholars tend to dismiss such an interpretation, arguing instead for a more flowing pace, a measured allegro.|$|E

Overviews on information retrieval, legal research, computer-assisted legal research (CALR), {{and the role of}} citations in legal research enable the formulation of a proposition: <b>Relevance</b> ranking <b>in</b> contemporary CALR systems could profit from the use of citation analysis techniques. After examining potential previous work in the areas of Web search, legal network analysis, and legal citation analysis, the proposition is further developed into a testable hypothesis: A basic citation-based algorithm, despite all its shortcomings, could be used to significantly improve <b>relevance</b> ranking <b>in</b> computer-assisted legal research.

5|$|With Peter Schneider, Ehlers {{embarked}} on an in-depth study of the foundations of gravitational lensing. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the gravitational field to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical <b>relevance.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we try {{to answer}} the {{question}} of how to improve the state-of-the-art methods for <b>relevance</b> ranking <b>in</b> web search by query segmentation. Here, by query segmentation it is meant to segment the input query into segments, typically natural language phrases, so that the performance of <b>relevance</b> ranking <b>in</b> search is increased. We propose employing the re-ranking approach in query segmentation, which first employs a generative model to create top $k$ candidates and then employs a discriminative model to re-rank the candidates to obtain the final segmentation result. The method has been widely utilized for structure prediction in natural language processing, but has not been applied to query segmentation, as far as we know. Furthermore, we propose a new method for using the result of query segmentation <b>in</b> <b>relevance</b> ranking, which takes both the original query words and the segmented query phrases as units of query representation. We investigate whether our method can improve three relevance models, namely BM 25, key n-gram model, and dependency model. Our experimental results on three large scale web search datasets show that our method can indeed significantly improve <b>relevance</b> ranking <b>in</b> all the three cases.

40|$|Active {{learning}} {{has been shown}} as a key technique for improving content-based image retrieval (CBIR) performance. Among various methods, support vector machine (SVM) active learning is popular for its application to <b>relevance</b> feedback <b>in</b> CBIR. However, the regular SVM active {{learning has}} two main drawbacks when used for relevance feedback. First, SVM often suffers from learning with {{a small number of}} labeled examples, which is the case <b>in</b> <b>relevance</b> feedback. Second, SVM active learning usually {{does not take into account}} the redundancy among examples, and therefore could select multiple examples <b>in</b> <b>relevance</b> feedback that are similar (or even identical) to each other. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that exploits both semi-supervised kernel learning and batch mode active learning for <b>relevance</b> feedback <b>in</b> CBIR. In particular, a kernel function is first learned from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled examples. The kernel will then be used to effectively identify the informative and diverse examples for active learning via a min-max framework. An empirical study with relevance feedback of CBIR showed that the proposed scheme is significantly more effective than other state-of-the-art approache...|$|R
