50|$|Breastfeeding delays the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> ovarian cycles by {{disrupting the}} pattern of pulsatile release of GnRH from the {{hypothalamus}} and hence LH from the pituitary. The plasma concentrations of FSH during lactation are sufficient to induce follicle growth, but the inadequate pulsatile LH signal results in a reduced estradiol production by these follicles. When follicle growth and estradiol secretion does increase to normal, the suckling stimulus prevents the generation <b>of</b> a <b>normal</b> preovulatory LH surge and follicles either fail to rupture, or become atretic or cystic. Only when the suckling stimulus declines sufficiently to allow generation <b>of</b> a <b>normal</b> preovulatory LH surge to occur will ovulation take place {{with the formation of}} a corpus luteum of variable normality. Thus suckling delays the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> ovarian cyclicity by disrupting but not totally inhibiting, the <b>normal</b> pattern <b>of</b> release of GnRH by the hypothalamus.

40|$|Summary. The post-partum {{secretion}} of LH, FSH and prolactin was monitored in 15 suckling and 6 non-suckling Prł=e' Sud ewes lambing {{during the}} breeding season by measuring plasma hormone concentrations daily at 6 -h intervals and also weekly at 20 -min intervals for 6 h from parturition to <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> regular cyclic ovarian activity. There {{was a constant}} phenomenon in the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> patterns <b>of</b> FSH and LH secretion: there was a rise in FSH values culminating on average on Day 4 post partum and returning subsequently to values observed during the oestrous cycle, and concurrently {{an increase in the}} frequency and amplitude of LH pulses more pro-gressive in suckling than in non-suckling ewes which led to an elevation of LH mean concentrations and occurrence of an LH surge. Since neither the FSH secretory pattern nor FSH mean values differed between suckling and non-suckling ewes, the results suggested that LH pulsatile pattern was a major limiting factor for the <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> oestrous cycles. Before regular oestrous cycles resumed other changes in preovulatory LH surges also occurred: (i) they increased in duration and probably in amplitude; (ii) they were preceded by an acceleration in LH pulse frequency and a large decrease in FSH values as in normal cyclic ewes; and (iii) at least in non-suckling ewes they occurred concurrently with a prolactin surge...|$|R

This study compared the short-term results of two tension-free methods of repair: totally extraperitoneal (TEP) laparoscopic patch repair and the open Lichtenstein mesh technique. Methods: A total of 1513 men from 11 hospitals who presented with a primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to one of the two methods. Operating time, short-term complications, reoperations, postoperative pain, consumption of analgesics, sick leave and time to <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> physical activities were recorded. Results: Some 1371 of the 1513 men underwent surgery, 665 in the TEP group and 706 in the Lichtenstein group. The median duration of operation was 55 min for both procedures and 91. 0 per cent of die patients in both groups were discharged on the day of operation. Patients in the TEP group experienced less postoperative pain (P < 0. 001), consumed fewer analgesics (P < 0. 001), had a shorter period of sick leave (7 versus 12 days; P < 0. 001) and a shorter time to <b>resumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> physical activity (20 versus 31 days; P < 0. 001).
