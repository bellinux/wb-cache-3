2500|$|In {{a recent}} review of the major {{research}} on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called [...] "the ratchet effect:" [...] innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered [...] "by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along." [...] The key point is that children are born good at {{a particular kind of}} social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations. For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls [...] "imitative learning," [...] (as opposed to [...] "emulative learning" [...] characteristic of other primates) and second, [...] the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates). [...] Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the <b>ratchet</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
40|$|Previous work [Gong and Brumer, Phys. Rev. Lett., 97, 240602 (2006) ] motivates {{this study}} {{as to how}} asymmetry-driven quantum <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects</b> can persist despite a {{corresponding}} fully chaotic classical phase space. A simple perspective of ratchet dynamics, based on the Heisenberg picture, is introduced. We show that <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects</b> are in principle of common origin in classical and quantum mechanics, though full chaos suppresses these effects in the former but not necessarily the latter. The relationship between <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects</b> and coherent dynamical control is noted. Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{effects of}} a firm’s attempt to {{optimize}} an existing incentive scheme to increase sales growth for direct store delivery workers. Before optimization workers reported <b>Ratchet</b> <b>Effects</b> that lowered productivity. The altered incentive plan offered higher compensation for increased sales relative to a sales growth target, and lower compensation for failing to meet the target. We gathered data on performance and attitudes at pilot and control sites {{before and after the}} change. Relative to control sites, sales growth increased in the pilot sites by two percent, a meaningful contribution to firm profits. We find no change in distortion of effort or manipulation of the per-formance measure. Workers did not substantially change number of hours worked, though alloca-tion of time across tasks changed slightly. Despite increased productivity, workers continued to report <b>Ratchet</b> <b>Effects</b> after the change.

Extending earlier dynamic moral hazard models, I propose a new test for <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects,</b> showing that classroom inputs are distorted less when schools face a shorter horizon over which they can influence student performance. I then exploit grade span variation using rich educational data to credibly identify the extent of dynamic gaming, finding compelling evidence of <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects</b> based on a triple-differences approach. Further analysis indicates that these effects are driven primarily by effort distortions, with teacher reallocations playing a secondary role...|$|R

40|$|Strategic {{delegation}} {{to an independent}} regulator with a pure consumer standard improves dynamic regulation by mitigating <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects</b> associated with short term contracting. A consumer standard alleviates the regulator’s myopic temptation to raise output after learning the firm is inefficient. Anticipating this tougher regulatory behavior, efficient firms find cost exaggeration less attractive. This reduces the need for long term rents and mitigates <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects.</b> The regulator’s welfare standard biased towards consumers comes, however, {{at the cost of}} some allocative distortion from the genuine social welfare perspective. Hence, a trade-off results which favors strategic delegation when efficient firms are relatively likely...|$|R

40|$|The {{persistence}} of <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects,</b> i. e., nonzero mass flux under a zero-mean time-dependent drive, when many-body interactions are present, is studied via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations {{of a simple}} liquid flowing in an asymmetric nanopore. The results show that (i) <b>ratchet</b> <b>effects</b> persist under many-body density correlations induced by the forcing; (ii) two distinct linear responses (flux proportional to the drive amplitude) appear under strong loads. One regime has the same conductivity of linear response theory up to a forcing of about 10 kT, while the second displays a smaller conductivity, the difference in responses is due to geometric effects alone. (iii) Langevin simulations based on a naive mapping of the many-body equilibrium bulk diffusivity, D, onto the damping rate, gamma are also found to yield two distinct linear responses.

Muller proposed this mechanism as one reason why sexual reproduction may be favored over asexual reproduction.

This effect has also been observed in those regions of the genomes of sexual organisms which do not undergo recombination.|$|E

The <b>ratchet</b> <b>effect</b> can denote an economic strategy arising {{in an environment}} where incentive depends on both current and past production, such as in a competitive industry employing piece rates. The producers observe that since incentive is readjusted based on their production, any increase in production confers only a temporary increase in incentive while requiring a permanently greater expenditure of work. They therefore decide not to reveal hidden production capacity unless forced to do so.|$|E
