5|$|After {{reviewing}} {{traffic conditions}} in 1961, the Ministry of Transport planned {{to improve the}} North Circular <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> higher capacity, grade separating as many junctions as possible, particularly those at important arterial routes. In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial motorways throughout London with the hope to ease traffic congestion in the central area. Under this plan the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual-carriageway standard throughout {{the majority of its}} length by the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena {{on what is}} now NY420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued west on modern NY37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY3, a highway extending across {{the width of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that four lanes at the western end was not enough. Several safety improvement areas were identified and projects implemented. In 1988 the Basalt Bypass relocated the highway off its original alignment through that town (currently Two Rivers <b>Road),</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new two-lane road to the south of it that crossed the Roaring Fork to the east of the town.|$|E

Plans for a civic centre were dropped as being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|M-30 is a rural, two-lane highway. M-30 follows Meridian Road {{starting}} at an intersection with M-20 (Isabella Road) outside of Midland. From this intersection, the highway runs {{north along the}} Michigan Meridian through forest lands to a crossing of the Tittabawassee River near Sanford. M-30 passes through the community and crosses the US10 freeway near the location where the latter crosses a narrow section of Sanford Lake. The road continues north running parallel to the lake along the meridian to a point near Edenville. There, the highway turns westerly along Curtis Road and then back northerly on Midland <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crossing of the Tittabawassee and Wixom Lake.|$|E
5|$|NY185 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9N and NY22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading {{away from the}} western terminus, there is {{a fork in the}} road: to the left is NY185, and to the right is a <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> housing development. Most of NY185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore.|$|E

They occupied and defended a farmhouse against {{an attack by}} Waffen-SS forces {{in the village of}} Le Paradis. After running out of ammunition, the defenders surrendered to the German troops. The Germans led them across the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wall and machine-gunned them. Ninety-seven British troops died. Two survived, with injuries, and hid until they were captured by German forces several days later.|$|E
5|$|State Route 149 (SR 149) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} that helps to connect Oroville and Chico through rural Butte County. Connecting State Route 70 at Wicks Corner with State Route 99 east of Durham, it forms part of the primary northsouth highway through the eastern Sacramento Valley, a Focus Route of the Interregional Road System. SR 149 was {{formerly}} part of the Oroville-Chico Highway; {{the majority of the}} latter was merged into other routes. In the mid-1970s, the highway was reallocated onto a newer two-lane alignment. A project to widen the two-lane <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> four-lane expressway was completed in late 2008, removing the bottleneck from the Oroville-Chico highway.|$|E
5|$|The Ridge Route was {{official}}ly the Castaic-Tejon Route. The official {{limits of the}} Ridge Route, as built in the 1910s, were SR 126 at Castaic Junction and {{the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine. Until 1930–31 the road from San Fernando to Castaic Junction ran through the Newhall Tunnel at San Fernando Pass and along San Fernando Road, Magic Mountain Parkway (both part of SR126 until the early 2000s) and Feedmill <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> former bridge over the Santa Clara River. A 1930 bypass of the tunnel and Newhall through Weldon Canyon is now part of The Old Road.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} the Fulton Avenue roundabout.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} NY268 date {{as far back}} as 1926, by which time the state of New York had assumed {{maintenance}} of several highways in the town of Clarence. The farthest north of these was Tonawanda Creek Road, which was state-maintained from Transit Road (NY78) in Millersport to Salt Road. From here, state maintenance continued south on Salt <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junction with Main Street (what is now NY5). Also state-maintained by this time was Goodrich Road, a north–south road connecting Tonawanda Creek Road to Main Street (modern NY5), and Wolcott Road, an east–west highway linking Goodrich Road to Transit Road (what is now NY78).|$|E
5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana and Pleasant Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E

5|$|In late 1977, the CPO {{made plans}} to push for adding SR117 to the Interstate Highway System, to obtain {{additional}} federal funding. By 1979, both San Diego city and county had allocated $6million to construct a temporary way to access the border crossing along Otay Mesa and Harvest Roads. Two years later, the City of San Diego indicated that the upgrade of Otay Mesa <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> four-lane road would be the preferred option; the state agreed to allocate $2million towards the $10million project, with the city contributing $6.4million and the county adding $2.3million. The Federal Highway Administration approved the continuous roadway via SR117 and SR125 from I-5 to the border at Otay Mesa as a non-chargeable (not eligible for federal Interstate Highway construction dollars) part of the Interstate Highway System in October1984. The Otay Mesa border crossing opened on January 24, 1985. The route number was legislatively changed to 905 in 1986, and signs were updated in 1988. This change was to apply for other federal funding. The original piece of SR117, west of I-5, also became SR905 {{with the rest of}} SR117, but Caltrans has not constructed it.|$|E
5|$|M-31 {{started at}} M-21 in Port Huron and ran northward along the Lake Huron shoreline. Along the way, it intersected the western {{terminus}} of M-46 before reaching Harbor Beach. In town, the original M-27 merged {{in from the}} north, and M-27/M-31 ran concurrently westward, turning inland. The two highways separated north of Ruth as M-27 turned southward. M-31 continued across The Thumb through Bad Axe, where it ran concurrently with M-19 in town. The highway carried on westward through Elkton and Pigeon to Bay Port. Once there, the trunkline turned southwesterly to follow along part of the Saginaw Bay. The road passed through Sebewaing to Unionville before turning back inland. Running southward to Akron, the highway turned alternately westward and southward to Fairgrove. M-31 next ran west along Bradleyville <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> connection with M-81; the two highways ran concurrently south through Gilford before M-31 separated and turned back westward through Reese to Saginaw. The northern terminus in downtown Saginaw was at an intersection with what was then M-10.|$|E
5|$|M-48 {{currently}} {{starts at}} an interchange with I-75 in the Rudyard area. The highway runs west from the interchange into Rudyard where it turns south, running concurrently with county road H-63. M-48 turns eastward {{south of town}} along 22Mile Road through fields. At Meridian Road, M-48 turns south along M-129 through the community of Pickford. South of town, M-48/M-129 runs long the Chippewa–Mackinac county line and crosses the Munuscong River. M-48 turns east at 26Mile Road into Chippewa County. The highway zig-zags through rural areas in the southeast of the county. It follows Hanna and 28Mile roads to Stalwart. In that community, M-48 runs south on Reynolds <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> corner on the Chippewa–Mackinac county line where the highway turns back east toward the Goetzville area running through the Lake Superior State Forest. After one last north–south segment, M-48 terminates at a junction with M-134 west of DeTour Village near Albany Harbor.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons Johnson {{featured}} intermittently in the first team. He scored five goals in 12 appearances for the first team in 1920–21, playing more regularly for the reserves, for whom he was the leading goalscorer with 18 goals. He became a regular first team selection in 1922–23, playing 35 matches. In 1923 Manchester City moved from Hyde <b>Road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new stadium, Maine Road, in the Moss Side area of the city. Johnson scored in the first match at the new stadium, against Sheffield United. While Johnson was a regular goalscorer {{at this point in}} his career, he did not score as frequently as teammates Frank Roberts and Horace Barnes. Firmly established in the first team, he missed only one match in the 1924–25 season.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia’s law {{libraries}} gave Blaine {{the chance}} to at last begin to study the law, but in 1853 he received a more tempting offer: to become editor and co-owner of the Kennebec Journal. Blaine had spent several vacations in his wife’s native state of Maine and had become friendly with the Journal’s editors. When the newspaper’s founder, Luther Severance, retired, Blaine was invited to purchase the publication along with co-editor Joseph Baker. He quickly accepted, borrowing the purchase price from his wife’s brothers. Baker soon sold his share to John L. Stevens, a local minister, in 1854. The Journal had been a staunchly Whig newspaper, which coincided with Blaine’s and Stevens’ political opinions. The decision to become a newspaperman, unexpected as it was, started Blaine on the <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lifelong career in politics. Blaine’s purchase of the Journal coincided with {{the demise of the}} Whig party and birth of the Republican party, and Blaine and Stevens actively promoted the new party in their newspaper. The newspaper was financially successful, and Blaine was soon able to invest his profits in coal mines in Pennsylvania and Virginia, forming the basis of his future wealth.|$|E
5|$|State Route 664 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with State Route 120 in community of Lock Haven. The highway progresses northward, leaving the community limits of Lock Haven. After the intersection with East Water Street, State Route 664 crosses the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. The {{bridge over the}} branch of river was constructed in 1986. At the intersection with Farrandsville Road, the highway turns eastward, paralleling the river. Nearing State Route 150, the highway turns northward and into Dunnstown. While winding around a few curves, State Route 664 intersects with Armory Drive, an access <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local armory. The route's surroundings are highly developed in Dunnstown, with the highway passing along homes. At the intersection with Aikey Street, State Route 664 leaves Dunnstown and proceeds northward.|$|E
