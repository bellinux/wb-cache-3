40|$|Abstract The {{knowledge}} about pesticide residue in private wells {{is not well}} documented in Sweden. Previous studies have detected pesticide residue in private wells, this issue is what made themunicipality of Laholm commission the study. The purpose was to collect water samples from 50 private wells in Laholm and have them analyzed for traces of pesticides. The wells in thestudy are spread geographical over the entire municipality. The analysis of the water sampleswas {{carried out by the}} accredited laboratory Eurofins. Nine of the 50 wells in this studycontained <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> and two of these exceeded the allowed concentration of 0, 1 μg/l. Nine different pesticides were detected, among these were BAM, Atrazin and breakdownproducts from Metribuzin. These pesticides were mostly found in older dug wells. The result alsoindicates that occurrence of pesticide residue is more frequent in areas of agricultural activity. These areas should therefore be investigated further. Not all substances that were found are usedfor agriculture. Substances that have been banned for a long time were found in the samples. This highlights the importance of adequate control of new pesticides considered for commercialuse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Tea is an {{agricultural}} {{product of the}} leaves, leaf buds, and internodes of various cultivars and sub-varieties of the Camellia sinensis plant, processed and vulcanized using various methods. Tea is a main beverage in Iranian food basket so should be free from toxic elements such as pesticides residue. There is no data bank on the <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in the consumed black tea in Iran. The present study is the first attempt for monitoring of 25 pesticide residues from different chemical groups in tea samples obtained from local markets in Tehran, I. R. Iran during the period 2011. A reliable and accurate method based on spiked calibration curve and QuEChERS sample preparation was developed for determination of pesticide residues in tea by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The using of spiked calibration standards for constructing the calibration curve substantially reduced adverse matrix-related effects and negative recovery affected by GCB on pesticides. The recovery of pesticides at 3 concentration levels (n = 3) was in range of 81. 4 - 99. 4 %. The method was proved to be repeatable with RSDr lower than 20 %. The limits of quantification for all pesticides were ≤ 20 ng/g. 53 samples from 17 imported and manufactured brand were analyzed. Detectable pesticides residues were found in 28. 3 % (15 samples) of the samples. All of the positive samples were contaminated with unregulated pesticides (Endosulfan Sulfate or Bifenthrin) which are established by ISIRI. None of the samples had contamination higher than maximum residue limit set by EU and India. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tea is {{a popular}} {{beverage}} made from the leaves of evergreen shrub or tree Camellia sinensis, under the family Theaceae. Tea plant is subjected to the attack of insects, mites, nematodes and some plant pathogenic diseases. Tea production is greatly hindered due to thesemaladies. About 10 - 15 % crop loss occurred by these pests per annum. In severe cases, it would be 100 %. To combat these problems different groups of pesticides {{have been used in}} the tea fields since 1960. As tea is a consumable commodity, the effect of <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in made tea is harmful to human health. In this context, biopesticides are being considered as environmentally safe, selective, biodegradable, economical and renewable alternatives for use in IPM programmes. Biopesticides are natural plant products and may be grown by the planters with minimum cost and extracted by indigenous methods. Biopesticides are secondary metabolites, which include alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, and minor secondary chemicals. It is estimated that as many as 2121 plant species have been reported to posses’ pest control properties. Botanicals like neem, ghora-neem, mahogoni,karanja, adathoda, sweet flag, tobacco, derris, annona, smart weed, bar weed, datura, calotropis, bidens, lantana, chrysanthemum, artemisia, marigold, clerodendrum, wild sunflower and many others may be grown by planters with minimum expense and extracted by indigenous methods. These botanical materials can be used as an alternative to chemical pesticides. These botanical extracts will help in controlling major pests of tea such as Helopeltis, red spider mite, aphids, thrips, jassid, flushworm, termites, nematodes etc. Thepresent note reviews the information of most widely available indigenous plants that may be used for the control of insect pests of tea as a component of IPM...|$|E

The insecticides clorantraniliprole, flubendiamide and diflubenzuron and the biological insecticides based on Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were harmless to T. podisi and T. pretiosum. The harmless herbicides were: 2. 4 -D amine, profoxydim, quinclorac, ethoxysulfuron and saflufenacil. The fungicide epoxiconazole + kresoxim-methyl was also harmless to these two biological control agents. Therefore, these pesticides are indicated for the integrated pest management, in flooded rice areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed {{to examine the}} <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> in {{vegetables}} and fruits in Qatar. The total numbers of samples that were collected were 127 samples of seven most consumed fresh vegetables and fruits from local and import production. The samples were then extracted using Acceleration Solvent Extractor (ASE) and cleaned up using two solid phase extraction (SPE) : florisil and silica gel. Gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC/ECD) was {{used to analyze the}} ten organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). In addition, scan mode of gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used in to screen the pesticides residues in these vegetables and fruits. Ninety percent of the imported samples recorded residues above the MRL with {{at least one of the}} selected OCPs and about 30 % of the local samples (mostly leafy vegetables) contained residues above the MRL. The most frequently detected OCPs in the samples were heptachlor (found in 75 samples) and was detected mostly in imported samples, g-chlordane (found in 22 samples) and a-chlordane (found in 19 samples). Two statistical analysis tests were used to determine significance (pair-difference t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA)). In most of the comparisons between the washed and unwashed samples, no-significant differences were observed (P > 0. 05). Though, it seems that the effects of washing the samples with tap water differ in organochlorine residues based on the type of vegetables and fruits. The interaction between the washing treatment and countries for heptachlor on parsley showed significant difference. Accordingly, there is a dire require for controlling program for <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in food products, especially in imported food products...|$|R
40|$|Class-specific {{determination}} <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> {{prior to}} chromato-graphic determination {{is an attractive}} approach for broader pesticide monitoring. If the total quantity of a class <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> in a sample can be determined and the quantity {{is less than the}} maximum <b>residue</b> limits <b>of</b> certain <b>pesticides</b> in the class, the sample can be eliminated from further inspec-tion for those pesticides. Since it is usual that a vast majority of food and environmental samples turns out to be under maximum <b>residue</b> limits <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> the time and cost saved by this approach may be enormous. There have been many studies aimed at developing such a class-specific determination method based on enzyme inhibition 1 - 5 or immunoassay, 6 - 8 but they were all very far from being quan-titative. This paper describes development of a new quantita-tive class-specific determination method for carbamate pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{collected}} 18 {{soil samples}} in the Chin-sha River basin, and analyzed <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> organochlorine <b>pesticides</b> (OCPs) in soil using gas chromatographic method, revealing the organochlorine pesticide residues, {{the distribution and}} sources in the river basin. The results show that, the relatively high sampling <b>residues</b> <b>of</b> organochlorine <b>pesticide</b> distribute in the industrial area. The composition and characteristics <b>of</b> organic chlorine <b>pesticide</b> show that the organochlorine pesticide residues in soil mainly come from the historical use. Compared with the domestic similar research, residual organochlorine pesticides in Chin-sha River basin were lower. Introductions Organochlorine pesticides (referred to as OCPs) such as DDT (DDT), HCH, heptachlor, dieldrin, aldrin, endrin, chlordane, mirex and toxaphene {{is one of the}} most important refractory organic pollutants, widespread concern due to their persistence, students accumulation and high ecological toxicity by environmental science, and was included in the first batch of 12 kinds of compoun...|$|R
