40|$|The risk {{management}} community needs to review its role, contribution and professionalism. Some directors and boards and some governance, compliance and {{risk management}} practices {{have become a}} “hinder” rather than a “help”. The perspectives of some risk managers need to broaden to embrace networks and supply and value chains. Contemporary risk management needs to be less of a compliance and overhead cost {{and more of a}} an enabler of innovation and entrepreneurship. Risk management professionals should become more of a partner in innovation and more of a positive contributor of value. They should look beyond the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks,</b> and contribute more to dealing with them and identifying and exploiting related opportunities. More risk managers should focus on the support of decision making. They must move on from giving advice on how to prevent downsides and also roll up their sleeves and help their colleagues to achieve upsides. Responsible risk taking is essential for innovation. Encountering risk is evidence that one is alive and trying to accomplish something. Governance, compliance and risk management frameworks need to become continually adapting and learning systems. Applications of performance support can rapidly improve outcomes, ensure compliance, reduce and contain risk, and deliver a variety of other improvements. Incorporating checks and blockers into support tools can prevent outputs that would represent commercial, quality, legal or regulatory risks and enable bespoke responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{government}} of Hungary has contained the main fiscal {{risks of the}} transition to a market economy. It has paid off and resolved most problems in the banking and enterprise sectors. Since 1995 it has implemented fiscal adjustment with the objective of long-term fiscal stability rather than an immediate deficit target. The main result has been pension reform, which has raised temporary deficits but reduced the long-term public liability. Only the health sector awaits the reform needed for long-term fiscal stability. Levels of government spending, budget deficits, and public service remain high, but the government has made great progress toward rationalizing public spending and improving the management of budget and off-budget fiscal risks. In the transition, the government has taken on new fiscal risks [...] mainly state guarantees and growing programs of credit and guarantee agencies (operating on behalf of the government) organized after privatization to support, first, industries and, later, exporters. The government has dealt with these new programs of contingent government support prudently and transparently, with reasonable ceilings on (and <b>reporting</b> <b>of)</b> <b>risks.</b> Hungary is likely to face pressure for additional spending. Priorities in fiscal policy should include reforming health financing, establishing checks on hidden subsidies in guarantee programs, and determining the government's optimal exposure to risk. In terms of institutions, the government should aim to create a more flexible, responsive budget process and greater capacity to analyze medium-term fiscal risks, to build a more results-oriented budget management system, and to improve mechanisms for sharing risk between {{the public and private sectors}} under government programs.

40|$|Abstract: Regulation {{and risk}} {{management}} in banks depend on underlying risk measures. In general {{this is the}} only purpose that is seen for risk measures. In this paper we suggest that the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> measures can be used to determine the loss distribution function for a financial entity. We demonstrate that a lack of sufficient information can lead to ambiguous risk situations. We give examples, showing the need for the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>risk</b> measures in order to determine a bank’s loss distribution. We conclude by suggesting a regulatory requirement <b>of</b> multiple <b>risk</b> measures being reported by banks, giving specific recommendations...|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} dependency {{of securities}} exchanges on internet-based (IP) platforms has dramatically increased the industry's exposure to reputation, market, and operational risks. In addition, {{the convergence of}} several innovations in the market are adding stress to these systems. These innovations affect everything from software to system design and architecture. These {{include the use of}} XML (extensible markup language) as the industry IP language, STP or straight through processing of data, pervasive or diffuse computing and grid computing, as well as the increased use of Internet and wireless. The fraud is not new, rather, the magnitude and speed by which fraud can be committed has grown exponentially due to the convergence of once private networks on-line. It is imperative that senior management of securities markets and brokerage houses be properly informed of the negative externalities associated with e-brokerage and the possible critical points of failure that exist in today's digitized financial sector as they grow into tomorrow's exchanges. The overwhelming issue regarding e-finance is to determine the true level of understanding that senior management has about on-line platforms, including the inherent risks and the depth of the need to use it wisely. Kellermann and McNevin attempt to highlight the various risks that have been magnified by the increasing digitalization of processes within the brokerage arena and explain the need for concerted research and analysis of these as well as the profound consequences that may entail without proper planning. An effective legal, regulatory, and enforcement framework is essential for creating the right incentive structure for market participants. The legal and regulatory framework should focus on the improvement of internal monitoring of risks and vulnerabilities, greater information sharing about these risks and vulnerabilities, education and training on the care and use of these technologies, and better <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and responses. Public/private partnerships and collaborations also are needed to create an electronic commerce (e-commerce) environment that is safe and sound.

On the other hand, company need not to disclose the commercially sensitive risk information, as it can give advantage to the rival companies. This risk reporting guidelines are also having some weaknesses. Such as, they mention about inverse relationship between level <b>of</b> disclosed <b>risk</b> information and cost of capital without any empirical evidence. Guidelines give a vague direction about the commercial sensitive risk information because companies can hide some important risk information on the ground of commercial sensitivity if needed.

40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{substantial}} developments in financial reporting over recent years, the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> in statutory <b>reports</b> {{is still very much}} evolving. This comes as no surprise, given numerous definitions and subsequent measures <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> In the financial services sector, the industry standard for risk disclosure is value at risk (VaR), but this applies only to a relatively small proportion of financial service sector risk – this being market risk in trading activities. Although operational risk has been {{at the core of the}} collapse of a number of financial services firms over recent years, there are no formal reporting standards for operational risk.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this phase}} of globalization, {{companies}} are constantly faced {{with the potential for}} risk which can compromise their current position. Being susceptible to risk can affect not only companies’ business operations but also the decision making process that evidently determines how they are managed. As a consequent, managing and <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> have increasingly attracted interest from various participants throughout the business field. This research is centred on the UK retail sector by conducting a thematic content analysis on eight annual <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> major UK retailers. It is comprised of two parts: The first section is a literature review of the topic <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> disclosure including a discussion of its importance, theories behind its application and its methods. The review also investigates the rise and importance of determining a company’s risk appetite. The first part also provides a review of the UK retail sector and covers the major issues related to the business of retailing including retailers’ position <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> management process. The second part of this study covers the methodology and method of analysis. It also introduces the major findings and results that were obtained upon completion of the analysis stage. This section ends with the research conclusion which outlines the major conclusions, contributions, recommendations and limitations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} mobile collaborative language learning studies published in 2012 – 16 with the aim to improve understanding of how mobile technologies {{have been used to}} support collaborative learning among second and foreign language students. We identify affordances, general pedagogical approaches, second- and foreign-language pedagogical approaches, second language acquisition (SLA) principles and affective designs. The results indicate that affordances such as flexible use, continuity of use, timely feedback, personalisation, socialisation, self-evaluation, active participation, peer coaching, sources of inspiration outdoors and cultural authenticity have been emphasised. These affordances were found to be particularly suited to promote social constructivism, which is often sustained by game-based, task based and seamless learning. In terms of second and foreign language pedagogical approaches, the combination of individualised and collaborative learning prevails, along with task based, situated and communicative language learning, and raising orthographic awareness. Among SLA principles, negotiation of meaning and opportunities for feedback are highlighted. Affective aspects include increases in motivation, engagement and enjoyment, mutual encouragement, reduction in nervousness and embarrassment, and a few negative <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> distraction, safety concerns, feelings of uncertainty and technical problems.

40|$|Pronouncements of {{regulatory}} bodies on ‘hedge accounting’ {{are aimed at}} ensuring that impact of price changes of hedging relationships are accounted for concurrently. However, it sometimes happens that certain provisions of these standards result in the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> enhanced earnings volatility being attributed to hedging relationships which is not economically justified. It is often {{perceived to be the}} case by stakeholders that the provisions of IAS 39 on ‘hedge accounting’ do not appropriately reflect and are not aligned with the <b>risk</b> management strategies <b>of</b> entities that attempt to mitigate risk using various hedging relationships. This occasionally results in a reporting entity adopting either a suboptimal hedging strategy that gives it eligibility to account for it using ‘hedge accounting’ or vice versa. Thus entities may be faced with the tradeoff between the benefits <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> mitigation strategies and the benefits derived from adopting ‘hedge accounting’. This motivated the IASB to initiate action for the complete reformulation of the standard on ‘hedge accounting’. The revised standard was pronounced in November 2013 as IFRS 9.
