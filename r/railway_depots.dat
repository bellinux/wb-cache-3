Well over half the total number were always on the former LNER system, from East Anglia up to Scotland, {{and there was also}} a large number across the former Lancashire & Yorkshire <b>railway</b> <b>depots.</b> Some were initially used on the Southern Region, but later left there, while another smaller group was on the Western Region for much of their lives.

50|$|The Oak Hill Railroad Depot is a one-story wooden {{building}} {{located on}} {{the southwest corner of}} Central Avenue and Virginia Street, along the Norfolk Southern Railway tracks. It has a board and batten siding with Victorian features, a style representative of small-town <b>railway</b> <b>depots</b> of the early 1900s. The original depot consisted of a passenger waiting area and a station master's office. A warehouse, loading dock, and ramp were added to the depot in 1922. Restoration on the depot began in 1993, at which point it was painted a period shade of gray. Behind the depot, there is a small steam locomotive.|$|E
50|$|After {{the turn}} of the century, small {{specialised}} transport unions were established throughout Australia. These included separate unions of milk carters, bread carters, and fuel and fodder carters. Numbers of wage-earning drivers increased in the major cities during this period as carrying firms grew in size, stimulated by growth in manufacturing. Wharves and <b>railway</b> <b>depots</b> were also important sources of work for drivers. By 1903 it was reported that work had become more stable and less casual. However, conditions were still poor. Drivers could be expected to work up to 19 hours a day. Wages were generally between 25 and 35 shillings a week.|$|E

5000|$|After the war, the uniquely American Stick Style {{developed}} {{as a form of}} construction that uses wooden rod trusswork, the origin of its name. The style was commonly used in houses, hotels, <b>railway</b> <b>depots,</b> and other structures primarily of wood. The buildings are topped by high roofs with steep slopes and prominent decoration of the gables. The exterior is not bare of decoration, even though the main objective remains comfort. Richard Morris Hunt constructed John N. Griswold's house in Newport, Rhode Island in 1862 in this style. The [...] "Stick Style" [...] was progressively abandoned after c. 1873, gradually evolving into the Queen Anne Style.|$|E
