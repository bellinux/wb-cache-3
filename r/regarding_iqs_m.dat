This study intends to give a better comprehension about this issue in Brazil, providing evidences from a large sample, using classical measures of SES and neuropsychological tasks based on traditional paradigms (besides IQ measures), with robust statistical analysis, that could be the basis for rethinking public policies that promote child development.|$|R

Unfortunately, not much is known on the prognosis of CLRE; it is assumed to be somewhere between the benign course of many idiopathic epilepsies and the more malignant course of most symptomatic epilepsies. The risk of cognitive decline over time seems to be increased for children with epilepsy, but no data are available specifically for CLRE. This study was a systematic cross-sectional open clinical and non-randomized investigation, which included 68 children with CLRE, 24 children with symptomatic localization related epilepsy (SLRE) and 21 children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). One-way between-groups ANOVAs with Tukey post hoc testing were used to test differences in demographical variables and IQ between CLRE, SLRE and IGE and to test the influence of duration of epilepsy and other epilepsy factors on IQ. To test whether there were IQ differences between the three types of epilepsy regarding duration of epilepsy and other epilepsy factors, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used. In CLRE, intelligence is stable over time; IQ scores do neither improve nor deteriorate.

Estimates of premorbid IQ based upon patient demographic characteristics can be made by means of the Barona, Reynolds, and Chastain (1984) prediction equation (derived using the WAIS-R standardization sample) or from tables published with the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (2001), derived using the WAIS- 3 standardization sample. The accuracy of WTAR demographic predictions has not been examined. The current study compared the accuracy of Barona and WTAR predictions in a sample of 81 head injured patients and 68 psychiatric controls. Head trauma patients were an average of 10. 3 months postinjuries characterized by a mean GCS of 9. 5 (S. D. = 4. 1), had abnormal CT scan findings in 86 % of cases, and obtained a mean WAIS- 3 FSIQ of 85. 6 (S. D. = 14. 1).

40|$|Introduction: Fluid {{intelligence}} {{is described as}} ability to rapidly solve novel problems and capacity to manage and easily adapt to new situations. Crystallized intelligence reflects ability to timely use lifetime-learned information and skills. Bearing in mind that {{intelligence is}} one of the impaired cognitive functions in psychosis, a question arises there are if any sex differences in patients, <b>regarding</b> total <b>IQ,</b> fluid or crystallized intelligence. Aim: To evaluate sex differences in psychosis and to analyze the differences between patients and sex, age and origin matched healthy controls. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study evaluated schizophrenia spectrum patients (F 20 - 29 based on ICD 10; n = 52, age = 29, 3 ± 5, 9 years, illness duration < 10 years) and controls (n = 51, age = 29, 8 ± 6, 3 years). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. Results: Analyzing sex differences in total IQ, fluid and crystalized IQ, it has been found that women exhibited lower crystallized intelligence scores both in the patient group (p = 0, 039) and in the control group (p = 0, 016). Among male patients, lower scores were found in comparison to the healthy male controls in all of the categories, while female patients scores in crystallized intelligence were not significantly different in comparison to female healthy group ((p = 0, 160). Conclusion: In the male subjects with psychosis, a deficit was found in both subdomains of intelligence, while in female subjects it was found in fluid intelligence only. Factors which could serve as protective from greater cognitive impairment in female patients need further evaluation, as a sign of potential mechanisms that could ameliorate the course and prognosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders...|$|R

Two researchers had meetings with teachers, presenting the Global Campaign "Epilepsy out of the shadows", when the questionnaire was first completed by all attendees. Twenty teachers of these schools were motivated to attend a training course entitled "Epilepsy and Health" {{as part of their}} continuous education programme. Two years later the same questionnaire was again completed (post-test) by these 20 teachers. RESULTS: 100 teachers originally completed the questionnaire (97 women, mean age 42 years, 64 married). Forty-three percent of teachers said that they had enough knowledge regarding epilepsy and 20 % said that they had poor knowledge about the condition. <b>Regarding</b> the <b>IQ</b> of children with epilepsy, 45 % of teachers believed that they had average IQ, 18 % above average, six percent under average and 29 % did not know. Teachers believed that children with epilepsy have a higher possibility of acquiring mental disease in the future (51 %); that epilepsy is a disease (68 %); that epilepsy is contagious (1 %); epilepsy is treatable (90 %). After the course, the teachers beliefs seem to have improved. DISCUSSION: This work with elementary school teachers identified difficulties related to epilepsy which, if addressed, may help promote better quality of life of people with epilepsy in the community and help to decrease stigma attached to the condition. Better informed teachers are likely to have a more positive attitude and this will be passed to others. Educational campaigns about epilepsy amongst teachers should be encouraged as this may improve the management of epilepsy, by helping to develop a well informed and tolerant community...|$|R
40|$|In 1998, the Department of Defense in the United States {{released}} {{the first of}} a series of seminal policies on Information Operations (IO). Entitled Joint Publication 3 - 13, this instruction laid out for the first time, in an unclassified format, how the American military forces could utilise this particular element of power. As a relative newly defined activity, this publication proposed to revolutionise the manner in which warfare, diplomacy, business and a number of other areas are conducted. However, this radical transformation in the United States government with <b>regard</b> to <b>IQ</b> has not occurred over the last decade and a significant gap exists in the capability of the federal bureaucracy to support operations in this arena. While strategic policy and doctrine have been developed and promulgated, in most cases only by the Department of Defense, the actual conduct of IO activities and campaigns across the United States, are normally performed at a much more tactical level. This delta between theory and reality exists because the interagency organisations are often unwilling or unable to make the transformational changes that are needed to best utilise information as an element of power. In this research, the author has developed definitions and models that articulate not only why this delta exists, but also specific strategies for utilising IO in a manner by the United States federal organisations that best optimises the inherent capabilities of this element of power. Specific recommendations are noted below, and will be laid out in greater detail throughout the paper : Develop an Academic Theoretical Construct for IO; Understand that Different Approaches and Processes are Needed to Support IO; Establish an International IO Standards Effort 2 ̆ 6 Meeting the IO Training Needs...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages [48]- 49. The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to investigate the}} relationship between the latent learning theory proposed by psychologist Edward Tolman and spelling ability. Three Typing I classes at Naperville North High School, Naperville, IL, were the subjects used in this experiment. Seventy-five pretest words were randomly dictated to the three typing classes to help statistically equate the groups based on spelling ability. During the next four weeks, or 20 class periods, the three typing classes received different methods of spelling instruction. The different methods of spelling instruction served as the independent variable with three levels—two levels are considered the traditional method of teaching spelling as they have already been researched. These are the list method and the self-corrected test method. The third level, latent learning theory, is the nontraditional method being researched in this experiment. The interrelationship effect with IQ served as the moderator variable in the experiment. Following the four weeks of instruction, a sixty-word posttest was administered to all students. This was used as the dependent variable. Scores on this test were compared to see if there were any significant differences between the three methods of teaching spelling as well as if any differences in teaching methods were interrelated with IQ. It was found that when the various methods were investigated {{there were no significant differences}} between the three methods. Neither method proved to be more effective than another method. The interaction analysis of IQ and spelling ability also showed no significant differences between IQ and method used to teach spelling. The experiment showed that no matter what a student's IQ level was, no method proved most effective for a particular <b>IQ</b> level. <b>M.</b> S. Ed. (Master of Education...|$|R
