40|$|Ross Perot. The billionaire. The presidential candidate. The man {{who made}} three {{references}} to the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny in a recent debate with the Vice President. However one chooses to think of him, <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> an amazing individual. He simply did not exist as a national political figure two years ago. Yet his simple, down-to-earth approach to economics and government ("just plain talk"), his successful business background, and his stated desire to "do what's right for my country" landed him nearly 20 million votes in last year's presidential election — 19 {{percent of the electorate}} — without the support of any major party (Fineman 34). A year later he remains the most potent political force in the United States outside the Beltway. This kind of popularity by a single, independent individual is unusual, to say the least. But contrary to Perot's own often used expression, it's just not that simple. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>is</b> a skilled political operator, to be sure, but there are larger social, political, and economic forces sustaining his popularity. White House pollster Stan Greenberg is right when he says that Perot is largely a creation of the voters. The Texas billionaire has reached his current level of popularity because the public is dissatisfied with the nation's leadership. " [...] from page...|$|E

The Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) is a private company. Independent <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> included in {{all three of the}} debates with Republican George H. W.

50|$|During the '92 Democratic Convention, the {{convention}} hall {{was plagued by}} the fact that independent candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> tied with or beating Clinton in opinion research polls. This caused a moderate turn of events at {{the convention}} to win back Perot Voters from the Perot Campaign. This led to the selection of such speakers such as Representative Barbara Jordan from Texas to deliver a bipartisan keynote address to the convention delegates. Also speaking was the Vice-Presidential nominee Al Gore who appealed to the center as he was, at the time, a Southern Moderate Democrat from Tennessee.|$|R

50|$|The 2000 {{election}} in Texas {{was a very}} partisan election, with nearly 60% of voters voting for the Republican Party candidate. The third party vote shrunk {{to a total of}} 2.7%, likely because <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> not on the ballot that year. The vast majority of counties voted heavily for Governor Bush as his approval rating and popularity in the state was high. Many of the long time rural Democratic counties, including those in East Texas along the border of Louisiana, swung Republican as the national party moved further to the left. Texas Democrats are more moderate to conservative by national standards, and many had a favorable view towards Bush because of his bipartisan approach with the Democratic state legislature during his tenure as governor.|$|R

25|$|Many {{researchers}} use self-report {{measures of}} felt emotion as a manipulation check.

For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot,</b> supporters <b>were</b> asked to describe their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|R

This provides a good opportunity to analyze strategic voting behavior?voting for a candidate not most preferred by the voter?in the US presidential elections with panel data drawn from NES (National Election Studies). First, the 1992 election is analyzed with multinomial choice estimators. Second, using the estimates, each individual¡¯s choice is predicted for the 1996 election. Third, those who were predicted to vote for Perot in 1996 but did not are identified as strategic voters and their profile is drawn. In addition to the main task of analyzing the strategic voting behavior, this paper does two additional tasks. First, analyzing the 1992 data with multinomial choice estimators, t is found that the following variables mattered significantly for the US presidential election: respondent and candidate ideology, personal finance, age, education, income, sex, abortion stance, health insurance policy, and welfare program policy. Second, critical mistakes in the literature in applying multinomial probit to election data are pointed. strategic voting, presidential election, multinomial logit, multinomial probit...|$|R
5000|$|In the New York Times, Steven Rattner {{called the}} new {{building}} of the Peterson Institute [...] "the locker room of the Team Globalization and Free Trade cheering squad." [...] We should not close our borders or retreat from the world, said Rattner, but free trade has winners and losers, and [...] "we {{need to be more}} sensitive to the losers and try to help," [...] for example by redistribution of income through the tax system, which, he said, we haven't <b>been</b> doing. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> right, he said, that the North American Free Trade Agreement would transfer American jobs to Mexico, particularly in manufacturing. From 2009 to 2013, employment in the American auto manufacturing sector rose by 23%, from 560,000 to 690,000. But employment in the Mexican auto sector rose from 368,000 to 589,000, or 60%. Without open borders, many of those jobs would have been American. Wages in American auto manufacturing are down by 12.7%. American auto manufacturing compensation was $35.67 an hour; in Mexico, it was $6.36 an hour.

50|$|In 1998, {{a unique}} federal law {{enforcement}} undercover operation was created to identify and arrest individuals selling bogus Moon rocks. This sting operation was known as Operation Lunar Eclipse. Originally two undercover agents were involved in this sting, Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz of NASA's Office of Inspector General (NASA OIG), posing as Tony Coriasso, and Inspector Bob Cregger of the United States Postal Inspection Service, posing as John Marta. This sting operation was later expanded to include Agents from the United States Customs Service, namely, Special Agent Dwight Weikel and Special Agent Dave Atwood. Agents posted a quarter page advertisement in USA Today asking for Moon rocks. The Agents were targeting individuals selling bogus Moon rocks, which con artists sell to the elderly and to space enthusiasts. The sting operation was led by NASA OIG Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz. For {{the first time in}} history the sting operation recovered an Apollo era Moon rock, the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock. This Moon rock had been given to Honduras by President Nixon, fallen into private hands, and then offered to the Agents for $5 million. In order to recover this Moon rock, the agents had to come up with the $5 million requested by the seller. Billionaire and one-time Presidential Candidate H. <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> asked by one of the agents to put up the money, and did so.|$|R

The Heye Trust included a restriction requiring the collection to be displayed in New York City, and moving the collection to a Museum outside of New York aroused substantial opposition from New York politicians.

While many disaffected conservatives may have voted for <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton.

After the company ignored his idea for electronic storage, he founded Electronic Data Systems in 1962, which was then contracted by the United States Government to store Medicare records. Perot earned a fortune with the company, and by 1968 was named by Fortune as the [...] "fastest, richest Texan." [...] <b>Perot</b> <b>was</b> known to run the company in a militaristic fashion, built on loyalty and duty. His best known venture with the company was in 1979, when he sent a private militia into Iran {{in the midst of}} the Iranian Revolution to rescue two of his employees who had been imprisoned. The episode inspired the 1983 novel, On Wings of Eagles. Perot eventually sold his company to General Motors in 1984 for $2.55 billion, and founded Perot Systems in 1988. By 1992, his fortune was judged to be $3 billion.|$|R
