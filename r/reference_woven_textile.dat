40|$|We {{proposed}} a physics-based rendering method for reflection of <b>woven</b> <b>textiles.</b> Both reflection properties of fibers and yarns {{are taken into}} account, which are the primary factors affecting visual appearance of cloths. The reflection from fiber surfaces is analyzed using Kirchhoff diffraction theory, assuming a statistical surface. Yarns are usually consisted {{of a group of}} fibers and they are simulated by a group of parallel infinite long triangle prisms which considers the different cross section shapes of fibers. The reflections from yarns are derived according to such geometry, taking into account of masking and shadowing. The model is compared with experimental data from spectrophotometer measurement on different <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> samples and fit very well by numerical simulations. Theoretically the model is suitable to different kinds of <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> structure and fiber materials. Also it can be developed to be used in computer graphics applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technology to integrate electronics at the thread level in <b>woven</b> <b>textiles.</b> Flexible plastic substrates are cut into stripes {{and serve as}} carriers for electronics, including ICs, thin-film devices, interconnect lines, and contact pads. These functionalized plastic stripes, called e-stripes, are <b>woven</b> into <b>textiles.</b> Conductive threads perpendicular to the e-stripes electrically interconnect the devices on the individual e-stripes. The integration of e-stripes and conductive threads into the <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> is compatible with commercial weaving processes and suitable for large-scale manufacturing. We demonstrate the technology with a <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> containing five e-stripes with digital temperature sensors. Conductive threads interconnect the e-stripes among each other to form a bus topology. We show that the contacts between the conductive threads and the pads on e-stripes {{as well as the}} contacts between the temperature sensors and e-stripes withstand shear forces of at least 20 N. The integration of the temperature sensors into the textile increases the bending rigidity of the textile by 30 %; however, it is still possible to obtain a textile-bending radii of <; 1 mm. This technology seamlessly integrates electronics into textiles, thus advancing the field of smart textiles and wearable computing...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Twenty-four <b>woven</b> Pre-Columbian <b>textiles</b> in the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department (AIM) of Oregon State University were {{reported}} to be from Ancon, Peru. A methodology was developed to confirm the exact provenance of the AIM textiles. Technical fabrication characteristics were utilized to describe certain known Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> and to analyze the twenty-four AIM textiles; then comparisons were attempted {{between the two groups}} to determine if internal patterns for each were identical. A literature and collection survey identified ten documented reports of known Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles.</b> The previously recorded information of the known Ancon pieces was summarized. Technical fabrication characteristics for each AIM textile were observed and recorded. The technical fabrication characteristics included weave structure, thread count, fiber content, direction of spin, ply, degree of twist, yarn diameter, color and motif. Frequencies and especially developed analysis tools were utilized to identify internal patterns. Hypothesis 1 stated that information about the technical fabrication elements of Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> in certain other collections can be organized into integrated patterns. Hypothesis 1 was not supported because data recorded on Ancon <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> was incomplete, and therefore only able to give limited frequencies. Hypothesis 2 was supported: The twenty-four <b>woven</b> Pre-Columbian <b>textiles</b> from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University will have similar patterns in technical fabrication elements. An analysis tool was developed to show patterns within technical fabrication elements. Thread count, direction of spin, ply, and degree of twist exhibited internal patterns. Hypothesis 3 stated that the provenance of twenty-four <b>woven</b> Pre-Columbian <b>textiles,</b> from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University is Ancon, Peru. This hypothesis could not be tested because technical fabrication patterns for the known Ancon weavings were not complete and could not be statistically analyzed. Even though the two sets of data populations (data from known Ancon textiles and data from the AIM collection) could not be compared statistically, some information was gained by a review and comparison of simple frequencies of internal patterns. Thread count frequencies for both populations exhibited internal patterns...|$|R
40|$|The ever-changing {{senses of}} {{consumption}} and fashion {{factor in the}} world have caused an ongoing increase on the demand towards hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> in recent years. Therefore, the prices of hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles,</b> where the supply is limited, are on the rise. It is known that Buldan city, one of the centers of hand woven production in Anatolia, has a significant commercial potential in this respect. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an insight to the industry by comparing the profit margin of products woven in hand looms and automatic looms in textile industry in Buldan city and to raise awareness regarding the importance of production in hand looms. “Scarf”, which is the most produced textile item in Buldan, was preferred in the application study. In the study, the unit costs of the scarves woven with insect silk, floss silk, cotton and linen yarn, which are widely used in production, in hand looms and automatic looms were calculated and the profit margins to be calculated through the average sales prices were compared. At the end of the application study, it was seen that the profit margin of hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> was almost twice as high as the <b>textiles</b> <b>woven</b> in automatic looms...|$|R

The experimental and fitting analysis of the anisotropy is realized using off-axis tensile tests for five <b>textile</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. Orthotropic hyperelastic modelling highlights the anisotropy tensile property of <b>textile</b> <b>woven</b> fabric compared to orthotropic linear elastic modelling. Particular attention is given to the influence of weave structure on fabric anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{thrust of}} the study is to compare {{different}} design principles for advanced creation of full-fashioned weaving. According to the present integrated design mode, three technical elements of weaving design have been identified in the course of creation, i. e. mixed yarns, integrated structures, and integrated patterns. The design process is the key to successful integrated design, including allocation of materials of warp and weft, different interlacing locations that suitable for clothing structures, and the method of patterning in the current CAD digital processing. The entire design mode is different from the previous laminar <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> designs. Experiments have shown that, with the shapeable materials, the fine silk yarns are perfect to weave and mould the three dimensional dress for women. Besides, rich and novel textures can be embellished inherently on the surfaces of the full-fashion woven clothing. The expanded creative dimensions of <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> contributed an added value to silk products produced by current machines. Meanwhile the new features of Seamless Woven Fashion (SWF) further widened the creative scope of fashion design. The study has contributed to the future research and development of advanced <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> as the end products...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique for visualizing <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> in real time, while optimizing the realistic appearance. The proposed approach supports rendering of complex weave patterns by adopting Weaving Information File (WIF), a standard from textile Computer Aided Design (CAD) for representing the grammar of weaving. We develop a realistic rendering scheme {{by combining the}} grammar representation obtained from the WIF with a procedural thread texture, a suitable textile Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and horizon maps. We employ the multi-texturing approach to meet the real time constraint. Thus our approach to visualizing <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> begins from <b>weaving</b> grammar specifications and converts them into textures {{that can be used}} for visualizing clothes. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach with examples...|$|R

40|$|Most {{scholars}} of Yoruba hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> have often {{concluded that the}} women wove merely for domestic purposes while their male counterparts wove as professionals. This paper proposes a contrary thesis by analyzing and discussing the functions of Yoruba women’s hand <b>woven</b> <b>textiles</b> by submitting that the cloth produced by women went far beyond satisfying domestic needs and that the women’s weaving activities were rather complementary to their men rather than subordinate. In contemporary Nigeria the women still dictate and influence fashion trends {{and at the same}} time ensure that the traditional hand woven cloth is always a part of the Yoruba fashion. It observes that despite Nigeria’s colonial experience by importing cheaper foreign textiles women still kept traditional textiles alive through their production, use, sale, and marketing...|$|R
40|$|Since many {{classes of}} {{structural}} FRPs have fibrous reinforcing geometries continuous {{in one or}} perhaps two-dimensions, they feature compliance and weakness in the unreinforced directions. Potential solutions to this problem are investigated here by quantifying the performance characteristics that could be achieved by arranging the fibrous reinforcing to run continuously in all three orthogonal directions. We start with results suggested by continuum material topology optimization, and then, for manufacturability reasons, these material arrangements are approximated using plane <b>weave</b> <b>textiles</b> with continuous infills. The elastic stiffness properties of these textile reinforced composites are computed using established unit cell homogenization methods. The results indicate that structural composites with infilled plane <b>weave</b> <b>textile</b> reinforcing may be one promising way to achieve enhanced overall extensional and shear stiffnesses, although coming {{at the expense of}} moderate sacrifices in longitudinal stiffness...|$|R

40|$|Being {{the closest}} layer to our body, {{textiles}} provide an ideal platform for integrating sensors and actuators to monitor physiological signals. We used a <b>woven</b> <b>textile</b> to integrate photodiodes and light emitting diodes. LEDs and photodiodes enable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) systems to monitor {{arterial oxygen saturation}} and oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in human tissue. Photodiodes and LEDs are mounted on flexible plastic strips with widths of 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively. The strips are <b>woven</b> during the <b>textile</b> fabrication process in weft direction and interconnected with copper wires with a diameter of 71 μm in warp direction. The sensor textile is applied to measure the pulse waves in the fingertip and the changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin during a venous occlusion at the calf. The system has a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 70 dB and a system drift of 0. 37 % ± 0. 48 %.
