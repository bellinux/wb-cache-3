Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is {{a right to a}} specific piece of property, contrasting to a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [...] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.|$|E

For example, in English law, the court was asked in Phrantzes v Argenti 1960 2 QB 19 to enforce a Greek marriage dowry agreement. Although the forum had no public policy objections and agreed that such agreements were enforceable, relief was denied because there were no local rules to calculate the amount to be paid. A different result would have been achieved if the agreement had stipulated a liquidated sum to be paid. Thus, in Shahnaz v Rizwan 1965 1 QB 390, a deferred mahr (dowry) was enforced as part of an ante-nuptial agreement made in India in consideration of marriage at a time when ante-nuptial agreements were not generally enforceable under English law. The judge accepted the difference between maintenance and a dowry, and enforced payment as a right ex contractu rather than as a matrimonial right. Hence, a remedy was granted to enforce a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam,</b> enforceable by the wife or widow against the husband or his heirs. The same result is achieved in the United States, see Aziz v. Aziz 1985 where a New York court enforced a deferred mahr of $5,000 because the terms of the contract complied with New York's General Obligations Law. The court rejected the husband's claim that it was a matrimonial action.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{equitable}} jurisdiction, {{the phrase}} <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> {{has been used}} to describe the means of enforcement of the equitable decree, the justification for equitable jurisdiction generally, and the mechanism by which chancery rulings effectively override the common law. In the context of curial proceedings, the phrase is also used to describe the nature of jurisdiction assumed over a person, as well as the effect of a decree against a person, as opposed to a thing. In the discourse on rights, it is used to distinguish personal from property <b>rights.</b> <b>In</b> <b>personam</b> reasoning <b>in</b> the equitable sense has been used historically to justify the assumption of jurisdiction in disputes relating to foreign immovable property, and the application of the principles of equity of the forum without reference to choice of law. In more modern times, similar reasoning {{has been used to}} justify cross-border anti-suit injunctions and asset-freezing orders.

50|$|The modern position, therefore, {{is that a}} {{beneficiary}} has {{merely a}} personal <b>right,</b> ius <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> ad rem acquirendam, against the executor; he does not acquire ownership by virtue of a will. The heir obtains ownership, or a lesser real right (such as a usufruct), only on delivery or transfer in pursuance of a testamentary disposition or intestate succession. Consequently, succession is merely a causa habilis, or appropriate cause, for transfer of ownership.|$|R
40|$|The trust is, by definition, {{a hybrid}} between <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> rem and <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam.</b> It {{is also an}} English legal concept that distinguishes the English common law from the Roman law {{tradition}} of continental Europe. The trust is largely absent in the classical writings of Karl Marx and Max Weber on the origins and nature of capitalism. This essay demonstrates that the trust is central to an adequate understanding of capitalism — including the capitalist institutions of modern banking, corporations, and representative democracy — and demonstrates that modern banking and politics are mirror images of each other. Before capitalism, credit economies created institutions to protect debtors or often revived the social order by cancelling debts. The capitalist credit economy, by contrast, considers strict debt obligations a supreme moral good {{and a way of}} securing social order. It creates a political scheme to ensure that debt obligations are strictly fulfilled. This essay argues that this scheme is a trust. The trust turns the debts of individuals, whose death can cancel their debt obligations, into the debts of imaginary groups such as the modern state, whose identities and obligations are permanently maintained by replaceable trustees. The essay further holds that without the politics of the trust, modern banking could not have developed...|$|R
5000|$|Land law is {{also known}} as the law of real property. It relates to the acquisition, {{protection}} and conflicts of people's rights, legal and equitable, in land. This means three main things. First, [...] "property rights" [...] (in Latin, a right in rem) are generally said to bind third parties, whereas personal rights (a <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam)</b> are exercisable only against the person who owes an obligation. English law acknowledges a fixed number, or numerus clausus of property rights, which create various privileges. The main situations where this distinction matters are if a debtor to two or more creditors has gone insolvent (i.e. bankrupt), or if there is a dispute over possession of a specific thing. If a person or a business has gone insolvent, and has things in their possession which are the property of others', then those people can usually take back their property free of anyone else's claims. But if an insolvent person's creditors are merely owed personal debts, they cannot take back their money freely: any losses have to be divided among all creditors. Often, creditors can contract for a proprietary right (known as a security interest) to secure repayment of debts. This gives the same result as having another proprietary right, so the secured creditor takes priority in the insolvency queue. Secured creditors, most usually, are banks and for most people the most familiar kind of security interest is a mortgage. In this way, property rights area always [...] "stronger" [...] than personal rights, even though they may be acquired by the same means: a contract. Most of the time, property rights are also stronger than personal because English courts have been historically more willing to order specific performance as a remedy for interference with property rights. People with personal rights, such as to the performance of a contract, are presumptively entitled to money in compensation, unless damages would be an inadequate remedy. In its second main feature, English land law differs from civil law systems in the European Union, because it allows the separation of the [...] "beneficial" [...] ownership of property from legal title to property. If there is a [...] "trust" [...] of land, then trustees hold legal title, while the benefit, use and [...] "equitable" [...] title might belong to many other people. Legal title to real property can only be acquired in a limited number of formal ways, while equitable title can be recognised because of a person's contribution, or the parties' true intentions, or some other reason, if the law deems that it is fair and just (i.e. equitable) to recognise that someone else has a stake in the land.|$|E

5000|$|The 1838 Code {{entered into}} force on 1 October 1838. While it was {{substantially}} {{influenced by the}} Napoleonic Code, it did adopt some Roman-Dutch innovations. First, one might note differences in structure. Unlike the French model, the Dutch Code drew a strict contrast between real <b>rights</b> (<b>rights</b> <b>in</b> rem) and personal <b>rights</b> (<b>rights</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam).</b> Property provisions were arranged around the principle of ownership. Many differences in content also prevailed. On certain subjects, French law was either amended or repealed. Meijer identifies many key alterations. First, many French statutory provisions were removed. Meijer points to the removal of civil death, a concept which was wholly foreign to Dutch society. Other omissions can be seen where a legal concept was either culturally inappropriate or inconsistent with existing Dutch legal principles. Second, modifications were made to codify prior existing Roman-Dutch law or give effect to Roman-Dutch legal standards. For example, in regard to property, the 1838 Code provided that registering a conveyance was a precondition to pass title in immovable property. This codified the Roman-Dutch abstract system of title transfer (abstracte stelsel van eigendomsoverdracht), thereby replacing the causal system (causale stelsel) of the French code. However, it remained true that the 1838 Code did draw heavily from the Napoleonic Code, as Meijer concludes: ...|$|R
50|$|One of the BGB's {{fundamental}} components is {{the doctrine}} of abstract alienation of property (German: Abstraktionsprinzip), and its corollary, the separation doctrine (Trennungsprinzip). Derived from {{the works of the}} pandectist scholar Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the Code draws a sharp distinction between obligationary agreements (BGB, Book 2), which create enforceable obligations, and “real” or alienation agreements (BGB, Book 3), which transfer property <b>rights.</b> <b>In</b> short, the two doctrines state: the owner having an obligation to transfer ownership does not make you the owner, but merely gives you the right to demand the transfer of ownership. The opposite system, the causal system, is in effect in France and other legal jurisdictions influenced by French law, under which an obligationary agreement is sufficient to transfer ownership; no subsequent conveyance is needed. The German system thus mirrors the English common law differentiation between <b>in</b> rem <b>rights</b> and <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{principles}} {{relating to}} the rule huur gaar voor koop were discussed. Under Roman law, a lease of property (locatio conductio rei) conferred only jura <b>in</b> <b>personam.</b> More particularly, the lessee held no real <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the leased property; he merely enjoyed contractual jura <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> against the lessor {{by virtue of the}} agreement of lease. Consequently, if during the currency of the lease the lessor alienated the leased property in terms of, say, a contract of sale, the purchaser (and new owner) was not bound to recognise the lessees rights of occupation under the lease, unless he had undertaken to do so.|$|R

With respect to each institution, we generally find that <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> relations are governed by flexible default rules; in rem relations are governed by bright-line rules that impose immutable and standardized obligations; intermediate relations, as befits their intermediate level of information costs, feature a type and degree of standardization beyond pure contract but short of pure property...|$|R

40|$|This Article takes a {{fresh look}} at the power of courts and {{creditors}} to force debtors to repay their obligations through <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> collection techniques. Variously known as “debtor’s examinations,” “turnover orders,” “citations to discover assets,” “supplementary proceedings,” “proceedings supplementary,” and “proceedings in aid of execution,” <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> remedies force the debtor, under threat of the court’s contempt authority, to turn over money or property directly to a creditor. Because the exercise of the court’s contempt authority can result in a debtor’s imprisonment, <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> techniques have long been regarded as a critical but potentially very coercive arrow in a debt collector’s quiver. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission and others have endorsed major changes to a debt collection system labeled as “broken. ” These reform proposals, however, have overlooked key problems <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings, where excessive creditor leverage and insufficient protection of debtors’ procedural rights risk validating a view that the judicial system is functioning as creditors’ private collection arm. Following the transfer of power to a newly established Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this Article resurrects a subject that has received virtually no attention in the scholarly literature for over a decade. It analyzes the particular features of <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings and debtor behavior that contribute to a longstanding imbalance in the leverage asserted by creditors over debtors. The Article recommends specific changes to the way courts conduct <b>in</b> <b>personam</b> proceedings to ensure that the in terrorem effects of these remedies do not upend important social policies, including the protection of exempt property and the adjudicative fairness of the collection process. Debt collection is a fundamental component of the consumer credit system. The strength and legitimacy of its procedures, however, depend on maintaining a difficult balance between the state’s and creditors’ interest in rigorous judgment enforcement and debtors’ interest in imposing reasonable limitations on the coerciveness of debt collection...|$|R
