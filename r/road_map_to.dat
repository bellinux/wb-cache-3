2500|$|Mulford was a {{prolific}} story teller {{in addition to}} his other talents. [...] He lectured on garden and natural history subjects to colleges, universities, schools and garden clubs throughout the United States as well as in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Canada. [...] He wrote quite a bit as well. His earliest writings {{came in the form of}} letters which were abundant even at an early age. Some were simple postcards, acknowledgments of his thoughts and yet now providing glimpses into his inner self and a <b>road</b> <b>map</b> <b>to</b> his outward activities. His letters were often either quite humorous or poetic prose although he also wrote poetry which he would use occasionally to adorn Christmas cards and the like. In the later years, after his move to Florida it was typical that you could find them scribbled on his Tropical Arts letterhead paper. Beginning in the 1940s Mulford along with Racine began publishing their ever-expanding bromeliad knowledge in a wide variety of garden and horticultural publications. These ranged from well-known venues such as The Smithsonian, The New York Times, and House Beautiful to trade journals such as the National Horticultural Magazine and Cactus and Succulent Journal to name just a few. A special article called [...] "Puya, the Pineapple's Andean Ancestor" [...] was published in the October 1950 National Geographic Magazine along with color photos. It was also during this time that they began writing their collaborative books based on travels to South America including Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, Bromeliads-A Cultural Handbook and Air Gardens of Brazil Mulford also became the founder and President of the Bromeliad Society in 1950 through 1959 and became its editor from 1951 through 1958 [...] and with his editorship of the Bulletin his audience became worldwide. He wrote numerous pieces for the Bromeliad Journal International which can be found in their archives with an examples frequently seen in reprints even today. He maintained this responsibility for over a decade with Racine acting a copy editor for years. Both were heavily committed to this publication at the beginning, often using their own monies to help publish the journal in the early years.|$|E

Moreover, we report the fundamental diagram of flow against density, in which hysteresis is found, indicating that the system is bistable in a certain range of vehicle density. In addition, the fundamental diagram is significantly different from single-lane traffic model and 2 -D BML model with four states: free flow, saturated flow, bistable and jammed.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we have {{developed}} a HiTi (Hierarchical MulTi) graph model for structuring large topographical <b>road</b> <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> speed up the minimum cost route computation. The HiTi graph model provides a novel approach to abstracting and structuring a topographical <b>road</b> <b>map</b> in a hierarchical fashion. We propose a new shortest path algorithm named SPAH, which utilizes HiTi graph model of a topographical <b>road</b> <b>map</b> for its computation. We give the proof for the optimality of SPAH. Our performance analysis of SPAH on grid graphs showed that it significantly reduces the search space over existing methods. We also present an in-depth experimental analysis of HiTi graph method by comparing it with other similar works on grid graphs. Within the HiTi graph framework, we also propose a parallel shortest path algorithm named ISPAH. Experimental results show that inter query shortest path problem provides more opportunity for scalable parallelism than the intra query shortest path problem.

30|$|The {{inner circle}} in Fig.  1 {{represents}} the internal context in an organization. Here, the top {{management and the}} board are crucial for sustaining, and also in some cases creating, the improvement trajectory. Top management’s own inertia, user competence, {{and commitment to the}} innovation and the organizational improvement trajectory are important and can either limit or increase the internal inertia/path dependency and resistance towards change. Here, top management can use communication, for example, in the form of narratives and <b>road</b> <b>maps</b> <b>to</b> limit internal inertia and resistance to a desired organizational change. Further, the search and learning processes are cumulative and path-dependent, but could break potential inertia by becoming more conscious and systematic in the desirability and feasibility steps.|$|R
