5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SSRI, {{even though this is}} not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, South Vietnamese commanders never {{realized}} that Hanoi had given its field commanders the full flexibility to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changing circumstances {{on the battlefield}} and had supplied North Vietnamese units with weaponry that was required to achieve their objectives. Ultimately, the average South Vietnamese soldiers {{would have to pay}} for the miscalculation of their commanders.|$|E

30|$|It {{is likely}} that {{differences}} in the sample sizes are attributable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temporal order in which the respondents were prompted <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> three questionnaires. Some chose <b>to</b> exit <b>the</b> website without <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remaining questionnaire(s). Thus, while all participants in <b>the</b> study <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SSRQ (ordered first), twelve exited after completing the SPWB (ordered second) and omitted the PANAS (ordered third), and 15 only <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SSRQ, omitting both the SPWB and PANAS. No participants who exited the survey early asked to have their data withdrawn from the study.|$|R

The nomination {{was both a}} long-term aim of the conservatives and a <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> labour movements' acts during November 1917.

5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 {{by the forces of}} Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended air campaign followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, Blue Demon, Jr., the {{president}} of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, telling them to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they {{were not part of}} the NWA. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. The promotion did not directly <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latest claim either; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented, simply stating that the titles belonged to CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship and returned the old title to NWA.|$|E
