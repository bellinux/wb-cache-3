40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{converts}} {{the high}} level waste slurries stored at the Savannah River Site into borosilicate glass for long-term storage. The vitrification process results in the generation of approximately five gallons of dilute recycle streams for each gallon of waste slurry vitrified. This dilute <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> is currently transferred to the H-area Tank Farm and amounts to approximately 1, 400, 000 gallons of effluent per year. Process changes to incorporate salt waste could {{increase the amount of}} effluent to approximately 2, 900, 000 gallons per year. The recycle consists of two major streams and four smaller streams. The first major <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> is condensate from the Chemical Process Cell (CPC), and is collected in the Slurry Mix Evaporator Condensate Tank (SMECT). The second major <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> is the melter offgas which is collected in the Off Gas Condensate Tank (OGCT). The four smaller streams are the sample flushes, sump flushes, decon solution, and High Efficiency Mist Eliminator (HEME) dissolution solution. These streams are collected in the Decontamination Waste Treatment Tank (DWTT) or the Recycle Collection Tank (RCT). All recycle streams are currently combined in the RCT and treated with sodium nitrite and sodium hydroxide prior to transfer to the tank farm. Tank Farm space limitations and previous outages in the 2 H Evaporator system due to deposition of sodium alumino-silicates have led to evaluation of alternative methods of dealing with the DWPF recycle. One option identified for processing the recycle was a dedicated evaporator to concentrate the <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> to allow the solids to be recycled to the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and the condensate from this evaporation process to be sent and treated in the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). In order to meet process objectives, the <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> must be concentrated to 1 / 30 th of the feed volume during the evaporation process. The concentrated stream must be pumpable to the DWPF SRAT vessel and should not precipitate solids to avoid fouling the evaporator vessel and heat transfer coils. The evaporation process must not generate excessive foam and must have a high Decontamination Factor (DF) for many species in the evaporator feed to allow the condensate to be transferred to the ETP. An initial scoping study was completed in 2001 to evaluate the feasibility of the evaporator which concluded that the concentration objectives could be met. This initial study was based on initial estimates of recycle concentration and was based solely on OLI modeling of the evaporation process. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has completed additional studies using simulated recycle streams and OLI{reg_sign} simulations. Based on this work, the proposed flowsheet for the recycle evaporator was evaluated for feasibility, evaporator design considerations, and impact on the DWPF process.

40|$|In August 2004 {{the last}} of the SIPP task testing ended [...] a task that {{formally}} began with the issuance of the RPP-WTP Test Specification in June 2003. The planning for the task was a major effort in itself and culminated with the input of all stakeholders, DOE, Bechtel National, Inc., Washington Group International, in October 2003 at Hanford, WA (Appendix A). This report documents the activities carried out {{as a result of that}} planning. Campaign IV, the fourth and final step towards the Semi-Integrated Pilot Plant (SIPP) task, conducted by the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) at the Savannah River Site, was to take the several <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> produced in Campaign III, the third step of the task, and combine them with other simulated recycle and chosen waste streams. (Campaign III was fed recycles from Campaign II, as Campaign II was fed by Campaign I.) The combined stream was processed in a fashion that mimicked the pretreatment operations of the DOE River Protection Project [...] Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (RPP-WTP) with the exception of the Ion Exchange Process. The SIPP task is considered semi-integrated because it only deals with the pretreatment operations of the RPP-WTP. That is, the pilot plant starts by receiving waste from the tank farm and ends when waste is processed to the point of being sent for vitrification. The resulting pretreated LAW and HLW simulants produced by the SIPP were shipped to VSL (Vitreous State Laboratory) and successfully vitrified in pilot WTP melters. Within the SIPP task these steps are referred to as Campaigns and there were four Campaigns in all. Campaign I, which is completely different than other campaigns, subjected a simulant of Hanford Tank 241 -AY- 102 /C- 106 (AY 102) waste to cross-flow ultrafiltration only and in that process several important <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> were produced as a result of washing the simulant and cleaning the cross-flow filter. These streams were fed to subsequent campaigns and that work was the subject of the issued Campaign I interim report (Duignan et al., 2004 a or Appendix I- 1). The streams created in Campaign I were used for Campaign II, and during Campaign II more of the same <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> were produced, with the addition of <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> created during the pilot-scale ion exchange unit operation (Duignan et al., 2004 b or Appendix I- 2). Campaign III used the recycles from Campaign II and was the first campaign to use all the <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> (Duignan et al., 2004 c or Appendix I- 3). The operation of each of the subsequent campaigns, i. e., II, III, and IV, while different from Campaign I, are very similar to each other, and can be best understood as the process of operating a series of Pretreatment Unit Operations in a somewhat prototypic manner. That is, while Campaign I studied the operation of a single, albeit important, Pretreatment Unit Operation, i. e., Ultrafiltration, subsequent campaigns were to study the four major unit operations that make-up the RPP-WTP Pretreatment Facility. They are: Waste Feed Evaporation Process (FEP), Ultrafiltration Process (UFP), Cesium Ion Exchange Process (CIX), and the Treated LAW Evaporation Process (TLP). Each of the campaigns operated basically as a separate subtask, but as with Campaign I, the <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> produced in one campaign were fed into the subsequent campaign. Therefore, all four campaigns were chemically connected through these <b>recycle</b> <b>streams,</b> which carry over effects of the preceding campaign. The results of Campaign IV operations are the subject of this fourth and final report. Separate reports were issued after each of the previous campaigns, but they were treated as interim because of being limited to the results obtained from a single campaign (or past campaigns) and further limited to only highlights of that single campaign. This final report not only discusses the Campaign IV results but compares those with the previous campaigns. Also included is a more comprehensive discussion of the overall task activities, as well as abridged versions of the full databases of the accumulated results and the equipment used during the year-long SIPP task...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel hybrid process combining thermally coupled reactive distillation with membrane-based pervaporation for enhanced production of n-butyl acetate. A conventional reactive distillation process {{was used as}} the base case and first optimized for the transesterification of methyl acetate with n-butanol to produce n-butyl acetate. It was observed that methyl acetate recovered in the <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> significantly affects the conversion in the reactive distillation column and overall energy efficiency of the whole process. The existing and proposed configurations were evaluated and optimized by simulation in Aspen Plus. The integration of thermally coupled reactive distillation and pervaporation improved the energy efficiency of the reactive distillation process by preventing remixing effect in the reactive distillation column and eliminating the azeotropic nature of the methanol and methyl acetate in the <b>recycle</b> <b>stream,</b> respectively. Finally, integration of the thermally coupled reactive distillation with a commercial pervaporation membrane was explored to take synergistic advantage of the thermally coupled reactive distillation and pervaporation hybrid configuration. As a result, the proposed hybrid design showed remarkably improved energy efficiency and economics.

40|$|Gas Switching Combustion (GSC) is a {{promising}} new process concept for energy efficient power production with integrated CO 2 capture. In comparison to conventional Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) {{carried out in}} interconnected fluidized beds, the GSC concept will be substantially easier to design and scale up, especially for pressurized conditions. One potential drawback of the GSC concept is the gradual temperature variation over the transient process cycle, {{which leads to a}} drop in electric efficiency of the plant. This article investigates heat management strategies to mitigate this issue both through simulations and experiments. Simulation studies of the GSC concept integrated into an IGCC power plant show that heat management using a nitrogen <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> can increase plant efficiency by 3 percentage points to 41. 6 % while maintaining CO 2 capture ratios close to 90 %. Reactive multiphase flow simulations of the GSC reactor also showed that heat management can eliminate fuel slip problems. In addition, the GSC concept offers the potential to remove the need for a nitrogen <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> by implementing a concentrated air injection that extracts heat while {{only a small percentage of}} oxygen reacts. Experiments have shown that, similar to nitrogen recycle, this strategy reduces transient temperature variations across the cycle and therefore merits further investigation...|$|E

The studied steady-state technology contains of two <b>recycle</b> <b>streams,</b> hence serves as a good model system for our study.

Based on our simulation calculations, it is shown that applying recirculation in the studied technology can effec-tively lead to instability if no appropriate process control system is installed. A method is shown that enables the selection of the appropriate process control structure, which ensures con-stant product purity. The example systems behaviour is studied with and without recirculation in both steady-state and dynamic domains. All the reasonable composition control structures are simulated and compared. Based on the steady-state results, con-trollability indices are calculated for the distillation columns and the best control structures are predicted. The steady-state investigations are confirmed later by dynamic simulations, and finally the best composition control scheme is selected for the entire system – based on the controllability indices...|$|R

40|$|In {{wastewater}} treatment, enhanced biological {{phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) {{is becoming an}} increasingly popular alternative to chemical precipitation (CP) because of its lower costs and reduced sludge production. However, downstream solids handling processes such as digestion, sludge storage and dewatering promote an undesirable release (i. e. secondary release) of polyphosphate that was stored within EBPR sludge. Released phosphate is recycled {{to the head of the}} plant with the liquors of sludge dewatering processes. The concentration of phosphate in <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> from EBPR systems can be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the influent phosphorus concentration entering the EBPR system. Plants using EBPR often have to resort to chemical phosphorus removal from the <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> to reduce the P loading returning to the EBPR process. The present study addresses the potential of lanthanum chloride as an alternative coagulant for phosphate removal in EBPR sludge dewatering liquors as the use of lanthanum-based coagulants has shown a strong potential for phosphorus precipitation in wastewater applications. The hypothesis is that lanthanum chloride is capable of achieving greater orthophosphate removals than ferric chloride or aluminum sulfate (alum) because lanthanum salts have shown to have a wider effective pH range and require lower doses than typical coagulants.

40|$|Pervaporation is {{advantageous}} in separating close-boiling point mixtures, azeotropes, thermally sensitive {{compounds and}} purification of chemicals. However, one pervaporation unit {{may not be}} economically feasible to simultaneously provide a high purity of compounds in both the retentate and the permeate streams. In this study, a cascaded pervaporation method is developed aiming to dehydrate 85 wt% acetic acid solution from a basis feed of 100 kg/h. First, pervaporation experiments were performed using lab-made PPSU membranes. In pervaporation, the separation factor depends ont the intrinsic properties of the membrane and on the operating conditions. These aspects cause {{a variation of the}} separation factor in pervaporation from 2 to 24.

40|$|This paper applies {{mathematical}} programming and superstructure-based optimization approaches to design multi-stage membrane systems for CO 2 capture, {{with the aim}} to systematically determine the optimal number of membrane stages, membrane areas, power requirements, the location of <b>recycle</b> <b>streams,</b> and operating conditions that satisfy desired CO 2 recovery−purity value pairs ranging from 90 to 98 % at minimum total cost. A superstructure that embeds several candidate configurations is represented as a NLP model {{which is used to}} investigate how these ranges of target values affect the optimal number of stages, membrane areas, operating conditions, and total cost. The results indicate that the optimal number of stages depend strongly on the desired CO 2 purity. For CO 2 purity ranging from 90 to 93 %, the optimal configuration involves two stages and one recycle stream; from 94 to 96 %, the optimal configuration involves three stages and two recycle streams; and finally, from 97 and 98 %, the optimal configuration involves all the four stages proposed in the superstructure keeping the two <b>recycle</b> <b>streams.</b> For the same design specifications, the obtained process configurations compete not only with reference cases of multi-stage membrane systems in terms of total cost, but also with absorption-based CO 2 capture processes in terms of energy requirements.

40|$|Testing was {{performed}} to determine the feasibility and processing characteristics of an evaporation process to reduce {{the volume of the}} <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> from the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The concentrated recycle would be returned to DWPF while the overhead condensate would be transferred to the Effluent Treatment Plant. Various blends of evaporator feed were tested using simulants developed from characterization of actual recycle streams from DWPF and input from DWPF-Engineering. The simulated feed was evaporated in laboratory scale apparatus to target a 30 X volume reduction. Condensate and concentrate samples from each run were analyzed and the process characteristics (foaming, scaling, etc) were visually monitored during each run. The following conclusions were made from the testing: Concentration of the ''typical'' <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> in DWPF by 30 X was feasible. The addition of DWTT recycle streams to the typical <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> raises the solids content of the evaporator feed considerably and lowers the amount of concentration that can be achieved. Foaming was noted during all evaporation tests and must be addressed prior to operation of the full-scale evaporator. Tests were conducted that identified Dow Corning 2210 as an antifoam candidate that warrants further evaluation. The condensate has the potential to exceed the ETP WAC for mercury, silicon, and TOC. Controlling the amount of equipment decontamination recycle in the evaporator blend would help meet the TOC limits. The evaporator condensate will be saturated with mercury and elemental mercury will collect in the evaporator condensate collection vessel. No scaling on heating surfaces was noted during the tests, but splatter onto the walls of the evaporation vessels led to a buildup of solids. These solids were difficult to remove with 2 M nitric acid. Precipitation of solids was not noted during the testing. Some of the aluminum present in the recycle streams was converted from gibbsite to aluminum oxide during the evaporation process. The following recommendations were made: Recycle from the DWTT should be metered in slowly to the ''typical'' recycle streams to avoid spikes in solids content to allow consistent processing and avoid process upsets. Additional studies should be conducted to determine acceptable volume ratios for the HEME dissolution and decontamination solutions in the evaporator feed. Dow Corning 2210 antifoam should be evaluated for use to control foaming. Additional tests are required to determine the concentration of antifoam required to prevent foaming during startup, the frequency of antifoam additions required to control foaming during steady state processing, and the ability of the antifoam to control foam over a range of potential feed compositions. This evaluation should also include evaluation of the degradation of the antifoam and impact on the silicon and TOC content of the condensate. The caustic HEME dissolution <b>recycle</b> <b>stream</b> should be neutralized to at least pH of 7 prior to blending with the acidic recycle streams. Dow Corning 2210 should be used during the evaporation testing using the radioactive recycle samples received from DWPF. Evaluation of additional antifoam candidates should be conducted as a backup for Dow Corning 2210.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the effects of}} <b>recycle</b> <b>streams</b> on the controllability of integrated plants and the improvement of performance {{made possible by a}} direct compensation of the recycle. A procedure for the decomposition of the global process in a part representing the process without recycle and in a part representing the recycle is presented. This is the key issue for evaluating the relevance of the recycle and to reduce the control system to two blocks: a regulator, depending on the process without recycle, plus a recycle compensator. The design of this control scheme is much easier with respect to a specific regulator computed for the global process and allows to achieve relevant improvement of performance with respect to a standard PI regulator. This is clearly illustrated for a SISO reference case, where process parameters are changed to create situations of particular evidence, and have been confirmed in the application to the two MIMO benchmarks, proposed in literature: the two reactors in series (W.

Application to two multivariable processes proposed in literature, the two reactors in series (Ray, 1981) and the two reactors plus three distillation columns (Luyben and Luyben, 1995) shows that also in these more realistic cases main advantages of the compensator are retained...|$|R
