40|$|The {{effects of}} {{turbulence}} in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on surface pressures {{of a typical}} low-rise building roof are investigated in this thesis. A 1 / 50 geometrically-scaled model of the Texas Tech University Wind Engineering Field Research Lab (WERFL) building model is used for pressure measurements in wind tunnel experiments. ABL wind turbulence intensities ranging from about 10 % to 30 %, and length scales ranging from 6 to 12 times of the building height (H) are generated. The effects of ABL turbulence on the mean <b>roof</b> <b>pressures</b> within the separated flow are explained from the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The pressure fields are reconstructed by integrating the pressure gradients using an analytic interpolation approach. For high turbulence intensity levels, the maximum suction coefficient on the roof surface {{was found to be}} increased. Such increasing magnitudes are directly related to reduced sizes of mean separation bubbles, more rapid variation of the velocity magnitude near the leading edge and enhanced variation of the turbulence stresses. On the other hand, higher surface pressure recovery found in the leeward portion of the separation bubble is mainly due to the more rapid variation of the turbulence stresses. The effects of ABL turbulences on the fluctuating <b>roof</b> surface <b>pressures</b> are explained by the quasi-steady (QS) theory. Basically, the QS model assumes that the instantaneous <b>roof</b> surface <b>pressure</b> is induced by a modified local mean flow field. The selection of the mean flow pattern and the amplification of the velocity magnitudes are determined so that the resulted instantaneous velocity vector is matched to the measurement at the reference location, i. e., 1 H above the roof leading edge in this thesis. The QS model is found to explain the effects of large length scale turbulences very well. Better QS-predictions are observed if vertical component of the velocities are included.

The objective is to investigate the generation mechanism of wind pressure and peak lifting actions on a large cantilevered roof. The roof model is 780 mm wide, 150 mm deep and is equipped with 78 pairs of pressure taps covering both roof surfaces. With an electronic pressure scanning system, wind pressures at these 156 taps are measured in a near-simultaneous manner. Time histories of the wind forces on both roof surfaces and of the net wind force on the entire roof are obtained from the simultaneous pressure signals. These force signals are analyzed statistically to investigate the mechanism of peak lift forces. The conditional sampling technique is used to extract the wind pressure pattern on the lower and upper roof surfaces when a large total uplift is occurring on the roof. It is found that the occurences of peak lift and peak moments on the roof are connected with large lifting actions on both roof surfaces. Differences between the conditionally sampled pressure pattern and the time-averaged mean pressure pattern are observed and discussed.

The analysis results indicates that ground pressure at material roadway increased sharply when the working face advanced to place 40 ∼ 50 m away from it, and as the advance of the working face, the deformation of the two-sides is clearly bigger than that at the roof and floor in material roadway; Therefore, support in material roadway should be strengthened to ensure the safe mining of working face.

40|$|For {{sustainable}} {{utilization of}} limited coal resources, {{it is important}} to increase the coal recovery rate and reduce mine accidents, especially those occurring in the entry (gateroad). Entry stabilities are vital for ventilation, transportation and other essential services in underground coal mining. In the present study, a finite difference model was built to investigate stress evolutions around the entry, and true triaxial tests were carried out at the laboratory to explore entry wall stabilities under different mining conditions. The modeling and experimental results indicated that a wide coal pillar was favorable for entry stabilities, but oversize pillars caused a serious waste of coal resources. As the width of the entry wall decreased, the integrated vertical stress, induced by two adjacent mining panels, coupled with each other and experienced an increase on the entry wall, which inevitably weakened the stability of the entry. Therefore, mining with coal pillars always involves a tradeoff between economy and safety. To address this problem, an innovative non-pillar mining technique by optimizing the entry surrounding structures was proposed. Numerical simulation showed that the deformation of the entry roof decreased by approximately 66 % after adopting the new approach, compared with that using the conventional mining method. Field monitoring indicated that the stress condition of the entry was signiﬁcantly improved and the average <b>roof</b> <b>pressure</b> decreased by appropriately 60. 33 % after adopting the new technique.

Five building models with roof angles of 10 ∘, 15 ∘, 20 ∘, 25 ∘ and 30 ∘ equipped with an interchangeable roof slope panel have been tested in a typical open country exposure in the boundary layer wind tunnel of the Centre for Building Studies at Concordia University.

40|$|During extreme wind events, roofing {{failures}} {{may lead}} to damage of the whole structure. In order to alleviate the effect, surface pressure coefficients on the roofs have been extensively investigated. This research aims to determine the roof pressures acting on low-rise buildings with consideration {{of the effects of}} turbulence (terrain). Pressure measurements, as well as wind speed data, were taken at the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL) of the University of Western Ontario (UWO) to examine the influence of turbulence level (i. e., terrain condition) on the critical wind directions corresponding to the largest surface <b>roof</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficients for various upstream boundary layer conditions. In addition, plan dimensions and eave heights of the building were also varied. Generally, corner vortices {{play a vital role in}} generating larger suction pressures on the roof surface in flat terrain. Moreover, separation bubble at the leading edge of low-rise buildings is also significant to take into consideration for winds normal to the walls. Our objective is to examine these points in terms of area-averages used in design. The results indicate that corner vortices control larger area on the roof surface among all angles of attack in lower turbulence flow (i. e., flat terrain), whereas this effect is reduced in higher turbulence level (i. e., suburban terrain) for all plan shapes. In addition, the size of the corner vortices along both edges of the roof increases with building height for low-rise buildings, consistent with the new requirements in ASCE 7 – 16. It is also found that the critical wind directions depend significantly on the turbulence level and building height. The critical wind directions for the corner zones of low-rise building roofs are primarily due to oblique angles (i. e., corner vortices), while they are normal wind directions (i. e., bubble separation) for the edge, and interior zones, when the tributary areas are small. The magnitude of peak pressure coefficients, GCp, depend more on the integral length scales compared to the turbulence intensity, which may be important in some design scenarios...|$|E

40|$|The present {{wind tunnel}} study {{examines}} the suitability of the current wind provisions in wind codes and standards {{for the design of}} roof zones of flat-roofed low-rise buildings with large dimensions. Current wind codes and standards have load provisions dealing with low buildings of common configurations. Large buildings, say 100 m long, have not been considered when these provisions were established. As a result, the interaction between wind and buildings of such geometries should be investigated for the assessment of current wind provisions in terms of their applicability to such configurations. Nine large low-rise buildings of 5, 7. 5 and 10 m high with flat roofs have been tested in a typical open country exposure in the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel of Concordia University. The models have been tested for wind directions ranging from 0 ° to 90 ° at increments of 15 °. The buildings have large square plan with equivalent full-scale horizontal dimensions ranging from 60 to 180 m. Local <b>roof</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficients have been obtained from the wind tunnel measurements. Moreover, area-averaged negative peak pressure coefficients have been established using numerical integration of individual pressure coefficients. The effects of building dimensions on the generated roof pressures have been addressed in this study. This thesis presents a comparative study based on code provisions and experimental results. The first part compares the application of the current code roof zone systems and the design wind pressures specified in codes and standards. The second part of the study compares the experimental results with the respective values specified in code/standard provisions in terms of wind pressures and roof zone sizes to assess the suitability of these provisions. These comparisons show significant differences in the patterns of the design pressure coefficients among the current wind codes and standards. Application of the current provisions of ASCE 7 - 10 and NBCC 2010 on building geometries of large roofs and low height may lead to considerably conservative and uneconomic roof design. An exception for very long low buildings, as far as the determination of the sizes of roof edge and corner zones is concerned, has been recommended to rectify the deficiency of wind codes and standards for these building geometries...|$|E
