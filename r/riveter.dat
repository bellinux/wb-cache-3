40|$|Measurements {{were made}} on 46 pairs of <b>riveters</b> and matched control {{subjects}} before and after a morning's work. Before starting work, the mean resting finger systolic pressure was 112 (SEM 3. 3) mm Hg in the <b>riveters,</b> similar to 117 (1. 7) in the control subjects. After cooling the middle phalanx to 10 degrees C for five minutes, 16 <b>riveters</b> but only one control subject exhibited digital vasospasm and these numbers were unaltered after a morning's work. A subgroup of <b>riveters</b> whose role was always to provide counter pressure to the rivet gun showed a higher incidence (45 %) of cold induced vasospasm than did <b>riveters</b> who invariably held the gun (10 %) or rotated between both roles (27 %). Plasma levels of three markers of vascular activity, endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWFAg), and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), were measured in non-smoking <b>riveters</b> and control subjects. Before work, ET- 1 concentrations were slightly lower (p < 0. 05) in the <b>riveters,</b> but vWFAg concentration and ACE activity were similar in <b>riveters</b> and control subjects. Riveting for a morning did not alter ET- 1 concentration or ACE activity but did induce a small increase (p < 0. 05) in vWFAg concentration, which may indicate damage to the endothelium. This type of vascular assessment may be helpful in assessing vasospastic complications in workers exposed to vibration...|$|R

Upon entering Earth-12591, the Ducky Dozen fought hordes of zombie Nazis and Asgardians, but suffered grave losses as members were either killed or zombified in battle.

25|$|Many American women {{retained}} {{their domestic}} chores and often added a paid job, especially one {{related to a}} war industry. Much {{more so than in}} the previous war, large numbers of women were hired for unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in munitions, and barriers against married women taking jobs were eased. The popular Rosie the <b>Riveter</b> icon became a symbol for a generation of American working women. In addition, some 300,000 women served in U.S. military uniform with organizations such as Women's Army Corps and WAVES. With many young men gone, sports organizers tried to set up professional women's teams, such as the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which closed after the war. After the war, most munitions plants closed, and civilian plants replaced their temporary female workers with returning veterans, who had priority.|$|E
25|$|Norman Perceval Rockwell (February 3, 1894 – November 8, 1978) was a 20th-century American author, {{painter and}} illustrator. His works {{have a broad}} popular appeal in the United States for their {{reflection}} of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over nearly five decades. Among the best-known of Rockwell's works are the Willie Gillis series, Rosie the <b>Riveter,</b> The Problem We All Live With, Saying Grace, and the Four Freedoms series. He also is noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), during which he produced covers for their publication Boys' Life, calendars, and other illustrations. These works include popular images that reflect the Scout Oath and Scout Law such as The Scoutmaster, A Scout is Reverent and A Guiding Hand, among many others.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} {{involved}} in a significant court case in 1912, which went to the highest court of the land and was subsequently cited in other cases, including in the United States. In 1902 a Mr Noden, employed as a <b>riveter,</b> had an accident at work which resulted in the amputation of a finger. He resumed work at the company in 1903 as a caulker, which involved using a light hammer, but in 1910 was instructed to use a heavy pneumatic hammer. The vibration from this heavier hammer caused his hand to become inflamed and he sought compensation, based on his injury of 1902. A lower court awarded him this compensation but the judgment was overturned on appeal by the Law Lords, who directed that {{there was no evidence that}} the 1902 accident was a contributory cause of his injury of 1910 and that, in any event, the latter incident was not actually an accident at all and therefore there was no entitlement to compensation under the terms of the 1897 Workmen's Compensation Act.|$|E
500|$|Rockwell's emblematic Rosie the <b>Riveter</b> {{painting}} was loaned by the Post to the U.S. Treasury Department {{for use in}} posters and campaigns promoting war bonds. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value—it sold for nearly $5million in 2002. Conversely, the lack of protection for the [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] image {{is one of the}} reasons it experienced a rebirth.|$|E
500|$|Willie Gillis was a freckle-faced All-American {{character}} {{who served as}} one of Rockwell's main coverboys during World War II. The Gillis character is widely referred to as an everyman who epitomized the typical American World War II soldier. [...] Rockwell created Gillis in 1940 as the European Theatre of World War II was escalating and Americans were enlisting or being drafted into the armed forces under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. Rockwell credits the name Willie Gillis to his wife, who derived it from the old nursery rhyme Wee Willie Winkie. Rockwell described Gillis as [...] "an inoffensive, ordinary little guy thrown into the chaos of war." [...] The public identified with Rockwell's portrayal of the [...] "little guy" [...] living up {{to a sense of}} duty in this time of war. [...] Gillis was truly seen as the typical G.I., and Rockwell's wartime art remains quite popular: his signed original May 29, 1943 depiction of Rosie the <b>Riveter</b> sold at a Sotheby's auction on May 22, 2002 for $4,959,500. Some of the Willie Gillis paintings and the Rosie the <b>Riveter</b> painting were raffled off during the United States Department of the Treasury's Second War Loan Drive, which ran from April 12 – May 1, 1943. [...] The Gillis character endures generations later for literary and artistic comparison.|$|E

500|$|North {{was born}} in Leeds, Yorkshire, on 30 January 1842, {{the son of a}} coal {{merchant}} and a churchwarden. [...] At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and engineers before working for several years as a mechanic. [...] He moved to Chile in South America at the age of 23 where his first occupation was as a boiler <b>riveter</b> in Huasco. [...] He moved from Huasca to Iquique in the province of Tarapacá, which was then part of Peru. [...] Here North established what later became a large business empire, working as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner.|$|E
500|$|Rockwell was {{perceived}} as apolitical, but advocated [...] "tolerance for differences, courtesy, kindness, and the freedoms that FDR articulated". He believed FDR's freedoms were worth fighting for, and he made numerous artistic contributions to the war efforts apart from the Four Freedoms. He is widely known for his idealized fictional wartime character Willie Gillis and his depiction of Rosie the <b>Riveter.</b> Some of his other war art is known by name, such as War News and Homecoming Soldier. [...] He was responsible for encouraging individual monetary support of the war through posters like the 1943 Hasten the Homecoming.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, the [...] "We Can Do It!"

The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed [...] "Rosie" [...] who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades. Other [...] "Rosie" [...] images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The Office of War Information geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] was not part of it.|$|E
