40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose two {{extensions}} of the Exponential model to describe income distributions. The Exponential ArcTan (EAT) and the composite EAT–Lognormal models discussed in this paper preserve key properties of the Exponential model including its capacity to model distributions with zero incomes.

Frequencies, percentages and tables were used to capture raw scores and to depict response rates, as well as to facilitate data analysis, interpretation, and recording. To assist the researcher to analyse qualitatively derived data, Textually Oriented Data Analysis (TODA) strategy was used. The findings revealed that staff development was essential, not only for institutional and curriculum development in the school, but also for personal staff growth and empowerment. Staff development is necessary for the acquisition of required skills for effective teaching. Schools should have a staff development teacher who focuses on helping teachers develop skilful teaching in a non-judgmental way. The findings further revealed that coaches for Maths and Literacy need to be introduced in schools to assist teachers with lesson plans and model lessons and that continuous training of teachers is necessary and should be done by experts and not by every person who claims to understand what effective teaching is all about. Finally, Networking with other schools and organizations should be encouraged to ensure inter-sectoral collaboration amongst specialists who have an interest in education.

40|$|Employee Assistance Programmes are {{the various}} {{interventions}} in the workplace, which {{are aimed at}} helping employees who are experiencing personal and work-related problems. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether there is a need for a structured Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) at Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital. In this study, the researcher utilised a quantitative approach due to the nature of the research topic under investigation, which is geared towards the assessment of the needs of employees for an EAP, because she wants to base her knowledge gained on objective measurements of the real world, not on someone's opinion, beliefs or past experiences. The researcher utilised research in this study to explore the need for an EAP programme that might be designed/introduced to solve employee problems. For this study, the <b>researcher</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> a combination of an exploratory-descriptive design, due to the fact that little is know about the phenomenon, group or programme. The researcher used a combination of interval/systematic sampling and random sampling to complement each other in eradicating any bias that has the potential of occurring when applying interval/systematic sampling. To achieve representation and precision in this study, the researcher divided the total population of 525 Sterkfontein employees into five categories according to their departments and attached the actual number of employees in a particular department as reflected in the staff establishment document of Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital to the appropriate stratum. The results derived from this endeavour were thus: Management (25), Clinical Staff (45), Administration (44), Nurses (253) and the General Assistants (158). The researcher divided each employee in each respective category by one tenth or 10 % in order to know how many respondents from each category could be included in the sample, and added together all the figures derived from such a division to obtain a sample size of 53 respondents for the study. As a result, the researcher came up with the following respondents in five (5) categories of employees: - Management (3), Clinical (5), Administration (4), Nurses (25) and General Assistants (16). The researcher compiled only one questionnaire for all five (5) categories of Sterfontein Psychiatric Hospital employees because EAP recognises that employees start from the CEO to the lowest paid employee in the company and, as such, considers all employees to be equal. The investigation illustrated some limitations in the normal running of the hospital. Most of the respondents had both personal and work-related problems, which impacted negatively on the hospital. There were no mechanisisms in place that were geared towards helping troubled employees or providing skills in handling troubled employees. Hence, from these limitations, it became clear that there is a need for an Employee Assistance Programme at Sterkfontein Psychiatric Hospital.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{behavioral}} and ecological evolution within a phylogenetic context (historical ecology; Brooks and McLennan 1991) {{is an important}} component of comparative studies in evolutionary biology. Although the number of historical ecological studies is growing rapidly, this research field {{is still in its infancy}} [...] an infancy whose maturation is hampered by the absence of rigorous phylogenetic hypotheses for many of the groups that have traditionally fascinated behavioral ecologists. In the absence of such critical information, behavioral ecologists are faced with the options either of forming cooperative groups with phylogenetic systematists or of investigating their ecological data based on 2 ̆ 2 trees 2 ̆ 2 reconstructed from old classification schemes or phenograms, neither of which produces a robust phylogenetic hypothesis of genealogy. Most <b>researchers</b> have <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> the second approach, prefacing their investigations with the caveat that the analysis and conclusions are only preliminary because of the unsatisfactory nature of the phylogenetic hypotheses available to them. The importance of a preliminary analysis cannot be underestimated for researchers who, recognizing the importance of incorporating phylogenetic information into evolutionary explanations, are frustrated by their inability to apply such an approach to their burgeoning data sets. It is, however, equally important to realize that a preliminary analysis can, at best, produce only tentative results (see, e. g., Sillen-Tullberg 1988). If the data themselves are both incomplete and ambiguous, this will compound the problems arising from an absence of a rigorous phylogenetic framework, which will produce a confusing picture of behavioral or ecological evolution...|$|R

30|$|ILSAs are {{tasked with}} obtaining sound {{measures}} of what students {{from around the}} world know and can do in the relevant content areas, as well as obtaining a host of background variables to aid in the contextualization of those measures. These tasks place a unique set of requirements on the test design and psychometric modeling. Although innovations in ILSAs can come from the re-analysis of past assessments, those data are fundamentally constricted to a particular design and by extant data. Due to the scope of ILSAs, pilot testing is highly restricted, leaving simulation studies as the primary means for understanding issues and possible solutions within the ILSA arena. The intention for lsasim was to develop a minimal number of functions to facilitate the generation of data that mimics the large scale assessment context to the extent possible. To that end, lsasim offers the possibility of simulating data that adhere to general properties found in the background questionnaire (mostly ordinal, correlated variables that are also related to varying degrees with some latent trait). The package also features functions for simulating achievement data according to a number of common IRT models with known parameters. A clear advantage of lsasim over other simulation software is that the achievement data, in the form of item responses, can arise from multiple-matrix sampled test designs. Although the background questionnaire data can be linked to the test responses, all aspects of lsasim can function independently, affording researchers a high degree of flexibility in terms of possible research questions and the part of an assessment that is of most interest. Built in default functionality also allows <b>researchers</b> to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> randomly chosen population parameters. Alternatively, users can specify their own test design specifications and population parameters, offering the possibility of full control over the research design and data generation process.|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{research}} and record the training process of teachers in a Grade R learning programme, within a context of inclusive education, by describing the teachers’ perception of the Grade R learning programme and by making certain changes to the training and training process that have been suggested in the study, and to offer guidelines with regard to the training of foundation phase educators, with specific reference to Grade R educators working within the context of inclusive education. The <b>researcher</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> an interpretative action research design within a qualitative research paradigm since she wished to describe, interpret and explain actions within her research whilst attempting to bring about certain improvements within the teaching practice. The type of action research that was performed is known as practitioner action research because it was performed in the presence of, and with the cooperation of education practitioners as well as academics who assisted the researcher with relevant skills and resources. The following major themes were identified: Facilitating, programme implementation, complete empowerment, cooperation as well as common religious convictions. The most significant findings were the following: When we look at the facilitation of training programmes, it is of the utmost importance that the facilitator accepts from the onset that the participants as well as the facilitators will experience uncertainty within themselves, specifically regarding their own knowledge and abilities and the level of acceptance they will experience in the company of other professionals. It is therefore all the more important to determine each participant’s expectations regarding the purpose and outcomes of the the training programme as this will ease the process considerably and at the same time render the facilitator a clear idea of what needs to be addressed and what not. Facilitators of training programmes, especially within contexts similar to this study, should reflect on the importance of sound relationships being established between facilitator and participants. The initial level of experience and skill of each participant should be determined before the start of the programme and here the facilitator plays an enormous role as far as emotional and social support is concerned. When it comes to programme implementation, I should think that educators in all possible contexts will benefit immensely from the format of the lessons, the contents of the lessons as well as the presentation thereof because these are outcomes-based lessons. In terms of contexts similar to the one in this reseach, it is important that the facilitator works through each new lesson with the educators to ensure that they fully understand everything and also to give them the opportunity to ask questions as this will enable them to implement these lessons with enhanced confidence in their own classes. It was important for the teachers to experience their training in a practical manner because they learnt from one another, they had the opportunity to exchange ideas and, whatever problems they experienced, could be addressed and solved immediately. In conclusion I would like to strongly advocate the choice of practitioner research as research methodology in any study that is focussed on the improvement of the teaching practice. Not only does it hold immense benefits for practitioners, but as researcher I experienced complete personal enrichment in as far as I acted as an agent of meaningful change in the lives of the practitioners who accompanied me on this journey...|$|R

The proliferation of “diet conscious” consumers has exacerbated the situation. These alternatives are the primary growth areas in the impulse beverage market. This has obviously threatened the viability and profitability of major players in this industry. To date the performance of Carbonated Soft Drinks (CSDs) has been less than satisfactory. There are other key players which have penetrated this market namely Pepsi, trading as Pioneer Foods, Royal, Pioneer Foods, California Cola, Pick ‘n Pay and Quality Beverages. For purposes of this study the three key players were chosen namely ABI, Pepsi and Quality Beverages. These key players have made huge investments in this industry at the level of production and distribution. In addition heavy investments go towards advertising and promotional campaigns. This research is exploratory in nature and makes way for further research in order to reach a more logical conclusion. This study is conducted within the confines of Gauteng region and more specifically Johannesburg North and Central. These two regions were chosen because the researcher resides close to these regions and wanted to minimize the costs involved in this study. The researcher also assumed the findings are a true representation of the broader picture of the South African scenario. Before collecting information the researcher initially consulted recent articles, books, magazines, company reports and even the internet in order to develop a clear understanding of the industry. This also helped the researcher to make logical decisions in the course` of undertaking the research. To that effect the researcher adopted the service quality SERVQUAL and the Gaps models in coming up with a measurement instrument for the research. The CSD companies have two broad categories of customers namely the trader and the end user or consumer. The trader purchases the product for purposes of research whilst the end user buys for consumption. This research focused on the trade customer. According to research experts a sample of more than 5 % of the total population does not compromise validity. However the <b>researcher</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> more than 10 % of the total population in order to increase reliability of the results. Thus from the population size of 965 trade outlets the researcher arrived at a sample of 100. The traders were classified into four major categories namely retail outlets, wholesalers, restaurants and service stations. Information was collected from these 100 traders using personal interviews. The researcher is the one who conducted all the interviews. Information was gathered from buyers, managers and owners. The researcher took advantage of the Statistical Package for Social Scientists in order to make a meaningful analysis of the data collected. Many service oriented recommendations have been promulgated by this research. They are neither exhaustive nor prescriptive given the time constraint within which this research was conducted...|$|R
40|$|Collaboration is {{identified}} within {{the supply chain}} management discipline as a strategy that helps to link inter-institutional business research operations {{in order to achieve}} a shared market opportunity. Through collaboration, institutions should aim at maintaining a competitive advantage in their core areas of operation. Researchers have begun to appreciate that through collaboration they are able to achieve combined synergies through effective use of available yet at times scarce resources particularly for research. In the Australian universities research sector collaboration has assumed importance in light of the changing public sector funding environment which is similar to the changes taking place {{in other parts of the}} world. The absence of a comprehensive operational policy on research collaboration at regional Universities in Australia would most likely hinder their capacity to attract funding from external sources for their business research function. Although the strategy of collaboration is widely advocated, no formal studies have been conducted and published in the context of the Australian regional university sector prior to this research. This thesis set out to fill this perceived gap in the literature by examining the policy issues likely to affect research collaboration at regional universities. For this purpose a research objective and five research questions were identified and defined. The research adopted a qualitative, inductive, theory-building exploratory approach with case study being the main research methodology. The <b>researcher</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> a single case study of a regional university in Australia, where 30 in-depth interviews and an additional 12 interviews representing research partner and beneficiary institutions were conducted. Upon data collection and data analysis, the following findings emerged: • researchers were keen to be involved in the development of the policy to facilitate the process of collaboration • adequate funding is essential for collaboration to achieve the desired results • the regional university policy on collaboration is reflected in relations with external institutions, there is encouragement for the conduct of joint research with stakeholders • the policy on collaboration impacts on university’s research focus, and should be comprehensively addressed • for the policy on collaboration to become operationally feasible the guidelines should have specific objectives with measurable outcomes. Further to these findings, it has been concluded that: • a comprehensive policy addressing the concerns of all stakeholders should be employed to facilitate the process of collaboration • sharing of information within and among partners should lead to synergies and opportunities for additional funding • the university policy on collaboration reflection in external relations should help in recognising the institution as a regionally, nationally and internationally recognised research university • the regional university impact on research focus should be comprehensively addressed in the policy on research collaboration, and • for the policy to become operationally feasible the guidelines should have specific objectives with measurable outcomes. Based upon the surveyed literature (Chapter 2), the analysis of field data (Chapter 4), the researcher’s understanding of the capacity, importance and relevance of collaboration as a strategy to attract external funding for business research, a conceptual model has emerged. The model enables the researcher to shed light on the research issue, the policy issues likely to affect collaboration at a regional university. The empirical research findings derived from this research have further implications for theory, policy and practice. Finally, the conclusions and implications provide a valid foundation for further research. This will be imperative in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the underlying issues...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigates Waste {{services provided by}} community-based enterprises in the Ngombe peri-urban settlement area - Lusaka, Zambia. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify and analyze the factors that contribute to illegal dumping of solid waste in the said peri-urban settlement area. The research objectives were as follows: To explore the capability of the community-based enterprises to effectively manage their enterprises in relation to the provision of solid waste services to the residents of the said settlement, To identify and evaluate the solid waste services provided by the community-based enterprises, and To make recommendations for the improvement of solid waste service provision and utilisation based on the findings of the study. The method of data collection for the above listed objectives was a literature study and focus group interviews. In order to achieve the said objectives of the study, the <b>researcher</b> <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> a qualitative research design – utilizing the contextual, descriptive, inductive and deductive approaches. The research population comprised the community-based enterprises involved in the provision of solid waste services in the Ngombe settlement area namely Kutwano and Tiyende Pamodzi Waste Enterprises. The purposive sample method was used for the selection of the focus group. The focus group discussions were captured by means of an audiotape and note-taking. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, within 24 hours of data capturing. Data analysis followed the five steps of Powell and Renner (2003, pp, 1 - 6), namely: familiarization, identifying a thematic framework, categorization (coding or indexing) of data, identifying patterns and connections within and between categories (relationships), and interpretation (bringing it all together). The researcher adhered to the relevant ethical considerations and the principles of trustworthiness, namely: credibility, transferability, dependability and conformability throughout the study. In exploring the capability of the two community-based enterprises to effectively manage their enterprises in relation to the provision of solid waste services to the residents of the said settlement it was found that community-based enterprises do not have the capability to provide adequate solid waste services. This is due to inadequate leadership and entrepreneurship skills of the community-based enterprises management committee members, non-payment of solid waste collection fees by the majority of households and inadequate legal enforcement by the Lusaka City Council’s Waste Management Unit. In identifying and evaluating the solid waste services provided by the community-based enterprises it was found that solid waste services provided by community-based enterprises were inadequate. This is due to the type of equipment (push carts) used for primary solid waste collection that does not carter for other forms of solid waste like construction waste; inappropriate solid waste storage containers (25 kg maize meal bags) which do not allow storage of solid waste in a sanitary manner (non-leak proof, accessible to rats, flies and cockroaches and rodents); restriction on the type of solid waste that community-based enterprises should collect (in relation to the specified solid waste storage container, 25 kg maize meal bags) and the delay of secondary solid waste collection by Lusaka City Council’s Waste Management Unit. On the basis of the findings of the study, a number of recommendations are being made, which, if implemented effectively, should improve the provision and utilisation of solid waste services within the study area. Such an improvement should lead to a higher level of environmental cleanliness, and ultimately to better health standards of the people living within the area...|$|R

40|$|The Translation of Parallelism in Political Speeches The core {{focus of}} this {{research}} centres on the rhetorical device parallelism, -which is frequently used in Arabic, particularly {{in the context of}} political discourse. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the way parallelism is dealt with when translated from Arabic into English in terms of its function, patterns and frequency and whether it manifests an impact on ST recipients. The research will draw on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in the investigation of the context of the research, which centers on political discourse and argumentative text typology. (CDA) offers involvement with ideology, in terms of belonging to a group or a country, the need for safety, food, etc, and the fear from invasion and outsiders, which in turn is involved in political speeches. Furthermore, (CDA) highlights significant issues such as power and legitimacy which are the core of political discourse. Furthermore, the <b>researcher</b> has <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> two tools to approach the rhetorical device in hand, first of which is contrastive Stylistics where parallelism is investigated in both Arabic and English political speeches as a stylistic device. Second, translation studies which is applied to the analytical part of this study, which investigates parallelism in original speeches in Arabic and their English translations. The findings of the study show that parallelism is an effective rhetorical device, which occurs in high frequency in Arabic political speeches. The results also indicate that English uses parallelism but less frequently compared to Arabic and relies more on other rhetorical features such as listing three elements, using contrasting elements and manipulating the use of pronouns, among others. The study concludes that parallelism plays a significant role in Arabic political speeches and creates a greater impact on recipients. Despite the fact that parallelism occurs less frequently in English political speeches, it has been noticed that it is highly used in the English translation, in contrast to what has been hypothised and this may be due to the nature of the corpus, which is delivered by a monarch and reflects legitimacy, power and highly controlled language.
