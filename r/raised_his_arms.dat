5|$|Boucaud scored {{his first}} goal for York with a 12-yard {{shot into the}} bottom corner in a 5–1 victory away to Kettering on 23 August 2011. He was handed a three-match {{suspension}} after being red carded during a 0–0 draw away to Barrow on 19 November 2011 after being adjudged by the referee to have <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> during the melee following the sending off of teammate Jason Walker during stoppage time. York's Conference Premier rivals Fleetwood Town made an offer for Boucaud during January 2012, which was rejected by manager Gary Mills.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} of these tales was that John of Howden, {{at his funeral}} in 1275, <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> from his open coffin during his requiem mass to greet the host. As such, he has become regarded as a saint, though the Catholic Church has never made this official. Through the pilgrims, Howden received the money that it needed to complete the minster, fulfilling John of Howden's prophecy that he would continue aiding the minster from beyond the grave.|$|E
25|$|The two {{officials}} {{near the}} play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; side judge Lance Easley <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to signal touchdown, while back judge Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved {{his arms to}} signal stoppage of the clock. Because Rhone-Dunn signaled timeout so as to stop the already expired game clock, Rhone-Dunn indicated that he desired further investigation of the play before rendering a verdict whereas Easley, from his angle, found sufficient evidence of a simultaneous catch with which to call a touchdown. The ruling on the field was officially a touchdown, with Tate and Jennings maintaining simultaneous possession.|$|E

25|$|In Olai's account, {{the battle}} was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop Anders Sunesen {{on top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.|$|E
500|$|After the sailboat, Larson's pattern play {{became more}} accurate, as {{he hit his}} target squares each time he spun. Tomarken was {{increasingly}} astounded that Larson was still spinning despite not having seen a Whammy for so long. Larson continued to press on, passing more and more milestone markers without losing any of his four remaining spins. As he passed the $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000 marks, Tomarken virtually begged Larson to stop more than once, fearing he would hit a Whammy. [...] Larson finally decided to stop once he reached $102,851. After he announced he was passing his remaining spins, Larson <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> in triumph and received a standing ovation from the audience.|$|E
500|$|Brown scored against Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie at Ibrox on 6 February 2011, {{which earned}} Celtic a replay. Brown and El Hadji Diouf, {{who had played}} {{directly}} against each other on Celtic's right wing, had exchanged words {{throughout much of the}} game. After scoring his goal, Brown turned to Diouf and <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> in a taunting celebration, he was booked for this. After the match they continued their feud in the media the next day. Two days after the match, Brown then stated that he considered their altercations to be [...] "just a bit of banter" [...] which he regularly encountered on the pitch and that the yellow card he received for his celebration was the best of his life. Several days later, Lennon publicly stated he wanted to agree a new contract with Brown. In the lead up to the replay of the Scottish Cup match, Rangers player Kyle Bartley said that not many Rangers players liked Brown and that they would be targeting him in the next game.|$|E

500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of people will say it was right {{and a lot of people}} will say it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|E
500|$|Mars first {{performed}} [...] "It Will Rain" [...] {{with his}} band at The Ellen DeGeneres Show, on November 18, 2011. Mars wore {{a hat and}} sunglasses as props, signing while fog appeared [...] "throughout the dimly-lit studio". Idolator's Becky Bain declared [...] "the man proves again that he's got some killer pipes". Madison Vanderberg from Stereotude also praised the singers' voice [...] "soulful croons and amazing voice". On the following week, the single {{was performed on the}} first season of the American X Factor, which for Mars would be one of his career highlights. The singer, who was wearing a fedora hat, <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to the audience as the song started and a digital screen projecting a giant broken heart-shaped neon light as background appeared during the show. Mars performed [...] "It Will Rain" [...] on his 2010 [...] "The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour", where it was the fourteenth song on the setlist. During the European leg, it was sang live with Skylar Grey. Mars performance with Grey drew the attention of some reviewers. Becky Bain of Idolator noted that the two [...] "have melancholia perfected". PopDust felt that [...] "Grey's contribution is soft and minimal; it's all about Bruno and his rain-slick voice." [...] the website concluded, [...] "it's a shame that here, she feels so invisible". On his second worldwide tour, Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-2014), interpolated with [...] "If I Knew", a song included on his second studio album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), in most concerts.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{is often}} singled out amongst the Beckett canon as being overtly {{political}} even though similar claims {{could be made}} for What Where and Rough for Radio II. The play is still a Beckett play and as such it is unwise to limit ones reading of it. [...] "When ... asked about the political significance of Catastrophe, he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{in a gesture of}} impatience and made just one remark: 'It is not more political than Pochade Radiophonique’”, Rough for Radio II, as the latter is known in English." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both {{government}} representatives and the Chilean public have repeatedly credited Divine Providence with keeping the miners alive while the Chilean public viewed their subsequent rescue as a miracle. Chile's president Sebastián Piñera stated, [...] "When the first miner emerges safe and sound, I hope all the bells {{of all the}} churches of Chile ring out forcefully, with joy and hope. Faith has moved mountains." [...] When Esteban Rojas {{stepped out of the}} rescue capsule, he immediately knelt on the ground with his hands together in prayer then <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> above him in adoration. His wife then wrapped a tapestry bearing the image of The Virgin Mary around him as they hugged and cried.|$|E
2500|$|On February 1, 2011, Sondheim joined former Salt Lake Tribune theatre critic Nancy Melich {{before an}} {{audience}} of 1,200 at Kingsbury Hall. Melich described the evening: He was visibly taken by the university choir, who sang two songs during the evening, [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] and [...] "Sunday", {{and then returned to}} reprise [...] "Sunday". During that final moment, Sondheim and I were standing, facing the choir of students from the University of Utah's opera program, our backs to the audience, and I could see tears welling in his eyes as the voices rang out. Then, all of a sudden, he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and began conducting, urging the student singers to go full out, which they did, the crescendo building, their eyes locked with his, until the final [...] "on an ordinary Sunday" [...] was sung. It was thrilling, and a perfect conclusion to a remarkable evening – nothing ordinary about it.|$|E
2500|$|On March 17, 2008, The Toronto Star {{reported}} {{details from}} Canadians {{caught in the}} violent riots in Tibet. 19-year-old John Kenwood of Victoria, B.C. was witnessing a Chinese motorcyclist being pummelled unconscious by a Tibetan mob hurling chunks of pavement as big as bricks. [...] "He may have died," [...] Kenwood said last night (March 16). [...] "I can't be certain." [...] "He didn't seem {{to understand what was}} going on," [...] said Kenwood. [...] "He was wearing a gold helmet and he got off his bike and <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> He didn't know what to do." [...] Also the report cited Canadian eye-witnesses of how the riots turned violent and how some of them escaped with help from taxi drivers and guides. Another report described in detail how Canadian traveller Justin Winfield from Toronto helped to save a Han Chinese from mobs and took him to a local hospital along with two women.|$|E

2500|$|Pro and his {{brothers}} were visited by Generals Roberto Cruz and Palomera Lopez around 11 p.m. on November 22, 1927. [...] The next day, as Pro walked from his cell to the courtyard and the firing squad, he blessed the soldiers, knelt, and briefly prayed quietly. Declining a blindfold, he faced his executioners with a crucifix {{in one hand and}} a rosary in the other and held his arms out in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, [...] "May God have mercy on you! May God bless you! Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent! With all my heart I forgive my enemies!" [...] Before the firing squad were ordered to shoot, Pro <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, [...] "Viva Cristo Rey!" [...] – [...] "Long live Christ the King!". When the initial shots of the firing squad failed to kill him, a soldier shot him at point-blank range.|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Magnussen {{was treated}} for {{dehydration}} and minor burns on his lower back by his trainer Antti Vierula with an iced towel and McLaren sought a doctor who gave attention to Magnussen in the team's hospitality building. His condition {{was caused by a}} broken radiator seal which possibly came loose after going over the turn seven kerbing early in the Grand Prix, causing hot air to be directed into his cockpit, making his seat and drinks bottle warmer. He found the drinks bottle content very hot to consume and complained over the radio that it burned his mouth. Magnussen <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> out of his cockpit to direct cool air down his sleeves and onto his back to alleviate the pain. The driver called his tenth-place finish [...] "the hardest-earnt point I've ever had" [...] and the McLaren team principal Éric Boullier said his performance under the circumstances was a [...] "scant consolidation" [...] and reserved praise for Magnussen being [...] "indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit". Magnussen later posted on Twitter that reports of his conditions were exaggerated and that he felt [...] "just hot and sweaty," [...] Kvyat also suffered from dehydration when his water supply malfunctioned after two-thirds race distance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, saying things like [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which he sat up from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.|$|E
