30|$|The {{most common}} {{risk factor for}} stroke was {{hypertension}} followed by dyslipidemia and then smoking with higher incidence of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> due to lowered living conditions.

25|$|Intravenous {{drug users}} {{tend to get}} their right-sided heart valves {{infected}} because the veins that are injected drain into {{the right side of}} the heart. In <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> infection occurs on the aortic and the mitral valves on the left side of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Treating {{people who}} have strep throat with antibiotics, such as penicillin, {{decreases}} {{the risk of developing}} rheumatic fever. In order to avoid antibiotic misuse this often involves testing people with sore throats for the infection, which may not be available in the developing world. Other preventive measures include improved sanitation. In those with rheumatic fever and <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> prolonged periods of antibiotics are sometimes recommended. Gradual return to normal activities may occur following an attack. Once RHD develops, treatment is more difficult. Occasionally valve replacement surgery or valve repair is required. Otherwise complications are treated as per normal.|$|E
25|$|Rheumatic fever (RF) is an {{inflammatory}} disease that can involve the heart, joints, skin, and brain. The disease typically develops {{two to four}} weeks after a streptococcal throat infection. Signs and symptoms include fever, multiple painful joints, involuntary muscle movements, and occasionally a characteristic non-itchy rash known as erythema marginatum. The heart is involved in about half of cases. Damage to the heart valves, known as <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (RHD), usually occurs after repeated attacks but can sometimes occur after one. The damaged valves may result in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and infection of the valves.|$|E
40|$|Valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> in Africa affect mainly {{children}} and young adults and are a result of rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a preventable disease, but in Africa the combination of a lack of resources, lack of infrastructure, political, social and economic instability, poverty, overcrowding, malnutrition and lack of political will contributes to the persistence of a high burden of rheumatic fever, <b>rheumatic</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> and infective endocarditis. Combating and eradicating rheumatic fever and <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> requires economic development and implementation of best practices of primary and secondary prevention measures. The barriers to achieving this goal in Africa are numerous, but not insurmountable...|$|R
50|$|According to ICD-10, {{hypertensive}} <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (I11), and its subcategories: hypertensive <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> with <b>heart</b> failure (I11.0) and hypertensive <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> without <b>heart</b> failure (I11.9) are {{distinguished from}} chronic <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (I05-I09), {{other forms of}} <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (I30-I52) and ischemic <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (I20-I25). However, since high blood pressure is {{a risk factor for}} atherosclerosis and ischemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> death rates from hypertensive <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> provide an incomplete measure of the burden of disease due to high blood pressure.|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{conclude}} that hypertension {{was one of the}} most prevalent risk factor that is probably due to the high prevalence of this disease in older patients. There was a high prevalence of cardio-embolic risk factor due to higher <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> in our community which is attributed to low living conditions which make patients more susceptible to have AF and subsequently more incidence of cardio-embolic strokes.|$|R
25|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{the annual}} incidence of infective endocarditis is 3 to 9 cases per 100,000 persons. The male to female case ratio is over 2:1. There is an increased incidence of infective endocarditis in persons 65 {{years of age}} and older, which is probably because people in this age group have a larger number of risk factors for infective endocarditis. In recent years, over one third of infective endocarditis cases in the United States were healthcare-associated. Another trend observed in developed countries is that chronic <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> accounts for <10% of cases. Although a history of valve disease has a significant association with infective endocarditis, 50% of all cases develop in people with no known history of valvular disease.|$|E
25|$|Rheumatic fever {{occurs in}} about 325,000 {{children}} {{each year and}} about 33.4million people currently have <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Those who develop RF are most often {{between the ages of}} 5 and 14, with 20% of first-time attacks occurring in adults. The disease is most common in the developing world and among indigenous peoples in the developed world. In 2015 it resulted in 319,400 deaths down from 374,000 deaths in 1990. Most deaths occur in the developing world where as many as 12.5% of people affected may die each year. Descriptions of the condition are believed to date back to at least the 5th century BCE in the writings of Hippocrates. The disease is so named because its symptoms {{are similar to those of}} some rheumatic disorders.|$|E

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{a common}} arrhythmia in patients with rheumatic mitral and other valve diseases who are candidates for valve repair surgeries. Conversion of rhythm to sinus has positive effects on {{quality of life and}} lower use of medications. The aim of this clinical study was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the radiofrequency ablation Maze III procedure in the treatment of atrial fibrillation associated with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> valve <b>disease.</b> Methods: We applied a modified Cox III Maze procedure using radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation associated with <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> valve <b>disease</b> and evaluated the outcome of 20 patients of atrial fibrillation associated rheumatic valve disease who underwent radiofrequency ablation Maze III procedure plus heart valve surgery. Demographic, echocardiographic, Electrocardiographic and Doppler study data were calculated before surgery, six month and one year after surgery [...] Results: No perioperative deaths occurred in the study group. Duration of additional time for doing radiofrequency ablation was about 22 minutes. Freedom from atrial fibrillation was 85 % and 75 % at six months and one year follow-up respectively [...] .

There was no difference in the frequency of stenosis between the rheumatic and low atherosclerosis groups...|$|R
2500|$|Modified Jones {{criteria}} were {{first published in}} 1944 by T. Duckett Jones, MD. They have been periodically revised by the American Heart Association in collaboration with other groups. According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of rheumatic fever can be made when two of the major criteria, or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of streptococcal infection: elevated or rising antistreptolysin O titre or DNAase. [...] Exceptions are chorea and indolent carditis, each of which by itself can indicate rheumatic fever. [...] An April 2013 review article in the Indian Journal of Medical Research stated that echocardiographic and Doppler (E & D) studies, despite some reservations about their utility, have identified a massive burden of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> which suggests the inadequacy of the 1992 Jones' criteria. [...] E & D studies have identified subclinical carditis in patients with rheumatic fever, {{as well as in}} follow-ups of <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> patients who initially presented as having isolated cases of Sydenham's chorea. Signs of a preceding streptococcal infection include: recent scarlet fever, raised antistreptolysin O or other streptococcal antibody titre, or positive throat culture.|$|E
2500|$|Warfarin {{treatment}} requires frequent (usually monthly) monitoring with a {{blood test}} resulting in a standardized number known as international normalized ratio (INR), often referred to by clinicians as [...] "pro-time"; this determines whether the correct dose is being used. In AF, the usual target INR is between 2.0 and 3.0 (a higher target, INR between 2.5 and 3.5, is used in patients with prior thromboembolism, <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> and mechanical artificial heart valves, many of whom may also have AF). A high INR may indicate increased bleeding risk, while a low INR would indicate that there is insufficient protection from stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Microbial superantigens are {{molecules}} {{expressed by}} bacteria and other microorganisms {{that have the}} power to stimulate a strong immune response by activation of T-cells. These molecules generally have regions that resemble self-antigens that promote a residual autoimmune response – this is the theory of molecular mimicry. Staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens have been characterised in autoimmune diseases – the classical example in post group A streptococcal <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> where there is similarity between M proteins of Streptococcus pyogenes to cardiac myosin and laminin. It has also been shown that up to 70% of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis) are chronic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus, with carriers having an eight times increased risk of relapse.

2500|$|AF {{is linked}} to several forms of {{cardiovascular}} disease, but may occur in otherwise normal hearts. Cardiovascular factors known {{to be associated with}} the development of AF include high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, mitral stenosis (e.g., due to <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> or mitral valve prolapse), mitral regurgitation, left atrial enlargement, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), pericarditis, congenital heart disease, and previous heart surgery. Additionally, lung diseases (such as pneumonia, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, and sarcoidosis) are thought to play a role in certain people. Disorders of breathing during sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are also associated with AF. [...] Obesity is a risk factor for AF. Hyperthyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are associated with AF development. Caffeine consumption does not appear to be associated with AF, but excessive alcohol consumption ("binge drinking" [...] or [...] "holiday heart syndrome") {{is linked to}} AF.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic <b>rheumatic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (RHD) is {{characterized}} by repeated inflammation with fibrinous repair. [...] The cardinal anatomic changes of the valve include leaflet thickening, commissural fusion, and shortening and thickening of the tendinous cords. It is caused by an autoimmune reaction to Group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that results in valvular damage. Fibrosis and scarring of valve leaflets, commissures and cusps leads to abnormalities that can result in valve stenosis or regurgitation. The inflammation caused by rheumatic fever, usually during childhood, {{is referred to as}} rheumatic valvulitis. About half of patients with rheumatic fever develop inflammation involving valvular endothelium. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with rheumatic fever is caused by its destructive effects on cardiac valve tissue. The pathogenesis of RHD is complex and not fully understood, but it is known to involve molecular mimicry and genetic predisposition that lead to autoimmune reactions.|$|E
