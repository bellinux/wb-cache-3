5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was erected}} on a 1.3 ha rocky island called Pulau Satumu, the southernmost {{island off the}} main island of Singapore. Pulau Satumu means [...] "one tree island" [...] - sa refers to satu ("one") and tumu is the Malay name for the large mangrove tree, Bruguiera confugata. The light source was a wick burner which was replaced in 1905 by a pressurised vapour kerosene mantle burner to increase the light intensity for a greater visible range. A 2nd Order optic was mounted on a <b>roller</b> <b>carriage</b> to allow for smooth rotation. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the lens). This <b>roller</b> <b>carriage</b> was a weight-driven machine {{which had to be}} rewound manually to lift the weight whenever it reached the base. The rewinding was done hourly. A crew of seven men was required to man the lighthouse.|$|E
5000|$|Ferdinand Porsche {{developed}} the spring rod <b>roller</b> <b>carriage,</b> the six twinned-up (one inner, one outer per axle) road wheel units comprising the suspension {{on each side}} of the vehicle's hull were joined in pairs, adding up to three twin-road-wheeled unit suspension bogies per side. The 57 to 59 tons combat weight in combination with 640 mm wide [...] "slack-tracks" [...] (KGS 62/640/130) using no return rollers, produced a ground pressure of about 1.06 kg / cm.|$|E

The ferry was then rented to John Beasley from 17 January 1839 for £2 4s 3d (£) per month in order to provide a service whilst the new bridge was constructed.|$|R
50|$|Although roller slides are not self-cleaning, {{they are}} {{suitable}} for environments {{with low levels of}} airborne contaminants such as dirt and dust. As one of the more expensive types of linear slides, roller slides are capable of providing linear motion on more than one axis through stackable slides and double <b>carriages.</b> <b>Roller</b> slides offers line contact versus point contact as with ball bearings, creating a broader contact surface due to the consistency of contact between the carriage and the base and resulting in less erosion.|$|R
50|$|Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman and Mrs. Herman are at {{the local}} county fair. Baby Herman loses his red balloon and Roger goes to get him a new one. Before he returns, however, Baby Herman sees another red balloon at a dart game and goes {{to try to get}} it. When Roger comes back to give Baby his balloon, he finds that he is gone, and the chase begins. Firstly Baby Herman finds himself {{following}} the balloon into a field occupied by a grazing bull. Roger soon follows the youngster, and falls in bull dung. Baby Herman walks directly underneath the bull. He notices a round balloon-like object and grasps it; unknown to him that it was in fact the bull's scrotum. The grazing creature snaps. Roger picks up Baby Herman but just happens to be looking the bull in the eyes. The animal hurls Roger and baby into the air, sending him flying out of the field and the two land crashing into a <b>roller</b> coaster <b>carriage</b> which is traveling slowly up.|$|R
5000|$|Consisting of a {{stationary}} linear base and a moving <b>carriage,</b> <b>roller</b> slides work similarly to ball bearing slides, {{except that the}} bearings housed within the carriage are cylinder-shaped instead of ball shaped. The rollers crisscross each other at a 90° angle and move between the four semi-flat and parallel rods that surround the rollers. The rollers are between [...] "V" [...] grooved bearing races, one being on the top carriage {{and the other on}} the base. The travel of the carriage ends when it meets the end cap, a limiting component. Typically, carriages are constructed from aluminum and the rods and rollers are constructed from steel, while the end caps are constructed from stainless steel.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} robust and {{efficient}} method to design a flap assembly to be resistant to a full scale experimental bird strike in according to the airworthiness certifications. In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including wing track attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the <b>roller</b> <b>carriages,</b> which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty seats. The flap model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by wing, fan cowl and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage). Result overview allows the selection of the bird impact points based on links and composite failure criteria, in particular on the flap tracks metallic attachments, and lower skin and rear spar damage; Result of current work have allowed to establish robust criteria and to define most critical impact points need to be investigated by means of a strike test. Reducing number of shots a two location allow laboratories to perform test bus using of a unique test specimen saving time and cost. The conclusion of this activity is dedicated a comparison of test result performed and relevant analysis. For the two shots strain gauge and force reaction history acquisition will be compared...|$|R
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front <b>rollers</b> of the <b>carriage,</b> down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to create a}} {{software}} tool to unwrap digital images of cylindrical rock cores and also to create a tool to measure the accuracy of the unwrapping transform. Measurements of an object can be taken directly from an image if the object is planar and the image plane of the camera is perpendicular to the object. If these conditions are met then picture scale allows a user to relate measurements in the image to a real world coordinate system after correcting for radial distortion. But if the object in the image is not planar or is not perpendicular to the image plane then additional corrections or geometric transformations must be applied to the object in the image. The project is focused on creating a coded software solution, using digital images from an off the shelf-camera, to transform or unwrap single images of cylindrical rock cores so that all objects in the image are co-planar. In addition to tools created to unwrap digital images a second software tool was created to verify the accuracy of the unwrapping software. The project is broken down into three major components. The first is a technique for taking pictures of rock core, or image acquisition. A single rock core is wrapped with a paper grid pattern that is used to determine a pixel scale for a series of images of a rock core sample. The grid wrapped core is placed in a carriage made of a set of two <b>rollers.</b> This <b>carriage</b> is then centered below a camera that is remotely controlled from a desktop computer. Two halogen lights are used to evenly illuminate the surface of the core and an image is taken. Once the grid pattern is photographed the pattern is removed and a series of images of the outer surface of the core are taken. The next phase of the unwrapping is to take the original image and pass it through a series of software modules that will assist the user to perform a rectification of the original images. First the scale of each pixel in the image is found using images of the original grid pattern wrapped around the core. Next the core itself is isolated from other background objects present in each image. Then a geometric transform is applied to the image of the core, using the unique pixel scale, with the goal to unwrap each image so that all objects in the image are co-planar and no longer suffer any distortion. In order to measure the effectiveness of this transform on rectifying all areas of the image, a second software tool was created. This software tool allows the user the ability to measure the spacing of gridlines in the original image of the grid wrapped core and compare these measurements to the same image after it has been unwrapped. The code returns a database of measurements for every gridline present in a image as well as different plots of the data for the user to make final conclusions as to the effectiveness of unwrapping on each area of the core images...|$|R
