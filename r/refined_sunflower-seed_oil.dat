40|$|The {{potential}} benefits {{on human health}} have prompted an interest in developing nutritional strategies for specifically increasing rumenic acid (RA) in ruminant milk. The aims {{of the present study}} were to (i) compare two dietary treatments with lipid supplements on milk yield and composition, (ii) measure the in vivo Delta-desaturation of vaccenic acid (VA) to RA using (13) C-labelled VA and (iii) determine the effect of the dietary treatments on this variable. Treatments were 90 g <b>sunflower-seed</b> <b>oil</b> (SO) per d or 60 g <b>sunflower-seed</b> <b>oil</b> and 30 g fish oil per d plus additional starch (SFO), in a grassland hay-based diet given to eight Alpine goats in a 2 x 2 cross-over design with 21 d experimental periods. Milk yield and composition were similar between treatments. Goats fed SFO had higher milk 6 : 0 - 16 : 0 concentration, lower milk Sigma C 18 concentrations and showed no effect on milk VA and RA, compared with SO. At the end of the experiment, intravenous injection of 1. 5 g [(13) C]VA followed by measurements of milk lipid (13) C enrichment showed that in vivo 31. 7 and 316 % of VA was Delta 9 -desaturated into milk RA in the caprine with the SO and SFO treatments, respectively.

40|$|Lipid in {{the diet}} is known to enhance milk fat {{secretion}} and alter milk fatty acid composition in lactating goats. In the current experiment, the contribution of peripheral tissue and mammary gland lipid metabolism to changes in milk fat composition from plant oils was examined. Fourteen Alpine goats in midlactation were used in a 3 x 3 Latin square design with 28 -d experimental periods. Treatments comprised maize silage-based diets containing no additional <b>oil</b> (M), <b>sunflower-seed</b> <b>oil</b> (MSO; 6. 1 % of diet DM), or linseed oil (MLO; 6. 2 % of diet DM). Compared with the control, milk yield was greater in goats fed MSO (3. 37 and 3. 62 kg/d, respectively), whereas MLO enhanced milk fat content (+ 3. 9 g/kg), resulting in a 14 % increase in milk fat secretion. Both MSO and MLO increased milk lactose secretion by 12 and 8 %, respectively, compared with M. Relative to the control, plant oils decreased C 10 to C 16 secretion (32 and 24 %, respectively, for MSO and MLO) and enhanced C 18 output in milk (ca. 110 %). Diets MSO and MLO increased cis- 9 18 : 1 secretion in milk by 25 and 31 %, respectively, compared with M. The outputs of trans- 11 18 : 1 and cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 in milk were increased 8. 34 - and 6. 02 -fold for MSO and 5. 58 - and 3. 71 -fold for MLO compared with M, and MSO increased trans- 10 18 : 1 and trans- 10, cis- 12 18 : 2 secretion. Plant oils decreased milk fat cis- 9 14 : 1 / 14 : 0; cis- 9 16 : 1 / 16 : 0; cis- 9 18 : 1 / 18 : 0; and cis- 9, trans- 11 18 : 2 /trans- 11 18 : 1 concentration ratios but {{had no effect on}} mammary stearoyl-CoA desaturase mRNA or activity. Furthermore, changes in milk fatty acid secretion were not associated with alterations in mammary acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA and activity, abundance of mRNA encoding for lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid synthase, or malic enzyme and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity in mammary tissue. Mammary lipoprotein lipase activity was increased with MSO relative to MLO.

Obese adults at risk of future coronary disease have impaired HRV and may benefit from these interventions. We evaluated the effect of DHA-rich tuna fish oil supplementation with and without regular exercise on HRV in sedentary, overweight adults with risk factors for coronary disease. In a randomised, double-blind, parallel comparison, sixty-five volunteers consumed 6 g fish oil/d (DHA 1 · 56 g/d, EPA 0 · 36 g/d) or <b>sunflower-seed</b> <b>oil</b> (placebo) for 12 weeks. Half of each oil group also undertook regular moderate physical activity (3 d/week for 45 min, at 75 % of age-predicted maximal heart rate (HR)). Resting HR and the HR response to submaximal exercise were measured at weeks 0, 6 and 12. In forty-six subjects, HRV was also assessed by power spectrum analysis of 20 min electrocardiogram recordings taken supine at baseline and 12 weeks. Fish oil supplementation improved HRV by increasing high-frequency power, representing parasympathetic activity, compared with placebo (P = 0 · 01; oil x time interaction). It also reduced HR at rest and during submaximal exercise (P = 0 · 008; oil x time interaction). There were no significant fish oil x exercise interactions.

Administration of 2 % (w/w) cholesterol in the rat diet inhibited hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity, and this inhibition was much more pronounced when cholesterol was fed in combination with unsaturated rather than with saturated fat. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was increased by all the high-cholesterol diets and inhibited by both the high-fat diets. Cholesterol esterification, as assessed by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity, was enhanced after unsaturated-fat feeding. Cholesterol supplement, without any added fat, failed to elicit any significant increase in ACAT activity, whereas consumption of cholesterol in combination with unsaturated fat led to the greatest increase in ACAT activity. After cholesterol feeding, C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 2 fatty acids in the microsomal phospholipids were increased, with concomitant decreases in C 18 : 0, C 20 : 4 and C 22 : 6 fatty acids, leading to an overall decrease in membrane unsaturation, irrespective of the particular fat supplement. It can be concluded that the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and the enhancement of cholesterol utilization, either by increased bile formation or by increased cholesterol esterification, after cholesterol feeding, may not be enough to prevent cholesterol accumulation in the microsomal membranes. Then, to compensate for the altered fluidity resulting from cholesterol enrichment, the unsaturation of membrane phospholipids is decreased, which would in turn have an effect on membrane lipid fluidity opposite to that of increased cholesterol...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{potential}} benefits of cis- 9, trans- 11 -conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) for human health there is interest in developing sustainable nutritional strategies for enhancing the concentration of this fatty acid in ruminant-derived foods. Most evidence to date suggests that endogenous synthesis is the major source of cis- 9, trans- 11 in milk fat and ruminal outflow is limited and largely independent of dietary 18 : 2 n- 6 supply. Four lactating cows fitted with a rumen cannula were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square with 14 d experimental periods {{to examine the effects of}} <b>sunflower-seed</b> <b>oil</b> (SFO) as a source of 18 : 2 n- 6 on ruminal lipid metabolism. Cows were offered grass silage-based diets supplemented with 0, 250, 500 or 750 g SFO/d. Supplements of SFO had no effect on DM intake, milk fat or protein secretion, but increased linearly (P < 0. 01) milk yield and milk lactose output and shifted (P < 0. 001) rumen fermentation towards propionate at the expense of acetate. SFO supplements increased linearly (P < 0. 05) the flow of 18 : 0, 18 : 1, 18 : 2 n- 6 and total CLA at the omasum and enhanced ruminal cis- 9 - 18 : 1, 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3 metabolism.

Plant oil supplements decreased (P< 0 ? 05) mammary stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity but had no effect on SCD mRNA. Treatments had no effect on glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity, or mRNA abundance and/or activity of lipoprotein lipase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in mammary, hepatic or adipose tissue. The results provided little support for milk fatty acid secretion responses to HLO and HSO being mediated via changes in mammary, hepatic or adipose mRNA abundance or in the activity of key lipogenic enzymes.

The high-fat diets markedly reduced non-fasting-rat serum triacylglycerol {{as compared with the}} low-fat reference, and the highest reduction (85 %) was observed with the fish-oil group, which was significantly lower than that of the other high-fat diets. The serum concentration of phospholipids was significantly reduced (30 %) only in the fish-oil-fed animals, whereas serum non-esterified fatty acids were reduced 40 - 50 % by both the fish-oil- and linseed-oil-fed groups. The liver content of triacylglycerol showed a 1. 7 -fold increase with the fish-oil diet and 2 - 2. 5 -fold with the other dietary groups when compared with rats fed a low-fat diet, whereas the hepatic content of phospholipids was unchanged. Peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (acyl-CoA oxidase) was 2 -fold increased for the rats fed fish oil; however this was not significantly higher when comparison was made with rats fed the linseed-oil diet. There was no difference in phosphatidate hydrolysis (microsomal and cytosolic fractions) among animals fed the various diets. Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was increased by all high-fat diets, but the fish-oil-diet-fed group showed a significantly lower enzyme activity than did rats fed the other high-fat diets. A linear correlation between acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity and liver triacylglycerol was observed, and the microsomal enzyme activity was decreased 40 - 50 % by incubation in the presence of eicosapentaenoyl-CoA. CoA derivatives of arachidonic, linolenic and linoleic acid had no inhibitory effect when compared with the control. These results indicate that dietary fish oil may have greater triacylglycerol-lowering effect than other polyunsaturated diets, owing to decreased triacylglycerol synthesis caused by inhibition of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase. In addition, increased peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation and decreased availability of non-esterified fatty acids could also contribute by decreasing the amounts of fatty acids as substrates for triacylglycerol synthesis and secretion...|$|R

Rapeseed oil in the diet was associated with the enrichment of trans 18 : 1 (? 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9), cis- 9 18 : 1, and trans- 7,cis- 9 CLA, SFO resulted in the highest concentrations of trans- 5, trans- 10, and trans- 11 18 : 1, ? 9, 11 CLA, ? 10, 12 CLA, and 18 : 2 n- 6, whereas CO enhanced trans- 13 - 16 18 : 1, ? 11, 15 18 : 2, ? 12, 15 18 : 2, cis- 9,trans- 13 18 : 2, ? 11, 13 CLA, ? 12, 14 CLA, ? 13, 15 CLA, ? 9, 11, 15 18 : 3, and 18 : 3 n- 3. Relative to CO, CE resulted in lower 18 : 0 and cis- 9 18 : 1 concentrations and higher proportions of trans- 10 18 : 1, trans- 11 18 : 1, cis- 9,trans- 11 CLA, cis- 9,trans- 13 18 : 2, and trans- 11,cis- 15 18 : 2. Comparison of milk fat composition responses to CO and CE suggest that the biohydrogenation of unsaturated 18 -carbon fatty acids to 18 : 0 in the rumen was less complete for camelina lipid supplied as an expeller than as free oil. In conclusion, moderate amounts of plant oils in diets based on red clover silage had no adverse effects on silage dry matter intake, nutrient digestion, or milk production, but altered milk fat composition, with changes characterized as a decrease in saturated fatty acids, an increase in trans fatty acids, and enrichment of specific unsaturated fatty acids depending on the fatty acid composition of lipid supplements.
