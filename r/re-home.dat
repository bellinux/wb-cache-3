25|$|A {{number of}} other {{countries}} have breed-specific legislation on the books. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) restricts the ownership of pit-bull type dogs and other breeds. In May 2010, a pit-bull type dog named Lennox was impounded from his disabled owner and deemed to be {{a danger to the}} public by authorities in Belfast, Northern Ireland, under the Dangerous Dogs (NI) Order 1991. The impoundment and subsequent court order to destroy Lennox sparked a two-year-long legal battle and heated public relations campaign over the fate of the dog that included an international letter-writing and social media campaign; a petition signed by more than 214,000 people worldwide; street protests in Belfast, London, and New York City; public appeals from celebrities like the boxer Lennox Lewis and the First Minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson; and threatening letters and acts of violence directed at some of Belfast's dog wardens. Dog trainer and international television celebrity Victoria Stilwell campaigned to save Lennox's life, appealing to the Belfast City Council and Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle O'Neill to allow her to <b>re-home</b> Lennox in the United States, where several rescue organizations had offered him sanctuary. All appeals, including Stilwell's were ignored by Belfast City Councillors, and Lennox was euthanised on July 11, 2012. Belfast City Council declined to return Lennox's body, his collar, or his ashes to his family.|$|E
500|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{received}} a public backlash on Twitter after the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) recommended {{that they should}} cull three red river hog piglets after an unplanned birth. A protest took place under the #savethehogs tag on Thursday 3 February 2011. The Twitter campaign was started by OneKind, with major support from Captive Animals Protection Society. On Friday 4 February 2011, {{it was announced that}} the #savethehogs campaign had been successful and the zoo would attempt to <b>re-home</b> the piglets. The zoo also came under criticism for plans to charge £20 per person for visitors to watch the necropsy of an animal. A OneKind spokesman criticised the idea, largely due to the timing of the event, which was scheduled to take place two months after the zoo announced a £2 million loss in profits, making the necropsy seem like a [...] "Money-making drive".|$|E

By 1987, Jim Cronin set up Monkey World and was able <b>re-home</b> the Templers' chimpanzees and given them all a permanent, safe home at Monkey World.

50|$|Cronin {{could hardly}} believe that his small refuge centre had grown into a {{thriving}} rescue centre for primates from around the world. Monkey World worked with the Ping Tung Rescue Centre in Taiwan in stopping the illegal smuggling of apes from the wild, and Monkey World was able to <b>re-home</b> some of the primates from the Ping Tung Rescue Centre, including Bornean orang-utans and different species of gibbon. Monkey World started working with foreign governments {{in the prevention of}} primate smuggling for pet trades, including the pet trade in Britain which allowed citizens to keep exotic small monkeys without being able to care for them properly or meet their substantial needs. Cronin and Alison travelled to places around the world, investigating animal trades, especially the trade and exploitation of primates.|$|E

Although older generations of Zygons were committed to integration with human communities, the younger generations resented being forced to live as humans and quickly radicalised.

Town were an amateur club and were wound down in 1937 to begin a professional club for Colchester that would be known Colchester United, as the new club moved into Town's Layer Road ground. With an ageing stadium, throughout the 1970s to the mid-2000s, Colchester United and Colchester Borough Council had been looking to <b>re-home</b> the club. Attention was first brought {{to the idea of}} relocation during the 1970s, when club chairman Maurice Cadman announced that Layer Road required £280,000 of basic improvements to meet the required safety legislation of the time. When the ground was purchased from the Council in 1971, a covenant was placed on Layer Road that the site could not be sold to be developed as housing. Potential resolutions for the problem included moving the pitch and building a new main stand, but proved to be too expensive for the club's ailing finances. The plans would have created an 'adequately' sized stadium with an 18,000 capacity, though the season ended with an average of just 3,818 in attendance.|$|E

40|$|When {{dogs and}} cats are not {{retained}} in a home, they are re-homed to somewhere, and {{while there is a}} collection of research around relinquishment to shelters, {{little is known about the}} general re-homing picture. A cross sectional random digit dial survey was conducted with an aim to learn more about who is re-homing, where they are re-homing and why they are re-homing owned {{dogs and cats}} in the US. We found the prevalence of re-homing in five years at 6 % making for an estimated 6. 12 million household re-homing pets every five years. Pets were most likely to be re-homed by being given to a friend or family member (37 %) closely followed by being taken to a shelter. Those who re-homed due to a reason related to the pet as opposed to reasons such as family issues were more likely to <b>re-home</b> to a shelter. For respondents who rented, housing reasons were the number one reason for re-homing, and for respondents of lower income, they were significantly more likely to <b>re-home</b> due to cost and housing issues as opposed to pet related issues. We conclude that some reasons for re-homing are not easily modified and humane re-homing is the best option, but that there are many areas in which intervention and prevention programs may increase retention...|$|E
40|$|Panel 26 Curating Southeast Asia - Session 2 : Repatriation Lecture summary: Apa Jika, The Mis-Placed Comma “When men die, {{they enter}} into history. When statues die they enter into art. This botany {{of death is}} what we call culture. ” (Statues Also Die, Resnais et al. 1953). Taking as a {{starting}} point the opening lines of the film Statues Also Die, the presentation uses the figure of a forgotten Malay weaver, Halimah Binti Abdullah, who participated in the 1924 Empire Exhibition in Wembley. A minor figure in the exhibition histories of Malaya, she exists as a series of footnotes, gaining historical attention only for the act of a premature or untimely death, in London and away from home. Her remains are located in an unmarked grave in Brockwood, Woking. The product of her labour may potentially be amongst the collections held at the Victoria & Albert Museum, and an incomplete textile on an incomplete loom may hold the record to her last creative act. The presentation explores Halimah’s status as both object and subject, and the possible forms of repatriation that might occur in the re-use and re- visiting of a minor historical figure, through the appropriating acts of an artist today. Apa Jika, The Mis-Placed Comma is a film commission for the National Gallery Singapore. Initiated as part of the Gallery’s inaugural launch in 2015, the work seeks a symbolic ‘repatriation’ of Halimah, (and of weaving and pre-colonial cultural production) attempting to insert her into the discourses of modernity that have so far excluded her. Finding a ‘home’ for Halimah, or a mechanism to <b>re-home</b> her becomes the focus of the art work and The National Gallery Singapore becomes a strategic site in which to do this. The question as to her status as exhibition object (statue/art) or historic subject (men/history) returns us to the quote above and questions the repatriation endeavour...|$|E
