2500|$|The {{original}} {{choice of}} [...] height for ISO containers {{was made in}} part to suit {{a large proportion of}} railway tunnels, though some had to be modified. [...] The current standard is [...] high. With the arrival of even taller hi-cube containers at [...] and double stacking rail cars, further enlargement of the <b>rail</b> <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> is proving necessary.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{has had to}} {{be reduced}} in height {{to comply with the}} current Network <b>Rail</b> <b>loading</b> <b>gauge,</b> and a shorter chimney was therefore made and fitted. This adversely affected draughting. A new design of blastpipe with four nozzles was designed and fitted in 2016 and early indications are that it has been effective. The other preserved [...] "King" [...] class locomotives have double chimneys and therefore it was not possible simply to use the same proven blastpipe and chimney arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Several {{proposal}} {{have been}} made for the modernization of line, proposing alternately either switching the line to standard tram rolling stock and eventually integrating with the Warsaw Tramway system or rebuilding the line to standard <b>rail</b> <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and converting to 3 kV electrification system in order to integrate it with the national rail network. Additionally plans have been prepared for moving the final station of the line in Warsaw to Rondo Dmowskiego at Marszałkowska Street {{in order to facilitate}} easier transfers to the Centrum station on the city's first metro line and to build the line between Komorów and Nadarzyn, however as of 2011 no funds have been allocated towards any of those.|$|E
50|$|The {{test track}} {{includes}} short sections of non-energised 25 kV AC railway electrification and non-energised third/fourth <b>rail,</b> a W6A <b>loading</b> <b>gauge,</b> and facilities for ERA Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) noise testing.|$|R
50|$|The first lines built, linking Caen {{with the}} coast used 15 kg/m <b>rails.</b> The <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> allowed a width of 1.88 m and height of 2.80 m. Gradients {{were to be}} no steeper than 30mm/m (1 in 33). Trains were to be {{restricted}} to 20 km/h with a maximum length of 60 m. Later lines were built with rails of 18 or 20 kg/m and the earlier lines were upgraded in the 1930s. Many of the lines were laid alongside roads or canals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heavy duty}} [...] narrow-gauge {{railways}} in Australia (e.g. Queensland), South Africa, and New Zealand show {{that if the}} track is built to a heavy-duty standard, performance {{almost as good as}} a standard gauge line is possible. Some 200-car trains operate on the Sishen-Saldanha railway in South Africa, and high-speed tilt-trains run in Queensland. Another example of a heavy-duty narrow-gauge line is EFVM in Brazil. [...] gauge, it has over-100-pound <b>rail</b> (...) and a <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> almost as large as US nonexcess-height lines. It has multiple [...] locomotives and 200+ car trains. In South Africa and New Zealand, the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> is similar to the restricted British <b>loading</b> <b>gauge,</b> and in New Zealand some British Rail Mark 2 carriages have been rebuilt with new bogies for use by Tranz Scenic (Wellington-Palmerston North service), Tranz Metro (Wellington-Masterton service), and Transdev Auckland (Auckland suburban services).|$|R
50|$|The Transnet Freight <b>Rail</b> <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> {{specification}} {{which had}} been submitted during the tender phase when only the Euro Dual electro-diesel locomotive was being considered in {{the scope of the}} contract, was one which made special allowance for the pantographs on electric locomotives to exceed the actual maximum height of 3965 mm. The loading gauge specification for diesel-electric locomotives and other rail vehicles, specifying a maximum height of 3965 mm above the railhead, was submitted to the manufacturer in October 2013 after the locomotive design was completed. The two loading gauge versions are identical in respect of roof profile and height, and differ only in respect of the special provision for the pantographs on electric locomotives to exceed the prescribed maximum height.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the 1991 route was updated - Sloane Square {{was dropped}} and the Central line's Epping branch from Leytonstone was re-safeguarded. Due to {{objections}} from residents of Sloane Square, it was reinstated the following year. South West Trains' Wimbledon depot was safeguarded as a depot for the line. The safeguarding was enlarged from tube gauge to Network <b>Rail</b> <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> {{as it became}} clear that larger and longer trains would be needed. Of the three routes proposed for south-west London the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea initially favoured one going south via Imperial Wharf to Clapham Junction, but now supports the takeover of the District line's Wimbledon branch. Under these present plans, only one entirely new station would be constructed, at Chelsea.|$|E
5000|$|Rail {{access to}} the {{terminal}} is via connection to the Tilbury Loop of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway line. On site 25 km of double track access accommodates trains of up to 35 wagons long (750 m, which are loaded/unloaded next to the port container handling areas. Rail logistics partners DB Schenker Rail (UK) (now DB Cargo) and Freightliner are running intermodal trains {{on a daily basis}} via [...] and [...] to the West Coast Main Line. Network Rail have cleared all trains on this route to <b>rail</b> <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> W10, the same as the connecting rail access route to the Channel Tunnel, allowing 9 ft high containers to be transported. The East Coast Main Line connection to serve [...] and [...] carries a smaller W8 loading gauge clearance, requiring the use of specially designed low-liner wagons to accommodate the taller containers.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the NSW <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> just happens to allow for double decker trains in Sydney, while the Victorian <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> (in this populous city), {{which is similar to}} Swedish SE-A <b>loading</b> <b>gauge,</b> is not quite tall enough to allow for double deck trains in Melbourne (except for one {{experimental}} train).|$|R

50|$|The European (Berne) <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> {{is usually}} 3150 mm wide by 3,175 mm rising to 4280 mm in the centre. This is a {{clearance}} envelope (see <b>loading</b> <b>gauge)</b> on a curve of 250 m radius.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to making {{best use of}} the loading area {{there has been a}} trend towards large-volume wagons, which make maximum use of the available <b>loading</b> <b>gauge.</b> However they need to take account of the fact that in many countries the permitted <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> varies and this reduces the interoperability of this vehicle. The wagons cleared for use in Great Britain have a very small <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and are distinguished bo the code letters f, ff or fff. Other countries with small <b>loading</b> <b>gauges</b> include Switzerland, something which needs to be borne in mind for trains transiting the country e.g. between Germany and Italy.|$|R
50|$|The terms {{structure}} <b>gauge</b> and <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> {{have little}} connection with track gauge. They are both widely used, but imprecise, terms. Structure gauge describes the cross-section envelope into which new or altered structures (bridges, lineside equipment etc.) must not encroach. <b>Loading</b> <b>gauge</b> is the corresponding cross-sectional profile within which rail vehicles and their loads must be contained. If an exceptional load {{or a new}} type of vehicle is being assessed to run, it must conform to the route's <b>loading</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Developments in {{high-speed}} rail from the 1970s mean that ballast depths have increased, {{resulting in a}} present decrease in UK pan-network <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> height. This has recently started to be reversed {{with the introduction of}} pan-European <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> standards on some mainlines, mainly originating from ports. The present result of these civil engineering changes is that an original height King locomotive would not pass through various points of the modern Network Rail system, designed to a <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> height of 13 ft.|$|R
5000|$|... The small {{structure}} gauges {{and consequently}} small <b>loading</b> <b>gauges</b> on British railways mean that double stacking {{is not possible}} and that well cars are required {{to be able to}} transport 9 ft high intermodal containers on routes where the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> is W9 or smaller.|$|R
25|$|Limit of boiler {{diameter}}: The boiler {{and water}} tanks must fit within the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> of the railway being run on. Above a certain diameter of boiler {{there is little}} or no room for water tanks to be added and still fit within the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{difference}} between the structure <b>gauge</b> and the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> is called the [...] "clearance". The amount of clearance between the <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> and the structure gauge depends on {{the speed of the}} train, due to the train wobbling, so a train {{may be able to get}} past a restricted clearance by travelling at slow speed.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> {{can also}} {{refer to a}} {{physical}} structure, sometimes using electronic detectors using light beams on an arm or gantry placed over the exit lines of goods yards or at the entry point to a restricted part of a network. The devices ensure that loads stacked on open or flat wagons stay within the height/shape limits of the line's bridges and tunnels and prevent out-of-gauge rolling stock entering a region with a smaller <b>loading</b> <b>gauge.</b> Compliance with a <b>loading</b> <b>gauge</b> can be checked with a clearance car which in the past were simple wooden frames or physical feelers mounted on rolling stock. More recently lasers are used.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{rail line}} between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was opened on January 31, 1862.

Russian trains could not have used the Finnish rail network due to a narrower <b>load</b> <b>gauge.</b> Later the Finnish <b>load</b> <b>gauge</b> was widened to match the Russian <b>load</b> <b>gauge,</b> with hundreds of station platforms or tracks moved further apart from each other.|$|R
