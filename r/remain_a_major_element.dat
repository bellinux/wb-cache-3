40|$|Defense budgets in Japan {{have been}} {{complicated}} compromises from numerous inputs - including threat perceptions, domestic industrial/technological base development, {{support for the}} bilateral security treaty with the United States and internal bureaucratic politics - but {{with the fall of}} the former Soviet Union, the clearest justification for higher spending disappeared. Double-digit defense spending increases that were common in the 1980 s have been replaced by annual increases lower than present inflation rates, resulting in negative real growth in the country's defense budget. Domestic economic problems and consistent government pressures for smaller budgets have further slowed annual growth in total spending and have contributed to lower procurement budgets. As a result, the domestic Japanese defense industry is facing far more constrained conditions from the growth years of a decade before. Government policymakers are examining Japan's regional security environment as well as its alliance with the United States to determine the appropriate course for the country to take in the coming years. The formal security treaty with the United States is likely to <b>remain</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>element</b> of government positions, but other aspects of the country's overall security posture are open to debate. Perceptions of a reduced threat environment are fueling additional pressures for defense budget cuts. The domestic defense industry seeks means to assure its survival in domestic defense markets in this constrained environment. Expansion into overseas markets to offset declining domestic markets is an option that currently is constrained by policy restrictions on arms exports. Industry is advocating re-examination of those policies and unlike earlier years, government appears willing to respond positively but cautiously to this lobbying.

The establishment <b>remained</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>element</b> in the economy of Thurso and Caithness until 1994 when the government ordered that the reactors be closed for good; a large workforce employed in the clean-up of the site (which is scheduled to continue until at least 2025) remains.|$|R
50|$|The Riverside {{area was}} {{connected}} to nearby downtown Miami by the 12th Street (later Flagler Street) bridge, which opened as a toll-roadway in 1905. The tolls were steep for the time: 10 cents for a pedestrian: 25 cents for a horse-drawn cart. In 1909, the City of Miami purchased the facility and removed the tolls. Broad Flagler Street was the area’s most important thoroughfare. A Flagler Street trolley began operating in 1915, carrying passengers as far west as S.W. 12th Avenue. Businesses and splendid homes arose along both sides of Flagler Street in the early 1900s. Prominent Miamians’s of the era lived in the Riverside area. By the 1930s, Riverside’s population was changing. Increasing number of Jews moved into the area, {{and many of their}} businesses, professional offices, and institutions accompanied them. The Jewish presence continued to grow, and <b>remained</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>element</b> of the population until the late 1950s, when an era of postwar prosperity brought another housing boom to Greater Miami. The boom prompted many Riverside residents to suburban developments throughout Dade County.|$|R
40|$|The 5 -module JISC KeepIt {{course on}} Digital Preservation Tools for Repository Managers was {{designed}} by repository managers. Each module consists of a mix of short presentations and hands-on exercises {{to learn about the}} basics and gain practice with each of the tools covered. Module 4 puts storage, format management and preservation planning in the repository, by making such functions available from within the familiar repository interface. Hitchcock's introduction briefly reviews the previous module, which acted as a primer on preservation workflow, formats and characterisation, as preparation for the preservation planning tools to be encountered in this module. This leads into an extensive practical tutorial on logical and bit-stream preservation using Plato (a preservation planning tool) and EPrints (software for creating digital repositories), which Rauber introduces with a rapid recap on the principles and reasons for digital preservation. Moving on to EPrints, Field presents a new 'hybrid' storage controller for EPrints providing selectable storage options locally and in the cloud. EPrints v 3. 2 introduces an abstracted storage layer which provides the ability for data hosting services such as Amazon S 3 {{to be used as a}} storage back-end to EPrints. An accompanying tutorial leads users through some of the storage interfaces that EPrints can use, and also shows how to modify the storage policies. Tarrant places the process of managing formats and risk analysis in the EPrints repository interface. Another supporting exercise gives practical experience with the assignment of risk analysis scores to the discovered file formats to aid in digital preservation decisions. In this activity users are presented with a set of test files, a series of scanned images, for use throughout the <b>remaining</b> exercises. In <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>element</b> of this tutorial Rauber and Kulovits review preservation planning workflow, showing how to identify requirements using a mindmap approach and then how to upload the output to Plato, the preservation planning tool, to run experiments and produce results. Two exercises are outlined for users in the final 5 slides of the presentation, to describe the collection of test files provided previously, using the mindmap to define the requirements and to create the plan using Plato. The module completes with an exercise on preservation action (see document, no presentation slides), migrating selected files to new formats as identified in the plan. The preservation plan is uploaded to EPrints to act on the test files, displaying the results in an EPrints interface, also providing the means to review the preservation actions. Materials here include all presentations and supplementary materials to support the practicals, so the full course module can be experienced by other users...|$|R

They <b>remained</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> characteristic of United States trade with Japan. VERs are actions by foreign producers, often in conjunction with their governments, to limit exports to certain international markets. They sometimes take the form of unilateral declarations by exporters designed to reduce the possibility of restrictive action by importing countries. Often VERs are joint declarations by exporting and importing countries negotiated as part of bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings to control imports...|$|R
