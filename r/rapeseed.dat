The oil point position on the deformation curve, that is, the first leakage of oil from the pressing vessel of the various oilseeds was determined and compared. Based on the measured amounts <b>rapeseeds</b> achieved the highest values followed by jatropha seed and then sunflower seed.

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting <b>rapeseed</b> oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, <b>rapeseed,</b> walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{supercritical}} {{oil extraction}} from oleaginous seeds (sunflower and <b>rapeseeds)</b> is presented here through experimental and modelling results. The experimental setup allows an accurate following {{of the mass}} of the oil extracted and to derive the experimental influences of pressure, temperature and supercritical CO 2 flowrate on the extraction curves. These parameters are very sensitive and highlight the necessity of precise optimisation of experimental conditions. In order to complete the behaviour of supercritical fluids extraction, an improved modelling is proposed. The modelling basic equations are based on others modelling published previously. In this work, the determination of several parameters comes from correlations and the other constants are fitted with all the experimental results. Thus the modelling is more representative and predictive as other ones. The modelling results present a good agreement with the experimental results, and hence it can be used for the dimensioning of some extraction autoclaves...|$|R

40|$|Modelling joint {{distribution}} of crop plant yields and prices {{with use of}} a copula function Abstract. The paper constitutes an attempt at modelling the {{joint distribution}} of crop plant yields and prices in Poland. The main objective of the paper {{was to examine the}} usefulness of the copula function for the task and the selection of suitable marginal distributions. The fit of a joint distribution based copula function was compared with multivariate normal distribution. It was revealed that the multivariate normal distribution is outperformed by a Gaussian copula with the following marginal distribution: yields of both crop plants – normal distribution, price of wheat – Burr distribution (type XII) and price of <b>rapeseeds</b> – lognormal distribution. The main advantages of the copula function were: the possibility to use different marginal distributions and ability to model non-elliptical two-dimensional distributions. The practical implications of choosing the right joint distribution is demonstrated by comparing empirical quantiles of income for a given crop structure with theoretical quantiles based on the proposed joint distributions.

40|$|Development of Brassica napus L. cv Tower embryos of {{different}} ages cultured in vitro with and without abscisic acid (ABA) was compared with normal development in situ to investigate the role of ABA in embryo maturation. Endogenous ABA levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and sensitivity to ABA was assayed {{in terms of its}} ability to suppress precocious germination and stimulate accumulation of storage protein and storage protein mRNA. During development in situ, the levels of endogenous ABA and 12 S storage protein mRNA both reach their peaks just before the embryos begin to desiccate. The ABA levels during this phase of development also correlate with the time required in culture before germination is evident. Following these peaks, increasing concentrations of exogenous ABA are required to both suppress germination and continue storage protein accumulation in vitro. Thus, both endogenous ABA and ABA sensitivity decline during maturation. The concentrations of exogenous ABA required to suppress germination at these later stages result in abnormally high levels of endogenous ABA and appear to be toxic. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in maturing <b>rapeseeds,</b> low water content rather than ABA prevents germination during the later stages of development...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel is {{a notable}} {{alternative}} to the widely used petroleum-derived diesel fuel since it can be generated by domestic natural sources such as soybeans, <b>rapeseeds,</b> coconuts, and even recycled cooking oil, and thus reduces dependence on diminishing petroleum fuel from foreign sources. The injection and atomization characteristics of the vegetable oils are significantly different than those of petroleum-derived diesel fuels, mainly {{as the result of}} their high viscosities. Modern diesel engines have fuel-injection system that is sensitive to viscosity change. One way to avoid these problems is to reduce fuel viscosity of vegetable oil in order to improve its performance. The conversion of vegetable oils into biodiesel is an effective way to overcome all the problems associated with the vegetable oils. Dilution, micro-emulsification, pyrolysis, and transesterification are the four techniques applied to solve the problems encountered with the high fuel viscosity. Transesterification is the most common method and leads to monoalkyl esters of vegetable oils and fats, now called biodiesel when used for fuel purposes. The methyl ester produced by transesterification of vegetable oil has a high cetane number, low viscosity and improved heating value compared to those of pure vegetable oil which results in shorter ignition delay and longer combustion duration and hence low particulate emissions.
