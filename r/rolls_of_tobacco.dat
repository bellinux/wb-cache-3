60|$|But as abused {{prosperity}} is oftentimes {{made the}} very means {{of our greatest}} adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next year with great success in my plantation: I raised fifty great <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> on my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my neighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundred weight, were well cured and laid by against {{the return of the}} fleet from Lisbon.

60|$|After a {{few days}} farther conference with this ancient friend, be brought me {{an account of the}} six first years income of my plantation, signed by my partner, and the merchants' trustees, being always {{delivered}} in goods; viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c. which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this account, that every year the income considerably increased: but, as above, the disbursement being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old man let me see, that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar, and fifteen double <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> which were lost in his ship, he having been shipwrecked coming home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my leaving the place.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a letter}} of my partner’s, congratulating me very affectionately upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved, and what it {{produced}} a year; with the particulars {{of the number of}} squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he had said so many Ave Marias to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of my own, and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver my effects if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of his friendship, and that of his family; and sent me as a present seven fine leopards’ skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by some other ship that he had sent thither, and which, it seems, had made a better voyage than I. He sent me also five chests of excellent sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as moidores. By the same fleet my two merchant-trustees shipped me one thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> {{and the rest of the}} whole account in gold.|$|E

5000|$|A cigar is {{a tightly}} rolled bundle of dried and {{fermented}} tobacco which is ignited {{so that its}} smoke may be drawn into the smoker's mouth and expelled; thus the cigar is generally [...] "puffed on" [...] (like a tobacco pipe) {{as opposed to being}} inhaled from (as is the case with cigarettes). The cigar {{is one of the oldest}} methods of preparing tobacco for consumption, some of the first cigars being introduced to Europeans as <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> smoked by the Taíno of 15th century Cuba.|$|E
50|$|Early texts, {{including}} those of Lewis and Clark, indicate that C. l. nubilus was abundant throughout the Great Plains, outnumbering local coyotes. Alexander Henry mentioned wolves several times in his writings on his trips to North Dakota, noting how they fed extensively on bison carcasses, and were bold around humans, sometimes approaching people and entering tents. He recorded that Native tribes occasionally dug up wolf pups and dug large pitfalls to capture adults, while Maximilian of Wied recorded that they would sell wolf pelts in exchange for two <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> each. Though still common by the mid-1800s, a combination of railroad construction, human settlement, the development of stock grazing and the subsequent extermination of bison pushed C. l. nubilus to the remoter regions of its range where the terrain made agriculture impracticable.|$|E

40|$|Many {{people view}} cigar smoking as more {{sophisticated}} and less dangerous than cigarette smoking. The traditional cigar is quite large, but today, smaller cigars are much more popular – you can buy them almost anywhere. Except for the brown wrapper, many of these little cigars look just like cigarettes. So {{when we talk about}} cigars, we’re talking about 2 extremes: on one side is the traditional big cigar, and on the other is the small cigarette-like version. There are also sizes in between. No matter the size, cigars are tobacco, and they are dangerous to your health. And like cigarettes, cigars give off secondhand smoke, which can fill a room for hours. Tobacco use is responsible for nearly 1 in 5 deaths in the United States. Tobacco use is an acquired behavior – it’s something that people choose to do. This makes smoking the most preventable cause of death in our society. How are cigars different from cigarettes? A cigar is defined, for tax purposes, as “any <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> wrapped in leaf tobacco or in any substance containing tobacco, ” while a cigarette is “any <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> wrapped in paper or any substance not containing tobacco. ” Traditional cigars don’t usually hav...|$|R
2500|$|The English word [...] "tobacco" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} Spanish and Portuguese word [...] "".

In Taino, it was said to mean either a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> leaves (according to Bartolomé de las Casas, 1552) or to tabago, a kind of Y-shaped pipe used for sniffing tobacco smoke (according to Oviedo; with the leaves themselves being referred to as cohiba).|$|R
60|$|Well, {{they went}} to a great many masters, but all said that they could make the lad as good as they were themselves, but better than that they could not make him. When the man came home to the old woman with this answer, she said, 'I shall be equally well pleased {{whatever}} you do with him; but this I do say, that you are to have him made a master over all masters.' Then she once more put some food and a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> into the bag, and the man and his son had to set out again.|$|R

50|$|This {{structure}} is 180 ft high, with a carved tile-effect on the spire. The four continent statues by John Thomas are as follows. Africa faces away from Crossley Street {{and consists of}} an ancient Egyptian and two boys. North America, above the tower portico, is a Native American with two small figures holding a paddle and a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco.</b> Europe, {{at the front of}} the tower in Crossley Street, has emblems of civilisation and refinement. After sculpting these, John Thomas died, and Asia was carved under the supervision of Daniel Maclise. Asia faces down Crossley Street, on the opposite side of the tower from the portico, and is a figure with a Chinese boy and tea chest and a child with flowers. On the corners of the spire are four seven-foot angels.|$|R

60|$|I {{was struck}} with these {{reflections}} as one astonished, {{and had not}} a word to say, no, not to answer to myself: but rose up pensive and sad, walked back to my retreat, and went up over my wall, as if I had been going to bed; but my thoughts were sadly disturbed, and I had no inclination to sleep; so I sat down in my chair, and lighted my lamp, for it began to be dark. Now, as the apprehensions of the return of my distemper terrified me very much, it occurred to my thought, that the Brasilians take no physic but their tobacco, for almost all distempers; and I had a piece <b>of</b> a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> in one <b>of</b> the chests, which was quite cured, and some also that was green, and not quite cured.|$|R
60|$|Lumley, whose {{powers of}} {{observation}} often surprised me, {{had noticed that}} Attick looked often and with longing eyes at a very small <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> which belonged {{to one of his}} comrades, and lay on the counter temptingly near at hand. Slowly, and, as it were, inadvertently, he advanced his hand until it touched the tobacco, then, laying hold on it, when the owner was busy with something else, he carried it towards the bosom of his leather hunting-shirt. Before it reached that place of concealment, however, Lumley quickly, yet so quietly that the act was scarce perceived, seized the elbow of the chief and gave him a look. Attick promptly put the tobacco down and looked at Lumley with a scowl, but the pale-face chief was smilingly giving some advice to the man, with whom he was trading.|$|R

From the depths of despair they were all suddenly raised to renewed and sanguine hope, so that they wrought with the energy of gold-diggers, and soon their toil was rewarded by the discovery of that which, in their circumstances, they would not have exchanged for all the golden nuggets that ever were or will be dug up from the prolific mines of Australia, California, or British Columbia, namely, three casks of biscuit, a small keg of wine, a cask of fresh water, a <b>roll</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and a barrel of salt junk.|$|R
