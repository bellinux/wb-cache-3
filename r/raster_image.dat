25|$|In 1993 the Jaws <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> {{processor}} from Global Graphics {{became the}} first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.|$|E
25|$|<b>Raster</b> <b>image</b> {{processors}} (RIPs) {{are used}} to convert PDF files into a raster format suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and prepress in {{a process known as}} rasterisation. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine from Adobe Systems and Jaws and the Harlequin RIP from Global Graphics.|$|E

In the fine retouching industry, the airbrushing technique is often considered a low-end practice, with significantly inferior quality to that found in the most important fashion photography publications.|$|E

25|$|Two PDF {{files that}} look similar on a {{computer}} screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high resolution <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.|$|E
2500|$|Raster {{images in}} PDF (called Image XObjects) are {{represented}} by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> may be embedded directly in a page description as an inline image.) Images are typically filtered for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters ...|$|E
2500|$|In digital imaging, a pixel (or picture element) is {{a single}} point in a <b>raster</b> <b>image.</b> Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often {{represented}} using dots or squares. Each pixel is a sample of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original.

40|$|Super-resolution {{is the art}} of {{creating}} nice high-resolution <b>raster</b> <b>images</b> from given low-resolution <b>raster</b> <b>images.</b> Since “nice” is not a well-defined term in mathematics and computer science, we propose a linear model of the world that allows us, under certain conditions, to achieve perfect super-resolution for arbitrarily high resolution.

2500|$|The DFT is {{the most}} {{important}} discrete transform, used to perform Fourier analysis in many practical applications. [...] In digital signal processing, the function is any quantity or signal that varies over time, such as the pressure of a sound wave, a radio signal, or daily temperature readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a window function). In image processing, the samples can be the values of pixels along a row or column of a <b>raster</b> <b>image.</b> The DFT is also used to efficiently solve partial differential equations, and to perform other operations such as convolutions or multiplying large integers.|$|E
2500|$|Population – ORNL {{provides}} federal, {{state and}} international organizations with a gridded population database, called Landscan, for estimating ambient population. LandScan is a <b>raster</b> <b>image,</b> or grid, of population counts, which provides human population estimates every 30 x 30 arc seconds, which translates roughly to population estimates for 1 kilometer square windows or grid cells at the equator, with cell width decreasing at higher latitudes. Though many population datasets exist, LandScan is the best spatial population dataset, which also covers the globe. Updated annually (although data releases are generally one year behind the current year) offers continuous, updated values of population, based on the most recent information. [...] Landscan data are accessible through GIS applications and a USAID public domain application called Population Explorer.|$|E
50|$|All {{types of}} {{electronic}} printers typically generate image data as a two-step process. First {{the information to}} be printed is converted into a dot matrix using a <b>raster</b> <b>image</b> processor, and the output is a dot matrix {{referred to as a}} <b>raster</b> <b>image,</b> which is a complete full-page rendering of the information to be printed. <b>Raster</b> <b>image</b> processing may occur in either the printer itself using a page description language such as Adobe Postscript, or may be performed by printer driver software installed on the user's computer.|$|E

This work also consider extending the graphic program GIMP, bringing a new plug-in for object selection in <b>raster</b> <b>images.</b> The solution is based on the original classic model of active contours, the extended model using a gradient vector field (GVF) and proposed improvements.

Among them are nearest neighbor algorithm, bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation. We consider our research methodology, and then we tell about result of algorithms comparison. We use two criteria: quality of output images and performance of algorithms. Due to this research we can tell some recommendations on the choice of algo-rithms for increment of <b>raster</b> <b>images.</b> It is useful because there is no single universal algorithm for efficient solution to the problem...|$|R
