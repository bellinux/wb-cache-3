60|$|In {{the evening}} my {{companion}} and Mr. Grant {{walked to the}} north-west of the concession; the place is called by Mr. Walker Iziá-bookah (Izíá Hill), but the natives ignore the term. Here, {{at a distance of}} 900 yards north and by west (true) of the Arábokasu village, they found and collected specimens of a fine reef of hard white quartz. 'Women's washings' were numerous, showing the proper way to begin working the ground. The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospecting</b> the whole <b>of</b> the section to the N.E. had been secured by Mr. Walker for Mr. Irvine, and presently the 'Apollonian concession' appeared in the mining journals.|$|R

5000|$|The latest act {{governing}} and regulating this Concession {{is that of}} the TATI CONCESSIONS LAND ACT 1970 (Cap 32:05). The {{most controversial}} provision in this act can be found in Section 6 of the above-mentioned, which states that [...] "The right to all minerals and precious stones under the land in the Tati District is reserved to the Tati Concessions, Limited, and also the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>prospecting</b> for and working the same." [...] The effect of this section is that mineral rights are bestowed unto this body, which is contrary to the Botswana Government's desire for all mineral rights in the country to devolve in her (as can be seen from Section 3 of the Mines and Minerals Act of 1999 66:0)which is to the effect that all minerals within Botswana, with the exception of Tati Concessions, are the property of the Republic of Botswana).|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{environmentalist}} {{thought is}} suspicious of private markets and property <b>rights.</b> The <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> global climate change, and consequent ecological disruptions, has fueled {{the call for}} additional limitations on private markets and property rights. This essay, written for the Environmental Law Symposium on 21 st Century Water Law, presents an alternative view. Specifically, this essay briefly explains why environmental problems generally, and the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> changing environmental conditions such as those brought about by climate change in particular, do not counsel further restrictions on private property rights and markets. To the contrary, the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> significant environmental changes strengthens the case for greater reliance on property rights and market institutions to address environmental problems, such as the management of fresh water resources...|$|R

These children often {{work long hours}} with dangerous tools and machines andare exposed to hazardous chemicals, polluted air, and infectious diseases. They are denied the education that is their <b>right</b> and deprived <b>of</b> <b>prospects</b> foreven minimally prosperous and healthy lives. The economic exploitation of children has generated an expanding set ofinternational legal standards designed {{to protect children from}} the harmful anddangerous effects of child labor. These standards, although well established,have suffered from many of the same practical weaknesses that have limitedthe effectiveness <b>of</b> international human <b>rights</b> law generally. This dilemma -strong legal norms but weak enforcement mechanisms - has contributed to arecent rise in private action to prevent child labor. These private initiativesutilize the standards embedded in international law and may, in turn, contributeto an evolution that will ultimately transform principles into effective,enforceable, legal norms...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Since the {{enactment}} of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) a fundamental conflict arose between the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> a holder <b>of</b> either a <b>prospecting</b> or a mining <b>right,</b> and that <b>of</b> a landowner. On the one hand this can be explained by having regard to the impact the granting <b>of</b> a <b>prospecting</b> or a mining right may have on the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the landowner to whose land such a right relates. On the other hand, section 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution), provides for the protection of property to a certain extent. The protection that the Constitution affords to a landowner, together with the rights granted to the holder <b>of</b> a <b>prospecting</b> or a mining right by the MPRDA, is the cause of such a fundamental conflict. It is against this background that this study seeks to determine to what extent the MPRDA provides for the protection <b>of</b> a landowner's <b>rights,</b> having regard to the rights granted to the holder <b>of</b> a <b>prospecting</b> or a mining right, which is considered against the protection of property as afforded by the Constitution.

50|$|Because the UNRWA's {{position}} consists <b>of</b> the <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> {{a conflict}} resolution {{leading to the}} creation of an independent Palestinian State and to the return of the refugees on that territory, as a definitive solution, it tends to justify the Lebanese policies granting the Palestinian refugees only a minimal legal status. In other words, the Palestinian refugees' rights are limited to the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> residence as a condition of the application of UNRWA's humanitarian assistance.|$|R
