50|$|Indian <b>rock-cut</b> {{architecture}} is more various and found in greater abundance {{than any other}} form of <b>rock-cut</b> architecture around the world. <b>Rock-cut</b> {{architecture is}} the practice of creating a structure by carving it out of solid natural rock. Rock that {{is not part of the}} structure is removed until the only rock left is the architectural elements of the excavated interior. Indian <b>rock-cut</b> architecture is mostly religious in nature.|$|R

See here, Thurston, leaving all {{personal}} amenities out of the question, I'm inclined to figure that you will be of use to me, aid the connection also will help you considerably. My paid representatives are not always so energetic as they might be. So if you are tired of High Maples you can start in with the <b>rock-cutting</b> on the new wagon road.

60|$|Despite his employer's {{invitation}} Thurston did {{not return}} to High Maples {{at the end of the}} week. The <b>rock-cutting</b> engrossed all his attention, and he was conscious that it might be desirable to allow Miss Savine's indignation to cool. He had thought of her often since the day that she gave him the dollar, and, at first still smarting under the memory of another woman's treachery, had tried to analyze his feelings regarding her. The result was not very definite, though he decided that he had never really loved Millicent, and was very certain now that she had wasted little affection upon him. One evening at Graham's ranch when they had stood silently together under the early stars, he had become suddenly conscious of the all-important fact, that his life would be empty without Helen Savine, and that of all the women whom he had met she alone could guide and raise him towards a higher plane.|$|E

50|$|Ignited {{methane gas}} {{is a common}} source of explosions in coal mines, which in turn can {{initiate}} more extensive coal dust explosions. For this reason, rock dusts such as limestone dust are spread throughout coal mines to diminish the chances of coal dust explosions {{as well as to}} limit the extent of potential explosions, in a process known as rock dusting. Coal dust explosions can also begin independently of methane gas explosions. Frictional heat and sparks generated by mining equipment can ignite both methane gas and coal dust. For this reason, water is often used to cool <b>rock-cutting</b> sites.|$|E

Under this there is a rock-cut tomb, with the entrance outside {{the east end of}} the church, and the local under where the altar would probably be placed. The loculi are ordinary square-headed kokim; the tomb was too much filled with chopped straw to see how many there were. A large stone, used as a lintel in one of the houses, bears the representation of a vase; and there is also a stone niche built into the wall of a modern house. There are several well-dressed stones of considerable size, and some <b>rock-cutting</b> showing foundations of ancient buildings." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although free {{standing}} structural temples were being {{built by the}} 5th century, <b>rock-cut</b> cave temples continued {{to be built in}} parallel. Later <b>rock-cut</b> cave architecture became more sophisticated as in the Ellora Caves, culminating ultimately in the monolithic Kailash Temple. Although cave temples continued to be built until the 12th century, <b>rock-cut</b> architecture became almost totally structural in nature, made from rocks cut into bricks and built as {{free standing}} constructions. Kailash was the last spectacular <b>rock-cut</b> excavated temple. [...] There are also a number of rock reliefs, relief sculptures carved into rock faces, outside caves or at other sites.|$|R

40|$|AbstractLarge {{amounts of}} solid wastes are {{discarded}} in the ornamental rocks industry. This work investigates {{the incorporation of}} ornamental <b>rock-cutting</b> waste as a raw material into an aluminous porcelain body, replacing natural feldspar material by up to 35  wt. %. Formulations containing <b>rock-cutting</b> waste were pressed and sintered at 1350  °C. The porcelain pieces were tested to determine their properties (linear shrinkage, water absorption, apparent density, mechanical strength, and electrical resistivity). Development of the microstructure was followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The results showed that ornamental <b>rock-cutting</b> waste {{could be used in}} aluminous porcelains, in the range up to 10  wt. %, as a partial replacement for traditional flux material, resulting in a valid route for management of this abundant waste...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 402 <b>rock-cutting</b> samples were {{recovered}} during the 2011 hydrocarbon exploration project conducted by Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) of Sri Lanka using the Chikyu drillship. The <b>rock-cutting</b> {{samples from the}} Dorado North and Barracuda exploration wells represent an approximately 4000  m thickness of Late Cretaceous-to-Miocene calcareous argillaceous to arenaceous sediments in the Mannar Basin (Fig.  1). These samples were highly contaminated by drilling mud and oil. No drilling operation reports or information on the drilling fluid compositions are publically available as yet.|$|E
30|$|As new {{technology}} has developed, differing categories of drilling fluids (drilling mud/lubrication) {{have been used}} to drill deeper and geometrically more complex wells. <b>Rock-cutting</b> samples are thus often contaminated by drilling fluids. These fluids contain a mixture of compounds, including paraffin, olefins, and oil-based esters (Wenger et al. 2004; Toldo Jr and; Zouain 2009). Due to contamination, misleading bulk organic and molecular organic geochemical information may thus be acquired from rock cuttings, compared to larger and more intact rock samples from cores (Brocks et al. 1999, 2003; Grosjean and Logan 2007; Reddy et al. 2007; Jarrett et al. 2013). Therefore, it is necessary to develop geochemical methods for evaluating possible sample contamination. Although the use of contamination tracer testing is highly site-specific, it provides an overview {{of the quality of the}} <b>rock-cutting</b> samples collected in any particular drilling program.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rock-cut</b> {{architecture}} {{is the creation}} of structures, buildings, and sculptures, by excavating solid rock where it naturally occurs. <b>Rock-cut</b> {{architecture is}} designed and made by man from the start to finish. In India and China, the terms 'cave' and 'cavern' are often applied to this form of man-made architecture. However, caves and caverns, that began in natural form, are not considered to be 'rock-cut architecture' even if extensively modified. Although <b>rock-cut</b> structures differ from traditionally built structures in many ways, many <b>rock-cut</b> structures are made to replicate the facade or interior of traditional architectural forms. Interiors were usually carved out by starting at the roof of the planned space and then working downward. This technique prevents stones falling on workers below. The three main uses of <b>rock-cut</b> architecture were temples (like those in India), tombs (like those in Petra, Jordan) and cave dwellings (like those in Cappadocia, Turkey).|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} the bulk and molecular geochemical characteristics of residual heavy liquid oil-based drilling mud mixtures (oil-based drilling mud) extracted from <b>rock-cutting</b> samples from wells drilled in the Mannar Basin of Sri Lanka.

40|$|Particle Impact Drilling is an {{efficient}} drilling technology for deep-well hard formation which cuts rock mainly by high-speed spherical particle impacting rock {{with the help}} of hydraulic action and mechanical action. In order to determine main influence factors and their order of priority, the orthogonal experiment was designed and the experimental data was analyzed with both the general method and the variance method. The analysis indicates that the order of priority of the main influence factors of particle water jet <b>rock-cutting</b> performance is pump pressure ps, impacting range S, particle mass concentration ω, confining pressure P and particle diameter dp. Moreover, ps is highly important and S and ω are important. In addition, high ps, moderate S, moderate ω, moderate dp and low P could effectively promote particle water jet to impact and cut rocks.
