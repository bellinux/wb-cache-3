500|$|Landis {{had been}} a lawyer with a {{corporate}} practice; upon his elevation to the bench, corporate litigants expected him to favor them. According to a 1907 magazine article about Landis, [...] "Corporations smiled pleasantly {{at the thought of}} a corporation lawyer being on the bench. They smile no more." [...] In an early case, Landis fined the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company the maximum $4,000 for illegally importing workers, even though Winifred Landis's sister's husband served on the corporate board. In another decision, Landis struck down a challenge to the Interstate Commerce Commission's (ICC) jurisdiction over <b>rebating,</b> a practice banned by the Elkins Act of 1903 in which railroads and favored customers agreed that the customers would pay less than the posted tariff, which by law was to be the same for all shippers. Landis's decision allowed the ICC to take action against railroads which gave rebates.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{politicians}} and economists in the United States consider VAT taxation on US goods and VAT rebates for goods {{from other countries}} to be unfair practice. E.g. the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition claims that any rebates or special taxes on imported goods {{should not be allowed}} by the rules of the World Trade Organisation. AMTAC claims that so-called [...] "border tax disadvantage" [...] is the greatest contributing factor to the $5.8 trillion US current account deficit for the decade of the 2000s, and estimated this disadvantage to US producers and service providers to be $518 billion in 2008 alone. Some US politicians, such as congressman Bill Pascrell, are advocating either changing WTO rules relating to VAT or <b>rebating</b> VAT charged on US exporters by passing the Border Tax Equity Act. [...] A business tax rebate for exports is also proposed in the 2016 GOP policy paper for tax reform. [...] The assertion that this [...] "border adjustment" [...] would be compatible with the rules of the WTO is controversial; it was alleged that the proposed tax would favour domestically produced goods as they would be taxed less than imports, to a degree varying across sectors. For example, the wage component of the cost of domestically produced goods would not be taxed.|$|E

40|$|A channel <b>rebate</b> is {{a payment}} from a {{manufacturer}} to a retailer based on retailer sales to end consumers. Two common forms of channel <b>rebates</b> are linear <b>rebates,</b> {{in which the}} <b>rebate</b> is paid for each unit sold, and target <b>rebates,</b> in which the <b>rebate</b> is paid for each unit sold beyond a specified target level. When demand is not influenced by sales effort, a properly designed target <b>rebate</b> achieves channel coordination and a win-win outcome. Coordination cannot be achieved by a linear <b>rebate</b> {{in a way that}} is implementable. When demand is influenced by retailer sales effort, a properly designed target <b>rebate</b> and returns contract achieves coordination and a win-win outcome.

60|$|It {{is not my}} {{intention}} to make an apology for my poem: some will think it needs no excuse, and others will receive none. The design I am sure is honest: but he who draws his pen for one party, must expect to make enemies of the other. For wit and fool are consequence of Whig and Tory; and every man is a knave or an ass to the contrary side. There is a treasury of merits in the Fanatic church, {{as well as in}} the Popish; and a pennyworth to be had of saintship, honesty, and poetry, for the lewd, the factious, and the blockheads: but the longest chapter in Deuteronomy has not curses enough for an Anti-Bromingham. My comfort is, their manifest prejudice to my cause will render their judgment of less authority against me. Yet if a poem have genius, it will force its own reception in the world. For there is a sweetness in good verse, which tickles even while it hurts; and no man can be heartily angry with him who pleases him against his will. The commendation of adversaries is the greatest triumph of a writer, because it never comes unless extorted. But I can be satisfied on more easy terms: if I happen to please the more moderate sort, I shall be sure of an honest party, and, in all probability, of the best judges; for the least concerned are commonly the least corrupt. And I confess I have laid in for those, by <b>rebating</b> the satire (where justice would allow it), from carrying too sharp an edge. They who can criticise so weakly as to imagine I have done my worst, may be convinced, at their own cost, that I can write severely, with more ease than I can gently. I have but laughed at some men's follies, when I could have declaimed against their vices; and other men's virtues I have commended, as freely as I have taxed their crimes. And now, if you are a malicious reader, I expect you should return upon me that I affect to be thought more impartial than I am. But if men are not to be judged by their professions, God forgive you Commonwealth's-men for professing so plausibly for the government. You cannot be so unconscionable as to charge me for not subscribing my name; for that would reflect too grossly upon your own party, who never dare, though they have the advantage of a jury to secure them. If you like not my poem, the fault may possibly be in my writing (though it is hard for an author to judge against himself); but more probably it is in your morals, which cannot bear the truth of it. The violent on both sides will condemn the character of Absalom, as either too favourably or too hardly drawn. But they are not the violent whom I desire to please. The fault on the right hand is to extenuate, palliate, and indulge; and to confess freely, I have endeavoured to commit it. Besides the respect which I owe his birth, I have a greater for his heroic virtues; and David himself could not be more tender of the young man's life, than I would be of his reputation. But since the most excellent natures are always the most easy, and, as being such, are the soonest perverted by ill counsels, especially when baited with fame and glory; it is no more a wonder that he withstood not the temptations of Achitophel, than it was for Adam not to have resisted the two devils, the serpent and the woman. The conclusion of the story I purposely forbore to prosecute, because I could not obtain from myself to show Absalom unfortunate. The frame of it was cut out but for a picture to the waist; and if the draught be so far true, it is as much as I designed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Manufacturer <b>rebates</b> are {{commonly}} used as price discount tools for attracting end customers. In this study, we consider a two-stage supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer, where a single seasonal product faces uncertain and price-sensitive demand. We characterize {{the impact of a}} manufacturer <b>rebate</b> on the expected profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer. We show that unless all of the customers claim the <b>rebate,</b> the <b>rebate</b> always benefits the manufacturer. Our results thus imply that “mail-in <b>rebates,</b> ” where some customers end up not claiming the <b>rebate,</b> particularly when the size of the <b>rebate</b> is relatively small, always benefit the manufacturer. On the other hand, an “instant <b>rebate,</b> ” such as the one offered in the automotive industry where every customer redeems the <b>rebate</b> on the spot when he/she purchases a car, does not necessarily benefit the manufacturer. © 200...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} mail-in {{consumer}} <b>rebates</b> — a significant, yet controversial marketing practices that has generated thousands of consumer complaints, inspired countless articles in major periodicals, {{and begun to}} attract the interest {{of state and federal}} legislators. The paper first aims to provide an understanding of the purposes of consumer <b>rebate</b> offerings. It then surveys the main categories of consumer <b>rebate</b> complaints, including that firms impose onerous <b>rebate</b> redemption requirements and that they fail to pay <b>rebate</b> rewards in a timely manner. The paper draws on recent marketing, psychological and behavioral economics research to address the potent claim that <b>rebates</b> exploit sub-optimal consumer behavior. The latter part of the paper evaluates several possible regulatory options for consumer <b>rebates,</b> including unfair and deceptive trade practices litigation, informational or de-biasing laws aimed at reducing sub-optimal consumer behavior, and legislation that sets mandatory <b>rebate</b> promotion terms. The paper also discusses how the market has already begun to respond to consumer dissatisfaction with <b>rebate</b> promotions. In the end, the paper argues that the most egregious <b>rebate</b> promotion abuses can be managed with a minimum level of paternalistic intervention while preserving the welfare-enhancing benefits of <b>rebate</b> promotions...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturers have {{increasingly}} instituted widespread mail-in <b>rebate</b> programs in recent years. Two primary purposes for <b>rebates</b> are to: (1) more directly impact consumer demand by reducing net retail price, and (2) capitalize on consumers' slippage behavior {{because not all}} consumers who intend to redeem the <b>rebate</b> at purchase time end up actually redeeming it. However, retailers can counteract the power of <b>rebates</b> to impact demand by simply raising the retail price {{by the amount of}} the manufacturer's <b>rebate.</b> We show that by combining a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) along with a <b>rebate,</b> the manufacturer can better control the channel by inhibiting the retailer's ability to raise price, particularly when consumers exhibit loss aversion. As a result, incorporating MSRP with a <b>rebate</b> promotion plan increases the manufacturer's profit. More surprisingly, the profit of the supply chain as a whole also increases, and the channel efficiency increases as well. In fact, contrary to results from the existing <b>rebate</b> literature suggesting that <b>rebates</b> should always be offered whenever slippage exists, we demonstrate that MSRP can actually be a more effective tool than <b>rebates</b> in managing retailer and consumer behavior when consumers do not have sufficient loss aversion and the slippage rate is low enough.
