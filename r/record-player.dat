50|$|The Phonotrope is {{the term}} coined by Animation Director Jim Le Fevre to {{describe}} the technique of creating animation in a 'live' environment using {{the confluence of the}} frame-rate of a live action camera and the revolutions of a constantly rotating disc, predominantly (but not exclusively) using a <b>record-player.</b>|$|E

Thus Nam June Paik, who was trained as a composer, installed twelve television sets, four pianos, <b>record-players,</b> tape-recorders and mechanical sound-generating objects in the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal in March 1963.

Having failed to persuade its directors to diversify from making <b>record-players</b> to making records, {{he raised the}} capital to take the company over, and ran it until his death. Among the ground-breaking achievements of Decca under Lewis were the [...] "Decca Navigation System" [...] (the leading maritime and aviation navigation system prior to GPS), the Decca [...] "ffrr" [...] recording technology, and the first release on record of Wagners Ring cycle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{records were}} played on turntables, {{but since the}} timing - the clock {{synchronization}} - between the two SIGSALY terminals had to be precise, the turntables {{were by no means}} just ordinary <b>record-players.</b> The rotation rate of the turntables was carefully controlled, and the records were started at highly specific times, based on precision time-of-day clock standards. Since each record only provided 12 minutes of key, each SIGSALY had two turntables, with a second record [...] "queued up" [...] while the first was [...] "playing".|$|R
5000|$|From its {{inception}} {{the most commonly}} used methods of rotating the disc have been using a <b>record-player</b> however Le Fevre has used a pottery wheel to spin a glazed pot to create animation as well as using a bespoke motor to animate hundreds of cut-out card images on a two meter high wooden tiered structure for the title sequence for the BBC television comedy film Holy Flying Circus.|$|E
5000|$|In instant replays, {{slow motion}} reviews are now {{commonly}} used to show in detail some action (photo finish, football (soccer) goal, ...). Generally, they are made with video servers and special controllers. The first TV slo-mo was the Ampex HS-100 disk <b>record-player.</b> After the HS-100, Type C videotape VTRs with a slow-motion option were used. There were a few special high frame rate TV systems (300 fps) made to give higher quality slow-motion for TV. 300 FPS {{can be converted to}} both 50 and 60 FPS transmission formats without major issues.|$|E

40|$|People {{who possess}} {{high-end}} audio systems are fas-tidious. They demand an absolutely authentic ren-dition of their music. The Silencer takes you one gigantic {{step closer to}} this goal. The disturbing influence of vibration has its origins in buildings, in people moving through the room and also in airbourne sound input from the loud-speakers. All these sources of disturbance lead to a distorted rendition of audiosignals. The Silencer’s active damping system suppresses these distur-bances masterfully, delivering spectacular results that are simply not available with passive vibration isolation systems. The Silencer focusses on high grade, analog <b>record-players,</b> CD-players, power amplifiers {{as well as other}} audio components sensitive to vibration. And it offers you a new kind of absolute sound – the ultimate listening experience! Technological Elegance High-Tech for Ultimate Listening Pleasure The Silencer is something of an understatement. It’s sophisticated metal surface is only interrupted by one single switch on the front panel. LEDs alone hint at its inner activities: ultra-fast control engineering absorbs vibration amplitudes in the micron-area. In recent years, this technology has become an es-sential part in modern, nanotechnological applica-tions. And now the Silencer is introducing it to the high-end audio world...|$|R
5000|$|An interobject is a {{phenomenon}} of dreams, {{in which there is}} a perception of something that is [...] "between" [...] two objects. The term was coined by Blechner in his book The Dream Frontier. Interobjects differ from typical dream condensations in which two objects are fused into one. Instead the condensation is incomplete. Some examples from the literature on dreams include [...] "a piece of hardware, something like the lock of a door or perhaps a pair of paint-frozen hinges," [...] and [...] "something between a <b>record-player</b> and a balance scale." [...] Interobjects are new creations derived from partially fused blends of other objects.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{in a new}} yellow dress, Solange {{sings in}} front of a pastel-colored background, multiplies herself, dances, and then leaps onto a large <b>record-player.</b> She runs laps on the record, and spells out the lyrics [...] "Ba Ba B B Baby", before moving to Solange (in a copper/beige dress) {{in front of a}}n ocean background. Now in the background, large CGI {{balloons}} appear, and Solange grabs hold of one and flies up. Solange then lets go and lands back in front of her band (in a black/yellow feathered dress) singing in front of a CGI elephant, balloons, mushroom, and octopus, as her backing singers join her. Confetti falls around the room as Solange finishes the song and then walks off as the video fades.|$|E
50|$|In December 1960, the Chairman, Sir Patrick Bishop, {{resigned}} and Richards left the board. Morphy also left as managing director, but {{stayed on the}} board. Graham Hurst became managing director. By March 1961, Richards had joined GEC as joint managing director of their electrical appliance division. On 12 May 1961, a new £500,000 factory at Dundee built by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts was opened by Richard Wood, Baron Holderness, then the Minister of Power. The Dundee site was managed by Willis Roxburgh until July 1966, and produced around {{a quarter of all}} fridges in the UK. By 1962 it was exporting to over 120 countries. In August 1962 the company appointed Faber Birren to give advice on colours of products. On 7 December 1962, Richards joined {{the board of directors of}} GEC. In October 1963, it took over the <b>record-player</b> division of EMI. On 15 November 1964, Charles Richards died aged 64 at his house in Buckinghamshire.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977, Carver {{submitted}} {{a story with}} this title to Esquire, which Gordon Lish subsequently edited and retitled [...] "I Am Going to Sit Down", but no version ever appeared in Esquire. The story {{was first published in}} Quarterly West in Autumn 1978 and later in The Paris Review in Spring 1981. The Quarterly West version incorporated many of Lish's suggested changes, while the final version was 9% shorter. It {{tells the story of a}} drinking man overseeing his yard-sale. The reader gets the feeling that he may be selling all his possessions, looking to start life anew. A young couple stops by to select furniture for their new apartment. They haggle a little over prices and buy a TV and a bed. The drinking man tells the young girl to put a record on. When the music begins the man asks the couple to dance. Uncomfortably, they comply. Then the drinking man dances with the young girl, and she says to him: [...] "You must be desperate or something." [...] Several weeks later, the young girl is telling her friends about the man at his yard-sale. She mocks the <b>record-player</b> and records he gave them, saying: [...] "Will you look at this shit?" [...] The story ends with her trying to make sense of the man's situation before quitting her wondering altogether.The story was adapted in the 2010 film Everything Must Go starring Will Ferrell and written and directed by Dan Rush.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a novel interface for musical performance which utilizes a <b>record-player</b> turntable augmented with a computation engine and a high-density optical sensing array. The turntable {{functions as a}} standalone step sequencer for MIDI events transmitted to a computer or another device and it is programmed in real-time using visual disks. The program instructions are represented on printed paper disks directly as characters of English alphabet that could be read by human as effectively as they are {{picked up by the}} machine’s optical cartridge. The result is a tangible interface that allows the user to manipulate pre-arranged musical material by hand, by adding together instrumental tracks to form a dynamic mix. A functional implementation of this interface is discussed in view of historical background and other examples of electronic instruments for music creation and performance incorporating optical turntable as a central element...|$|E
