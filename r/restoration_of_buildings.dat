25|$|Managua's {{progress}} came to {{a sudden}} halt after it suffered a second major earthquake on December 23, 1972, which destroyed 90% of the city's downtown and killed more than 19,120 people. Infrastructure was severely damaged and rehabilitation or <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> was nearly impossible. At the time, Managua's limited resources had to be directed to other disaster relief purposes. Managua's {{ability to cope with}} the disaster was also limited. Surviving fire squadrons and ambulance companies were not able to handle the skyrocketing demand for their services. Some buildings burned to the ground, while the foundations of others simply gave way. Not able to rebuild quickly, the city directed emergency workers to clear away much of the city's ruins quickly while burying the deceased in mass graves. Residences, government buildings and entire avenues were demolished. Escaping the city center, earthquake victims found refuge in the outskirts of the city. To add insult to injury, corruption within the Somoza regime which allocated part of the relief funds hindered the reconstruction of the city's center which remains somewhat isolated {{from the rest of the}} capital.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{official}} {{end of the}} French protectorate and a lesser role recognized by the ruling authority in Palestine, France was not inclined to diminish its influence in the region. Dominique Trimbur wrote [...] "Paris and its representatives acted as if France still occupied the place of protective power which it {{had at the time}} of the Ottoman Empire." [...] France sought to restore its traditional role in Palestine, to protect the Catholic communities. Dominique Trimbur stresses the role of Amédée Outrey, Consul General of France in Jerusalem from 1938 to 194, in restoring the status quo: [...] "for him, it (was) first of all a matter of serving as the arbitrator of the communities and of avoiding absolutely any British interference in their affairs." [...] Through the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> (Abbey of Abu Ghosh), maneuvers to have posts of responsibility appointed to French people, and the attribution of medals to the directors of seminars devoted to France, Outrée tried to restore France's historic dominance.|$|E
