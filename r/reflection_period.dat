25|$|The Czech Government {{continued}} to improve trafficking {{protection and assistance}} over the last year. In November 2004, the Model of Support and Protection of Victims of Trafficking in Persons was expanded to a permanent, government-funded program that {{is open to all}} foreign and Czech victims. This program involves close cooperation between the government and NGOs, and allows the victims a 30day <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> to receive assistance and consider whether to assist in prosecuting their traffickers. From January 2004 to January 2005, 14 trafficking victims — including one forced labor victim — took part in the program. Many victims chose to apply for asylum, which allows them legal status in the Czech Republic until their cases are decided — a process involving months to years. The government houses victims and potential victims applying for asylum with other at-risk groups in guarded asylum centers to prevent unwanted contact with traffickers. The government funded several NGOs and international organizations for sheltering and care of victims; two of the Czech Republic’s principal organizations provided shelter to 68 trafficking victims in 2004.|$|E

50|$|Government {{authorities}} referred all 780 identified victims for assistance, {{compared with}} 540 victims referred {{for assistance in}} 2008. Victims were encouraged to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; 158 victims served as witnesses in 2009, a significant decrease from 1,053 victims who assisted law enforcement in 2008. The law provides that foreign victims were eligible to benefit from a 90-day <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> {{to remain in the}} country and decide whether they would like to cooperate in a criminal proceeding; however in practice, no foreign victims used this <b>reflection</b> <b>period.</b> The law permits foreign victims to request a temporary residence permit and remain in the country until completion of the trafficking investigation and prosecution; in 2009, no foreign victims applied for and received temporary residence permits.|$|E
50|$|Under the Act on Compensation for Crime Damage, {{victims of}} crime could receive {{government}} compensation for personal injury, damage to property, or other financial loss {{caused by a}} crime. Finnish authorities provided identified trafficking victims with a six-month <b>reflection</b> <b>period,</b> a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they consider whether to assist law enforcement. There were no indications, however, that the <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> was used extensively. Victims of trafficking wishing to stay longer than six months were eligible to apply for an extended residence permit or asylum {{as an alternative to}} deportation. The government granted permanent residence permits to seven victims during the reporting period. The government made some effort to ensure victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. The government provided anti-trafficking awareness training for labor inspectors, diplomatic personnel, public health workers, immigration adjudication staff and Finnair flight attendants.|$|E
50|$|The Norwegian {{government}} made {{progress in the}} identification and protection of trafficking victims during the reporting period. Through employment of proactive identification procedures, government officials reported identifying 292 possible trafficking victims, 80 of whom were forced labor victims, in 2009 - an increase from 256 victims, 71 of whom were forced labor victims, identified in 2008. In September 2009, the government conducted a three-day seminar on trafficking victim identification for NGOs and over 200 officials, including police, prosecutors, child welfare specialists, asylum reception center workers, and immigration authorities. The government provided direct assistance services to victims as well as funding for NGOs offering victim services. The government gave trafficking victims in Norway shelter in domestic violence centers, medical care, vocational training, stipends, Norwegian classes, and legal assistance. The government encouraged victims to participate in trafficking investigations and prosecutions; all victims who assisted in the conviction of their traffickers received $20,000 or more in restitution from the government for their trafficking experiences. Victims were permitted to stay in Norway without conditions during a six-month <b>reflection</b> <b>period,</b> a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they consider whether to assist law enforcement - 73 applied for the <b>reflection</b> <b>period,</b> of which 50 were approved and 23 were denied. After the <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> and deciding {{to cooperate with the}} police, 20 victims applied for longer term residency permits, and 10 received such permits. Trafficking victims reportedly were not penalized during the reporting period for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. The government funded the IOM to provide voluntary and safe repatriation to foreign trafficking victims.|$|E

50|$|Denmark {{sustained}} its {{victim assistance}} and protection efforts over the year. In addition to employing formal victim identification procedures, the government conducted a proactive victim identification outreach program, interviewing people in prostitution, {{as well as}} in prisons and asylum centers, in an attempt to identify and rescue trafficking victims. The government identified 54 victims during the reporting period, down from 72 identified the previous year. The government offered medical, dental, psychological, and legal services, and in certain cases a stipend, to victims of trafficking during a 100-day <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> - a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they considered whether to assist law enforcement. There were two government-funded crisis centers for female victims of violence, which accommodated women trafficking victims. There were no specific shelter facilities for male victims, but at least one government-funded NGO offered assistance to men. The government offered child trafficking victims additional social services and placement in shelters or foster care. No support is provided to adult or child foreign victims of trafficking in Denmark beyond the <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> if asylum or residency is not granted.|$|E
50|$|The Government of Macedonia did not {{demonstrate}} sufficient progress in protecting trafficking victims in 2009. Macedonia’s victim identification procedures require that first-line responders liberally identify people, such as illegal migrants and foreign {{women and girls}} in prostitution, as potential victims until they can be formally vetted by a trained anti-trafficking authority. Of the 157 potential trafficking victims identified by authorities in 2009, seven were confirmed as trafficking victims; all were children. Eighteen victims were identified in 2008. With IOM assistance, the government organized a series of trainings reaching 280 front-line responders on proactive victim identification. These trainings were funded with the government’s EU pre-accession funds, earmarked for trafficking. Additionally, {{in conjunction with the}} OSCE, the government trained all of the country’s labor inspectors on proactive victim identification in the labor sector. Macedonian law exempts victims from criminal prosecution for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. While the government’s standard operating procedures mandate a multi-disciplinary approach to identifying victims, NGOs and international organizations should be more systematically included in this process. The government continued to fund and operate a transit center for foreign migrants and trafficking victims with the help of a local NGO that specializes in victim rehabilitation, especially children. The government provided in-kind contributions to the NGO assisting foreign victims in this center. All potential victims are offered a two-month <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> during which time they are offered victim assistance services, regardless of whether they choose to testify for the state. At any time during the <b>reflection</b> <b>period,</b> if they decide to cooperate with authorities in the investigation of the crime, an additional six-month residency permit can be granted. As an undocumented foreigner, until a foreign trafficking victim receives a legal residency status, his or her movement is restricted to within the shelter. During the reporting period, one foreign victim stayed in the transit center under the <b>reflection</b> <b>period.</b> No foreign victims to date have requested the six-month residency permit.|$|E

In December 2007, the government adopted a national action plan on child sexual exploitation, improved awareness on trafficking issues, and increased internal and international cooperation to combat child sex tourism.

50|$|In 2009, the {{government}} allocated approximately $298,000 for victim assistance, including $59,000 for {{a shelter for}} use by adult female victims of trafficking. In response to criticism {{that there were no}} shelters dedicated to assisting male victims of trafficking, {{the government}} housed seven male trafficking victims in a government-run crisis center in January 2010 and enrolled them in the Victim/Witness Protection Program, ensuring they had access to necessary care. Under Polish law, all foreign victims are permitted to stay in Poland during a three-month <b>reflection</b> <b>period,</b> during which time they are eligible to access victim services while they {{decide whether or not to}} cooperate with law enforcement. In 2009, no victims took advantage of the 90-day <b>reflection</b> <b>period.</b> Those foreign victims who choose to cooperate are permitted to stay in Poland during the investigation and prosecution process. In 2009, two foreign victims were granted temporary residency permits to remain in Poland pending completion of the prosecution process. However, some trafficking experts expressed concern that some victims who chose not to cooperate with law enforcement may not have been given victim status and therefore may not have received emergency victim assistance. Police encouraged victims to cooperate with law enforcement. In 2009, 22 victims assisted law enforcement, compared with 21 victims in 2008. There were no reports that identified victims were penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.|$|E
50|$|The government-run {{trafficking}} hotline referred nine {{victims to}} NGOs for assistance last year, a decrease from 50 victims referred by the hotline in 2008. Law enforcement and consular officials identified approximately 30 victims domestically and abroad in 2009, compared with 26 in 2008. Both {{law enforcement and}} NGOs were often unaware or uncertain about what services victims of trafficking were eligible to receive; this lack of awareness may have limited the number of victims assisted during the reporting period. Victims were not penalized for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result}} of being trafficked and there were no reported cases of authorities’ mistreatment of trafficking victims. The government encouraged victims to assist with trafficking investigations and prosecutions; in 2009, twenty-seven victims assisted in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. The government offered foreign victims a 30-day <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> to decide whether to assist law enforcement; however, no foreign victims applied for or received the 30-day temporary residency permits in 2009. NGOs expressed concern that Hungarian victims were not provided with a <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> to receive assistance and decide whether or not to assist law enforcement; instead, Hungarian victims were required to decide upon identification whether or not they wanted to assist law enforcement. Foreign victims may apply for a six-month temporary residency permit if they choose to cooperate with law enforcement.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, law 3386/2005 {{was passed}} to better assist victims of trafficking; however, victim {{identification}} {{continues to be}} a weak point of Greek anti-trafficking efforts. The government officially identified only 125 human trafficking victims in 2009, an improvement over the 78 victims identified in 2008. The government continued to operate a short-term shelter, which could accommodate children, in addition to two long-term shelters for women. The government also referred child victims to orphanages or detention centers that did not have specialized facilities for trafficking victims. One NGO reported that authorities released unaccompanied foreign minors onto the street with little support after detention. The government encouraged victims to participate in prosecutions by offering a 30-day <b>reflection</b> <b>period,</b> a time for victims to receive immediate care while they consider whether to assist law enforcement, but according to NGOs, authorities did not always provide the <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> consistently during the reporting period. Victims who assisted with law enforcement prosecutions qualified for temporary, renewable residence permits as a legal alternative to removal. NGOs reported excellent cooperation with specialized anti-trafficking police units. Overall, the government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts that may have been committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. However, some NGOs reported that the coast guard and border police, overwhelmed with processing refugees and undocumented migrants, had little time to use victim identification procedures. As a result, they sent many potential victims, including vulnerable unaccompanied minors, to migrant detention centers, where they often faced poor conditions. In a positive development, the government implemented a child repatriation agreement with Albania, repatriating six Albanian child victims in cooperation with NGOs.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{government}} drafted legislation {{to ensure that}} domestic trafficking victims receive free healthcare, a lack of implementation of this provision resulted in an NGO paying for some victims’ emergency medical care in 2009. During the reporting period, {{the government}} took over complete financial responsibility for the National Referral Mechanism Office, a coordinating body responsible for monitoring victim identification, referral, assistance, and legal processes. Macedonian law provides legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face retribution or hardship through both a two-month <b>reflection</b> <b>period</b> and a six-month residency permit. The government encouraged victims {{to participate in the}} prosecution of their traffickers; it reported that three victims provided witness testimony in courts and three assisted in law enforcement investigations in 2009. Reportedly, one of the reasons victims do not report their traffickers is because the traffickers tell the victims they have connections with the police.|$|E

In 2007, these NGOs assisted 26 victims or potential victims compared to 43 victims assisted in 2006. The government continued to implement its formalized victim identification and referral mechanism during the reporting period; however, during the year, police referred only four victims to NGOs for assistance, down from 21 victims referred in 2006.
