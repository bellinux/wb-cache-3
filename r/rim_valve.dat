40|$|Hydraulic spool valves {{are found}} in most {{hydraulic}} circuits in which flow is to be modulated. Therefore their dynamic performance {{is critical to the}} overall performance of the circuit. Fundamental to this performance is the presence of flow reaction forces which act on the spool. These forces can result in the necessity of using two stage devices to drive the spool and in some cases have been directly linked to valve and circuit instabilities. As such, a great deal of research and design has concentrated on ways to reduce or compensate for flow forces. In one particular series of studies conducted on flow divider valves, it was established that a rim machined into the land of the spool reduced the flow dividing error by approximately 70 - 80 %, and it was deduced that the main contribution to this error was flow forces. Direct verification of the claim regarding flow force reduction was not achieved and hence was the motivation for this particular study. This thesis will consider the reaction (flow) force associated with a conventional spool land and one with a rim machined into it, and a modified form of the rimmed land referred to as a “sharp edge tapered rim spool land”. The rim and the sharp edge tapered rim were specially designed geometrical changes to the lands of the standard spool {{in order to reduce the}} large steady state flow forces (SSFF) inherent in the standard spool valve. In order to analyze the flow field inside the interior passages of the valve, three configurations of the spool were considered for orifice openings of 0. 375, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 05 mm. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was used to describe the fluid mechanics associated with the steady state flow forces as it provided a detailed structure of the flow through the valve, and to identify the flow mechanism whereby flow forces are reduced by the machining of a rim and tapered rim on the land of the spool. For all openings of the spool, the sharp tapered <b>rim</b> <b>valve</b> provides the largest reduction in SSFF. It was also observed that for all cases studied, the inflow SSFF’s were smaller than for the outflow conditions. The prediction of the steady state flow force on the rim spool was investigated in a flow divider valve configuration, and the results from the CFD analysis indicated a reduction by approximately 70 %...|$|E

50|$|The Presta valve (also called Sclaverand valve or French valve) is a valve {{commonly}} found in high pressure road style and some mountain bicycle inner tubes.

25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the <b>rim</b> piece. <b>Valve</b> holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|R
50|$|Thalassiosira weissflogii {{is a short}} {{cylinder}} {{in shape}} and varies in size from 4 to 32 µm in diameter. It tends to be larger in winter, typically 15 µm in diameter, but smaller in summer (5 µm). It occurs both singly and in groups and may be embedded in a gelatinous matrix. There is a silicaceous cell wall with two frustules or valves, a larger epivalve and a smaller hypovalve. The face of the valves vary in shape but are basically irregular rings with one labiate and two or more central processes. Other features that may be present include an irregularly shaped areola or pore, further processes on the <b>rim</b> of the <b>valves,</b> marginal spines, striations and thick radial ribs.|$|R
500|$|The {{shell of}} the Antarctic scallop grows to about [...] long and 7 {{centimetres}} wide and has a nearly circular outline.

50|$|The most {{conspicuous}} feature of flower urchins are their pedicellariae (stalked grasping appendages). Flower urchins possess {{four types of}} pedicellariae, distinguished by form and function, but only two are abundant. The first type are the ophicephalous pedicellariae. They resemble tube feet, except they end in three small claws (called valves) rather than suction cups. These are used to keep the body surface clear of algae, encrusting organisms, and unwanted debris. The second type are the globiferous pedicellariae which superficially resemble flowers (hence its common name). These are more specialized and are used for defense against predators and larger ectoparasites. Globiferous pedicellariae also end in a three-valved claw-like grasping appendage, like they do in ophicephalous pedicellariae, but they are much larger. The valves are connected to each other by a distinctive circular membrane around 4 to 5 mm in diameter. They are pinkish-white to yellowish-white in color with a central purple dot and a bright white <b>rim.</b> Each <b>valve</b> ends in a sharp fang-like tip which is capable of penetrating human skin. The base of the valves also house venom glands. Some authors further subdivide globiferous pedicellariae into two subtypes based on size - the trumpet pedicellariae and the giant pedicellariae. The other two types of pedicellariae - tridentate and triphyllous - are rare or restricted only to {{certain areas of the}} test.|$|R

40|$|In December 2007, a male {{equipment}} operator was fatally {{injured by}} a metal lock ring propelled from a multi-piece wheel tire assembly he was inflating. The victim was employed by an excavating and snow removal company. At {{the time of}} the incident, he and a co-worker were getting their loaders ready to remove snow from a shopping mall parking lot. Soon after he started his loader, the victim noticed that his left front tire mounted on a multi-piece wheel was “soft”(under-inflated). The multi-piece rim wheel referring to the tire assembly consisted of six components: the <b>rim</b> base, <b>valve</b> assembly, tire, side ring, O-ring and lock ring. The function of the lock ring was to hold the tire in place by locking and securing the other wheel components when the tire was inflated. The victim asked the co-worker, whose loader had an air compressor, to put air in the tire. The initial tire pressure was not checked. The co-worker connected one end of an air hose to the quick-connect fitting on the air compressor and the clip-on chuck at the other end to the valve stem of the tire. The co-worker then went to his loader’s cab and used the throttle control to maintain the airflow. The air hose did not have an in-line pressure gauge. The victim checked the air pressure at the tire valve with a hand-held pressure gauge periodically as the tire was being inflated. The maximum cold tire inflation pressure specified by the tire manufacturer was 35 pounds per square inch (psi). After a few minutes, the victi...|$|R
60|$|Exuviation; Rate of Growth; Size.--I {{have had}} {{occasion}} repeatedly to allude to the exuviation of the Lepadidæ: {{with the exception}} of the genus Lithotrya,[20] in which the calcareous scales on the peduncle, together with the membrane connecting them, is cast off, neither the valves nor the membrane uniting them, nor that forming the peduncle with its scales and styles, are moulted; but the surface gradually disintegrates and is removed, perhaps sometimes in flakes, whilst new and larger layers are formed beneath. In Scalpellum, I ascertained that the new membrane, connecting together the newly-formed calcified <b>rims</b> under the <b>valves</b> of the capitulum, was formed as a fold, with the articulated spines which it bears, all adpressed in certain definite directions. This fold of new membrane, when the old membrane splits and yields, of course expands, and thus the size of the capitulum is increased. In the peduncle, lines of splitting can seldom be perceived, except, indeed, in the sub-globular, embedded, downward-growing peduncle of Anelasma, as described under that genus. I do not understand what determines the complicated lines of splitting of the old membrane between the several valves of the capitulum,--without it be simply, that along these lines alone, the old membrane is not strengthened by the new membrane being closely applied under it, the new being formed, as we have just said, in a fold, in order to allow of increase in size. Although, as I believe, there is strictly no exuviation in the outer membranes of mature Lepadidæ, it seems that narrow strips of membrane are cast off from between the valves, for the few first moults, after the final metamorphosis of the larva. I may here remark that, in most sessile Cirripedes, the outside membrane connecting the operculum and shell, is regularly moulted.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the anatomical variability {{of the oval}} fossa in cases of atrial septal defect {{and to find out}} which factors might make such defects suitable or unsuitable for closure by umbrella or clamshell devices. DESIGN [...] 100 specimens with defects of the atrial septum within the oval fossa were studied, especially the position of the defects within the fossa; the area of the defect in relation to the total area of the oval fossa; the shape of the <b>rims</b> and flap <b>valve</b> of the oval fossa; and the anatomical variability in the eustachian and thebesian valves. RESULTS [...] The oval fossa was displaced to the mouth of the inferior caval vein in four cases; displaced to the mouth of superior caval vein in two cases; placed on the middle of the interatrial wall in 43; or placed slightly towards the inferior caval vein in 51. Because of their shape 29 of the hearts were considered to be unsuitable for transcatheter closure of the defect. This was because the defect was too large (16 hearts); the oval fossa was displaced to the mouth of the inferior caval vein (four hearts) or to the superior caval vein (two hearts); lacked its anterior rim (two hearts); lacked the posteroinferior rim (one heart); because a thick eustachian valve was displaced posteriorly forming a false posteroinferior rim (one heart); or because the strand of insertion of the floor of the oval fossa was too distant from the left atrial aspect (three hearts). CONCLUSION [...] 68 hearts appeared to be ideal candidates for transcatheter closure; 3 would probably have been suitable; but 29 were unsuitable. These morphological variations might explain why the procedure has been unsuccessful in so many cases. Patients should be screened before any attempt is made at transcatheter closure...|$|R
60|$|General Appearance.--Capitulum highly {{variable}} {{in all its}} characters; thick and broad in proportion to its length, but the breadth is variable,--in some specimens, the capitulum being longer by one-fifth of its total length than broad; in others, one-fifth broader than long. Valves generally approximate; in some varieties, however, from the narrowness of the carina and terga, the valves stand far apart, there being an interval between the carina and scuta of nearly half {{the breadth of the}} latter. Valves excessively thin, brittle, transparent, colourless, smooth, but generally sinuous along the zones of growth, which are conspicuous: valves generally covered throughout by thin chitine membrane, which is thickly clothed, especially in the interspaces between the valves, with minute spines, barely visible to the naked eye. Scuta with {{the lower part of the}} tergo-carinal margin extremely protuberant; occludent margin, more or less, but slightly reflexed, with a depressed line running from the umbo to the apex; basal margin much reflexed, but to a variable extent and at a varying angle, even up to a right angle,--an external rim or collar being thus formed. There are no distinct internal teeth, but the basal margin under the umbones, is more or less distinctly produced into a rounded disc or projection, which is generally not so much outwardly reflexed as the rest of the basal margin: there is no distinct internal basal <b>rim.</b> The primordial <b>valves</b> are generally visible, but they do not lie, as in all other species, close to the basal margin, but a little above it,--the lower reflexed portion having been subsequently developed. Terga flat, with the occludent margin slightly arched, and not, as in the foregoing species, formed of two sides; apex bent towards the carina; width of the lower half {{highly variable}}, owing to the varying extent to which the scutal margin is hollowed out; in some specimens, the whole lower half beneath the apex of the scuta is of nearly the same width throughout; in other specimens this lower part is spear-shaped. The widest part of the tergum either equals in width, or is only two-thirds of the width of the widest part of the carina beneath its umbo. Carina (Pl. I, fig. 6 a) highly variable in shape, with the part above the umbo either spear-shaped and slightly concave within, or nearly flat and furnished with a central external ridge; or the upper part (fig. 6 c) is of equal and extreme narrowness throughout, and deeply concave within, appearing as if only the central ridge had been developed. The part below the umbo, (answering to the fork in the foregoing species,) is about one-third of the length of the whole valve, and generally twice as wide as the upper part, but in the variety with the upper part of the carina equally narrow throughout, the lower part is thrice as wide as the upper; the disc, or lower part, is generally slightly concave within, exteriorly either with or without a central ridge; basal margin rounded; lateral margin more or less curved, according to the form of the upper part. The disc is not more deeply imbedded in membrane than is the upper part of the valve. The heel or umbo is either angular and prominent, or rounded. In very young specimens the carina is simply bowed, instead of being rectangularly bent.|$|R
