5000|$|More simply {{speaking}} {{for those who}} want a working definition of <b>reputation,</b> <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> the sum of impressions held by a company's stakeholders. In other words, <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> in the [...] "eyes of the beholder". It need not be just a company's <b>reputation</b> but could <b>be</b> the <b>reputation</b> of an individual, country, brand, political party, industry. But the key point in <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> not what the leadership insists but what others perceive it to be. For a company, its <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> how esteemed it is in the eyes of its employees, customers, investors, talent, [...] candidates, competitors, analysts, alumni, regulators and the list goes on.|$|R

30|$|Researchers {{have agreed}} that a {{favorable}} corporate <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} important intangible assets driving company performance (Chun 2005; Fisher-Buttinger and Vallaster 2011; Gibson et al. 2006). Not to be confused with brand identity and image, corporate <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> often defined as consumers’ accumulated opinions, perceptions, and attitudes towards the company (Fombrun et al. 2000; Fombrun and Shanley 1990; Hatch and Schultz 2001; Weigelt and Camerer 1988). In addition, corporate <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> established by individuals’ relative perspective; thus, corporate <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> closely linked to the consumers’ subjective evaluation about the company (Fombrun and Shanley 1990; Weigelt and Camerer 1988).|$|R

However, there are cohorts that converge to a convention exhibiting high levels of trust and trustworthiness in which behavior under <b>reputation</b> <b>is</b> indistinguishable from behavior under commitment...|$|R
5|$|Although his <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> {{unsettled}} {{during the}} following centuries and his descendants were not notable, he gained standing during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mindaugas was the only King of Lithuania; {{while most of the}} Lithuanian Grand Dukes from Jogaila onward also reigned as Kings of Poland, the titles remained separate. Now generally considered the founder of the Lithuanian state, he is also now credited with stopping the advance of the Tatars towards the Baltic Sea, establishing international recognition of Lithuania, and turning it towards Western civilization. In the 1990s the historian Edvardas Gudavičius published research supporting an exact coronation date – 6 July 1253. This day is now an official national holiday, Statehood Day.|$|E
5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> entrenched. Gaining {{exposure}} from a pavilion of his artwork set up {{near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received requests to make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E

40|$|Personal <b>reputations</b> <b>are</b> an {{important}} factor in trust. Prior work has focused on how favorable reputations lead to higher trust than unfavorable ones. In this paper, I examine the effects of other reputation dimensions on trust, specifically reputation breadth (how widespread the <b>reputation</b> <b>is)</b> and <b>reputation</b> consensus (how well agreed upon the <b>reputation</b> <b>is).</b> In two studies, I present participants with reputation information that varies in favorableness, breadth and / or consensus. I find that, for positive reputations, both breadth and consensus increase trust. For negative reputations, Employees frequently shift work relationships as they engage in project-based teams, rotate through departments, and advance in their careers (Burt, 2006; Kilduff, Tsai & Hanke, 2006). In such dynamic environments, personal <b>reputations</b> <b>are</b> importan...|$|R
5|$|Chadwick {{became a}} Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, with his {{appointment}} as Chaplain in 1946, and in 1950 {{advanced to the}} position of Dean. His rising academic <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> confirmed in 1953 with the publication of a project which had occupied him since the days of his curacy—his new translation of Origen's Contra Celsum, with introduction and notes. He had by now made himself an expert in Patristic Greek; only an inexactness in philology marking his earlier abandonment of Greek for music. Also in 1953 he was appointed co-editor (with Hedley Sparks) of the Journal of Theological Studies and continued editing it until 1985. He held the university appointment of Hulsean Lecturer from 1954–6.|$|E
5|$|Chroniclers Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto were {{generally}} unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but {{more tolerant of}} the earliest years of John's reign.

The Allison Incident, the slapping of an American consul by a Japanese soldier, further increased tensions with the United States.|$|E

Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad. Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works.

5|$|Knowing {{that his}} <b>reputation</b> <b>was</b> at stake {{following}} the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa {{moved quickly to}} a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E

Data from a specially designed survey carried out in 24 neighbourhoods in Utrecht, the fourth largest city in the Netherlands, are used.
