40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} umbilical arterial and venous pH {{and base}} deficit (pH(UA), pH(UV), BD(UA), and BD(UV), respectively), {{as well as}} venous-arterial pH differences, as measures of perinatal condition at birth (in relation to emergency intervention, <b>resuscitation,</b> facial <b>mask,</b> low Apgar, seizures, other cerebral problems or death); to investigate whether BD(UA) or pH(UA) better measures perinatal risk. STUDY DESIGN: A novel method (Event Rate Estimate (EveREst) plots) was used to analyze cord blood gases and perinatal outcomes of 34, 510 term singleton deliveries: cord blood gas values were grouped into exclusive quantiles (containing equal proportions of cases); the quantiles were plotted against per cent rates (event rates) for perinatal outcomes; the event rates for the different blood gases were compared using the χ² test for difference of proportions. RESULTS: Low pH(UA) predicts poor perinatal outcome better than or comparably to high BD(UA) : pH(UA) is significantly better than BD(UA) for predicting low Apgar, <b>resuscitation</b> and facial <b>mask</b> (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 05, and p< 0. 001, respectively). For seizures and other cerebral problems, low pH(UA) is better than high BD(UA) but the difference is not statistically significant. For death, both measures perform equally well. Interventions for the specific reason of "fetal distress" increased as pH(UA) decreased but only where electronic fetal monitoring was used. In acidemic neonates (pH(UA) ≤ 7. 05, n= 1752), significantly more cord prolapses and placenta abruptions were associated with large and small venous-arterial pH difference (pH(VAD)) respectively (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: EveREst plots display clearly the diagnostic value of cord gases. They allow for the easy identification of background rates and increases above background, thresholds of interest, and comparison of the blood gas measures. Overall pH(UA) is the best umbilical blood measure of perinatal outcome. BD(UA) is comparable or inferior. Extremes of pH(VAD) (large or small) identify higher proportions of specific poor outcomes in acidemic neonates...|$|R

40|$|Background: In pre-clinical animal studies, the {{uniformity}} of dosing across subjects and routes of administration {{is a crucial}} requirement. In preparation for a study in which aerosolized live-attenuated measles virus vaccine was administered to cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) by inhalation, we assessed the percentage of a nebulized dose inhaled under varying conditions. Methods: Drug delivery varies with breathing parameters. Therefore we determined macaque breathing patterns (tidal volume, breathing frequency, and inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio) {{across a range of}} 3. 3 - 6. 5 kg body weight, using a pediatric pneumotachometer interfaced either with an endotracheal tube or a facemask. Subsequently, these breathing patterns were reproduced using a breathing simulator attached to a filter to collect the inhaled dose. Albuterol was nebulized using a vibrating mesh nebulizer and the percentage inhaled dose was determined by extraction of drug from the filter and subsequent quantification. Results: Tidal volumes ranged from 24 to 46 mL, breathing frequencies from 19 to 31 breaths per minute and I:E ratios from 0. 7 to 1. 6. A small pediatric <b>resuscitation</b> <b>mask</b> was identified as the best fitting interface between animal and pneumotachometer. The average efficiency of inhaled dose delivery was 32. 1 % (standard deviation 7. 5, range 24 %- 48 %), with variation in tidal volumes as the most important determinant. Conclusions: Studies in non-human primates aimed at comparing aerosol delivery with other routes of administration should take both the inter-subject variation and relatively low efficiency of delivery to these low body weight mammals into account...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{presented}} bachelor thesis is ventilation support in prehospital care and during transport of the patient. Consciousness, breathing and blood circulation belong among basic life functions. Thanks to ventilation support {{we are able}} to provide full or partial pulmonary ventilation. For this we use aids such as <b>resuscitation</b> <b>masks</b> meant for lay public or aids for trained paramedics like laryngeal masks, endotracheal tube and ventilator for artificial pulmonary ventilation. Prehospital care is not only about professional first aid, but about giving first aid by lay public as well. That is why aids for pulmonary ventilation are included in this thesis. This bachelor thesis had two aims; to map and compare knowledge of students attending the last year of high school in kiss of life and map experiences of paramedics with a laryngeal mask Supreme and capnometry. The research was implemented with mixed method research. Knowledge of students were found out by tests which were give in class "Z 4 " at Střední odborná škola veterinární, mechanizační a zahradnická a Jazyková škola s právem státní jazykové zkoušy and in class " 4. B" Gymnázium Jírovcova. At Z 4 class research took place on 14 th March 2014. There were 25 students in this class, 4 men and 21 women. At class of 4. B students' knowledge was tested on 2 nd April 2014 with presence of 26 students, 16 women and 10 men. At the beginning of test the anonymity of respondents was stressed, and then all respondents were acquainted with the character of my research and its aim. At the start of the test there were two statistic questions; if the respondent is either man or woman and whether the respondent has his/her driving license. There were 15 closed questions in the test and students were supposed to choose one right. After handing all the tests, the correct results were told to students. 51 tests altogether were given. Experiences of paramedic with the laryngeal mask and capnometry were found out in a form of five short dialogues in a week from 7 th to 11 th April 2014. The research group include paramedics of Zdravotnická záchranná služba Jihočeského kraje. Gained data from tests were evaluated, each question separately and then transformed in graphs which show the number of wrong and right answers. The aim of this thesis was to map and compare knowledge of students {{in the last year of}} their studies. Evaluated tests show us, that students of Z 4 class have more knowledge about kiss of life or with cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In seven questions these students were more successful than their same-age colleagues from Gymnázium, who were better at three questions only. Experiences of paramedic with laryngeal masks Supreme are positive and if ensuring of air passages is needed, when a doctor is not present, they choose LMA Supreme. Paramedics agreed on that following ventilation via LMA Supreme is sufficient as long as we choose the right size. Paramedics ask for capnometer device in all cars EMS. Paramedics of the research group do not daily meet patients who would need or used at controlled ventilation. Students of the last year at high school have basic knowledge about kiss of life or about giving first aid. This knowledge is not 100 % and teaching of giving first aid should be as a subject at high schools. Paramedics accept new aids and machines and use them during their practise. Thanks to this, first aid is becoming more beneficial for patients and for paramedics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The CAREvent((R)) Public Access Resuscitator (PAR, O-Two Medical Technologies, Ontario, Canada) {{is a new}} oxygen-driven device {{alternating}} two ventilations with 15 prompts for chest compressions. The PAR {{is designed}} for use with a standard <b>resuscitation</b> face <b>mask</b> and is equipped with mask leakage and obstruction alarms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the quality of basic life support (BLS) by hospital nurses and to evaluate if BLS with the PAR is better than BLS using the mouth-to-mask technique. Methods: The study group consisted of 352 nurses from Ghent University Hospital working outside the critical care and emergency departments. BLS skills were measured using a Laerdal Skillreporter manikin (Laerdal, Norway) connected to a Laerdal PC Skillreporting system. To assess base line skills, 200 nurses were tested without previous notice in single rescuer BLS using a pocket mask (PM, Laerdal, Norway) or a bag-valve mask device (Laerdal, Norway) over a period of 2 min. A separate consecutive sample of 152 nurses was randomised to the PM or PAR groups after a standard BLS refresher course. The PAR group received a short period of training in PAR use. Immediately after training,, both groups performed the 2 min single rescuer BLS test. Results: Unprepared nurses achieved only 26 compressions and 3 ventilations/min. Immediately after training, nurses using the PAR delivered 54 compressions/min as opposed to 35 for the PM group (p < 0. 0001). PAR users ventilated six times/min compared to five times for PM users (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Immediately after training, the use of the PAR improved BLS performance by ward nurses significantly, bringing the number of ventilations and compressions per minute close to the theoretical maximum achievable within the current guidelines. Retention tests after 6 and 12 months will show if the effect is sustained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background Although the {{effectiveness}} of community mobilisation and promotive care delivered by community health workers in reducing perinatal and neonatal mortality is well established, {{evidence in support of}} home-based neonatal resuscitation and infection management is mixed. We assessed {{the effectiveness}} of adding training in neonatal bag and <b>mask</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and oral antibiotic therapy for suspected neonatal infections to a basic preventive and promotive interventions package delivered by public sector community-based lady health workers (LHWs) in rural Pakistan. Methods We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in two subdistricts of Naushahro Feroze in rural Sindh, Pakistan, between April 15, 2009, and Dec 10, 2012. LHWs, trained in basic newborn resuscitation and in recognition and treatment (with oral amoxicillin) of suspected neonatal respiratory infections, were linked with traditional birth attendants and encouraged to attend home births. Control clusters received routine care through the existing national programme. The primary outcome was all-cause neonatal mortality. Independent data collection teams recorded data for all pregnancies and their outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and household practices related to maternal and newborn care. Findings Of the 27 randomised clusters with functional LHW programmes, 13 were allocated to the intervention group (n= 242   749) and 14 to the control group (n= 256   985).

40|$|AIM: To {{review the}} {{literature}} surrounding {{various aspects of}} T-piece resuscitator use, with particular emphasis on the evidence comparing the device to other manual ventilation devices in neonatal resuscitation. DATA SOURCES: The Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane databases were searched in April 2011. Ongoing trials were identified using www. clinicaltrials. gov and www. controlled-trials. com. Additional studies from reference lists of eligible articles were considered. All studies including T-piece resuscitator use were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirty studies were included. There were two randomised controlled trials in newborn infants comparing the devices, one of which addressed short and intermediate term morbidity and mortality outcomes and found {{no difference between the}} T-piece resuscitator and self inflating bag. From manikin studies, advantages to the T-piece resuscitator include the delivery of inflating pressures closer to predetermined target pressures with least variation, the ability to provide prolonged inflation breaths and more consistent tidal volumes. Disadvantages include a technically more difficult setup, more time required to adjust pressures during <b>resuscitation,</b> a larger <b>mask</b> leak and less ability to detect changes in compliance. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for appropriately designed randomised controlled trials in neonates to highlight the efficacy of one device over another. Until these are performed, healthcare providers should be appropriately trained {{in the use of the}} device available in their departments, and be aware of its own limitations...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of {{a cohort of}} very low risk pregnancies in hospital, that would be suitable for home delivery. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken of computerised records covering five years from July 1988 to August 1993 of 32424 pregnant women who delivered at the North Staffordshire Maternity Hospital, Stoke on Trent, during that period. RESULTS: Of 32424 deliveries, only 1314 (4 %) fulfilled our criteria for being low risk. Sixty seven (5. 1 %) of the low risk group had an operative delivery, with Caesarean section accounting for 32 (2. 4 %) cases, 16 (23. 9 %) babies were resuscitated and three were intubated. A normal vaginal delivery occurred in 1245 women, but a paediatrician attended 122 births (9. 22 %), assisted ventilation was provided in 65 cases (5. 2 %), and five babies were intubated (0. 4 %). Fourteen babies in total were admitted to the neonatal unit and one died. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that at least 5 % of women suitable for delivery at home will require transfer in labour. Midwives attending home births must be skilled in bag and <b>mask</b> <b>resuscitation</b> as only rarely will an urgent intubation be required. The British Paediatric Association Working Party report on neonatal resuscitation suggests a need for resuscitation in only 0. 2 % of low risk deliveries: but {{these findings suggest that}} the need is greater...|$|R
40|$|Background: Historically, {{there were}} some {{difficulties}} in saving patients’ lives in many cases such as diseases in which the patients were unable to managed for airway <b>resuscitation.</b> The laryngeal <b>mask</b> airway (LMA) has traditionally been used to secure the patients airway and maintain spontaneous ventilation during short outpatient surgical procedures in which general anesthesia required. To continue this practice at FMIC, Kabul, {{this study was conducted}} to identify the outcome of LMA among children of Kabul, Afghanistan, at FMIC. Objective: This research study was conducted to identify the outcomes of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) application during ventilation among children at FMIC Institute, Afghanistan. Methodology: A descriptive Case series study design was employed to study research question. The study population comprised of all the children undergoing laryngeal mask airway (LMA) application during surgery at FMIC, Afghanistan from January 2015 till August 2016 and the data collection was done from the file records from July till August 2016. The information was also collected after reviewing the history of LMA. This study was conducted at French Medical Institute for Children (FMIC), Kabul Afghanistan. FMIC is a children 2 ̆ 7 s hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, established in 2005 and is ISO 9001 : 2008 accredited, and was the first medical centre to receive this accreditation in 2009. The sample size for this study was calculated by using the statistical method of Epi-Info software 2000. The data was entered in SPSS version 23. Discriptive analysis was mainly done to estimate the proportion of the outcomes among those who had LMA during proceudres from 2015 till 2016.

40|$|Some 5 - 15 % of {{children}} aged 3 to 15 years in both developing and developed countries suffer from mental handicaps. There {{may be as}} many as 10 - 30 million severely and about 60 - 80 million mildly or moderately mentally retarded children in the world. The conditions causing mental handicaps are largely preventable through primary health care measures in developing countries. Birth asphyxia and birth trauma are the leading causes of mental handicaps in developing countries where over 1. 2 million newborns die each year from moderate or severe asphyxia and an equal number survive with severe morbidity due to brain damage. The other preventable or manageable conditions are: infections such as tuberculous and pyogenic meningitides and encephalopathies associated with measles and whooping cough; severe malnutrition in infancy; hyperbilirubinaemia in the newborn; iodine deficiency; and iron deficiency anaemia in infancy and early childhood. In addition, recent demographic and socioeconomic changes and {{an increase in the number}} of working mothers tend to deprive both infants and young children of stimulation for normal development. To improve this situation, the primary health care approach involving families and communities and instilling the spirit of self-care and self-help is indispensable. Mothers and other family members, traditional birth attendants, community health workers, as well as nurse midwives and physicians should be involved in prevention and intervention activities, for which they should be trained and given knowledge and skills about appropriate technologies such as the risk approach, home-based maternal record, partograph, mobilogram (kick count), home-risk card, icterometer, and mouth-to-mask or bag and <b>mask</b> <b>resuscitation</b> of the newborn. Most of these have been field-tested by WHO and can be used in the home, the health centre or day care centres to detect and prevent the above-mentioned conditions which can cause mental handicap...|$|R

In the intervention group, LHWs did 80 % of the planned community mobilisation sessions, but were able to attend only 1184 (14 %) of 8425 deliveries and 4318 (25 %) of 17   288 neonatal visits within 72 h of birth (p< 0 · 0001 for both variables compared with the control group). The neonatal mortality rate was 42 deaths per 1000 livebirths in intervention clusters compared with 55 per 1000 in the control group (risk ratio 0 · 80, 95 % CI 0 · 68 – 0 · 93; p= 0 · 005). Interpretation: The reduction in neonatal mortality in intervention clusters occurred against a background of improvements in domiciliary practices for maternal and newborn care. However, the poor reach of LHWs in accessing newborn infants at birth and in the early postnatal period underscores the limitations of tasking community health workers in public sector programmes working in similar circumstances with such complex interventions. Such community-based interventions in health systems should be accompanied by concerted efforts to improve quality of care in facilities and referral systems.
