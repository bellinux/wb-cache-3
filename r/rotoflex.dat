2500|$|By far {{the most}} {{significant}} change to the Mark IV was to the rear suspension, which was de-cambered and redesigned to incorporate what Triumph called a [...] "Swing Spring". With this system one leaf was eliminated from the stack and only the bottom leaf was attached rigidly to the differential. The remaining leafs were mounted such {{that they were able}} to pivot freely. With this change Triumph was able to eliminate the worst characteristics of the original swing-axle design. This was a different approach than that taken with the Triumph GT6 Mk II (GT6+) and Triumph Vitesse Mark 2, both of which received new lower wishbones and <b>Rotoflex</b> half-shaft couplings. In either case the result on all these cars was safe and progressive handling even at the limit.|$|E
50|$|The giubo is {{believed}} first {{to have been}} used for this purpose on the Alfa Romeo model 1900, produced between 1950 and 1959. As used on several British cars, such as the Hillman Imp, Triumph GT6 MKII/GT6+, Lotus Elan and some early versions of the Land Rover Discovery, the item is known as a <b>Rotoflex</b> coupling.. The Porsche 917 used a Giubo centered on the rear half-shaft, but in a manner that did not require the joint to laterally flex.|$|E
50|$|Triumph {{realised}} {{that they}} needed to find an answer to the handling problem, if only to maintain their reputation in the USA. Their response came with the 1969 model year, with the introduction of the GT6 Mk II, known in the States as the GT6+. The rear suspension was significantly re-engineered using reversed lower wishbones and <b>Rotoflex</b> driveshaft couplings, taming the handling and turning the Triumph into an MGB beater. The Vitesse was also modified, but the Spitfire had to wait until 1970 for any improvements to be made.|$|E

50|$|The Vitesse Mark 2 was {{launched}} in October 1968 as the final update to the Vitesse range. Essentially intended to be Triumph's answer to growing criticism of the rear suspension, the Mark 2 was fitted with a redesigned layout using new lower wishbones and <b>Rotoflex</b> half-shaft couplings. This system, also shared with the new GT6 MKII (GT6+ in the US market), and the first GT6 MkIIIs, tamed the wayward handling and endowed the Vitesse with more firm, progressive roadholding. The solid swing axles of the Herald and earlier Vitesses had camber changes of some 15 degrees from the limits of travel. By adding the lower wishbone and the divided drive shaft whilst retaining the transverse leaf spring as the top link, this camber change was reduced to about 5 degrees. While this was a considerable improvement, {{it was still a}} system that struggled to keep up with a really good link-located live axle (such as Triumph would introduce on the Toledo, 1500TC and later Dolomite saloons).|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} was {{determined}} the influence of alloying ele-ments on changes in the structure and properties of the selected grade of fine grained steel. The main objective of research that was carried out, was to provide independent results to the com-pany which uses Hardox 400 and 450 steel {{in the construction of}} semi-trailers. To this end, researches of selected mechani-cal properties and fatigue tests were carried out. For this pur-pose, samples were prepared for fatigue research on the device <b>Rotoflex</b> for Hardox 400 and 450 and as reference samples for S 355 J 2 steel, which is also used in the construction of semi-trailers by Wielton S.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of fatigue tests carried out on STRENX-type high-strength cold forming steel. For high-cycle fatigue tests carried out using low cycle loading frequencies of around 30 Hz, a <b>ROTOFLEX</b> machine was used. For ultra high-cycle tests, a KAUP-ZU testing machine was employed, which enables fatigue tests to be performed with symetric specimen loading (R = - 1) and at a frequency of f ≈ 20 kHz. The relationships σ a = f(N) were determined experimentally in the high and ultra high-cycle region for STRENX high-strength steel. To determine the fatigue crack initiation mechanism, the fractographic analysis of fatigue fractures was made...|$|E

Briefly, 2  mM hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (HAuCl 4 : 3 H 2 O, Sigma Aldrich) and 1  mM sodium thiosulfate (Na 2 S 2 O 3, Sigma Aldrich) were prepared in Milli-Q water in amber bottles {{and allowed to}} age for 3  days prior to synthesis. Na 2 S 2 O 3 {{was added to the}} HAuCl 4 in a round bottom flask under mild stirring at room temperature (25  °C) and allowed to react for 1  h at a volumetric ratio of 1.03 : 1, forming the GGS NP. For temperature studies, the nanoparticles were similarly prepared but stirring occurred on either a hot plate (50  °C), under refrigeration (4  °C), or on ice (0  °C). All nanoparticle samples were centrifuged twice at 3200 [*]g for 40  min, and pellets were resuspended in H 2 O to a final optical density (OD) of 1.3. Particles were PEGylated by mixing 1  mL of 250  mM PEG-SH (Laysan Bio 2000 MW) in ultrapure water with 9  mL of the nanoparticle suspension on ice, followed by constant agitation overnight at 4  °C (<b>Rotoflex).</b> PEGylated particles were centrifuged at 3200 [*]g for 40  min at 10  °C to remove excess PEG and were stored in the refrigerator at 4  °C until further use.|$|E
40|$|This work forms {{part of a}} large EU funded project, <b>RotoFlex,</b> {{which aims}} to develop an {{automated}} filling system for the rotational moulding process. As part of that project it was necessary to (i) assess how material may sag or flow during the filling stage of the multilayer moulding process (ii) investigate methods to reinforce mouldings using glass fibres (iii) investigate methods to reinforce mouldings using layered silicate nanoclays. As a means of characterising material sagging, a test method based on rotational rheometry and actual sagging measurements has been developed. The data from these tests was used to formulate a simple model to predict flow or material sag with time. A comparison with experimental results shows that the prediction is under estimated by about 18 %. It found that the extent of sagging is proportional to the initial layer thickness, time of holding mould stationary, and temperature, whereas it is inversely correlated with the viscosity of polymer. Guidelines for designing sag-free moulding and a method for recovery of the sagged material have also been developed. In {{the second part of the}} work the effect of different glass fibres (treated and untreated), compatibiliser (different MFI and MAH level) and composite preparation methods (with or without pre-compounding) on the performance of the rotationally moulded composites was investigated and results are repOlied in term of morphology, rheological and mechanical properties; The composites made with pre-compounded composite powder have superior tensile and impact properties to those made with pellets. A single layer composite moulding with 35 wt% of glass fibre exhibited a 160 to 170 % increase in flexural modulus, and 158 to 176 % in tensile modulus compared with the unfilled polyethylene. In the third section of the work to determine how layered silicate nanoclays can be introduced into rotationally moulded parts to improve mechanical performance different clays (Cloisite 20 A and Somasif MTE) ~ [...] [...] - and base resins (high and low viscosity polyethylene, nylon 11) were examined. The incorporation of nanoclays into the resins has the effect of increasing the zero shear viscosity of the molten material. This had a detrimental effect on the ability of the polymer to sinter properly and for bubble dissolution and hence reduced mechanical properties. Increasing compatibiliser:clay ratio in the polyethylene matrix increases exfoliation but also increased the zero shear viscosity and results in lower performance compared with the lower compatibiliser:clay ratios. The nylon 111 nanoclay system exhibited the best enhancement in tensile modulus with a maximum 140 % increase at a nanoclay loading of 10 wt% compared with a maximum increase of 39 % for the polyethylene/nanoclay system at 5 wt% nanoclay. The Halpin-Tsai model predictions for the modulus were in good agreement with experimental results for nylon/clay system up to 10 wt% of clay concentration. In all cases, the impact performance decreased as reinforcing agent was addedEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
