50|$|The {{mechanical}} components, including engine, suspension, and transmission, {{could be}} drawn from the Ford Pinto, Mercury Bobcat, or Ford Mustang II. Based on these donor choices, the suspension is relatively unsophisticated, with a solid <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> on quarter-elliptical leaf springs. The donor leaf springs are cut approximately in half, with just one of the halves {{on each side of the}} differential making up the rear springing. The <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> is actually <b>mounted</b> above the side rails of the frame, which keeps the frame design simple but limits the axle's vertical range of movement. The front suspension is a somewhat sportier double-wishbone design, built from the donor car's lower A-arm and a custom upper A-arm, with coil-over shocks and the donor's disk brakes.|$|R
50|$|The 1,087 cc {{four-cylinder engine}} had {{hemispherical}} combustion chambers with the valves inclined at 45 degrees in a crossflow head. To save the expense and complication of overhead camshafts, the valves were operated by two camshafts mounted {{high in the}} crankcase through short pushrods and rockers. The engine was mounted in the chassis by a rubber bushed bar that ran through the block with a further mount {{at the rear of}} the gearbox. Drive was to the rear wheels through a torque tube and spiral bevel live <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> <b>mounted</b> on semi elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|The E28 uses {{independent}} {{front and}} <b>rear</b> suspension.The front <b>axle</b> is a dual joint axle, the wheels are suspended by MacPherson struts with double-acting shock absorbers and coil springs. They {{are supported by}} transverse and trailing links. A torsion spring acts as a stabiliser. The <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> is <b>mounted</b> on a delta beam that {{is connected to the}} body with three screws in rubber bearings, that have longitudinal play. Like the front wheels, the rear wheels are suspended by MacPherson struts, however, they are supported by diagonal links instead. The 528i and M535i have an additional torsion spring as a stabiliser for their <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> as well.|$|R
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{companies}} offered four-wheel-drive conversions, such as County Tractors of Knighton in Powys, who converted vans {{on behalf of}} Ford as a Special Vehicle Operations factory option. The first Transit County models {{were based on the}} Mk2 Transit model, both long and short wheelbase. The conversion used a Dana 44F front axle and a NP208 transfer box, both lifted from the Ford Bronco, coupled to the regular Transit engine, gearbox and <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> using three custom propshafts. The Transit <b>rear</b> <b>axle</b> was retained, <b>mounted</b> to a rear subframe or 'lift cradle' to give the extra ride height. Other modifications were 16-inch wheel rims, locking front hubs, a heavy-duty steering box and 305 mm diameter front brake discs.|$|R
50|$|The 120 series {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with a six-cylinder in-line engine (as opposed to the four-cylinder Steyr 100) driving the rear wheels via a four-speed transmission. Front wheels had a transverse leaf spring suspension while the <b>rear</b> swing <b>axle</b> was <b>mounted</b> on quarter-elliptic leaf springs. On the four-door sedan model the rear doors were hinged at the back-end (known as suicide doors), allowing the B-pillar to be omitted. By 1936 a total of 1200 Steyr 120 Super had been produced.|$|R

50|$|Joubert and White {{began the}} {{manufacture}} of high-grade buckboards in Glens Falls in 1865. They were the innovators and inventors of a famous model that was known for its suspension system and was sought by many wealthy people here and abroad. Notable owners of the buckboard included Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor, J. Pierpont Morgan, Louis Tiffany, Spencer Trask, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. A standard buckboard was constructed by running two planks of wood between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>axles</b> and <b>mounting</b> the passenger seat body on the planks. The only shock absorption was in {{the flexibility of the}} planks. When riding on the rough roads of their day, passengers felt like they were riding a bucking horse, hence the name. Joubert devised a way to attach two steel leaf springs, bowed upwards to the planks, with the passenger seat attached {{to the top of the}} springs. The seats moved vertically on the springs and also rocked forward and back, making for a more cushioned ride. In 1880, Joubert patented his suspension design in 1880. Some 50 carriage and sleigh models by Joubert and White were considered to be of superior quality. A good buggy would sell for $50 to $75, while the Joubert and White buckboard might cost $500 to $800 with some as high as $1000 or more if customized.|$|R

The diesel and larger capacity petrol engines are canted {{as far back as}} possible in the engine bay, in an effort to put as much weight as possible behind the front axle line, also reducing the centre of gravity, while improving weight distribution and minimising understeer.|$|R
