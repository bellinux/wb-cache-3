5000|$|Within {{a couple}} of years Scientific American took notice, and printed the {{following}} praise for Whitehill's design, especially for its powertrain: Of Vibrating ShuttlesThese are shuttles of the long description, moving in a segment of a circle. There are several varieties. The most novel machine of this kind is the vibrating shuttle machine just produced by the Singer Manufacturing Company. In this case the shuttle itself consists of a steel tube, into the open end of which the wound reel is dropped, and is free to revolve quite loosely. Variation of tension is thus obviated in a very simple manner. The chief point of interest in the machine is undoubtedly the means employed in transferring the motion from the main shaft to the underneath parts, an arrangement as ingenious and effective as any device ever introduced into stitching mechanism. It is the invention of Mr. Robert Whitehall sic, and consists of a vertical <b>rocking</b> <b>shaft</b> situated in the arm of the machine. Motion is imparted to it by means of an elbow formed upon the main shaft acting upon two arms, called wipers, projecting from the <b>rocking</b> <b>shaft,</b> the angle formed by the arms exactly coinciding with that of the elbow in its revolution.This admirable motion will no doubt attract much attention from mechanists and engineers.|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} large {{diameter}} bored piles socketed into rock has emphasized considerable attention in sedimentary rocks. However, the design only has been occasionally addressed in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Design methods {{based on the}} performance of sockets in sedimentary rocks have been proposed in literature, but it is uncertain how applicable they are to other rock types. This paper attempts to review the applicability of the formulae published in the literature in granite formation of Malaysia. A program of field testing tests was conducted to measure the axial response of bored piles. A total of 15 bored piles of diameter varying from 1000 mm to 1500 mm were constructed in decomposed granite using techniques including advancing of temporary casing and with drilling slurry composed of bentonite fluids. These bored piles were tested with static load test and high strain load dynamic test to verify its integrity and performance and the results of the load tests were evaluated in this study. The results demonstrate that method proposed by Horvath & Kenny gives the best prediction of <b>rock</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance for decomposed granite. The trend of the rock discontinuities were also scattered with relationship to <b>rock</b> <b>shaft</b> resistance and <b>rock</b> compressive strength although proportional increase of rock compressive strength with rock quality designation was observed.

5000|$|The first {{locomotive}} of Class 9P {{to be built}} was costed at £5,871. The four cylinders had a bore of 16 in and {{a stroke}} of 26 in. They were set in line (like the LNWR Claughton Class), with the inside cylinders driving the front coupled axle, and the outside cylinders driving the middle coupled axle (like the GWR Star Class). The 8 in piston valves were actuated by two sets of Stephenson valve gear, mounted inside the frames and operating the valves of the outside cylinders through <b>rocking</b> <b>shafts</b> placed behind the cylinders. These <b>rocking</b> <b>shafts</b> caused the two valves on each side to move forwards and backwards together, and since the inside and outside cylinders on each side were out of phase by 180°, the valves of the outside cylinders were arranged for outside admission, instead of the normal inside admission layout.

5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive <b>rock.</b> <b>Shafts</b> were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through the shafts and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|R

40|$|Disposal {{of highly}} {{radioactive}} waste (HLW) can be environmentally acceptable if radionuclides are kept {{isolated from the}} groundwater, which has inspired planners of repositories to work out multibarrier concepts that postulate defined functions of the host rock and engineered waste confinements. Assessment {{of the role of}} the host rock involves groundwater flow modelling and rock mechanical analysis, which are both highly speculative and ignore future changes in rock structure, stress conditions, and groundwater flow. Widening the perspective by considering the integrated physical performance of contacting geological strata respecting groundwater flow conditions can provide excellent isolation of HLW with a minimum of engineered barriers as illustrated by the principle of very deep boreholes (VDH) for which the very high salt content of deep water is the primary barrier by maintaining possibly contaminated groundwater at depth. Such isolation of groundwater regimes can also be obtained by constructing relatively shallow repositories in crystalline rock covered by clay-containing sedimentary rock in regions with no or very low hydraulic gradients. The paper describes a possible case of this type, showing that effective isolation of HLW in repositories of commonly discussed types, KBS- 3 H and VDH, can be achieved under present climatic conditions. The paper compares the short- and long-term functions of repositories located at the southern end of the Swedish island Gotland, being an example of desired geological conditions that are found also in other parts of Sweden and in Lithuania, Germany, Holland and the UK. Here, 500 m of sediment rock series cover gneiss bedrock in which a KBS- 3 H repository of SKB-type can be built under virtually “dry” conditions because of the tightness of the overlying sedimentary rock and lack of hydraulic gradients in the crystalline <b>rock.</b> <b>Shafts</b> leading down from the ground surface to the repository level are constructed by use of freezing technique and lined with low-pH concrete before installation of waste after which they have to be sealed with expanding clay. Use of initially largely water-saturated clay provides suitable physical properties of the embedment of waste containers. Alternatively, a VDH repository consisting of a number of steep 4 km deep boreholes with about 8 oo mm diameter can be driven for installing waste below 2 km depth, leaving the upper 2 km for sealing with clay. The geological conditions, which are also believed to provide acceptable rock pressure conditions for construction of a KBS- 3 H repository at about 600 m depth, are believed to be suitable for the construction and short- and long-term performance of either repository type. ...|$|R

Although the shafts are of varying heights, the columns are ingeniously arranged to support fallen arches harmoniously. The height difference is compensated by the development of variable bases, capitals and crossbeams a number of these crossbeams are in cedar wood.
