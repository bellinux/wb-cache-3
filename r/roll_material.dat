Microstructure evolution during ECAP and subsequent annealing was investigated. The deformed and annealed states were characterized by EBSD, TEM and microhardness tests.

40|$|Asymmetric rolling (ASR) {{was applied}} to {{aluminium}} alloy AA 6016 with various circumferential velocity ratios between {{the top and bottom}} rolls. This gives rise to intense plastic shear strains, and in turn the shear deformation textures through the sheet thickness. The developed texture in asymmetrically <b>rolled</b> <b>materials</b> is weaker in comparison to that produced during conventional rolling. The recrystallization texture in asymmetrically <b>rolled</b> <b>materials</b> is also considerably weaker than that in conventionally rolled one. With proper design of the ASR parameters, the shear deformation textures are still present in recrystallized materials after final heat treatment (SSHT). The presence of the shear texture orientations significantly improves both the average r and Delta r values. Furthermore, with 20 % ASR reduction and annealing, an average grain size is approximately 3 times smaller in comparison to that observed in conventionally <b>rolled</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R

Processing included isothermal rolling of an extruded bar to large strain values. As a result of rolling at 500 C, strength was increased, but with a substantial loss of ductility. Further strengthening was realized by rolling at 350 C and no further ductility loss was seen.
