5|$|Coggins {{was born}} in London, England on July 10, 1911, {{the only child of}} Ethel May (née Dobby) and Sydney George Coggins. Sydney Coggins was Regimental Corporal Major of the First Regiment of Life Guards, the part of the Household Cavalry {{responsible}} for guarding the British Monarch; Jack Coggins {{was born in}} his father's barracks. During World War I, Sydney Coggins served with, and was commissioned by the regiment. After the war, he was appointed regimental <b>Riding</b> <b>Master,</b> but he was retired when the 1st and 2nd Life Guards were amalgamated into a single regiment under the Geddes Axe. A fellow officer, married to an American steel heiress, offered Sydney work as a secretary to his wife, and the Coggins family emigrated to Long Island, New York in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Deployed in India, Nolan was {{eventually}} made the regimental <b>riding</b> <b>master</b> and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials {{to evaluate the}} use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.|$|E
5|$|His {{attachment}} to the Maidstone depot gave Nolan the opportunity to further study and practice cavalry theory; he met several other officers with a similar interest, including Captain Key, with whom he became close friends. By 1842 his time at Maidstone had ended, and he departed for India in October, arriving at Madras on 9 May 1843. The 15th Light Dragoons were stationed in Bangalore, a relatively peaceful area, and Nolan did not see action during his time there. He was appointed regimental <b>riding</b> <b>master</b> on 13 August 1844, in recognition of his expertise at horsemanship. In his spare time, Nolan raced his horse Arab Beauty. At the Bangalore Cantonment Races in October 1846, he placed second in two races, and won both the Galloway Stakes and Ladies' Purse. A year later he entered Sahagun, without success.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1931, Le Goff's {{father was}} a French cavalry officer. Jack began riding early, and during his teenage years competed as a steeplechase jockey, as well as showing in dressage, showjumping, and eventing. At the age of seventeen, {{after the death of}} his father, Le Goff joined the French {{military}} and began riding for Cadre Noir, the national riding academy. After his training, he became a <b>riding</b> <b>master</b> at the school and he remained in this position for a decade. As a French soldier he fought in the Algerian War after his appearance in the 1960 Olympic Games. Le Goff competed in two Olympic Games, in 1960 and 1964. In 1960, at the Roma Games, he finished sixth individually and helped the French team to a bronze medal. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, he finished twenty-third individually, while the French team came in eighth. He was also the French national eventing champion in 1956 and 1964. He is survived by his three children Martine, Dominique and Cyrille with Pauline Kralicek, two children Florence and Corinne with Marie-Madeleine Giraud, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren along with his long-time companion Susan Smith.|$|E
500|$|As regimental <b>riding</b> <b>master</b> he {{introduced}} substantial {{changes to the}} cavalry training programme, reintroducing the use of leaping bars, training individual soldiers before teaching formation riding to entire squads, and appointing a dedicated soldier in each troop who was trained to break in new horses. Over {{the next few years}} the regiment's standard of horsemanship rose, increasing Nolan's reputation. When the regiment was inspected by Major General John Aitchison, a man known for his high standards, he wrote that: ...|$|E

The Virginia Minstrels probably made [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] {{a regular part of}} their show beginning with their first performance at the Bowery Amphitheatre on February 6, 1843. Their minstrel show also included a comic scene loosely based on the song, [...] "Dan Tucker on Horseback", about a black <b>riding</b> <b>master.</b> The piece starred Richard Pelham in the title role and Frank Brower as a black clown. [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] did not appear on a Virginia Minstrels playbill until a March 7 and 8 performance at Boston's Masonic Temple.

5|$|Despite the {{negative}} associations with service there, Nolan had deliberately {{transferred to a}} regiment operating in India. He initially travelled to Maidstone, where the 15th maintained a troop to train new recruits, {{under the command of}} Captain George Key. He then caught a troopship to Bombay, the Malabar, which arrived on 9 November. Soon after arrival he fell ill and was granted two years of sick leave, starting from 26 March 1840, and returned to Britain. He returned to active service in June 1841, again to the Maidstone depot, and became a Lieutenant on the 19th. He went on leave again in August to take the <b>riding</b> <b>master's</b> course and exam, and returned on 8 March 1842, newly qualified.|$|R
