For this purpose I have paid most {{attention}} to his collection of short stories What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, which is generally considered to be his most minimalistic work. In my analysis I have to some extent applied minimalist theory, but my main focus throughout the thesis was to show how three significant aspects of <b>Carver</b> <b>s</b> fiction, namely omissions, epiphanies and endings, are connected with his distinctive form of minimalism. This approach allowed me to keep a primary focus on his texts. I felt {{that it was important to}} look closely at omissions because they are one the most prominent features in What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. When one compares a story from this collection to another version of the same story, which I have done with The Bath and A Small, Good Thing, (the latter from Cathedral) one discovers how much information Carver actually leaves out of his stories when he is at his most minimalistic. In the chapter about omissions, I have also analyzed Tell The Women We re Going and So Much Water So Close To Home where I have applied Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan s theory on gaps to the stories. In the chapter on epiphanies I wanted to show that, contrary to what many critics have claimed, <b>Carver</b> <b>s</b> epiphanic moments actually accentuate his minimalism and are therefore an integral part of his writings. Here I will look closer at the arrested epiphany, the comic epiphany, and the ironized epiphany in connection with the stories I Could See The Smallest Things, The Third Thing That Killed My Father Off and A Serious Talk. In the last chapter, I discuss <b>Carver</b> <b>s</b> open endings and how they contribute to his minimalism. I have looked at the signals of closure in three stories; Sacks, Gazebo and Viewfinder. However, what soon became clear to me was that some of <b>Carver</b> <b>s</b> endings were in fact so open that the theory could not be applied to the stories. What I have tried to do in those cases is to modify the theory to fit <b>Carver</b> <b>s</b> fiction...|$|R

40|$|Esta dissertação analisa o universo discursivo das obras de <b>Raymond</b> <b>Carver,</b> focando-se especialmente no silêncio e em como ele cria mecanismos de significação nos contos do autor. O objetivo {{principal}} é analisar a presença recorrente, nos contos de Carver, de personagens que podem ser classificados, culturalmente, como losers. Para embasar este trabalho, amparo-me nas teorias da Análise do Discurso Francesa e em seus pressupostos acerca do sujeito, história e língua. A questão do silêncio é analisada tomando como base as teorias desenvolvidas por Orlandi. Espera-se concluir que os personagens de <b>Raymond</b> <b>Carver,</b> no decorrer da carreira do autor, evoluem, passando de excluídos, sem voz e sem poder de discurso — características marcantes na fase minimalista; para uma fase de maior autonomia discursiva e inclusão social — mais frequente na fase final da sua carreira. This dissertation {{analyzes the}} discursive universe {{of the fictional}} works of <b>Raymond</b> <b>Carver,</b> focusing specially {{in the role of}} silence and on how it creates mechanisms of signification in the short stories of the author. The main goal of this dissertation is to analyze the recurrent presence, in the short stories of <b>Raymond</b> <b>Carver,</b> of characters that can be classified, culturally, as ―losers‖. To support this paper, I use the theories of French Discourse Analysis and its presuppositions about language, subject and history. The issue of silence is analyzed with the endorsement of the theories developed by Eni Orlandi. I expect to conclude that the characters of <b>Raymond</b> <b>Carver,</b> throughout the career of the author, evolve, passing from excluded subjects who have no voice and no discursive authority — characteristics that are evident in the minimalist phase of the author; to a phase where the characters have a more significant discursive autonomy and social inclusion — characteristics that are more frequent in the final phase of Carver‘s career...|$|R
