5|$|Ideas for a {{film about}} the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were {{proposed}} as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, made it his life's mission {{to tell the story}} of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the {{responsibility}} to keep possession of the ball {{in order to stop}} opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> shot on goal, their hands are near or above the surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately in order to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.|$|E

25|$|Although she {{had tried}} for several years to shed her image as a porn star, Chambers {{returned}} to the adult film industry with 1980's Insatiable. In the film she played actress, model, and heiress Sandra Chase, whose appetite for sex is, as the title suggests, insatiable. Sandra is getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie and her manager, played by Jessie St. James, is working on getting some big names to appear alongside Sandra. The story is told {{in a series of}} flashbacks which detail Sandra's sexual encounters.|$|E
25|$|Villers {{covered his}} men behind a ravelin of the wall, which had also a moat, and {{reinforced}} his weak flank with some baggage wagons. Sancho Dávila {{was unable to}} reach such positions with his cavalry due to the rough groves, so he called Sancho de Londoño to come rapidly with the infantry. By early afternoon, the 300 German pikemen were detached behind the ravelin to prevent any attempt to flee, while 600 Spaniards, organized in five flags and under the personal leadership of Londoño, were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> frontal attack over the fort, which they did shortly thereafter.|$|E
60|$|It {{is enough}} to say that before nightfall I had {{received}} all the instructions and advice that could be given, and was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> attempt at getting into town once more, mourning meanwhile because of having left the skiff so far away that a long tramp would be necessary in order to come at her.|$|R

25|$|Between January and February 1965, Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, {{in reality}} a {{communist}} double agent, {{was locked in}} a power struggle with junta leader General Nguyễn Khánh, and began plotting a coup against Khánh, who he thought {{was trying to kill}} him. Thảo consulted Kỳ—who wanted to seize power for himself—before the plot, and exhorted him to join the coup, but the Air Force chief claimed he would remain neutral. Thảo thus had reason to believe that Kỳ would not intervene. Kỳ had been preparing his own coup plans for a fortnight and was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were not yet <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> coup, and their preparations were well behind that of Thảo.|$|E

The Snow Queen knows that Gold wants to leave Storybrooke with Belle and {{to be free of}} the Dagger of Kris, while the Snow Queen wants Storybrooke all to herself, and she says that she has the secret to the missing ingredient he needs. She then asks for the ribbons, and as he gives them to her, the Snow Queen whispers the secret into his ear. Then, Mr. Gold says that he will obtain the final ingredient with great pleasure, causing the Snow Queen to stare at him with a shocked expression.|$|E

He listened politely to Grisell's {{introduction}} of Master Ridley, exchanged silent greetings with Vrow Clemence, and insisted on their coming into the chamber within, where a repast of cold pasty, marchpane, strawberries, and wine, awaited them--to be eaten while as yet {{there was nothing to}} see save the expectant multitudes.|$|R

Rochester Castle was torpedoed but escaped at [...] and caught up with the main body by 05:30, by when Charybdis, Eskimo and Somali had arrived, {{increasing}} the escort to two cruisers and seven destroyers around Rochester Castle, Waimarama and Melbourne Star. Ohio and its destroyer were slowly closing the distance and further back were Port Chalmers and two destroyers. Dorset was sailing independently and Brisbane Star lurked near the Tunisian coast, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> run for Malta after dark. Dawn brought an end to the torpedo boat attacks and at 07:30, Burrough sent Eskimo and Somali back to help Manchester but they arrived too late, took on survivors who had not reached the shore and made for Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} two years of her contract, Bush spent more time on school work than making an album. She left school after doing her mock A-levels and having gained ten GCE O-Level qualifications. In 2005, Bush stated in an {{interview}} with Mark Radcliffe on BBC Radio 2 that she believed EMI signed her before she was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius.|$|R

2500|$|Rabbi {{taught that}} when all Israel stood before Mount Sinai {{to receive the}} Torah, they decided {{unanimously}} to accept the reign of God joyfully.

Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, {{by the fact that he}} had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.|$|R
