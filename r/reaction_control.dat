5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell fired the orbiter's <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> {{thrusters}} {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with Atlantiss Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight control surfaces, performed a <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run through a series of landing simulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} and booster {{were almost}} identical to those used on the two preceding Mercury orbital flights. The spacecraft had heating blankets removed from the retrorocket motors, to save weight, and a SOFAR bomb was added. This would be ejected {{at the time the}} main parachute was deployed, and would help recovery crews find the spacecraft after it landed. A number of modifications were made to the <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system, and the communications equipment was upgraded.|$|E
5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to try {{to determine if they}} worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system.|$|E
5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier USS Ticonderoga delivered the Apollo 16 Command Module to the North Island Naval Air Station, near San Diego, California, on Friday, May 5, 1972. On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment {{being used to}} empty the residual toxic <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system fuel in the Command Module tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station hangar. Forty-six people {{were sent to the}} hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him. A hole was blown in the hangar roof 250 feet above; about 40 windows in the hangar were shattered. The Command Module suffered a three-inch gash in one panel.|$|E
40|$|Very {{fine-grained}} (0 · 2 um), dense Y-TZP ceramics {{have been}} produced by free sintering at 1150 °C. The superplastic deformation of these materials is studied in compression at low temperatures (1100 - 1300 °C). A significant enhancement in initial strain rates was observed compared to a coarser-grained (0 · 4 ¿m) commercially available material (Tosoh, Japan). Doping with small amounts of Fe 2 O 3 led to a further enhancement of strain rate. Deformation occurred via interface <b>reaction</b> <b>controlled</b> grain boundary sliding. Prior to deformation a continuous glassy silicate film was observed at the grain boundaries. The applicability of interface <b>reaction</b> <b>controlled</b> solution-precipitation creep models is discussed.

5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to a failure of the onboard <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E

25|$|The <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> {{system is}} the only way to control {{spacecraft}} attitude outside the atmosphere.

All thrusters have redundant backups, so there are twelve thrusters in all.|$|E
