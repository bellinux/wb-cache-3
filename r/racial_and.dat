40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} role that racial concordance, defined {{as the percentage of}} African Americans in one’s environment, plays in the relation between <b>racial</b> socialization <b>and</b> <b>racial</b> identity. African American (n=- 160) students evaluated their perception of parental socialization, <b>racial</b> concordance, <b>and</b> <b>racial</b> identity. As hypothesized, racial socialization significantly predicted racial identity. As well, racially concordant environments moderated the relation between <b>racial</b> socialization <b>and</b> <b>racial</b> identity. Minority <b>and</b> cultural socialization were the best predictors of racial identity. Conclusions emphasize the importance of proactive <b>racial</b> socialization <b>and</b> supportive environments.

Cazenave and Maddern (1999) define racism as [...] "a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates {{at every level of}} society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination.

5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society.

This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
