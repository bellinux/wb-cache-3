5|$|D.O.-granting U.S. {{medical schools}} have {{curricula}} identical {{for the most}} part to those of M.D.-granting schools. Generally, the first two years are classroom-based, while the third and fourth years consist of clinical <b>rotations</b> through the major specialties of medicine. Some schools of Osteopathic Medicine have been criticized by the osteopathic community for relying too heavily on clinical <b>rotations</b> with private practitioners, who {{may not be able to}} provide sufficient instruction to the rotating student. Other D.O.-granting and M.D.-granting schools place their students in hospital-based clinical <b>rotations</b> where the attending physicians are faculty of the school, and who have a clear duty to teach medical students while treating patients.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ingredients}} of this equation, the arc length, curvature, and time, are all unaffected by translations and <b>rotations</b> of the Euclidean plane, {{it follows that the}} flow defined by this equation is invariant under translations and <b>rotations</b> (or more precisely, equivariant). If the plane is scaled by a constant dilation factor, the flow remains essentially unchanged, but is slowed down or sped up by the same factor.|$|E
5|$|Rotating a book 90° {{around a}} {{vertical}} axis then 90° around a horizontal axis produces a different orientation {{than when the}} <b>rotations</b> are performed in the opposite order.|$|E
30|$|The single within-subjects {{independent}} variable for the <b>rotation</b> task was <b>rotation</b> technique. Three <b>rotation</b> techniques were compared: touch-rotate, phone-inertial, and wand direct. Each <b>rotation</b> technique was evaluated twice {{with each of}} 12 randomly generated target <b>rotation</b> angles. This produced a total of 3 <b>rotation</b> techniques × 2 repetitions × 12 target orientations = 72 <b>rotation</b> trials for each participant. Over all 20 participants, this yielded 1, 440 <b>rotation</b> trials in total. The dependent variables for the <b>rotation</b> task were <b>rotation</b> time (RT), measured in seconds. This was measured as the time from when the target appeared until the time participants pressed the foot pedal upon completing the <b>rotation</b> trial.|$|R
50|$|In any three {{dimensional}} <b>rotation</b> {{the plane}} of <b>rotation</b> is uniquely defined. Together with the angle of <b>rotation</b> it fully describes the <b>rotation.</b> Or in a continuously rotating object the rotational properties such as the rate of <b>rotation</b> {{can be described in}} terms of {{the plane of}} <b>rotation.</b> It is perpendicular to, and so is defined by and defines, an axis of <b>rotation,</b> so any description of a <b>rotation</b> in terms of a plane of <b>rotation</b> can be described in terms of an axis of <b>rotation,</b> and vice versa. But unlike the axis of <b>rotation</b> the plane generalises into other, in particular higher, dimensions.|$|R
50|$|Every nontrivial proper <b>rotation</b> in 3 {{dimensions}} fixes {{a unique}} 1-dimensional linear subspace of R3 {{which is called}} the axis of <b>rotation</b> (this is Euler's <b>rotation</b> theorem). Each such <b>rotation</b> acts as an ordinary 2-dimensional <b>rotation</b> in the plane orthogonal to this axis. Since every 2-dimensional <b>rotation</b> can be represented by an angle φ, an arbitrary 3-dimensional <b>rotation</b> can be specified by an axis of <b>rotation</b> together with an angle of <b>rotation</b> about this axis. (Technically, one needs to specify an orientation for the axis and whether the <b>rotation</b> is taken to be clockwise or counterclockwise {{with respect to this}} orientation).|$|R

5|$|For the {{enumeration}} of {{all possible}} solutions, two solutions are considered distinct if any of their corresponding (81) cell values differ. Symmetry relations between similar solutions are ignored., e.g. the <b>rotations</b> of a solution are considered distinct. Symmetries {{play a significant role}} in the enumeration strategy, but not in the count {{of all possible}} solutions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the first}} {{discovered}} millisecond pulsar, with a rotational period of 1.557708 milliseconds, meaning it completes almost 642 <b>rotations</b> per second.

50|$|A <b>rotation</b> {{with only}} one plane of <b>rotation</b> is a simple <b>rotation.</b> In a simple <b>rotation</b> there is a fixed plane, and <b>rotation</b> {{can be said to}} take place about this plane, so points as they rotate do not change their {{distance}} from this plane.

5|$|This {{provides}} a definition {{for the moment}} of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the tensor that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of <b>rotations</b> including precession and nutation.|$|E
30|$|Calculated <b>rotation</b> {{values were}} close to actual <b>rotation</b> values {{throughout}} the arc of <b>rotation.</b> The mean absolute error of five observers for all measurements of external and internal <b>rotation</b> was 3.97 ° (± 0.83). The correlation coefficient between calculated and actual <b>rotation</b> values was 0.9927. The interobserver intraclass correlation coefficient for calculated <b>rotation</b> was 0.997.|$|R
25|$|Internal <b>rotation</b> (or medial <b>rotation)</b> and {{external}} <b>rotation</b> (or lateral <b>rotation)</b> refers to <b>rotation</b> towards (internal) {{or away from}} (external) {{the center of the}} body.

5000|$|A double <b>rotation</b> has two {{angles of}} <b>rotation,</b> {{one for each}} plane of <b>rotation.</b> The <b>rotation</b> is {{specified}} by giving the two planes and two non-zero angles, [...] and [...] (if either angle is zero the <b>rotation</b> is simple). Points in the first plane rotate through , while {{points in the second}} plane rotate through [...] All other points rotate through an angle between [...] and , so in a sense they together determine the amount of <b>rotation.</b> For a general double <b>rotation</b> the planes of <b>rotation</b> and angles are unique, and given a general <b>rotation</b> they can be calculated.

5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred <b>rotations</b> per second.|$|E
5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few <b>rotations</b> per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E

Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and <b>rotations.</b> Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector. While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.|$|E

50|$|A general <b>rotation</b> in four-dimensional {{space has}} only one fixed point, the origin. Therefore an axis of <b>rotation</b> cannot be used in four {{dimensions}}.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to examine how {{training}} either mental or manual (virtual) <b>rotation,</b> affects performance gains on either a mental or a manual <b>rotation</b> task. In Experiment 1, we examined improvement on a manual <b>rotation</b> task following practice in mental <b>rotation,</b> manual <b>rotation</b> and a control condition. Practice in mental but not manual <b>rotation</b> lead to improved performance on manual <b>rotation,</b> compared to the control condition. In Experiment 2, we examined improvement on a mental <b>rotation</b> task {{as a function of}} the same 3 training conditions. In this experiment, both mental and manual <b>rotation</b> practice lead to more efficient posttest performance relative to the control condition. These results suggest common processes in mental and manual <b>rotation,</b> related to mental planning...|$|R
5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, <b>rotations</b> and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E

Several {{architectural}} features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into {{the sides of the}} pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 <b>rotations</b> (365.01).|$|E

40|$|Specific {{inhibition}} of flagellar <b>rotation</b> reversal was observed after exposure of chemotactic Salmonella typhimurium to citrate autoclaved at neutral pH. The {{presence of a}} <b>rotation</b> reversal inactivator was established in autoclaved citrate-containing media and nutrient broth. Since modulation of flagellar <b>rotation</b> by attractants and repellents {{is the basis of}} chemotactic behavior, a specific inhibitor of <b>rotation</b> reversal, which is essential for tumble generation, provides a useful probe into the molecular mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis. The inactivator inhibits clockwise <b>rotation</b> without affecting counterclockwise <b>rotation,</b> speed of <b>rotation,</b> or the capacity of the cells to grow and divide. Inactivation of clockwise <b>rotation</b> is gradual and irreversible, differing from the transient {{inhibition of}} clockwise <b>rotation</b> by attractants, which is characterized by an immediate suppression followed by a return to normal <b>rotation</b> patterns. The <b>rotation</b> reversal inactivator is stable to acidification, rotary evaporation, lyophilization, and rehydration...|$|R

5|$|In these works, Wigner {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for the theory of symmetries in quantum mechanics. Wigner's theorem proved by Wigner in 1931, is a cornerstone of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as <b>rotations,</b> translations, and CPT symmetry are represented on the Hilbert space of states. According to the theorem, any symmetry transformation is represented by a linear and unitary or antilinear and antiunitary transformation of Hilbert space. The representation of a symmetry group on a Hilbert space is either an ordinary representation or a projective representation.|$|E

Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E
40|$|International audienceForced {{turbulence}} {{combined with}} the effect of <b>rotation</b> and shear flow is studied. In a previous paper [Leprovost and Kim, PRE in press (2008) ], we considered the case where the shear and the <b>rotation</b> are perpendicular. Here, we consider the complementary case of parallel <b>rotation</b> and shear, elucidating how <b>rotation</b> and flow shear influence the generation of shear flow (e. g. the direction of energy cascade), turbulence level, transport of particles and momentum. In contrast with the case where <b>rotation</b> and shear are perpendicular, we found that <b>rotation</b> affects turbulence amplitude only for very rapid <b>rotation</b> (Ω≫) where it reduces slightly the anisotropy due to shear flow. Also, concerning the transport properties of turbulence, we find that <b>rotation</b> affects only the transport of particle and only for rapid <b>rotation,</b> leading to an almost isotropic transport (whereas, {{in the case of}} perpendicular <b>rotation</b> and shear, <b>rotation</b> favors isotropic transport even for slow <b>rotation)</b> ...|$|R
