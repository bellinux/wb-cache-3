40|$|Using a {{questionnaire}} {{addressed to the}} personnel departments of companies, we examined {{the transformation of the}} internal labor market and its determinative factors. As a result of an analysis, it has become clear that companies establish employment classification by combining <b>regular</b> employees <b>and</b> <b>non-regular</b> employees. In particular, it has become clear that within employment classification, such things as job characteristics, education and training policy, and wage disparity differ {{as a result of the}} combination of <b>regular</b> employees <b>and</b> that the internal labor market has undergone transformation. Based on this analysis, we will present two types of internal labor market models in Japan today. One is a type in which a relative wide range of personnel is regarded as the core employees and the system of conversion from more than one employment classification is accepted. The other is a type where a limited range of personnel is considered to be core employees, core employees are segregated from employees who belong to other employment classifications in jobs and careers, and a narrow gate is set for passage in the conversion system.

In 2007, the Korean government undertook a labor reform prohibiting undue discriminatory treatment against fixed-term, part-time, and dispatched workers {{in an attempt to}} address income inequality arising from labor market duality.

In this sense, non-regular work is exclusionary. This result suggests that policies are needed to support the movement of non-regular workers into regular work...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{structure}} {{conservation in}} various a-helix subclasses reveals the sequence and context dependent factors causing distortions in the a-helix. The sequence-structure relationship in these subclasses {{can be used}} to predict structural variations in a-helix purely based on its sequence. We train support vector machine(SVM) with dot product kernel function to discriminate between <b>regular</b> a-helix <b>and</b> <b>non-regular</b> a-helices purely based on the sequences, which are represented with various overall and position specific propensities of amino acids. Results: We characterize the structural distortions in five a-helix subclasses. The sequence structure correlation in the subclasses reveals that the increased propensity of proline, histidine, serine, aspartic acid and aromatic amino acids are responsible for the distortions in regular a-helix. The N-terminus of regular a-helix prefers neutral and acidic polar amino acids, while the C-terminus prefers basic polar amino acid. Proline is preferred in the first turn of regular a-helix, while it is preferred to produce kinked and curved subclasses. The SVM discriminates between <b>regular</b> a-helix <b>and</b> the rest with precision of 80. 97 % and recall of 88. 05 %. Conclusions: The correlation between structural variation in helices and their sequences is manifested by the performance of SVM based on sequence features. The results presented here are useful for computational design of helices. The results are also useful for prediction of structural perturbations in helix sequence purely based on it...|$|R

The objective function of this problem is a linear combination of both a <b>regular</b> part <b>and</b> a <b>non-regular</b> part. Minimizing the makespan is equivalent to maximizing the revenue, since the revenue function is assumed to be monotonically decreasing in the makespan, i.e., u_t > u_t+ 1 ∀ [...] t. For any strictly decreasing revenue u_t, revenue maximization even matches the makespan minimization objective. Hence, this part is a regular function. However, minimizing overtime cost is a non-regular objective, since decreasing the overtime typically leads to longer project durations as fewer activities can be performed in parallel.|$|R

We analyze how the {{expansion}} of the wage gap between <b>regular</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-regular</b> employment affects the economy. If the steady state equilibrium exhibits the wage-led demand regime, an increase in the wage gap does not affect the stability of equilibrium. In this case, the size of the reserve army effect affects the stability of the equilibrium. If the reserve army effect is strong, the steady state equilibrium is unstable. On the other hand, if the steady state equilibrium exhibits the profit-led demand regime, an increase in the wage gap destabilizes the equilibrium. It is possible that depending on conditions, an increase in the wage gap produces endogenous and perpetual business cycles. The introduction of the minimum wage is desirable in that it mitigates business cycle fluctuations. However, the introduction of an inappropriate minimum wage policy leads to a real wage and an employment rate that are lower than the steady state values...|$|E

In this dissertation, we study weighted likelihood estimation, a standard estimation method in this study design. Though sampling without replacement at the second phase induces dependence among observations, independence is often assumed in practice for theoretical convenience, leading to overestimating the asymptotic variance. The main contribution of this dissertation is to develop asymptotic theory for weighted likelihood estimation taking account of the dependence of observations due to the sampling scheme, for both cases where the nuisance parameter is estimable at a <b>regular</b> (√ n-rate) <b>and</b> <b>non-regular</b> rates. To this end, we develop a set of empirical process tools including a Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, a theorem for rates of convergence of M-estimators, and a Donsker theorem for the inverse probability weighted empirical processes under two-phase sampling and sampling without replacement at the second phase. For variance estimation, we propose two different bootstrap procedures. The first method is to estimate the phase I and II variances separately which allows us to evaluate how much information we lose by two-phase designs. The second method, which accounts for th...|$|R
