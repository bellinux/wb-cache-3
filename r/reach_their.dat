5|$|The brain {{develops}} in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages. It changes in shape {{from a simple}} swelling {{at the front of}} the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.|$|E

Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top speed of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the top speed of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E
5|$|At 17:30, {{three hours}} into the war, the twelfth and final {{infantry}} wave crossed, bringing the total in all five bridgeheads to 32,000 men (around 6,400 in each bridgehead). By then Israeli armored losses had reached around 100 tanks. The magnitude of Israeli losses stemmed from their insistence to <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> comrades in the Bar Lev Line, and they repeatedly ran into aggressive ambushes by Egyptian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

The remainder mostly found themselves stranded in isolated camps and settlements along the ice-covered river often in desperate circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|The wet {{season is}} the main period of {{vegetation}} growth within the Savanna climate regime. However, this also means that wet season {{is a time for}} food shortages before crops <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> full maturity. This causes seasonal weight changes for people in developing countries, with a drop occurring during the wet season until {{the time of the first}} harvest, when weights rebound. Malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking to <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong {{can benefit from}} aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{landings}} on 17September were successful, over {{the night of}} 17–18September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September18. Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks decided that the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> objective.|$|E
5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they <b>reach</b> <b>their</b> mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
