5|$|Ashes: Shiva {{iconography}} {{shows his}} body covered with ashes (bhasma, vibhuti). The ashes represent a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> all of material existence is impermanent, {{comes to an}} end becoming ash, and the pursuit of eternal soul and spiritual liberation is important.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World War I in 1917, {{images of}} the statue were heavily used in both {{recruitment}} posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially. This impressed upon the public the war's stated purpose—to secure liberty—and served as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> embattled France had given the United States the statue.|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually {{no way to know}} exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

50|$|At Khami several {{artefacts}} are found, such as ritual drinking pots, {{iron and}} bronze weapons, copper objects and ivory divining pieces. Artifacts from Europe and China are <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> Khami {{was once a}} trade centre.|$|R
25|$|We are diminished {{when any}} American is {{targeted}} unfairly {{because of his}} or her heritage. This Memorial and the internment sites are powerful <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> stereotyping, discrimination, hatred and racism have no place in this country.|$|R
5|$|Her {{story is}} a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the {{universal}} denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven {{by the light of}} knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in many outlets for the entertainment of its population, including theatres, cinemas and public houses. In 1908 the Hippodrome Theatre on Leigh Road {{was built on}} the site of Walker's silk mill of 1827, this subsequently became a cinema, first the Odeon, later the Classic. Another theatre, the Theatre Royal, was built on Lord Street which later became the Leigh Casino Club. The Palace Cinema was built in 1913 on Railway Road and the assembly rooms above the Conservative Club, were converted to a cinema known as the Sems in 1908. Brewery Lane is a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> there was once a brewery in Bedford belonging to George Shaw & Co.|$|E
5|$|The University of Houston and the University of Texas {{played their}} first {{football}} game {{against one another}} in 1953. Since this was their first meeting, members of Alpha Phi Omega—the service fraternity in charge {{of taking care of}} ShastaI, the university's mascot—brought her to the game. During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off. At the game, several Longhorn players saw what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent, suggesting the Cougars were invalids. Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> they would remember the taunts.|$|E
50|$|Mayor Andrew Broaddus is {{the only}} {{floating}} lifestation and the last inland waterway lifestation for the United States Coast Guard still in existence, {{and one of the}} few <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. Life-Saving Service ever existed.|$|R
50|$|Consistent with choice blindness, Henkel and Mather {{found that}} people are easily {{convinced}} by false <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> they chose different options than they actually chose and that they show greater choice-supportive bias in memory for whichever option they believe they chose.|$|R
5000|$|Lyrical {{topics are}} varied, and include <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> all will face God {{eventually}} ("Can’t Hide" [...] and [...] "Table"), exhortations to follow Biblical example ("Dangerous" [...] and [...] "Least of These") and acknowledgments of personal struggles ("Greed" [...] and [...] "Razor").|$|R
5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
5000|$|The Ministry of Religious Affairs {{responded to}} this wave of self-immolations by devoting the Friday sermons of 21 January to admonitions of {{patience}} and <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> suicide is forbidden in Islam. [...] However, some cases continued to be reported over coming days: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{vision of}} {{what ought to be}} done shone brightly while Mr. Britling and Mr. Wilkins {{maintained}} it. But presently under discouraging <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> there were no rifles, no instructors, and, above all, the open hostility of the established authorities, it faded again....|$|R
50|$|On July 19, 2010, WNOX {{moved its}} former {{programming}} to 98.7 WOKI, with 100.3 FM airing nothing but <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> former WNOX listeners should turn to 98.7. On August 1, 2010 the station's owner, Oak Ridge FM, Inc. regained programming {{control of the}} station and resumed broadcasting a news-talk format.|$|R
5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda, aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> both grids are present in the campus.|$|E
25|$|Great Connell Priory was an {{important}} Priory, founded in 1202 by the Augustinian Canons. This and other sites are a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> Newbridge was an early Christian settlement.|$|E
25|$|This is sung as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> {{the reason}} for {{creation}} is love, so that the followers may know themselves and each other and that they may love that which they know.|$|E
5000|$|Lisa Nesselson of Variety.com {{praises the}} film by saying [...] "Narrative is often {{bittersweet}} but never dreary. Nicely rendered period design jolts the viewer with <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> provincial France in the mid-'70s was still closer to WWII {{than to the}} present and that today's relatively harmonious multicultural society was hard won indeed." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Zuni {{consider}} Raven to be a prankster {{but without}} negative characteristics which they {{associate with the}} coyote. [...] The Raven's greatest traits are his ability to assist the people in overcoming their failures by offering gentle <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> anything people {{have the courage to}} face, thus too do they have the power to transform.|$|R
50|$|The project uses trap-neuter-return, {{adoption}} efforts, public education, and anti-abandonment programs. Kittens {{are placed}} in foster homes, while friendly adult cats are socialized by volunteers. Signs and brochures about the program are placed at locations along the trail where cats {{are most likely to}} be viewed, with <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> it is illegal to abandon cats.|$|R
25|$|Many couples {{keep the}} wedding crowns {{in a case}} and display them near their icon corner or in the couple’s bedroom. They serve as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> God has united them {{to each other and}} to himself and that he has {{bestowed}} his grace upon them to live in unity, faith and love.|$|E
25|$|A {{vehicle that}} has no front- and rear-position lights fitted or has had those lights {{permanently}} removed, painted or masked-over is exempt from the lighting sections of the MOT test. An advisory note will be provided on the VT32 as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the vehicle should only be used during daylight hours and not used at times of seriously reduced visibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} of Gloria Vanderbilt and Carol Matthau are encountered first, {{the two women}} gossiping about Princess Margaret, Prince Charles {{and the rest of}} the British royal family. An awkward moment then occurs when Gloria Vanderbilt has a run-in with her first husband and fails to recognize him. It is only at Mrs. Matthau's <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> Gloria realises who he is. Both women brush the incident aside and chalk it up to ancient history.|$|E
2500|$|Under the 2001 {{budget of}} the United States, Congress {{authorized}} that the ten detention sites are to be preserved as historical landmarks: [...] "places like Manzanar, Tule Lake, Heart Mountain, Topaz, Amache, Jerome, and Rohwer will forever stand as <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> this nation failed in its most sacred duty to protect its citizens against prejudice, greed, and political expediency".|$|R
50|$|Canada's {{thirteen}} World War I memorials were erected to honour {{and remember}} the achievements and sacrifices of Canadians and Newfoundlanders during the Great War. Collectively, these memorials are symbolic of the Canadians and Newfoundlanders who gave their lives during the First World War, and are physical <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> their sacrifices and victories must never be forgotten.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 As I am {{walking through the}} {{elaborate}} entrance of the Grand Central Station Terminal, thoughts of a glorious day fill my head. Nevertheless, my fatigued legs are painful <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> I have been journeying through the Big Apple. 2 ̆...|$|R
25|$|The {{area was}} {{originally}} {{covered by the}} Great North Wood which was a natural oak forest that covered four miles (6km) of South London. Apart from South Norwood, the wood covered Upper Norwood, West Norwood (known as Lower Norwood until 1885) and the Woodside and Gipsy Hill areas reflect {{the history of the}} area. The wood covered more of Lambeth and Southwark than Croydon, but the name Norwood is itself a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> it had closer connection with Croydon than with Lambeth or London.|$|E
25|$|The first {{narrative}} section begins. John baptizes Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him. Jesus prays and meditates in {{the wilderness}} for forty days, and is tempted by Satan. His early ministry by word and deed in Galilee meets with much success, and leads to the Sermon on the Mount, {{the first of the}} discourses. The sermon presents the ethics of the kingdom of God, introduced by the Beatitudes ("Blessed are..."). It concludes with a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> the response to the kingdom will have eternal consequences, and the crowd's amazed response leads into the next narrative block.|$|E
25|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually {{no way to know}} exactly how close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. These fossils serve as a <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation.|$|E
5000|$|Newfoundland passports. Found {{at various}} tourist shops {{to serve as}} souvenirs of Newfoundland and Labrador. These mark the {{distinct}} culture of the most eastern Canadian province and oldest place of European colonization in North America. They are also <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> Newfoundland was once an independent British Colony of Newfoundland and Dominion of Newfoundland before joining Canada in 1949.|$|R
5000|$|Under the 2001 {{budget of}} the United States, Congress {{authorized}} that the ten detention sites are to be preserved as historical landmarks: [...] "places like Manzanar, Tule Lake, Heart Mountain, Topaz, Amache, Jerome, and Rohwer will forever stand as <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> this nation failed in its most sacred duty to protect its citizens against prejudice, greed, and political expediency".|$|R
25|$|The first {{interviews}} for the autobiography frustrated Haley. Rather than discussing his own life, MalcolmX spoke about Elijah Muhammad, {{the leader of}} the Nation of Islam; he became angry about Haley's <b>reminders</b> <b>that</b> the book was supposed to be about MalcolmX. After several meetings, Haley asked MalcolmX to tell him something about his mother. That question drew MalcolmX into recounting his life story.|$|R
