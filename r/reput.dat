Perlis {{is one of}} the major producers of ‘Batu <b>Reput</b> ’ in Malaysia that content large deposit of high-purity dolomite [CaMg (CO 3) 2]. Pure samples of ‘Batu <b>Reput</b> ’ recently explored in the Koperasi Rimba Mas Padang Besar Quarry were investigated for their physical, chemical and mineralogical composition. SEM and XRD analysis methods were applied. The potential of ‘Batu <b>Reput</b> ’ as a raw material in fertilizer production was investigated in this paper...|$|E

This {{research has been}} done to investigate the mechanical properties of rPP/Batu <b>Reput</b> composites such as tensile properties and impact strength. The interfacial adhesion between the Batu <b>Reput</b> filler and rPP was investigated by examining the tensile fracture surface using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The water absorption of the composites was also determined for up to 14 days. In this study, tensile strength results exhibit 300 μm with 10 % filler content shows significant increase of mechanical strength compared to the neat rPP and other filler percentage composites. This is due to the good interfacial adhesion, better compatibility and good stress transfer during tensile test. While for water absorption testing, the result indicates that the smaller the particle size, the higher the water absorption percentage since there is large surface area of dolomite to be i...|$|E

The {{effects of}} {{different}} sizes of “Batu <b>Reput</b> ” (Dolomite) filler which are smaller size (< 63 µm) and bigger size (75 - 150 µm) on tensile and morphological properties of “Batu Reput” (Dolomite) filled SMR L and epoxidized natural rubber (ENR- 50) blends were investigated. Results indicated that, the tensile properties, such as tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (Eb) and stress at 100 % elongation (M 100) of “Batu <b>Reput</b> ” (Dolomite) filled SMR L higher than “Bat...|$|E
40|$|The {{preservation}} of food heritage and the Malay community's nutrition has been substantial {{especially in the}} world where it is well regarded as borderless. In the era where the eating culture has adopted a more universal approach, with specific regards to various foreign influences that can pose a threat to the tastebuds and the normative attributes of eating, traditional foods naturalness must be sustained, so that it will not be impacted by the passing of time, as the saying goes, tak lekang dek panas,tak <b>reput</b> dek hujan, The Emergence of fast food restaurant which mushroom, also not fogetting the international status restaurants, can be seen as an extraordinary and an interesting globalised phenomenon. Although this is seen as unique and a good tranformation, some adverse effects may be brought about especially when the culture of the eating habit of the locals is noted to lean more towards food that is more instant and when traditional foods are no longer seen as appealing, let alone to be placed on ahigh position in the society. The change of lifestyle has also altered the eating trend of the Malaysians towards Something with "better class". Traditional food have been given the backseat. The natural greens as an example, which is the type of food that had never left the tables of the traditional community homes, has started to be abandoned when the salad was introduced more widely in the market. Such a phenomenon can gradually erode the position of the local community,s traditional eating habit and at this juncture, automatically an asset of the Malay culture, which is eating will have been affected. Therefore, this paper will attempt to delve into the world of ulam {{in the context of the}} Malay societys nutrition in the northern region...|$|E
