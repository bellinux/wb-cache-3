40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{analyzes}} the gene pattern-location structures across related microbial genomes in an aim to extract their organizational and functional differences. We propose a sequence-ordered-set {{to represent the}} whole selected set of genes of a genome. The combined comparison of gene sequence similarity and relative location matching between genomes is then a 2 -level pattern analysis, analogous to a comparison of <b>random</b> <b>linear</b> <b>graph</b> structure. Plots comparing between two genomes, depicting the highest similarity of each gene sequence from one genome to another for the whole set of genes were constructed. From the plot, additional analyses were performed using global rearrangement operations of: (1) shifts, (2) reversals, or (3) splits. Experiments were done using five closely related Chlamydia genomes that have substantial pathogenic differences. To analyze the relationship of pathogenic variation, the cell envelope set of genes was chosen. Results show consistent hierarchical gene rearrangements among genomes displaying similar pathogenicity. We hypothesize that an organizational structure may be intrinsic to the overall pathogenic functionality of these genomes. Results generally supported the hypothesis that genes of the cell envelope provide the variable loci required to form an effective source of variation among species that are otherwise very similar.

Our main results are that for a <b>random</b> <b>linear</b> embedding of K_n in a cube, the mean sum of squared linking numbers and the mean sum of squared writhes are {{of the order of}} θ(n(n!)). We obtain a similar result for the mean sum of squared linking numbers in <b>linear</b> embeddings of <b>graphs</b> on n vertices, such that for any pair of vertices, the probability that they are connected by an edge is p.

40|$|A <b>linear</b> <b>graph</b> is a graph whose {{vertices}} {{are totally}} ordered. Biological and linguistic sequences with interactions among symbols are naturally represented as <b>linear</b> <b>graphs.</b> Examples include protein contact maps, RNA secondary structures and predicate-argument structures. Our algorithm, <b>linear</b> <b>graph</b> miner (LGM), leverages the vertex order for efficient enumeration of frequent subgraphs.

Unlike conventional graph mining algorithms detecting connected patterns only, LGM can detect disconnected patterns as well.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new edge-based authen-tication scheme for network coding. Many {{authentication}} schemes for <b>random</b> <b>linear</b> network coding {{have been proposed}} against pollution attacks. However, <b>random</b> <b>linear</b> network coding is vulnerable to entropy attacks. An adversary can generate messages that are verified as correct messages by the authentication mechanism but obstruct the network coding. <b>Random</b> <b>linear</b> network coding is shown to be efficient in a random failure model, but not in an adversary model. This paper shows a simple solution to tolerate entropy attacks by changing <b>random</b> <b>linear</b> coding to deterministic message combining rule. For an example, this paper shows a modification of RIPPLE, an authentication scheme for <b>random</b> <b>linear</b> network coding. Lastly, we show that the total delay of modified RIPPLE can be reduced by an edge-based authen-tication. RIPPLE and many other authentication schemes are node-based, that is, verification keys and operations are defined for each node. We show that we can construct an edge-based scheme, that is, verification keys and operations are defined for each edge. We show that the edge-based authentication scheme is more efficient than the node-based schemes.
