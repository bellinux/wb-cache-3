The aims of this thesis were to investigate {{young people and}} their experiences of different online sexual behaviours with regard to characteristics, associations and consequences, by using data from {{a representative sample of}} 3, 503 Swedish youth (m= 18. 3 years). In addition 16 interviews were made with young women who had sold sex online before the age of 18. Focus in these interviews were in which ways contacts between buyer and seller were established and the motivational factors for selling sex online. In study I (n= 3, 288), 20. 9 % (19. 2 % boys and 22. 3 % girls) reported experiences of voluntary online sexual exposure: flashing in webcam/mobile; posted partially undressed pictures or films; masturbated on webcam; had sex on webcam. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between voluntary online sexual exposure and a number of different forms of harassments online. Neither poorer psychological health nor problematic relations with parents remained significant in the final model predicting voluntary online sexual exposure. In study II (n= 3, 432) four online sexual behaviours were studied: meeting a person online for sex online; meeting a person online for sex offline; posted sexual pictures online; selling sex online. These were investigated in relation to socio-demographic factors, psychosocial wellbeing and risk behaviours. Bivariate logistic regressions were followed by multiple logistic regressions. The data suggested that most Swedish youth do not perform any of the assessed online sexual behaviours, but those who did (15. 2 %) reported a more problematic background, rated their health as poorer, had a more sexualised life and had experienced more sexual or physical abuse. This was especially prevalent among those who had sold sex online. In study III, young women with experiences of selling sex online before the age of 18 were interviewed. The interviews focused on the role Internet and mobile phone play and the methods of contacts and characteristics of the communication between buyer and seller. Two main themes were identified: Internet use - part of daily life for good and bad, depending on mood; Patterns of contacts - innocent/curious, dating, advertising. In the fourth study the interviews with the young women who had sold sex online before the age of 18 were analysed focusing on the women’s perceptions of the reasons why they started, continued and stopped selling sex. Three themes and eight sub-themes were identified in relation to different stages in their lives in the sex trade, each with its own storyline: Entering, adverse life experiences - traumatic events, feeling different and being excluded; Immersion, using the body as a <b>regulating</b> <b>tool</b> - being seen, being touched, being in control, affect regulation and self-harming; Exiting, change or die - living close to death, the process of quitting. In conclusion, the results from this thesis showed that most young people use Internet and mobile phones for non-sexual activities. Sexual behaviours online were associated with a more problematic background and poorer wellbeing. More research, attention and support are needed, especially related to young people selling sex online...|$|E

40|$|The {{transforming}} growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays {{a pivotal}} role in the pathobiology of human gliomas: during carcinogenesis, it turns from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter. The traditional Smad pathway and the more recently discovered MAPK pathway are the most important pathways for TGF-beta related intracellular signal transduction mediating differential pathobiological effects. In this study, we investigated the effects of TGF-beta 2 and the TGF-beta 2 antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (PTO) AS- 11 on the functionality of both the Smad and MAPK pathways in high-grade gliomas. We aimed to correlate the imbalance between the pathways with differences in the behaviour of high-grade glioma cells. Gene and protein expression studies were used to detect levels of members of the Smad and MAPK pathways under regulation of TGF-beta 2 and AS- 11. Proliferation and migration assays were functional readouts for effects caused by these <b>regulating</b> <b>tools.</b> Gene arrays were used to detect yet unknown regulators of these functional effects. The Smad pathway was functional in the tested cell lines. Exogenous TGF-beta 2 inhibited proliferation but enhanced migration. Smad 2 mRNA expression and activation were significantly reduced by incubation with AS- 11. K-ras was reduced both in gene arrays and quPCR under treatment with AS- 11, but there was no influence of K-ras down-regulation on the activity of ERK. Ubiquitination-related genes also were specifically down-regulated with AS- 11. Our results indicate the involvement of K-ras in TGF-beta signaling in high-grade gliomas. ERK, which {{is a member of the}} MAPK pathway, was not influenced and seems to be activated through RAS independent cascades in glioma. These results suggest that combined antagonization of the TGF-beta and MAPK pathways might be a promising approach for glioma therapy. An imbalance between these two pathways might be responsible for TGF-beta switching to a tumor promoter protein in high-grade gliomas...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{researches}} {{on cutting}} force control in end milling processes {{have been reported}} in the literature. There have been, however, very few practical applications actually employed in commercial products. The paper presents a simple, practically feasible and effective scheme to <b>regulate</b> the <b>tool</b> life through a long-term control of cutting force. Cutting force changes quickly occurring due to tool path geometry are suppressed using model-based feedrate scheduling. Cutting force is monitored only at tool path check points, set typically at intervals of several dozen meters. Since it does not require continuous full-time monitoring of cutting forces, a “cheaper” estimation scheme of cutting forces can be potentially employed. Feedback control focuses only on a long-term point-to-point regulation of cutting force, targeting tool life providing cutting for the given desired distance. The effectiveness of the present approach is experimentally investigated by an application example to contour-parallel cutting of hardened steel...|$|R

Pneumatic rivet guns {{typically}} have a regulator which adjusts the amount of air entering the <b>tool.</b> <b>Regulated</b> air entering passes through the throttle valve which is typically controlled by a trigger in the hand grip. When the trigger is squeezed, the throttle valve opens, allowing the pressurized air to flow into the piston. As the piston moves, a port opens allowing the air pressure to escape. The piston strikes against the rivet set. The force on the rivet set pushes the rivet into the work and against the buck. The buck deforms the tail of the rivet. The piston is returned to the original position by a spring or the shifting of a valve allowing air to drive the piston back to the starting position.|$|R
40|$|We have privileged {{the study}} of Botany {{contents}} in our research. Such contents derive from reorganizational approaches within the teaching of Natural Sciences {{at the elementary level}} in Portugal and Brazil. Along with the development of scientific knowledge on biological classifications and attempts to solve existing weaknesses in both countries, various governments introduced, throughout the last century, new programmatic Botany contents within the teaching of Natural Sciences at the elementary school. Thus, the teaching of Botany becomes more complex with the emergence of new realities, as well as curricular and didactic changes that emphasize such dimensional metamorphoses, which can be seen within classroom contexts and during the teaching-learning process. We aim to study such complex dimensions within the teaching of Botany, which is placed into a knowledge area undergoing a re-organizational approach where historical and educational circumstances mark Portuguese and Brazilian realities. This knowledge area faces important changes and new challenges resulting from significant environmental and political modifications, new practises and programmatic speeches that have been heard throughout various national and international debates. Such scientific approach on Natural Sciences favours the questioning and conceptual role played by Botany, and should clearly take into consideration the existing approaches in education and science teaching. The start point of the current study is the relevance of the teaching of Botany within the curricular and didactic structure and the importance texts have in it. Such texts come from outside the classroom and may be seen as <b>regulating</b> <b>tools</b> for the teaching practise by configuring reference universes – school textbooks and programmatic texts are examples. These texts are analysed in their specificity, articulation with the scientific speech, and relationship with the pedagogical transmission. An articulated, diachronic analysis shall be used for such aspects, i. e. with the use of an evolutionary and historical approach. The methodological approaches taken in our investigation will be both qualitative and quantitative. So that objectives are met, the overall strategy consists of the analysis of samples of various school textbooks, which will be chosen according to their application and use frequencies throughout the Portuguese territory, and within the Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Document, content and cluster analyses will be used to do so. We also aim to reach through several levels, as follows: i) Academic level, at which multiple mechanisms are allowed, i. e. deeper analyses of the educational processes to be studied, investigation team build-up and investigation unit selection; ii) Social level, at which results will be shared with the educational community directly involved with the study object; and, iii) Educational level, at which new dynamic procedures will be introduced in the teaching-learning process regarding Botany, with the production of elements that enhance its comprehension and, perhaps, its transformation.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{international}} implications of anti-competitive cartel law enforcement. The main issue {{discussed in the}} paper is the effectiveness of international legal <b>tools</b> <b>regulating</b> anti-cartel laws enforcement, including, in particular, the leniency programmes.

The authors are skeptical about the possibility of adopting a multilateral antitrust agreement at the WTO, considering particularly US approach. On the other hand, there are legal tools (mainly bilateral agreements) that enable fighting international cartels within a decentralized antitrust law enforcement system. Apart from bilateral agreements, actions against cartels are also taken by certain states through extraterritorial enforcement o f anti - cartel laws.

40|$|Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) was {{recently}} discovered as a novel human polyomavirus that {{is associated with}} ~ 80 % of Merkel Cell Carcinomas. The Large Tumor antigen (LT) is an early viral protein which has a variety of functions, including manipulation of the cell cycle and initiating viral DNA replication. Phosphorylation plays a critical regulatory role for polyomavirus LT proteins, but no investigation of MCPyV LT phosphorylation has been performed to date. In this report mass spectrometry analysis reveals three unique phosphorylation sites: T 271, T 297 and T 299. In vivo replication assays confirm that phosphorylation of T 271 does not play a role in viral replication, while modification at T 297 and T 299 have dramatic and opposing effects on LT’s ability to initiate replication from the viral origin. We test these mutants for their ability to bind, unwind, and act as a functional helicase at the viral origin. These studies provide a framework for understanding how phosphorylation of LT may dynamically regulate viral replication. Although the natural host cell of MCPyV has not yet been established, this work provides a foundation for understanding how LT activity is <b>regulated</b> and provides <b>tools</b> for better exploring this regulation in both natural host cells and Merkel cells...|$|R

The transition from {{free access to}} <b>regulated</b> fisheries with <b>tools</b> like limited entry and quotas (of different degrees of transferability) meant an important evolution {{in the way of}} understanding fisheries problems and managing them efficiently. Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction gave the coastal states property-rights and the potential of a sustainable management of their fisheries resources. For many fisheries economists it was a "promise of abundance". In practice, without a policy of overcapacity reduction, and in the presence of multiple social and political constraints, these conclusions were reserved. Also, the problems of "unfinished business" in the Law of the Sea (1982), namely imprecise definition of rights in the areas of High-Seas adjacent to the EEZs and the consequent difficulties in the management of straddling stocks, make it necessary to revisit the "Tragedy of the Commons" and the oldest issue: free access / excess of effort / overfishing.

Results We have developed a novel tool that searches for cis -element candidates in the upstream, downstream, or coding regions of differentially <b>regulated</b> genes. The <b>tool</b> first lists cis- element candidates by motif searching based on the supposition that if there are cis- elements playing important roles in the regulation of a given set of genes, they will be statistically overrepresented and will be conserved. Then it evaluates the likelihood scores of the listed candidate motifs by association rule analysis. This strategy depends on the idea that motifs overrepresented in the promoter region could play specific roles in the regulation of expression of these genes. The tool is designed so that any biological researchers can use it easily at the publicly accessible Internet site [URL]. We evaluated the accuracy and utility of the tool by using a dataset of auxin-inducible genes that have well-studied cis- elements. The test showed the effectiveness of the tool in identifying significant relationships between cis- element candidates and related sets of genes. Conclusion The tool lists possible cis- element motifs corresponding to genes of interest, and it will contribute to the deeper understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms in plants. </p...|$|R

In eradication campaigns, vaccination plays a crucial role by reducing the number of susceptible hosts with the ultimate goal of interrupting disease transmission. Nevertheless, mass vaccination campaigns may be very expensive and in some cases unprofitable. VacciCost is a tool designed to help decision-makers in the estimation of the resources required to implement mass livestock vaccination campaigns against <b>regulated</b> diseases. The <b>tool</b> focuses on the operational or running costs of the campaign, so acquisition of new equipment or vehicles is not considered. It takes into account different types of production systems to differentiate the vaccination productivity (number of animals vaccinated per day) in systems where animals are concentrated and easy to reach, from those characterized by small herds that are scattered and less accessible. The resource requirements are classified in eight categories: vaccines, injection supplies, personnel, transport, maintenance and overhead, training, social mobilization, and surveillance and monitoring. This categorization allows identifying the most expensive components of a vaccination campaign, which is crucial to design cost-reduction strategies. The use of the tool is illustrated using data collected in collaboration with Senegalese Veterinary Services regarding vaccination against peste des petits ruminants. The average daily number of animals vaccinated per vaccination team was found to be crucial for the costs of the campaign so significant savings can be obtained by implementing training to improve the performance of vaccination teams...|$|R
40|$|Inflation is a {{phenomenon}} inherent in any system operating in conditions of market economy. It is considered a necessary evil; thus, economic subjects try to adjust their behavior and activities to inflation or even use it to their advantage. The purpose of the article is to analyse the consequences of inflation {{in the sphere of}} economic growth and in the national product distribution in highly developed market economies. At the same time, the analyses are the basis for investigating to what extent the efects of inflation and the deflationary activities may be utilized as a <b>tool</b> of <b>regulating</b> a modern market economy as a whole. The budgetary, monetary and credit policy realized in conditions of inflation is a factor limiting the dynamics of economic growth. The processes of the prise rise are autonomous with respect to the increase in the unemployment rate. In turn, in the sphere of redistribution of national product they generally inflict the decrease in real income from work or property. Similar negative consequences are caused by inflation in the sphere of balance of trade and payments (decreased price competitiveness of goods and services). In highly developed countries operating in conditions of market economy inflation may to some extent be utilized as a <b>tool</b> <b>regulating</b> those systems. However, the consequences of such operations are negative and the possibilities of using inflation to attain positive results in the economic process are insignificant.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{generate}} an understanding of antitrust and its evolution {{in the context of}} the globalising economy of the 20 th and early 21 st centuries. I do this by focusing on the role of economic ideas and more specifically, conceptual approaches to competition policy, in the international context. Existing legal and economic studies have mainly framed antitrust as the disciplinary <b>tool</b> <b>regulating</b> market competition according to criteria of efficiency and/or economic welfare. So far, few researchers have addressed the enforcement of policies - and specifically, of market competition regulations, without resorting to pure rational-choice or reflectivist arguments. This thesis aims to fill this gap by examining the ways in which abstract economic concepts and theories on the one hand and material interests on the other, by influencing political actors’ understanding of reality, have shaped the decision-making process behind specific antitrust policies and laws. My analysis develops on the basis of what I call a pan-institutional methodology, a synthesis of an institutional understanding of antitrust and sociological theories of isomorphism. Pan-institutionalism is employed here to examine the development of antitrust policies in the US, Europe and Japan during the Great Depression of the 1930 s, the oil crises of the 1970 s and the current recession. My study reveals that the corpus of ideas and institutions of antitrust of the 20 th and early 21 st century can be identified as Harvard, Chicago and Post-Chicago paradigms of competition policy. To a degree, these US-originated approaches have been internalised by Europe and Japan through formal and informal institutions, and adapted in light of major economic crises. At the same time however, the reliance of Europe and Japan on their traditional understanding of market practices has prevented a total harmonisation of their antitrust policies with the dominant American ones...|$|R

Through the gaze, it is regulated how the architectural object will be seen and how the subject will see. The <b>tools,</b> <b>regulating</b> the gaze, in terms of architecture, are oriented to the subject (that looks) and the space (that is looked at). In order to reveal {{the effects of the}} <b>tools</b> <b>regulating</b> the gaze on the architectural experience, it will be appropriate to examine the circumstances that every tool emphasis both on the subject and the object. The interactive relationship between the subject (that looks) and the object (that is looked at) are defined by the <b>tools</b> <b>regulating</b> the gaze. The experience had in the cycle build up by the body, subject and  the action shapes as the elements in the cycle exist separately or are in interaction with each other. The subject should react to the stimuli from the outer world and get in interaction with the world to increase the experience. The regulations cause a passive receiving and an active perception. The experience increases when the subject and the object are involved with their lives as a result of effective perception. In case of nonparticipation, the subject becomes a watcher and the object becomes watched. Regulations that encourage to watch without  the participation and involvement will decrease the experience while the regulations that encourage participation to the space will increase the experience. The decrease and increase of experience depends on the strenght of the distinction between object and subject. The knowledge of the space is obtained by framing a relationship between the object and the subject. When the distinction between the object and subject is established, the subject  is positioned as the information resource for the object. Then “to look” becomes the main tool to reach all the information beyond the seen, without any leakage. According to this approach, to see an object requires to distinguish the difference between the knowing subject and informative object. How an “object” will be seen and a “subject” will see, are regulated by the gaze itself. Gaze regulations are oriented to the subject and the object. When action is also becomes the part of the one that gazes and the one that is gazed, one can observe the interactive loop. The body is also requisite for the action. Addition to this, the object is requiried by the body to take an action. The experience that {{will be part of the}} loop, which is built by the object, the subject and the action, is shaped differently if the elements of this loop are seperate or having an interaction between each other. In another word, gaze regulations frame the experience in a space accoring to the various positions which could either emphasize the difference or narrow the distance in between. The subject responds to the stimuli which comes from the world surrounding it. The subject responding to the impulses shows that it has an interaction with its environment. When the subject understands its environment efficently and effectively, it responds to the stimuli, becomes part of this environment and interacts with it. The difference between watching and participating reminds the difference between active perception and passive perception. If the body cannot become the part of the environment surrounding it, it starts to become passive. An efficent perception is required for an interaction between the subject and the object. Architectural object could be internalised by an efficent perception and accordingly, the experience is augmented. The stimulus by the subject is repsonded by the architectural object. Then one could see the possibilities for interaction between the subject and the object. There are many differences between different mutual expereinces of the object and the subject, it is not possible to compare the confrontation, tangency and rencounter. Visually attractive buildings collect the “gaze” on them. Instead of participating to them, one could only watch. In order to understand a building effectively, one oguht to be part of it in a daily basis. Otherwise the building becomes only an object to watch. In this study, it is intented to indicate how gaze regulations would affect the architectural experience. In the time when the images are multiplied numerously, how the architectural objects will be seen and the subjects will see them, becomes crucial. Gaze ragulations are oriented to the subject that looks and the space which is looked at. The second quesiton of this study tries to exaimne the tools which are used for regulating the gaze. It is seen that, occasionally these tools may emphasize the object or the subject. And it is intented to show how these tools actually affect the architectural experience accordingly. And this emphasis on the object or on the subject comes to prominence regarding the distance or narrowing the distance in between these two. In the study, the following headlines; focus, senses, memory, measurement, context and the body will be discussed as the <b>tools</b> that <b>regulate</b> the gaze. Under the headline of ‘focus’, perspective regulations that fix the eye to a central point or move it around the points; under the headline of ‘senses’, regulations that snatch the eye from other senses or open the space up to all sensory experiences; under the headline of ‘memory’, regulations that shape present time by past experiences or regulations of current expectations shaped by the old habits; under the headline of ‘measurement’, regulations that calculate the quantitative relationships between objects or aim to evaluate the interaction between the subject and the object; under the headline of ‘context’, regulations that demonstrate the structure in or out the context; under the headline of ‘body’, regulations that include or not include the body into the interaction area will be mentioned. The study opens up a discussion about how emphasis on the object and the subject shapes the experience by {{examining the}} circumstances of emphasis on the object and the subject by every <b>tool</b> that <b>regulates</b> the gaze.

40|$|Law {{was created}} to {{regulate}} the order of people 2 ̆ 7 s lives and to protect all components of a civilization. But lately laws in Indonesia gained sharp spotlights from all levels in the society. This happens because the law {{that is expected to}} be a <b>regulating</b> instrument, balancing <b>tool</b> between public and individual interests, and a driving catalyst to enhance the change processes to protect a community, is far off the expectation. Under the provisions of Article number 184 paragraph 1 of the Book of the Code of Criminal Procedure (KUHAP) explains that there are valid instruments of evidence that can be used in a court that including: description of witnesses, experts, information letters, instructions, and descriptions of defendant. Evidence of witnesses has an important role in uncovering the truth of material of a crime. In Article 229 paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code also mentioned that there is a right for a grant or a replacement cost for a witness or an expert who avowed to present at the hearing. Nonetheless, in the reality this right has not been fulfilled successfully. The objectives of this research paper therefore are: first, to know how is the implementation of the right to obtain a replacement fee for the witnesses in District Court of Pekanbaru according to the book of the code of criminal procedure (KUHAP); second, to know what are the obstacles in implementing this right; and third, to know what are the feasible solutions that can be done to put this right into practice effectively. The type of research done in this research was empirical juridical or legal sociological research. It was conducted at the state court and the state prosecutor of Pekanbaru. Sources of data used were primary, secondary, and tertiary. The technique of data collection was by literature research in library and direct interviews with various group of professionals and authorities. Data analysis was eventually analyzed by a deductive data method. The results of this research were: first, the practice of the law of allocating a replacement fee to witnesses in Pekanbaru was not effectively executed as the number of obstacles in practice is still high. Second, the obstacles found in implementing this right include: the lack of financial management in the court; lack of coordination and communication between the court and the prosecutor office; the lack of enforcement agency to monitor and control the activities of law implementation. Nevertheless, the people as the users of the law are ultimately unaware of the right that would benefit and protect themselves. Third, efforts that can be undertaken by the law enforcement agencies, especially in Pekanbaru area, are by proposing additional operating cost of the court, establishing cooperation and coordination with other relevant agencies, and increasing the frequency on education and socialization of the right to the respective people...|$|R
50|$|After the First World War, {{on account}} of the global trend of nations to {{formulate}} their monetary policies independently by establishing their respective central banks, which would be authorized to issue money, and to reinforce the political independence gained in the War of Independence with economic independence, deliberations about the establishment of a central bank in Turkey gained pace. This issue was first addressed in the 1923 Izmir Economic Congress with a special emphasis on founding a “national state bank”. In 1927, the Minister of Finance Abdülhalik Renda submitted a draft bill on the establishment of a central bank. Following the enactment of the law, Turkey exchanged views with the central banks of other countries’ in establishing the Turkish Central Bank. In 1928, having been invited to Turkey, Dr. G. Vissering, a member of the De Nederlandsche Bank (Central Bank of Netherlands), Board of Governors, highlighted in his report the necessity of an independent central bank not affiliated to the Government; espoused, in 1929, by Italian expert Count Volpi who suggested that the establishment of a central bank was necessary to ensure stability of the Turkish currency. Following these developments, the Government took the initiative to draft the necessary legal framework {{for the establishment of a}} central bank, and a draft was prepared for the Central Bank with the contributions of Prof. Leon Morf from the University of Lausanne.The law was enacted by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey on 11 June 1930, and published in the Official Gazette of 30 June 1930 under the name “The Law on the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey No. 1715”. Following the centralization of duties carried out by various institutions and organizations, the Central Bank started to function on 3 October 1931. The shares of the Bank, which acquired legal status as a joint stock company; - to manifest that ‘it is not a public entity’, and that ‘it is independent’, were divided into (A), (B), (C) and (D) classes. Class (A) shares belong solely to the Treasury, and, for the purpose of strengthening the Bank’s independence, it is stipulated in the Law No. 1715 that these shares shall not constitute more than fifteen percent of the capital. Class (B) shares are allocated to national banks; Class (C) shares are allocated to banks other than the national banks and to privileged companies; and Class (D) shares are allocated to Turkish commercial institutions and to legal and real persons of Turkish nationality. According to the Law No. 1715, the primary objective of the Central Bank was to support the economic development of the country. To this end, the Bank was authorized to set rediscount ratios (the main policy <b>tool),</b> <b>regulate</b> money markets and the circulation of money, execute Treasury operations, and take measures related to the stability of the Turkish currency. The Bank was vested with the exclusive privilege of issuing banknotes in Turkey. Additionally, the Bank also assumed the role of the treasurer of the Government. Under the fixed exchange rate regime implemented during that period, the Government was the authority to set the exchange rates. Independence of the Central Bank and low levels of inflation prevailed during the 1930s, as the Government could not intervene in the Bank’s field of authority and decisions.|$|R
40|$|Already in the 80 s, Winne (1982) {{argued that}} {{research}} on {{learning from instruction}} is mostly focused on the instructional stimuli as such and its effects on learning assuming that all learners process the stimuli as intended. Students actual processing of the instructional stimuli remains, he argued, a black box that is largely undocumented within research but needs more consideration. Research that investigates students tool-use within technology-enhanced learning environments opens Winnes black box and stresses its importance. In this respect, tools are defined as all those instructional (technology-supported or face-to-face) stimuli that are deliberately integrated into or added to the learning tasks and learning content in view of fostering students learning. Although these tools provide, theoretically, learning support, evidence suggests that {{only a minority of}} students profits from this learning support. Particularly, throughout multiple studies it was revealed that students tool-use is on average suboptimal i. e., on average tools are neglected or used in other ways as intended which had in most studies significant performance effects. In terms of Winnes (1982) black box, current tool-use evidence implies that the learning effectiveness of a learning environment depends on students adaptive tool-use or using tools in line with the learning task requirements. Nevertheless, current tool-use evidence indicates that this black box problem cannot be minimized since only a minority of students used the available tools adaptively. Consequently, more research on students adaptive tool-use seems necessary from an instructional design perspective. Current tool-use evidence is however mainly retrieved in controlled, technology-enhanced, learning environments that were uniquely designed for the research purpose. These controlled learning environments differ inherently from realistic, technology-enhanced learning environments in terms of tool-set, learning tasks and learning episode. As a consequence, the ecological validity of current tool-use evidence can be questioned. The current dissertation addressed this ecological validity and investigated students tool-use throughout an ecological technology-enhanced learning environment. As an introduction (cf. chapter 1), the dissertation hypothesized on a model of adaptive tool-use and its main components based on an analysis of the existing tool-use research and relevant theoretical frameworks i. e., Winnes (1982) cognitive conditions, Perkins (1985) framework and Nelson Le Galls (1985) and Newmans (1994) help-seeking model. In this respect, tool-use is conceptualized as a self-regulated strategy wherein students can <b>regulate</b> (a) the <b>tools</b> that they select (tool-diversity), (b) the way these tools are used (tool-activeness) and (c) the moment these tools are selected within the learning episode (tool-consistency). Adaptive tool-use on the other hand was conceptualized as (a) selecting those tools that are functional for the learning task at hand (tool-diversity), (b) use these tools as intended by the instructional designer (tool-activeness) and (c) reflect and monitor this tool-choice when learning tasks change accordingly (tool-consistency). Throughout three studies, the empirical validity of this model was investigated. The first study (cf. chapter 2) that was executed was a literature review that explored current tool-use evidence within content management supported courses i. e., the type of learning environment that was used throughout the PhD. Particularly, the literature review presented an overview over the existing research on students tool-use within CMS supported courses and related the main findings to our tool-use model. With respect to the latter, existing evidence was analyzed in relation to (a) students agency in tool-use, (b) performance effects of tool-use and (c) influencing student variables. The second study was an empirical study that aimed to explore the importance of the three components of adaptive tool-use i. e., diversity, activeness and consistency. Particularly, it was explored within chapter 3 whether student differences in tool-use reflect different tool-use patterns that mark differences in (a) students tool-diversity and (b) students tool-activeness. Additionally, it was investigated whether these differences affected students learning significantly and are hence important to consider. Chapter 4 explored whether students differed significantly in the moment tools were accessed (tool-consistency) and whether these temporal differences influenced students performance as well. The final empirical study was mainly focused on (1) replicating the tool-use patterns of the previous study with a new student group, (2) investigating the conditional factors for students tool-use and (3) investigating the importance of students tool-diversity, tool-activeness and tool-consistency in one analysis. The different findings of these two empirical studies are related {{to each other and to}} our tool-use model in the conclusion. Additionally, new research opportunities are addressed that come out of these findings. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Stem cell {{maintenance}} and differentiation are regulated by local inductive cues; one {{potential source of}} inductive cues is the extracellular matrix. The fundamental hypothesis of the thesis was that differentiation of embryonic stem cells can be manipulated by substrates onto which cells are plated thus, our first experimental chapter explores {{the impact of the}} extracellular matrix proteins, laminin, fibronectin and type IV collagen on neural induction of E 14 Tg 2 a mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) plated as adherent monolayers. In-cell Western assays were carried out to determine coating efficiency of selected matrix proteins. Cell viability and proliferation was estimated using the MTT assay. In addition, the effect of matrix proteins on neurite outgrowth of mESCs-derived neurons was evaluated by counting the number of primary neurites (using βIII tubulin labelling) and neural progenitor (nestin). Total neurite length per neuron was quantified on neurons derived from the differentiated mESCs. Immunocytochemistry against tyrosine hydroxylase and βIII tubulin was used to observe the progression of neuronal maturation of cells plated onto matrix proteins. The MTT assay was used to determine the effect of each matrix on adhesion of mESCs, 24 hours after replating. The results showed that laminin and fibronectin were associated with increase in cell adhesion and they also enhanced the proliferation rate of mESCs when compared to type IV collagen. Laminin significantly increased the number of βIII tubulin positive cells 96 hours after re-plating, but failed to result in a larger numbers of positive catecholaminergic neurons.   Second experimental chapter focused on effect of the immobilization of growth factors [sonic hedgehog (Shh), fibroblast growth factor 8 b (FGF 8) and fibroblast growth factor basic (FGF 2) ] on the generation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons from mESCs. A combination of matrix proteins components was produced by incubating laminin, fibronectin, type IV collagen and heparan sulphate in a ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 : 0. 1. This mixture was used to immobilize growth factors within matrix proteins via non-covalent interactions. In-cell Western assays were carried out to identify stable immobilization of growth factors onto the matrix proteins. The effect of matrix proteins with and without growth factors on neural differentiation was investigated by determining the expression of the AMPR gene (encoding beta-lactamase) in Lmx 1 a-AMP mESCs. Immunocytochemistry was used to observe the progression of neuronal maturation under different conditions. FGF 2 and FGF 8 b were successfully immobilized on a combination of selected matrix proteins but the immobilized factors failed to demonstrate any significant effect on the proportion of cells expressing Lmx 1 a. This is likely to be explained by the unexpected high proportion of Lmx 1 a expressing cells produced {{even in the absence of}} specific growth factors. In the last experimental chapter the focus was on investigation of the signaling pathways that <b>regulate</b> differentiations. New <b>tools</b> to promote the differentiation of stem cells into particular cell types can be generated by identifying specific cues in the microenvironments and deciphering how neighbouring cells and the extracellular matrix control developmental fate. It is well established that complex interactions between soluble and extracellular matrix molecules regulate intracellular signaling and differentiation.   Many of these signaling events involve one or more kinases including; focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt, hereafter called Akt), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) – such as those also known as Extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs). However, the relevance of a given signaling molecule in mediating the pro-survival signaling induced by extracellular matrix appears to be cell–type specific. Therefore, it is desirable to determine which of these intracellular signaling pathways might be involved in the effects of extracellular matrix on survival and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. This chapter explores the role of small molecule inhibitors of FAK, PI 3 K, Akt and MAPK-ERK on adhesion and proliferation of cells produced by neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells. The focus of the chapter is on early events in neural induction making use of Sox 1 -eGFP reporter ESCs. This cell line expresses the eGFP reporter under control of the Sox 1 promoter, one allele expressing eGFP and the other Sox 1. The work showed that plating onto laminin (but not gelatin or poly-D-lysine) activated PI 3 K-Akt and MAPK-ERK survival signaling pathways. Plating of cells on laminin in the presence of CHIR 99021, or in combination with PF 562271, resulted in significant conversion of viable embryonic stem cells to Sox 1 + neural stem/progenitor cells, indicating the role of laminin in the generation and survival of neurons...|$|R
40|$|With the {{detection}} of anti-androgenicity in the effluents from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), there is speculation that sexual disruption in fish is a multi-causal condition involving anti-androgens. Much of the research has focussed on deciphering the modes-of-action (MoAs) of (anti) estrogens and androgens. However, effects of androgen receptor (AR) antagonists have not been fully characterised and remain elusive in fish. The present study aimed to investigate {{the effects of the}} classic mammalian anti-androgen, flutamide and the emerging industrial pollutant, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) on the biomarkers of reproduction in adult (male and female) and juvenile Murray rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis). Flutamide is the “pure” anti-androgen designed to treat prostate cancer in men and polycystic ovarian syndrome in women. It has also been extensively used in toxicity testing in mammals. The in vitro anti-androgenic activity in the aquatic environment worldwide is measured in flutamide equivalents. Phthalates are a class of synthetic industrial chemicals commonly found in the aquatic environment worldwide. They have been recognised as anti-androgens in male mammals but little is known about their endocrine-disrupting effects in the native Australian fish species. Due to its detection in freshwater both in Australia and worldwide and considering its higher solubility in water (11 mg/L), it is important to investigate effects of DnBP on the reproductive fitness of native Australian fish species. Flutamide is not an environmental contaminant and has not been detected in freshwater. However, it is used as the reference chemical to quantify antiandrogenic activity in aquatic environment using in vitro assays. In addition, flutamide is also used as the model anti-androgen to investigate anti-androgenic effects in mammals. Adult female and male Murray rainbowfish were exposed to biologically active concentrations (nominal 125 – 1000 μg/L) of flutamide for 7 days. In females, histological investigation revealed marked atresia and absence of mature oocytes in the flutamide-treated fish at all concentrations investigated. Reduction in the sizes of the vitellogenic oocytes was found after treatment with 500 and 1000 μg/L flutamide. The plasma VTG and the activity of brain aromatase were reduced in fish treated with 500 and 1000 μg/L flutamide. Treatment with 500 and 1000 μ/L flutamide reduced the concentrations of 11 -keto testosterone (11 -KT) and 17 β-estradiol (E 2) in plasma. In males, qualitative assessment of the testes of the fish exposed to 125 – 1000 μg/L flutamide exhibited inhibition in transformation of spermatogonia to spermatozoa and increased testicular anomalies like multinucleated and pyknotic cells and interstitial fibrosis. VTG was induced in plasma after an exposure to 1000 μg/L of flutamide. The activity of brain aromatase declined after exposure to flutamide at all concentrations. Males exposed to 1000 μg/L of flutamide showed a down-regulation of the hepatic genes encoding androgen receptors α (ARα) and ARβ. The expression levels of the genes for the estrogen receptor α (ERα) were up-regulated and those of VTG were downregulated after treatment with 250 – 1000 μg/L of flutamide. Juvenile rainbowfish were exposed to the nominal concentrations 25 ng/L E 2, 25 μg/L flutamide, 250 μg/L flutamide, 25 ng/L E 2 + 25 μg/L flutamide and 25 ng/L E 2 + 250 μg/L flutamide. Co-treatment with Flu high and E 2 resulted in significant reductions in weights and lengths in males and condition factor in females. Inter-sex was noted in Flu high and E 2 +Flu high treated fish. The development of spermatocytes in the testes was inhibited by E 2 and this effect was accentuated after co-treatment with flutamide. Exposures to E 2 resulted in precocious oocyte development in the ovaries which was further up-regulated when fish were co-exposed to E 2 and flutamide. The E 2 levels decreased significantly in the head of both males and females after co-exposures to flutamide and E 2. Flutamide and E 2 alone increased the 11 -KT levels in both sexes. However, E 2 +Flu low decreased 11 -KT levels in males and increased them in females. Flutamide (low and high) induced VTG protein in the tails of both sexes. In males, VTG was induced in the tail tissue after exposure to flutamide but not E 2. No significant increase of flutamide on E 2 -induced VTG concentration was noted. We concluded that anti-androgens do not add to the effects of estrogens due to different modes of action. However, they induce similar effects which can cause additive inhibition/stimulation of the gonad development. Sexually mature female and male Murray rainbowfish were exposed to sub-acute concentrations of 125 – 1000 μg/L DnBP for 7 days. The testes in 125 – 1000 μg/L DnBPexposed fish were in the early spermatogenic stage with a higher proportion of spermatogonia. The sizes of spermatogonia, Type A and B spermatocytes and spermatids were significantly smaller relative to the controls after treatment with 125 – 1000 μg/L of DnBP. The sizes of the previtellogenic oocytes in the 250 – 1000 μg/L treated fish were higher than those in the corresponding control fish. The early vitellogenic oocytes in the 1000 μg/L treated fish were smaller relative to those in the unexposed fish. Histological changes like chorion folding, shrunken ooplasm, impaired yolk production, granulomatous inflammation and interstitial fibrosis were observed in the ovaries of the fish treated with DnBP at all concentrations. The plasma VTG was significantly lower in the female and higher in males exposed to 500 – 1000 μg/L DnBP. An induction in the expression levels of the genes encoding for ERα and β and choriogenin L, coupled with an amplified activity of aromatase in the brain for the 1000 μg/L of DnBP treatment suggested an estrogenic MoA of DnBP in male fish. Juvenile fish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (5, 15 and 50 μg/L) of DnBP for 90 days. The lowest observed effective concentration to significantly affect the condition factor after 90 days was 5 μg/L. Histological investigation revealed complete feminisation of the gonad in fish exposed to 5 μg/L for 90 days and to 15 and 50 μg/L of DnBP at all sampling times. In addition, incidences of inter-sex gonads were noted in the 15 and 50 μg/L of DnBP treatments {{at the end of the}} exposure period. After 90 days of exposure to DnBP, the ovaries were regressed and immature. Testes, present only in fish exposed to 5 μg/L of DnBP for 30 or 60 days, were vacuolated and immature. There was a significant induction in E 2 concentration in fish exposed to 5 μg/L of DnBP for 90 days and in 15 and 50 μg/L DnBP treatments at all sampling times. Long-term exposure to low concentration (5 μg/L for 90 days) had similar hormonal effects as short-term exposure to higher concentration of DnBP (50 μg/L for 30 days) in causing in vivo estrogenicity. Longterm continuous exposures to 5 μg/L of DnBP for up to 30 days did not have profound effects on body growth and gonadal differentiation of fish. However, 30 days of continuous exposures to 15 μg/L could interfere with the gonad development and to 50 μg/L could compromise the hormonal profile of juvenile fish. The study, for the first time, reported the differential effects of two anti-androgens in male, female and juvenile Australian fish species. Using an integrated approach of histological, biochemical and molecular tools, the hypothetical models of effects and potential MoAs of flutamide and DnBP have been proposed. The data from the present study suggest that continuous exposures to biologically active concentrations of flutamide for 7 days can cause anti-androgenicity in male and defeminisation in female adult Murray rainbowfish. In addition, 35 day exposures to the anti-androgen, flutamide can induce feminisation in juvenile Murray rainbowfish and the effects of flutamide are cumulative in combination with E 2. It was also concluded that continuous exposures to sub-acute concentrations of DnBP for 7 days can cause estrogenicity in male and anti-estrogenic effects in female adult Murray rainbowfish. Treatments with environmentally relevant concentrations of DnBP for 90 days during sensitive phases of development in juvenile Murray rainbowfish adversely affect the fish growth and gonad development. It is proposed that short-term exposures to high concentrations and long-term exposures to low concentrations of DnBP have similar reproductive endocrine effects. Australian water quality guidelines recommend DnBP concentrations should be < 9. 9 μg/L for freshwater ecosystems ([URL] guidelines-fresh-and-marine-water-quality-volume- 1 -guidelines). Levels of DnBP found in freshwaters in Australia (47 ng/L) do not pose a threat to the reproductive fitness of Murray rainbowfish. However, there is a strong need to revise the water quality guidelines for DnBP in freshwater in Australia for future reference. It is also recommended to detect, identify and quantify individual anti-androgens in freshwater in Australia and worldwide. In addition, identification of the genes and testing molecular <b>tools</b> <b>regulating</b> gonadal differentiation in Murray rainbowfish are needed to assess the reversibility of the effects caused by environmental chemicals. It is important to investigate the endocrine disruption, if any, in the fish thriving in this aquatic environment in Australia using field caging studies. Similar studies have been reported in Europe and the US. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 201...|$|R
