2500|$|Beckman saw an opportunity, and {{rethinking}} the project, {{decided to create}} a complete chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists. By October 1934, he had <b>registered</b> <b>patent</b> application US Patent No. 2,058,761 for his [...] "acidimeter", later renamed the pH meter. The Arthur H. Thomas Company, a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in Philadelphia, was willing to try selling it. [...] Although it was priced expensively at $195, roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time, it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components, about $500. The original pH meter weighed in at nearly 7kg, but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment. The earliest meter had a design glitch, in that the pH readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes, but Beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{the image}} of the harp is used on the coins, {{passports}} and official seals of Ireland and is incorporated into the emblems of many bodies in Northern Ireland, such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The harp is frequently incorporated into the emblems of Irish companies, [...] such as Guinness and Ryanair. It appears on the arms of countries with historical links to Ireland or the United Kingdom, such as Montserrat and Canada. In 1984, exemplars of the modern design, approved by the Chief Herald, were registered by the Government of Ireland with the World Intellectual Property Organization under Article 6ter of the Paris Convention, which relates to state emblems. The government only registered [...] "left-facing" [...] images, with the harp's sound board on the right. While the Attorney General's office felt that right-facing images should also be <b>registered,</b> <b>patent</b> agents advised this might be interfere with Guinness Brewery's use of such harps in its logo since the 1870s.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{generation}} of [...] "MP3" [...] style data streams (files) extended the MPEG-2 ideas and implementation but was named MPEG-2.5 audio, since MPEG-3 {{already had a}} different meaning. [...] This extension was developed at Fraunhofer IIS, the <b>registered</b> <b>patent</b> holders of MP3 by reducing the frame sync field in the MP3 header from 12 to 11 bits. As in the transition from MPEG-1 to MPEG-2, MPEG-2.5 adds additional sampling rates exactly half of those available using MPEG-2. [...] It thus widens the scope of MP3 to include human speech and other applications yet requires only 25% of the bandwidth (frequency reproduction) possible using MPEG-1 sampling rates. [...] While not an ISO recognized standard, MPEG-2.5 is widely supported by both inexpensive Chinese and brand name digital audio players as well as computer software based MP3 encoders (LAME), decoders (FFmpeg) and players (MPC) adding 3*8=24 additional MP3 frame types. [...] Each generation of MP3 thus supports 3 sampling rates exactly half that of the previous generation {{for a total of}} 9 varieties of MP3 format files. [...] The sample rate comparison table between MPEG-1, 2 and 2.5 is given later in the article. [...] MPEG-2.5 is supported by both LAME (since 2000), Media Player Classic (MPC), iTunes, and FFmpeg.|$|E
