25|$|<b>Relational</b> <b>{{aggression}},</b> {{also known}} as covert aggression or covert bullying {{is a type of}} aggression in which harm is caused through damage to relationships or social status within a group rather than physical violence. <b>Relational</b> <b>aggression</b> is more common and has been studied more among girls than boys.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} classifications and {{dimensions}} of aggression have been suggested. These depend on {{such things as}} whether the aggression is verbal or physical; {{whether or not it}} involves <b>relational</b> <b>aggression</b> such as covert bullying and social manipulation; whether harm to others is intended or not; whether it is carried out actively or expressed passively; and whether the aggression is aimed directly or indirectly. Classification may also encompass aggression-related emotions (e.g. anger) and mental states (e.g. impulsivity, hostility). Aggression may occur in response to non-social as well as social factors, and can have a close relationship with stress coping style. Aggression may be displayed in order to intimidate.|$|E
30|$|Among {{the types}} of aggressions the {{participants}} mentioned, <b>relational</b> <b>aggressions</b> (humiliation, gossip, exclusion, etc.) were the most reported, followed by verbal and physical aggressions. This data {{is consistent with the}} literature, as verbal aggressions are more common than physical aggressions in bullying, especially as age advances and verbal language improves (Bandeira and Hutz, 2012, 2014; Dodge et al., 2006; Olweus, 1993; Terroso, Wendt, Oliveira, & Argimon, 2016). Nevertheless, although part of the participants’ acknowledge that <b>relational</b> <b>aggressions</b> are the most frequent, physical aggression is the main type in the collective imaginary concerning bullying and the target of caregivers’ major concern (Borsa et al., 2015; Sawyer et al., 2011). It is important to mention that who has contact with children involved in situations of bullying should be capable of observing the effects of this practice on child development (Shakoor et al., 2011).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{categorize}} workplace aggression into nine subtypes based on human aggression and workplace aggression literature, and to examine gender differences in engaging in these subtypes of workplace aggression.

25|$|According to {{the journal}} of Aggressive Behaviour, an {{analysis}} across 9 countries found boys reported more {{in the use of}} physical aggression. At the same time no consistent sex differences emerged within <b>relational</b> <b>aggression.</b> It has been found that girls are more likely than boys to use reactive aggression and then retract, but boys are more likely to increase rather than to retract their aggression after their first reaction. Studies show girls' aggressive tactics included gossip, ostracism, breaking confidences, and criticism of a victim's clothing, appearance, or personality, whereas boys engage in aggression that involves a direct physical and/or verbal assault. This could be {{due to the fact that}} girls' frontal lobes develop earlier than boys, allowing them to self-restrain.|$|E
25|$|Gender is {{a factor}} that {{plays a role in}} both human and animal aggression. Males are {{historically}} believed to be generally more physically aggressive than females from an early age, and men commit the vast majority of murders (Buss 2005). This {{is one of the most}} robust and reliable behavioral sex differences, and it has been found across many different age groups and cultures. However, some empirical studies have found the discrepancy in male and female aggression to be more pronounced in childhood and the gender difference in adults to be modest when studied in an experimental context. Still, there is evidence that males are quicker to aggression (Frey et al. 2003) and more likely than females to express their aggression physically. When considering indirect forms of non-violent aggression, such as <b>relational</b> <b>aggression</b> and social rejection, some scientists argue that females can be quite aggressive, although female aggression is rarely expressed physically. An exception is intimate partner violence that occurs among couples who are engaged, married, or in some other form of intimate relationship. In such cases, some research suggests that women are more physically aggressive than men, although differences are small and men are less likely to be injured than women are.|$|E

50|$|In adolescence, social {{aggression}} boosts female's popularity {{by maintaining}} and controlling the social hierarchy. Furthermore, males are also ranked higher in popularity {{if they are}} physically aggressive. But, if males practice <b>relational</b> or social <b>aggression</b> then they are seen as unpopular among their peers. When it comes to different forms social aggression, males {{are more prone to}} use direct measures and females indirect.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree to}} which an {{individual}} is perceived as popular is often highly correlated {{with the level of}} aggression with which that individual interacts with his or her peers. There are two main categories of <b>aggression,</b> <b>relational</b> and overt, both of which have varying consequences for popularity depending on several factors, such as the gender and attractiveness of the aggressor.|$|R
2500|$|Retaliation and {{backlash}} against a victim are very common, particularly a complainant. Victims who {{speak out against}} sexual harassment are often labeled troublemakers who {{are on their own}} [...] "power trips", or who are looking for attention. Similar to cases of rape or sexual assault, the victim often becomes the accused, with their appearance, private life, and character likely to fall under intrusive scrutiny and attack. They risk hostility and isolation from colleagues, supervisors, teachers, fellow students, and even friends. They may become the targets of mobbing or <b>relational</b> <b>aggression.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "hostile {{attribution}} bias" [...] {{was first}} coined in 1980 by Nasby, Hayden, and DePaulo who noticed, {{along with several}} other key pioneers in this research area (e.g., Kenneth Dodge), that a subgroup of children tend to attribute hostile intent to ambiguous social situations more often than other children. Since then, hostile attribution bias has been conceptualized as a bias of social information processing (similar to other attribution biases), including the way individuals perceive, interpret, and select responses to situations. While occasional hostile attribution bias is normative (particularly for younger children), {{researchers have found that}} individuals who exhibit consistent and high levels of hostile attribution bias across development {{are much more likely to}} engage in aggressive behavior (e.g., hitting/fighting, reacting violently, verbal or <b>relational</b> <b>aggression)</b> toward others.|$|E
2500|$|Substantial {{literature}} has documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggression in youth. Hostile attribution bias is traditionally associated with overt physical aggression (e.g., hitting, fighting), such that {{higher levels of}} hostile attribution bias predict more aggressive behavior. In particular, much evidence suggests that hostile attribution bias is especially linked to [...] "reactive aggression" [...] (i.e., impulsive and [...] "hot-blooded" [...] aggression that reflects an angry retaliation to perceived provocation) rather than [...] "proactive aggression" [...] (i.e., unprovoked, planned/instrumental, or [...] "cold-blooded" [...] aggression). Beyond physical aggression, elevated hostile attribution bias is also associated with increased use of <b>relational</b> <b>aggression</b> (e.g., gossip, spreading rumors, social exclusion). This is particularly the case when youth attribute hostile intent to ambiguous relational situations (e.g., not receiving {{an invitation to a}} party or not receiving a response to a text).|$|E
50|$|Although victims {{respond to}} {{bullying}} in various ways, {{some of the}} most common ways include avoidance or escape behaviors, such as not going to school and running away from home. However, in some extreme cases, suicide attempts might occur. Compared to non-victims, victims exhibit increased levels of suicidal ideation. {{and are more likely to}} have attempted suicide. Researcher Y.S. Kim (2005) found that there are some gender differences as victimized female but not male students were at significantly greater risk for suicidal ideation.Further research has shown that increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts depend on a specific interaction between gender, frequency, and type of <b>aggression.</b> <b>Relational</b> or indirect <b>aggression</b> was found to be associated with depression and suicidal ideation among both genders. According to Brustein and Klomek (2007), victimization at any frequency increased the risk of depression, ideation, and attempts among girls, while only frequent victimization increased the risk of depression and ideation among males; yet, Katliala-Heino et al. (1999) found that severe ideation was associated with frequent victimization only among girls.|$|R

Childhood aggression is associated with maladaptive social information processing in general and maladaptive social goals in particular.

2500|$|According to the 2015 International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, sex {{differences}} in aggression {{is one of the}} most robust and oldest findings in psychology. Past meta-analyses in the encyclopedia found males regardless of age engaged in more physical and verbal aggression while small effect for females engaging in more indirect aggression such as rumor spreading or gossiping. It also found males tend to engage in more unprovoked aggression at higher frequency than females. This analysis also conforms with the Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology which reviewed past analysis which found men to use more verbal and physical aggression with the difference being greater in the physical type. There are more recent findings that show that differences in male and female aggression appear at about two years of age, though the differences in aggression are more consistent in middle-aged children and adolescence. Tremblay, Japel and Pérusse (1999) asserted that physically aggressive behaviors such as kicking, biting and hitting are age-typical expressions of innate and spontaneous reactions to biological drives such as anger, hunger, and affiliation. Girls' <b>relational</b> <b>aggression,</b> meaning non-physical or indirect, tends to increase after age two while physical aggression decreases. There was no significant difference in aggression between males and females before two years of age. A possible explanation for this could be that girls develop language skills more quickly than boys, therefore they have better ways of verbalizing their wants and needs. They are more likely to use communication when trying to retrieve a toy with the words [...] "Ask nicely" [...] or [...] "Say please." ...|$|E
2500|$|Communication within {{peer groups}} allows {{adolescents}} {{to explore their}} feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members {{the opportunity to develop}} social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent's own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter. Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers. Both physical and <b>relational</b> <b>aggression</b> are linked to a vast number of enduring psychological difficulties, especially depression, as is social rejection. Because of this, bullied adolescents often develop problems that lead to further victimization. Bullied adolescents are more likely to both continue to be bullied and to bully others in the future. However, this relationship is less stable in cases of cyberbullying, a relatively new issue among adolescents.|$|E

Finally, the relation of playground aggression to student self-reports of playground worries was evaluated. School Climate Theory provided the conceptual framework for evaluating playground characteristics, student aggression, and worry. Participants included 767 third, fourth, and fifth grade students and 57 playground supervisors from 10 Midwest elementary schools. Participants completed reports of aggression (students and staff), playground worries (students only), and playground environmental factors (staff only).

40|$|Background: Women {{in medium}} secure {{services}} can present with aggressive behaviours {{and a high}} level of risk to self and others. Research suggests frontline staff are frequently the victims of, or witness to aggression by forensic inpatients. The therapeutic relationship is proposed as central to therapeutic outcome, but may be jeopardised by inpatient aggression. Staff perceptions of the therapeutic relationship and aggression have not been explored in women’s medium secure services. The study aimed to develop a theoretical model grounded in frontline staff perceptions of the therapeutic alliance and aggression in a women’s medium secure services. Method: The data from 13 semi-structured interviews conducted with frontline staff was analysed using Constructivist Grounded Theory methods. Results: The tentative descriptive theoretical model “Relating Following Aggression” emerged from the interview data. Contextual information supports five core categories, and the related sub-categories. The findings propose the therapeutic relationship is intrinsically linked to boundaries, and boundary violations could result in <b>relational</b> deterioration. <b>Aggression</b> affected the emotional and psychological wellbeing of the participants, and compromised the staff-patient relationship. The participants were fearful of aggression occurring in their workplace which resulted in them spending less time with the women and withdrawing from the therapeutic relationship. Conclusion: The findings reveal the complexity of the frontline staff-patient relationship in women’s services. Aggression occurring between frontline staff and women can seriously compromise the therapeutic relationship through a crossing of the boundary line and a perceived breach of trust. Greater support for both the frontline staff and women is required. Future research is recommended.

40|$|Although {{exclusion}} {{is commonly}} {{thought of as}} a form of <b>relational</b> or social <b>aggression,</b> it often reflects attempts at maintaining friendships, drawing group boundaries, and optimizing group functioning and can thus also be considered an inevitable feature of normative social interactions.

Eighty-four participants, aged 7, 12, and 17, provided one narrative account of a time when they had been excluded (victim) and one of a time when they had excluded someone else (perpetrator). Narratives differed in several expected ways, depending on the perspective from which they were told. Nevertheless, from both perspectives, participants referred to the reasons underlying the exclusion. Notably, also, from both perspectives, participants seldom referred to the victim’s emotions. Significant age differences in types of exclusionary behaviors, perpetrator’s role, and evaluations suggest age-related changes in the meanings of exclusion, with adolescents becoming increasingly attuned to the complexities and inevitability of exclusion. No significant gender differences were observed. Overall, this study provided insight into how the multifaceted nature of exclusion gets played out in children’s real-life experiences...|$|R
