5000|$|... "Vertical interoperability" [...] is a {{situation}} in which SIF agents at different levels of an organization communicate using a SIF Zone. Vertical interoperability involves data collection from multiple agents (upward) or publishing of information to multiple agents (downward). For example, a state-level data warehouse may listen for changes in district-level data warehouses and update its database accordingly. Or a state entity may wish to publish teacher certification data to districts. The three pieces of the SIF specification that deal directly with vertical interoperability are the Student Locator object, the Vertical <b>Reporting</b> <b>object,</b> and the Data Warehouse object.A good example of this would be the Century Consultants SIS Agent working with the Pearson SLF Agent sending student data to the State Agency and getting Student Testing Identifiers in return.|$|E
40|$|World Wide Web content {{providers}} often {{resort to}} "cache-busting" {{in order to}} obtain demographic information. Object usage reporting methods have been proposed to address this problem. We quantitatively compare strategies for <b>reporting</b> <b>object</b> hits from proxy caches back to origin servers, and propose novel strategies for improving reporting performance and efficiency. Examining hit-metering and usage-limiting approaches proposed in RFC 2227, we find a fundamental trade-off between reporting latency and efficiency. Further, we find the temporal locality in the server reference stream to be significantly stronger than that in the object reference stream. We propose a server report aggregation strategy that leverages this fact, and show that it can reduce reporting latency and improve efficiency by as much as 80 % and 100 % respectively. We also propose and evaluate additional strategies to improve performance. These include: dynamic reporting thresholds, report aggregation in a cache hierarchy, and piggybacking reports on existing HTTP messages...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of allocating a set of {{indivisible}} goods to multiple agents. Recent work [Bouveret and Lang, 2011] focused on allocating goods in a sequential way, and studied what is the "best" sequence of agents to pick objects based on utilitarian or egalitarian criterion. In this paper, we propose a parallel elicitation-free protocol for allocating indivisible goods. In every round of the allocation process, some agents will be selected (according to some policy) to <b>report</b> their preferred <b>objects</b> among those that remain, and every <b>reported</b> <b>object</b> will be allocated randomly to an agent reporting it. Empirical comparison between the parallel protocol (applying a simple selection policy) and the sequential protocol (applying the optimal sequence) reveals that our proposed protocol is promising. We also address strategical issues. Comment: IJCAI- 2013 Multidisciplinary Workshop on Advances in Preference Handlin...|$|R

Although the monkeys <b>reported</b> <b>object</b> identity, not location, neural activity specifying target location was evident in FEF before neural activity specifying target identity in IT.

40|$|Spatial {{attention}} in natural settings is investigated by asking subjects {{to report on}} what {{they are looking at}} as they walk through the environment. The number of <b>objects</b> <b>reported</b> at different locations within the environment peaks at a point {{directly in front of the}} walker at a distance of approximately 10 ft in an outdoor space and 6 ft in an indoor space. A physiological explanation of these results is proposed by noting that single cells in the brain may respond selectively to head direction. If so, human discrimination of angular changes of an object's position may depend on egocentric distance. This process might also scale with the size of the space within which judgments are being rendered. Spatial {{attention in}} humans In 1944 Brunswik introduced a method for exploring the allocation of visual attention in a natural environment. A female observer was accompanied along a walk around a familiar, outdoor space. At random time intervals she was interrupted and asked to tell what she was looking at.
