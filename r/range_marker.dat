Through the EB distributed within± 1 °, most of them were maldistributed on the minus side and the mean values of the ED were negative in all ranges. We estimate that the main cause for these tendencies was that some errors were included in the Gyro Compass and also in the personal equations when matching the <b>range</b> <b>marker</b> or cursor line with the target and reading the dial gage.

40|$|The {{envelope}} glycoproteins {{of several}} avian tumor virus recombinants {{selected for the}} host range of a leukosis virus and the transforming function of a sarcoma virus were compared {{with each other and}} with those of their parents. It was found that the glycoproteins of different recombinant viruses, derived from the same parents, differed in their electrophoretic mobilities measured in polyacrylmide gels. The glycoproteins that had lower electrophoretic mobilities had higher precentages of carbohydrate. The carbohydrate of viral glycoproteins was estimated to range between 8 and 18 % from their buoyant densities in CsCl, using known glycoproteins as standards. After exhaustive Pronase digestion, the carbohydrate was recovered from viral glycoproteins as a mixture of glycopeptides with molecular weights ranging from 2, 500 to 5, 000. It was estimated that distinct viral glycoproteins contained between two and five such oligosaccharide chains and that the glycoproteins of different recombinants expressing the same host <b>range</b> <b>marker</b> may differ in the number of oligosaccharide chains and consequently also in their polypeptide structure. Those with lower electrophoretic mobility contain more oligosaccharide chains per molecule than those with higher electrophoretic mobilities.

40|$|Synaptophysin is an {{integral}} membrane glycoprotein originally isolated from presynaptic vesicles of bovine neurons. The authors have studied {{a wide spectrum of}} neuroendocrine (NE) neoplasms by immunofluorescence microscopy on cryostat sections of freshly frozen tissues using a monoclonal antibody to this protein (SY 38). Without exception, they found the identical [...] or a very similar [...] protein expressed in all neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, ganglioneuromas, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas studied. In these "neural" type NE neoplasms, synaptophysin was coexpressed with neurofilament proteins. Synaptophysin was also demonstrated in NE neoplasms of "epithelial" type in which it was predominantly coexpressed with cytokeratins and desmoplakin. It was invariably found in all variants of islet cell neoplasms and in all medullary thyroid carcinomas. Synaptophysin was also demonstrated in several adenomas of the hypophysis and parathyroids, in the majority of carcinoids of the bronchopulmonary and gastrointestinal tracts, and in many, though not all, NE carcinomas of the same sites, and of the skin. Conversely, SY 38 did not immunostain any {{of a large number of}} benign and malignant non-NE epithelial neoplasms; nor was any immunostaining obtained in a group of mesenchymal tumors. It is remarkable that SY 38 did not immunostain a number of malignant melanomas, including several that were immunostained for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and several neuropeptides. Parallel studies conducted on conventionally fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections immunostained by the use of the avidin-biotin complex technique yielded very similar results. The findings indicate that synaptophysin is expressed in the whole range of NE neoplasms without detectable relation to the expression of other NE markers such as NSE, serotonin, and neuropeptides. Nor could the expression of synaptophysin by these tumors be correlated with their epithelial and/or neural cytoskeletal characteristics, their clinical aggressiveness, or the presence or absence of endocrinologic abnormalities. While the consistent expression of synaptophysin by the "neural" type of NE neoplasms would seem predictable its presence in diverse benign and malignant NE tumors of "epithelial" type is remarkable. It is concluded that synaptophysin is a significant as well as novel NE marker, and the use of antibody SY 38 as a broad <b>range</b> <b>marker</b> for the study and diagnosis of NE neoplasms is proposed...|$|E

40|$|The common {{garden ant}} Lasius niger use both trail pheromones and memory of past visits to {{navigate}} {{to and from}} food sources. In a recent paper we demonstrated a synergistic effect between route memory and trail pheromones: the presence of trail pheromones results in experienced ants walking straighter and faster. We also found that experienced ants leaving a pheromone trail deposit less pheromone. Here we focus on another finding of the experiment: the presence of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), which are used as home <b>range</b> <b>markers</b> by ants, also affects pheromone deposition behavior. When walking on a trail on which CHCs are present but trail pheromones are not, experienced foragers deposit less pheromone on the outward journey than on the return journey. The regulatory mechanisms ants use during foraging and recruitment behavior is subtle and complex, affected by multiple interacting factors such as route memory, travel direction and the presence trail pheromone and home-range markings...|$|R
