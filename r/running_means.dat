To this end we examine changes in daily variation as derived from hourly mean values from 15 geomagnetic observatories {{around the world with}} records extending back to 1900. For the period after 1947 we, not surprisingly, find correlations with the F 10. 7 flux density, a solar irradiance proxy. We here examine a more robust technique of removing the solar cycle signal than simply applying 11 -year <b>running</b> <b>means.</b> This involves a procedure developed by Lockwood and Fröhlich (2007) to account for the variations in the solar cycle length. We find a long-term increase in the amplitude of the daily variation since 1900, confirming earlier results using fewer data from fewer observatories and 11 -year <b>running</b> <b>means</b> (Macmillan and Droujinina, 2007).

40|$|The {{precipitation}} data for some regions in South Africa were studied {{for the period}} 1900 – 1998. From the 11 regions examined, 8 in South Africa had maximum precipitations in the austral summer months (December, January, February, March), while 3 had maxima in autumn and winter. Annual values showed considerable year-to-year fluctuations (50 % to 200 % of the mean), while five-year <b>running</b> <b>means</b> showed long-term fluctuations (75 % to 150 % of the mean). A spectrum analysis indicated periodicities in the ranges 2 – 3 (quasi-biennial oscillation, QBO), 3 – 4 (quasi-triennial oscillation, QTO), 6 – 11, 17 – 21, 23 – 26, 32 – 35 and 55 – 66 years, some common to, and some different in different regions. The QBO and QTO accounted for a substantial fraction (30 – 50 %) of the total variance. In five-year <b>running</b> <b>means,</b> the effects of QBO and QTO were suppressed considerably. The plots showed distinct peaks, but the spacings varied in a wide range, indicating that predictions based on extrapolation of single peaks {{are not likely to}} come true even for decadal averages. El Niño effects for the giant event of 1982 / 83 were as expected but those for 1997 / 98 were obscure, almost absent. <b>Running</b> <b>means</b> over 21 years did not indicate linear trends, upwards or downwards. Instead, considerable oscillations were seen, with magnitudes different in different regions (5 – 25 %).

40|$|Locomotor {{activity}} {{recordings of}} Syrian hamsters were systematically analyzed {{to estimate the}} precision of the overt circadian activity rhythm in constant darkness. Phase variation, i. e., the standard deviation of phase markers around the regression line, varied with the definition of phase. Smallest phase variation {{was found in the}} onset of wheel running activity defined by 1 h <b>running</b> <b>means</b> of the raw data. Both lower and higher degrees of smoothing lead to decreased precision measured in the overt rhythm. With passive infrared recordings, the midpoint of activity defined by 3 h <b>running</b> <b>means</b> was the least variable. This demonstrates that the choice of phase marker should vary between recording methods. Phase variation decreased with increasing activity and was larger in females than in males. By calculating the average cycle variation and serial covariance of consecutive cycles, we estimated the contribution of ‘clock’ and ‘nonclock’ related processes to the overt rhythm variability. Variance in precision between phase markers could be shown to be attributable mainly to nonclock processes. Variance in pacemaker cycle length appeared reduced in wheel running activity records compared with passive infrared sensing records, suggesting feedback from running activity onto pacemaker function. ...|$|E
40|$|Running mean filters {{have long}} been used as time domain, digital, {{low-pass}} filters. They are a convolution in the time domain with a boxcar function (or, more generally, with functions designed for better frequency characteristics). <b>Running</b> <b>means</b> are linear and easily described by their transfer functions in the frequency domain. They handle some kinds of high-frequency contamination well. However, faced with the spikey noise sometimes affecting electronic systems and phenomena subject to interference by lightening, cosmic rays, and timing tick marks <b>running</b> <b>means</b> usually perform poorly: spikes become low, wide, one-sided pulses affecting a broad region of the signal {{in the neighborhood of}} an originally short glitch. Since we can be generally confident of the signal except during the spike itself, a better triter would be one that does not affect the signal outside the spike, but replaces only the bad data with some interpolation of the good data. Stated another way, this filter would do what the human data editor does. Running medians nearly behave like this ideal filter; a simple extension of them is an ideal, general despiker.

40|$|The author {{investigates the}} bases of a short or medium range {{pressure}} forecast, based on autocorrelations (Vialar) and local correlations of pressure {{as well as on}} the use of running time means of atmospheric pressure (Grappe). In order to appreciate the degree of quality of a forecast, he introduces the concept of efficiency. This concept is based on the forecast of the sign of the pressure variation. The author points out that the method of autoregressive equations does not lead to an efficient forecast of pressure averages, whilst that of local regression equations, applied to the <b>running</b> <b>means</b> of daily pressure, gives an efficient forecast of pressure averages over a time interval of several days (2 to 5 days). The efficiency of this latter forecast, however, is illusive, this efficiency being a result of the algebraic properties of the <b>running</b> <b>means</b> only. The author notices that the failure of the forecast methods coincides with the lack of autoregressivity of time-series of daily pressure variation. Therefore, it is very unlikely that any method of short or medium range pressure forecast, based on local pressure data, can produce really efficient forecasts if the time series of the first variation of pressure is not autoregressive. © 1961 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|We {{have been}} {{continuing}} {{observation of the}} geomagnetic total force at five stations in Hokuriku, Kinki and Chugoku districts. Observed data are often contaminated by artificial noises which are caused by leakage current from electric railways. In order to plausibly detect secular anomalies related to tectonic activity from noisy data, we try to reduce noises using the <b>running</b> <b>mean</b> method and examine how many data interval is most suitable for the <b>running</b> <b>mean.</b> We conclude that a 40 -minute <b>running</b> <b>mean</b> interval is most desirable for reducing noises due to leakage current contamination, but leaving natural signals. From simple differences between Tottori (TOT) and Amagase (AMG), we find an offset of the data amounted up to 5 nT attributed to influence of electric trains. The existence of such an offset is a significant problem in investigation of anomalous secular variation. Based on recent data from 1992 to 1995, we show a regional trend of the secular variation around Hokuriku, Kinki and Chugoku districts. First we mention that the post anomaly possibly related to Off Noto earthquake in 1993 is almost settled.

A section Svinøy-NW was worked in December from 1951 to 1968 and in January from 1952 to 1973. In the Barents Sea three sections have been worked in August-October, one between Fugløya and Bjørnøya since 1964, one northward from Vardø along 31 ° 13 'E since 1953 and one northward from the Sem Islands along 37 ° 20 'E since 1956. Mean values of temperature and salinity have been established for parts of the sections in the depth intervals 0 - 50, 50 - 100 and 100 - 200 m. Three-year <b>running</b> <b>means</b> have been prepared to reduce the effect of year-to-year fluctuations. The three- year <b>running</b> <b>means</b> of the time series showed the same long-term trends in all three depth intervals. Similar features were found in all the sections.
