The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} <b>really</b> <b>cute</b> guy. Every time I thought I knew which one I was, I {{turned out to be the}} other. Which is one reason I think I got married, to, like, end the confusion." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{opined that}} [...] "Cutbacks" [...] was [...] "solid", as it [...] "included {{all the major}} players in familiar roles and provided some great laughs." [...] Canning complimented Roger Bart's performance noting that he played the part [...] "very straight until the very end." [...] In regards to the Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth plot, {{he said that the}} overall ending was [...] "a bit weak" [...] but [...] "the majority of the story worked well." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club noted that this episode was [...] "broad as hell, with three incredibly whoopsie plot threads all driven by one of the most venerable office sitcom tropes (budget cuts), but it was redeemed not only by being funny as hell at its best, but by letting the unlikability of some of the main characters– sometimes inadvertent, sometimes not, provide some of the strongest laughs in 'Cutbacks'." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons said that despite this episode not being [...] "one of the show's most sophisticated [...] " [...] she still enjoyed it, citing that it had [...] "some pretty fantastic lines– and some <b>really</b> <b>cute</b> moments between Liz and Jack." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Carey {{intended}} #1's {{to serve}} as a sign of gratitude to her fans, the album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums. The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' [...] "Sweetheart" [...] (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album Daydream, and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, [...] "I was thinking of the old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a <b>really</b> <b>cute</b> record. Young girls'll like it the way I liked it when I was growing up." [...] Another new song featured on #1's was [...] "When You Believe", which Carey said was included because she felt it was [...] "a miracle" [...] that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song [...] "When You Believe" [...] for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt. Carey and Houston were shown the film separately, and both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project.

The singer dances on top of the cars and performs some choreographed moves with her dancers against a chain-link fence.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Stack of the Chronicle Staff {{claimed that}} [...] "Gordys strongest suit is the piglet's {{determination}} to reunite with his family, and {{that part of}} the convoluted plot develops into a folksy comic effort as Jinnie Sue, her dad, Hanky and Gordy race to save the family of pigs from becoming sausages. One would think the pork industry would be livid about this film as it portrays pig slaughter as an outrageous evil. The highlight comes when Gordy jumps into a backyard swimming pool—piglets <b>really</b> are <b>cutest</b> when they put their little trotters together and dive—and saves Hanky from drowning. Generally speaking, time would be better spent with [...] "Charlotte's Web" [...] than this forgettable hogwash." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{first draft}} of Back to the Future was {{finished}} in February 1981 and presented to Columbia, who put the film in turnaround. [...] "They {{thought it was a}} <b>really</b> nice, <b>cute,</b> warm film, but not sexual enough," [...] Gale said. [...] "They suggested that we take it to Disney, but we decided to see if any other of the major studios wanted a piece of us." [...] Every major film studio rejected the script for the next four years, while Back to the Future went through two more drafts. During the early 1980s, popular teen comedies (such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Porky's) were risqué and adult-aimed, so the script was commonly rejected for being too light. Gale and Zemeckis finally decided to pitch Back to the Future to Disney. [...] "They told us that a mother falling in love with her son was not appropriate for a family film under the Disney banner," [...] Gale said.|$|R
500|$|The third single {{from the}} album, [...] "One Thing", is an upbeat pop rock song. The song has a [...] "plucky" [...] guitar riff and a [...] "forceful" [...] chorus with Lewis Corner of Digital Spy dubbing it [...] "arena-ready". The song's melody {{has been noted}} for {{similarities}} between Backstreet Boys song [...] "I Want It That Way". The fourth song on the album and fourth single, [...] "More than This", is a pop ballad. [...] "More than This" [...] contains sounds of synthesizers. The fifth song on the album, title track [...] "Up All Night", is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song. Lyrically, the song is a party-anthem, with the Katy Perry name-check in the chorus being noted by various publications. The sixth cut, [...] "I Wish", is a mid-tempo pop ballad. The song's lyrical tone {{has been compared to}} Robyn's [...] "Dancing On My Own". The seventh song, [...] "Tell Me a Lie", is an uptempo pop rock song which features prominent guitar instrumentation and pulsating beats. The song was originally intended for Kelly Clarkson's album Stronger (2011). [...] Clarkson spoke to Capital FM on how she was proud of the end result. [...] "It's a <b>really</b> <b>cute</b> song, I love it. I loved that they liked it. They sound really great on it. I already have it – I'm so VIP with my copy on my computer!

Von Teese's unique style is [...] "inspired by eccentric women like Luisa Casati, Anna Piaggi, and Isabella Blow." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Need You" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as an [...] "R&B-tinged pop rocker" [...] comparable to the work of Justin Timberlake. McCoy noted the contrast between the songs subject matter and musical style, as the song touches upon failed relationships in an uptempo manner and [...] "explodes" [...] as it reaches the chorus. [...] In the same vein of [...] "Need You", McCoy described [...] "Critical", featuring Tim William, as [...] "really personal, introspective subject matter put into an upbeat pop song. Its kind of like a rock song, but at the same time, it has this <b>really</b> shimmery, <b>cute</b> vibe to it." [...] "Akidagain" [...] features a childrens choir and samples Ahmads [...] "Back in the Day". [...] "Well Be Alright", which McCoy refers to as a [...] "party anthem", samples [...] "Alright" [...] by Supergrass. [...] He described the albums closer [...] "Dont Pretend" [...] as [...] "probably the most personal" [...] song on the album; during recording of the song, he suffered from allergies and had difficulty breathing, which [...] "added to the emotional vibe of the song".|$|R
500|$|Critics {{expressed}} mixed {{opinions of}} the game's audio. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said that the [...] "whimsical" [...] background music is [...] "quite enjoyable" [...] and the character sound bites are [...] "varied enough to avoid becoming annoying." [...] Doug Perry of IGN had a more mixed take, saying that the [...] "classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat" [...] is [...] "not necessarily great", and that after a few courses, [...] "you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it {{makes you want to}} cry or pull your hair out". On the subject of the voice acting, he concluded that there is [...] "nothing <b>really</b> that <b>cute,</b> clever or memorable" [...] in the game, and noted that Crash's voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the Mario Kart series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects [...] "push the game's cartoon theme," [...] the themes were not too [...] "over the top" [...] or incessant. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution passed the music off as [...] "standard kitschy fare" [...] and added that while the sound effects [...] "add to the cartoon quality of the game", some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters [...] "are all quite vocal", and the music [...] "sets off the whimsical mood nicely".|$|R
5000|$|According to Josh Klinghoffer, [...] "Sick Love" [...] "was a {{song that}} {{we were working on}} for awhile before we started {{recording}} it, and it just sounded like Elton John was involved somehow, someway. So we thought we should just invite him down and see if he likes it and wants to play on it.” Chad Smith said of the recording [...] "He was kind of nervous. It was actually <b>really</b> kind of <b>cute.</b> When he came in, he looked for somewhere to sit really quick, and he sat down. Anthony Kiedis added “As soon as he touched the piano it was magical. You try not to be a fan boy, but it is Sir Elton John… He talked about everything and was really cool… It’s a real honour for us to have him on the record.” The chord structure and melody of the song were inspired by John's classic [...] "Bennie and the Jets".|$|R
2500|$|The final vocal {{track was}} {{recorded}} between March and April 1966 at CBS Columbia Square, Hollywood, with the session engineered by Ralph Balantin and produced by Brian. The song features three {{voices on the}} track. Carl is featured on lead vocals, with Brian and Johnston backing him. Johnston explained that, [...] "The <b>really</b> <b>cute</b> thing {{is that at the}} end of the session, Carl was really tired, and he went home. So Brian ... remember, this was 8-track, so, he now has these extra tracks at his disposal. But there were just the two of us. So in the fade, he's singing two of the three parts. He sang the top and the bottom part and I sang in the middle." [...] Brian used the production technique of double-tracking Carl's voice, so that his voice is simultaneously singing the same part twice, to give the vocal a fuller and richer sound; Brian used this technique often during the recording of Pet Sounds. The song's sessions concluded on April 11.|$|E
2500|$|Patrick W. Galbraith, {{the author}} of The Moe Manifesto, was interviewed in the Otaku USA magazine. Galbraith was asked whether Imouto Paradise! 2 falls into the 'moe' category, to which he replied, [...] "Well, it’s an adult manga based on an erotic visual novel, so I’d say that it’s wank material. It’s not exactly {{mainstream}} manga, you know? Where it might overlap with the moe phenomenon, though, {{is that you have}} <b>really</b> <b>cute</b> characters and people who are into those characters." [...] Furthermore, he commented on the restriction of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga, saying that, [...] "I don’t think that it’s surprising that they took on Imouto Paradise, because it’s got a decent fan following, has an emphasis on incest, which is one act specifically mentioned in the ordinance, and the characters are marked by a kind of cuteness that’s worrisome for a lot of people, because cuteness often bleeds into youthfulness." [...] Like Kanemitsu, Galbraith showed distaste towards the government's decision to restrict the manga, saying that he [...] "is not a fan" [...] of this ordinance.|$|E

So when I'm watching this, it's kind of like watching grandma's dog. It's kind of like a sign to me." [...] The film aired on November 28, 2010 and received good ratings, with 2.611million viewers. In December 2010, Hilton launched her motorcycle team; her Spanish driver, Maverick Vinales, won the final race and finished third overall in the 125cc world championship the following November. She modeled for a second time at the 2011 Brazil Fashion Week (her first time was in early 2010). In February Hilton introduced a fragrance line, the Passport Collection, with perfumes inspired by cities such as Paris, South Beach, Florida and Tokyo.
