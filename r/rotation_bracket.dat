40|$|Solar array {{rotation}} mechanism provides a hinged joint between the solar panel and satellite body, smooth {{rotation of the}} solar array into deployed position and its fixation in this position. After unlocking of solar panel (while in orbit), <b>rotation</b> <b>bracket</b> turns towards ready-to-work position under the action of driving spring. During deployment, once reached the required operating angle (defined by power subsystem engineer), the <b>rotation</b> <b>bracket</b> collides with the fixed bracket that is mounted on body of the satellite, to stop rotation. Due {{to the effect of}} collision force that may alter the {{rotation mechanism}} function, design of centrifugal brake is essential. At stoppage moment micro-switches activate final position sensor and a stopper locks the <b>rotation</b> <b>bracket.</b> Design of spring and centrifugal brake components, static finite element stress analysis of primary structure body of rotation mechanism at stoppage moment have been obtained. Last, reliability analysis of rotation mechanism is evaluated. The benefit {{of this study is to}} aid in the design of rotation mechanism that can be used in micro-satellite applications.

2500|$|Modern {{measurements}} {{show that}} the central Oregon is still rotating, with the calculated <b>rotation</b> poles <b>bracketing</b> the Wallula Gap., which is approximately {{the intersection of the}} OWL and KBML. It is intriguing to consider whether the KBML has participated in this rotation, but this is unclear; that it is unbent where it crosses the OWL suggests it is not. [...] The OWL seems to be the northern edge of the rotating block, and the paucity of paleomagnetic data to the southeast of the KBML suggests it might be the southern edge. [...] But the details of all this remain murky.|$|R
30|$|Through the {{developed}} and programmable user interface, operators {{are able to}} easily and accurately control many test variables such as velocity, acceleration, and <b>bracket</b> <b>rotation</b> (in this case second-order rotation). This allows {{for a variety of}} experimental procedures to be set up quickly and performed repeatedly with minimal training. Given the amount of variables that may be manipulated with this apparatus, it was imperative that the controls remained as simple and straight forward as possible.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an acquisition and viewing method for high-resolution, high-dynamic range spherical image mosaics. These mosaics consist {{of hundreds of}} high resolution, high-dynamic-range color images, each annotated with 3 -DOF orientation about a common optical center. An automated acquisition platform captures a pre-specified hemispherical tiling of images. Each image is acquired with specified approximate camera <b>rotation</b> and <b>bracketed</b> exposures for high-dynamic range. Relative rotations among images, as well as internal camera parameters, are automatically refined using a correlation-based global optimization. The improved rotation and internal parameter estimates are used in an interactive viewer for smooth inspection of the resulting large spherical mosaic. The renderer uses a modified form of adaptive, incremental, parallel raycasting to sample the original images at pixel centers, preserving detail from the raw imagery while maintaining interactive display rates. We show an example dataset that resolves millimeter-scale detail at a viewing distance of ten meters. ...|$|R
30|$|It {{was found}} that two {{mechanisms}} produced lingual tipping of the anterior teeth when decreasing the archwire size. One mechanism was <b>rotation</b> of the <b>bracket</b> within a play between the archwire and the bracket slot. It will be easily understood without the present simulation. The other mechanism was elastic deflection of the archwire. In addition to that, the lingual tipping led to extrusion of the anterior teeth. These archwire’s deflection and incisor’s extrusion may not be imagined without the present simulation. This is a reason for necessitating such finite element simulations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of social, economic, health is increasingly being emphasized by people {{and has become a}} topic that can not be ignored. However, having a healthy body also need been the right health care. So, efficient and safe products are more popular with consumers. In paper, a self-service-based and purely mechanical traction treatment bed has been designed. The various parts of the self-traction treatment bed is introduced in detail. The structural designs of its unique folding feature, adjustable bed, a fixed <b>bracket,</b> <b>rotation</b> driving handle, the bottom track sliding, etc., make up for the design of the traditional traction therapy instrument. This traction treatment bed breaks the traditional design style and does reflect the modernist design style in the man-machine combination...|$|R
30|$|Ten {{specimens}} of 0.018 [*]×[*] 0.018  in., 0.018 [*]×[*] 0.022  in., and 0.018 [*]×[*] 0.025  in. stainless steel archwires (ORMCO, Glendora, California, USA) were evaluated in the 0.018 -in. brackets. In the 0.022 -in. series, the measured archwires were ten 0.019 [*]×[*] 0.019  in., ten 0.019 [*]×[*] 0.025  in., and ten 0.019 [*]×[*] 0.026  in. stainless steel specimens (ORMCO, Glendora, California, USA). For {{the construction of}} all archwires, a photocopy of the model {{was used as a}} template. The archwires were ligated with 0.120 -in. (Molded “O”; ORMCO, Orange, California, USA) elastomeric ligatures into the brackets. A 15 ° buccal root torque was gradually applied to the right central incisor bracket, in steps of 0.5 ° along the central axis of the slot. After each activation, the bracket was set to its initial position and the moments in the sagittal plane were recorded during the <b>rotation</b> of the <b>bracket.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To measure space closure {{during the}} {{retraction}} of upper permanent canines with selfligating and conventional brackets. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients who required maxillary canine retraction into first premolar extraction sites {{as part of}} their orthodontic treatment completed this study. In a random split-mouth design, the retraction of upper canines was performed using an elastomeric chain with 150 g of force. The evaluations were performed in dental casts (T 0, initial; T 1, 4 weeks; T 2, 8 weeks; T 3, 12 weeks). The amount of movement and the rotation of the canines as well as anchorage loss of the upper first molars were evaluated. Results: There was no difference between self-ligating and conventional brackets regarding the distal movement of upper canines and mesial movement of first molars (P. 05). Rotation of the upper canines was minimized with self-ligating brackets (P,. 05). Conclusion: Distal movement of the upper canines and anchorage loss of the first molars were similar with both conventional and self-ligating <b>brackets.</b> <b>Rotation</b> of the upper canines during sliding mechanics was minimized with self-ligating brackets...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{compares the}} {{efficiency}} of self-ligating brackets with the conventional preadjusted edgewise (PEA) brackets during maxillary canine retraction using nickel-titanium closed coil springs. Materials and Methods: The sample comprised of 20 healthy patients (10 males and 10 females), within age groups 16 - 26 years (mean, 20 years) having Class I malocclusion with bimaxillary protrusion. All patients underwent bilateral extraction of the maxillary first bicuspids and retraction of the maxillary canines with fixed self-ligating brackets (3 M Smart clip) and PEA appliance (3 M Gemini). The initial records included standard intra- and extra-oral photographs, study models, lateral cephalograms, and panoramic radiographs. Results: The mean distal movement of canines in self-ligating brackets was 0. 89 mm/mo with standard deviation of 0. 255 and in preadjusted edgewise brackets, the mean distal movement of canines was 0. 87 mm/mo with standard deviation of 0. 214. The mean tipping of canine in self-ligating brackets was 7. 45 ± 1. 050 (0) and in PEA brackets it was 7. 70 ° ± 1. 21 °. The mean rotation of canine in self-ligating brackets was 7. 65 ° ± 3. 47 ° and in preadjusted edgewise appliance it was 12. 30 ° ± 3. 08 °. Conclusion: The rates of distal movement of the maxillary canines were similar with both conventional and self-ligating <b>brackets.</b> <b>Rotation</b> of the maxillary canines during retraction was minimized with self-ligating brackets in comparison to conventional bracket systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of bracket type on the labiopalatal moments {{generated}} by lingual and conventional brackets. Incognito lingual brackets (3 M Unitek), STb lingual brackets (Light Lingual System; ORMCO), In-Ovation L lingual brackets (DENTSPLY GAC), and conventional 0. 018 inch slot brackets (Gemini; 3 M Unitek) were bonded on identical maxillary acrylic resin models with levelled and aligned teeth. Each model was mounted on the orthodontic measurement and simulation system and 10 0. 0175 x 0. 0175 TMA wires were used for each bracket type. The wire was ligated with elastomerics into the Incognito, STb, and conventional brackets and each measurement was repeated once after religation. A 15 degrees buccal root torque (+ 15 degrees) and then a 15 degrees palatal root torque (- 15 degrees) were gradually applied to the right central incisor bracket. After each activation, the bracket returned to its initial position and the moments in the sagittal plane were recorded during these <b>rotations</b> of the <b>bracket.</b> One-way analysis of variance with post hoc multiple comparisons (Tukey test at 0. 05 error rate) was conducted to assess the effect on bracket type on the generated moments. The magnitude of maximum moment at + 15 degrees ranged 8. 8, 8. 2, 7. 1, and 5. 8 Nmm for the Incognito, STb, conventional Gemini, and the In-Ovation L brackets, respectively; similar values were recorded at - 15 degrees: 8. 6, 8. 1, 7. 0, and 5. 7 Nmm, respectively. The recorded differences of maximum moments were statistically significant, except between the Incognito and STb brackets. Additionally, the torque angles were evaluated at which the crown torque fell well below the minimum levels of 5. 0 Nmm, as well as the moment/torque ratio at the last part of the activation/deactivation curve, between 10 and 15 degrees. The lowest torque expression was observed at the self-ligating lingual brackets, followed by the conventional brackets. The Incognito and STb lingual brackets generated the highest moments...|$|R
