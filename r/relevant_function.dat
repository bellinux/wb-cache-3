40|$|Different {{studies show}} that programmers are more {{interested}} in finding definitions of functions and their uses than variables, statements, or arbitrary code fragments [30, 29, 31]. Therefore, programmers require support in finding <b>relevant</b> <b>functions</b> and determining how those functions are used. Unfortunately, existing code search engines do not provide enough of this support to developers, thus reducing the effectiveness of code reuse. We provide this support to programmers in a code search system called Portfolio that retrieves and visualizes <b>relevant</b> <b>functions</b> and their usages. We have built Portfolio using a combination of models that address surfing behavior of programmer and sharing related concepts among functions. We conducted an experiment with 49 professional programmers to compare Portfolio to Google Code Search and Koders using a standard methodology. The results show with strong statistical significance that users find more <b>relevant</b> <b>functions</b> with higher precision with Portfolio than wit...|$|R
50|$|Roll-off is the {{steepness}} of {{a transmission}} function with frequency, particularly in electrical network analysis, and most especially {{in connection with}} filter circuits in the transition between a passband and a stopband. It is most typically applied to the insertion loss of the network, but can, in principle, be applied to any <b>relevant</b> <b>function</b> of frequency, and any technology, not just electronics. It is usual to measure roll-off {{as a function of}} logarithmic frequency, consequently, the units of roll-off are either decibels per decade (dB/decade), where a decade is a 10-times increase in frequency, or decibels per octave (dB/8ve), where an octave is 2-times increase in frequency.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When programmers write new code, {{they are}} often {{interested}} in finding definitions of functions, existing, working fragments with the same or similar functionality, and reusing as much of that code as possible. Short fragments that are often returned by search engines as results to user queries do not give enough information to help programmers determine how to reuse them. Understanding code and determining how to use it, is a manual and time-consuming process. In general, programmers want to find initial points such as <b>relevant</b> <b>functions.</b> They want to easily understand how the functions are used and see the sequence of function invocations {{in order to understand}} how concepts are implemented. Our main goal is to enable programmers to find <b>relevant</b> <b>functions</b> to query terms and their usages. In our approach, identifying popular fragments is inspired by PageRank algorithm, where the “popularity ” of a function is determined by how many functions call it. We designed a model based on the vector space model by which we are able to establish relevance among facts which content contains terms that match programmer’s queries. The result is an ordered list of <b>relevant</b> <b>functions</b> that reflects the associations between concepts in the functions and a programmer’s query...|$|R
50|$|Hepatocytes are {{the main}} cells of the liver. They are large {{polyhedral}} cells, with six surfaces, three of which have a <b>relevant</b> <b>function.</b> The threes relevant type of surfaces are sinusoidal, canalicular and intercellular. These surfaces {{are involved in the}} exchange of substances between the hepatocyte, the vessels and the biliar canaliculi. The sinusoidal surfaces are separated from the sinusoids because of the perisinusoidal space. They represent 70% of the total hepatocyte surface. They are coated by microvilli which emerge to the perisinusoidal space. These surfaces are the place where the exchange of substances between the hepatocytes and the sinusoids occurs. The canalicular surfaces are the ones through which bile drains from the hepatocytes to the canaliculi. They represent 15% of the surface of the cell. The cytoplasm of the hepatocyte near canaliculi is rich in actin filaments, and they are probably capable of modifying the canaliculi’s diameter, thus influencing the flow; however this is not yet proven. The intercellular surfaces {{are the ones that are}} between two adjacent hepatocytes and they are not in contact with sinusoids or canaliculi. These are simple surfaces specialized in the cellular adherence and in the communication between hepatocytes through gap junctions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} {{sequencing}} has permitted scientists to elucidate a huge landscape of new miRNAs, {{to increase our}} knowledge of the biogenesis involved and to discover putative post-transcriptional editing processes in miRNAs ignored until now. These processes mostly generate variations of the current miRNAs that are annotated in miRBase in the 3' and 5' terminus and in minor frequencies, nucleotide substitution along the miRNA length,. The variations are mainly generated by a shift of Drosha and Dicer in the cleavage site, but also by nucleotide additions at the 3'-end, resulting new sequences different from the annotated miRNA. These were named [...] "isomiRs" [...] by Morin et al., 2008. IsomiRs have been well established along different species in metazoa [...] and deeply described {{for the first time in}} human stem cells and human brain samples. Moreover, it has been proven that isomiRs are not caused by RNA degradation during sample preparation for next generation sequencing. Some studies have tried to explain the miRNA diversity by structural bases of precursors but without clear results. The functionality of adenylation or uridynilation at the 3'end (3'addition isomiRs) has been related to alterations in the miRNA-3'-UTR stability. Furthermore, isomiRs have been detected deregulated in D. melanogaster development and differential expressed during Hippoglossus hippoglossus L. early development, suggesting a biologically <b>relevant</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
