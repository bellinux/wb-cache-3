5|$|In 1863, when Winchester was {{no longer}} a safe {{location}} for the storage of Hampshire County's <b>records</b> <b>and</b> they again risked destruction by Union Army forces, White's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the <b>records</b> <b>and</b> transferred them to Front Royal.

In the fall of 1864, the county's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops {{were in the process of}} destroying them. Captain White's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon, and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war. Hampshire County's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War, likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina. Had White not separated the <b>records</b> <b>and</b> sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping, Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war, as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed.|$|E
