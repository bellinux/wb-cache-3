We answer their question for one-dimensional families of smooth curves degenerating to stable curves with just two components meeting at points in general position. In this note we treat only those families whose total space is regular. Nevertheless, we announce here our most general answer, to be presented in detail in [5]. 1.

Convergence of truncation errors severely degrades on general irregular grids; a design-order convergence can be achieved only on grids with {{a certain degree of}} geometric regularity. Such degradation of truncation-error convergence does not necessarily imply a lower-order convergence of discretization errors.

40|$|Accurate global {{positioning}} system (GPS) vector determination {{is now one of}} the major applications in modem geodesy. Most of the errors are modeled either to <b>smooth</b> <b>atmospheric</b> effects or to remove biases, such as clock offsets. The network design criteria and the vector processing solutions are based in distances to the reference stations and in the time span of the vectors involved in the sessions. Thus, the final solutions are computed accurately and the residuals show the quality of the computations. What is not usually taken into account in the final vector computation is the bearing of the vector to be processed, as the cutoff angle is considered fixed. This note deals with the variation on the final solution due to different cutoff angles, and still more importantly to the bearing of the vector in high-precision GPS vector determination.

The oscillations were probably generated by a nearby thunderstorm outflow, propagating into a stably stratified atmospheric layer. It is likely that the phenomenon was initiated by the degeneration of an outflow gravity current into a family of amplitude-ordered solitary waves. Although reasonable agreement can be obtained on the propagation speed using a linear theory, the weakness of the trapping mechanism for this solution and an over-estimation of the weakly nonlinear wave half-width leads to a conclusion that the waves were fully nonlinear. 1 Introduction There are two aims of a currently ongoing study of low-level wind shear at Sydney Airport, using data recorded on a continuous basis since mid 1991.
