30|$|These results {{indicate}} that high-grade metamorphic rocks are preserved if geofluids have not infiltrated into the system (e.g., Whitney and Davis, 2006; Vitale Brovarone et al. 2011). Retrogression of high-grade metamorphic rocks is localized to just around the system where geofluids can be sufficiently supplied. In contrast, {{a large amount of}} pervasive geofluid infiltration during retrograde stages eliminates the evidence of higher-grade peak stages. Recently published precise reconstructions of P–T paths and detailed analyses of metamorphic textures show that some regional metamorphic rocks, including the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt, have undergone pervasive <b>retrogressive</b> hydration <b>metamorphism</b> during exhumation (e.g., Ota et al. 2004; Okamoto and Toriumi 2005; Maruyama et al. 2010). Our calculations theoretically support these observations and suggest that the existence and behavior of geofluids significantly affect the progress of <b>retrogressive</b> hydration <b>metamorphism.</b> Conversely, the progress of hydration reactions is a possible indicator of the existence and behavior of geofluids, as shown by the proposed forward model.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The palaeomagnetic imprint in the Lewisian {{metamorphic}} basement {{was acquired}} during early post-Laxfordian times and resides in magnetite-filled microfractures. An early magnetizing event dated c. 1820 - 1750 Ma was largely overprinted {{by a second}} event between 1700 and 1500 Ma which was probably linked to <b>retrogressive</b> amphibolite facies <b>metamorphism.</b> It reaches its greatest intensity {{in the south of}} the outcrop while the relict remanence survives most prominently in Scourian terranes. Popu-lations of magnetic components are offset by c. 95 km of (presumed Caledonian) sinistral strike slip in the Minches. Intensities and susceptibilities of magnetization are enhanced in zones of Laxfordian re-working relative to the relict Scourian zones. Their distributions in the Outer Hebrides are reproduced in the Mainland outcrop and can be matched following correction for the same sinistral strike slip. A third line of evidence suggesting this motion is the offset of the deep crustal contribution to the aeromagnetic anomalies. The fault zone accommodating this motion may now be represented by {{one or more of the}} low angle detachments bordering the western margin of the Minches Basin. Post-Laxfordian remanences in the Outer Hebrides are rotated by an average of 4 " with respect to equivalent vectors on the Mainland and may record later block rotations.

The calculations - from geothermometer indicate that the metamorphic temperature of kyanite zone (470 °C- 500 °C) is obviously lower than that of garnet zone and staurolite zone. It means that kyanite zone was formed before garnet zone and staurolite zone. This is evidently inconsistent with the traditional theory of metamorphic belts. Chemical equilibrium calculations of fluid composition and thermodynamical analysis of metamorphic reactions show that the lower metamorphic temperature of kyanite zone is resulted not from the effect of metamorphic pressure and <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism</b> but from the buffering of temperature of dehydration metamorphic reaction forming kyanite by fluids with lower XH 2 o.

40|$|<b>Retrogressive</b> {{deformation}} and <b>metamorphism</b> {{are often}} reported {{from the main}} low-angle shear zones and detachments of metamorphic core complexes, but their importance is not sufficiently emphasized for the footwall interior. In order {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of exhumation-related retrogression processes within and at the top of metamorphic core complexes, an integrated detailed microstructural, textural, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronological, and thermobarometric study on the Naxos metamorphic core complex within the Aegean Sea is presented that provides a new perspective on low-grade retrogression during exhumation through shallow ductile levels. We found variable retrogressive deformation within the Naxos metamorphic core complex, which even pervasively affected significant portions of the migmatite-grade metamorphic core and remnant high-pressure areas of the metamorphic core complex, where retrogression led to pervasive formation of new fabrics within greenschist-facies metamorphic conditions during brittle-ductile transition. Within a continuum of retrogression, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar white mica dating allowed us to deduce three retrogressive ages at 16. 52 ± 0. 39 Ma (within the Naxos metamorphic core complex), 12. 6 ± 0. 28 Ma (Moutsounas detachment shear zone on the eastern boundary of the metamorphic core complex), and 10. 43 ± 0. 44 Ma to 8. 40 ± 0. 76 Ma (last ductile activity along the Naxos-Paros shear zone to the north of the metamorphic core complex). A further stage of retrogression at 12 − 11 Ma occurred along distinct low-angle normal faults within the middle Miocene Naxos Granite. Retrogressive microstructures, low-temperature calcite fabrics in marbles, and chloritization in metapelites (at temperatures of ∼ 350 − 130 °C) in the metamorphic core complex core resulted mainly from late-stage E-W shortening and folding. Late-stage flow of hydrous fluids resulted in resetting of fabrics and enhancement of ductile deformation. The middle−late Miocene retrogression events are also reflected by a similarly aged tectonic collapse basin in the hanging-wall unit above the detachment. The wide temporal range of retrogression within the Naxos metamorphic core complex coincides in age with retrogressive deformation within other metamorphic core complexes of the Aegean Sea. We interpret the long temporal range of retrogression to reflect outward, southwestward retreat of the subduction and sequential activation of major detachment zones...|$|R
40|$|The Asimotrypes mesothermal {{gold deposit}} {{located in the}} Pangeon Mt (E. Macedo¬ nia, N. Greece), {{is part of the}} Western Rhodope Massif (WRM), which {{represents}} the metamorphic core complex of an alpine collision orogen. Alpine metamorphism, of U. Cretaceous - M. Eocene age, reached upper greenschist to lower amphibolite con¬ ditions. A low-pressure greenshist fades retrograde overprint during uplift marked the end of Alpine metamorphism in the Miocene. Post-metamorphic Miocene uplift has been recognised in the Pangeon Mt and it was ascribed to Late Cainozoic extensional tectonics. The Asimotrypes ore, of replacement and shear-zone style consists mainly of arsenopyrite, pyrite and gold, with subordinate sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, tetrahedrite-tennantite, marcasite, covellite and malachite. Gold is either re¬ fractory occurring mainly in arsenopyrite {{and to a lesser extent}} in As-pyrite, or free in the oxide minerals. Three types of fluid inclusions (with subtypes) were recognised based on constitu¬ ent phases at room temperature and microthermometric behaviour: (i) H 2 O-CO 2 3 - phase inclusions: Li (Ü 2 O) +L 2 (CO 2) +V (CO 2); (ii) Aqueous 2 -phase inclusions: L+V; and (iii) Naturally decrepitated and/or leaked inclusions: V or L+V. The fluids have low salinity (< 5 wt % NaCl equiv.), but variable CO 2 /H 2 O ratios. Microther¬ mometric studies in gangue quartz indicate early ore deposition at P-T conditions of 275 - 310 C and 2. 7 - 3. 1 kb during unmixing of the mineralising fluids, followed by deposition at temperatures down to 130 C and low near surface pressures. 834 S values of primary sulphide minerals suggest a magmatic source for the sul¬ phur. 513 C values in marble calcite are indicative of a marine environment of deposi¬ tion, also supported by a plot of 813 C versus 518 O for the same samples. Calculated isotopic composition of ore fluids in quartz, sericite and whole rock at 275 C and 340 C are consistent with values of metamorphic fluids. Whole rock hydrogen iso¬ topic composition of - 1177. 5 (la) indicates that the mineralising fluid was of mete¬ oric origin. Sr isotope data implies seawater origin for strontium. Lead isotope data in ores from the Rhodope showed that Pb is derived from crustal rock types. Sulphide species such as Au (HS) " 2, were probably the most effective complexing agents for gold in the Asimotrypes fluids, which were typically low in salinity. A de¬ crease of sulphur species activity and cooling are suggested to be the favoured depositional mechanism in a reducing environment. Combined with geological evi¬ dence, the fluid inclusion and stable data of the Asimotrypes gold ore, are consistent with genesis from deeply convecting meteoric waters driven by regional uplift through rocks undergoing <b>retrogressive</b> greenschist facies <b>metamorphism...</b>|$|R

30|$|During the {{prograde}} stage, dehydration reactions may proceed spontaneously, {{because both}} {{the increase in}} temperature {{and the presence of}} H_ 2 O-saturated conditions kinetically promote the progress of the reactions. Thus, equilibrium is easily attained relative to rehydration reactions, although {{it should be noted that}} there are some exceptions and that even prograde dehydration reactions can be induced by external fluids (e.g., Gao and Klemd 2001). In contrast, during the retrograde stage, both the decrease in temperature and the presence of H_ 2 O-undersaturated conditions kinetically hinder the progress of rehydration reactions, and thus, equilibrium is difficult to achieve (Stüwe 1997). When a rock is fluid-free, rehydration reactions never occur, unless free water is supplied externally or retrograde breakdown of hydrous minerals occurs, as hydrous minerals such as lawsonite and talc contain large amounts of water (Palin et al. 2014). This is because rehydration reactions generally require water to produce low-temperature hydrous minerals (e.g., Yardley et al. 2014). Therefore, <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism</b> is generally considered to be fluid-induced (e.g., Andersen et al. 1991; Putnis and Austrheim 2010), such that the driving forces of rehydration can be assumed to be water infiltration in addition to changes in temperature and pressure.|$|E
40|$|The retrograded eclogites of the Forquilha {{area have}} been {{characterized}} based on detailed geological mapping and systematic petrography. These rocks occur as boudins enclosed into ortho- and paragneisses and rarely in calc-silicate rocks along more than 16 km in a N-S trend, defining the Forquilha Eclogite Zone, in the NW {{portion of the}} Borborema Province. This zone is in tectonic contact with rocks of the Ceará Group that dominantly comprises metapelites and subordinately metacarbonatic and metamafic rocks metamorphosed under high-pressure granulite and upper amphibolite facies conditions. The retrograded eclogites show three important stages of retrometamorphism that can be described by the following reactions: 1) [Grt + Cpx + Qtz + H 2 O → Pl + Amp] and [Grt + Cpx + Rt + Qtz + H 2 O → Amp + Ilm + Pl]; 2) [Omp → Di + Pl]; 3) [Grt + Di + Pl + H 2 O → Amp] and [Grt + Pl + Qtz + H 2 O → Grt 2 + Pl (An) + Amp], besides incipient late formation of Fe-chlorite and actinolite. The <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism</b> occurred heterogeneously on these metamafic bodies.

40|$|After the Connemara schists, of Dalradian age, {{had been}} folded (F 1) and metamorphosed to {{sillimanite}} grade, they were strongly hornfelsed by {{the intrusion of}} basic magma. From this magma crystallized peridotites, norites, pyroxenites and gabbros, all with An 80 – 87 plagioclase. Movements then caused the magma to break up these ultrabasic rocks and crystallization of basic rocks occurred. They are labradorite (An 55 – 65) -hornblende-relic clinopyroxene rocks that grade into quartz-hornblende-labradorite (An 55) -gneiss, quartz-hornblende-labradorite (An 55) - and andesine (An 40) -gneiss and quartz-andesine (An 40) -hornblende-biotite-gneiss. These gneisses formed during strong F 2 and F 3 movements, and probably during amphibolite-facies metamorphism, and they broke up, injected, metasomatized and amphibolized the earlier basic and ultrabasic rocks, giving a heterogeneous migmatite that commonly contains two plagioclases, An 40 and An 55. Quartzo-feldspath-ization of metasediment occurred, possibly up to {{a mile from the}} migmatites. This, and recrystallization, formed quartz-andesine (An 40) -biotite-gneiss that merges into the magmatically crystallized gneisses as do gneisses formed by silicification of basic and ultrabasic rocks.

This migmatite complex contains evidence of both magmatic and metamorphic crystallization of hornblende and the relative importance of each process remains to be determined.

The Pb 207 / Pb 206 model age obtained in galena and lillianite-gustavite series from the mineralization yields an age of 1. 88 Ga. It {{is higher than the}} estimated age of the deposit (» 534 Ma). The Pb isotopic composition obtained in these minerals indicates that the age of Schramm mine source {{is similar to that of}} the galena of the Ribeirão da Prata mine (Pb-Zn-Cu-Ag). This mine is located 25 Km southwest of the Schramm gold mine witch is hosted in the tension fracture zone conjugated with the first order shear zone that contains the Ribeirão da Prata deposit. The similarities between Pb-isotope compositions of both deposits could indicate that they were contemporaneous and derived from the same regional lead source. The REE patterns of the ore samples of Schramm mine are similar to that of the pyroxenites and banded iron formations from the Archean Santa Catarina Granulitic Complex that host the Schramm gold mine.

An eugeosynclinal rock sequence is found containing units with different metamorphic evolutions. All units were affected by Precambrian tectonization and <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism.</b> This orogeny may be subdivided into three metamorphic and four deformation phases which caused definite changes in the mineralogical composition and the texture of the rock. The sequence of metamorphic phases, established in a granulite facies unit is as follows: the first phase of Precambrian metamorphism is characterized by the (hornblende-) granulite facies, more precisely the (hornblende-) clinopyroxene-garnet-sodic plagioclase subfacies of the kyanite-bearing granulite facies. At that time, PH 2 O must have been very low locally. The second and third phases were marked by the hornblende-clinopyroxene-garnet-sodic plagioclase subfacies and the amphibolite facies, respectively. The other units bear witness to lower grade metamorphic activities. The granulite facies unit comprises metamorphosed basic lavas, metapelitic rocks, garnet-bearing metagabbros and garnet-bearing peridotites. The metapelitic rocks (kyanite-garnet-orthoclase-sodic plagioclase-biotite) and the metamorphosed basic lavas (clinopyroxenegarnet-sodic plagioclase-amphibole) are described in detail. The latter rocks contain Ca-rich inclusions, displaying scapolite-bearing mineral assemblages. The inclusions can be ascribed to deuteric alteration or incipient metamorphism in the basic lavas prior to the granulite facies metamorphism. The other units contain metasedimentary rocks and granitic and granodioritic orthogneisses. Metamorphic conditions during the Hercynian orogeny did not go further than the lower amphibolite facies. Therefore, retrogradation of the Precambrian units continued but a clear conversion of the rock texture cannot be discerned.

The eastern petrographic unit consists of mela- nocratic granulites, with metagabbroic structures, called the “Ketao-Sirka Granulites” (GKS). These two petrographic units are separated by the Panalo Mylonitic Zone (ZMP). This major west verging zone includes a syn-Dn + 2 dextral shear contact. The Kpaza Massif comprises nappes of melanocratic granulites (GKM), comparable to the GKS of the Kabye Massif. All these granulitic nappes include boudins of pyroxenites or meta-anorthosites, and ultramafic rocks represented by serpentinites, talcschists, actinolite- and chlorite-schists which generally mark thrust soles. The GLS nappes are thrust over the Kara-Niamtougou orthogneissic unit (UKN) which is considered as the easternmost structural unit of the Dahomeyide external zone. On the other hand, the GKS nappes underlie those of the Binah meta-volcano sedimentary Complex (CB) which belongs to the Dahomeyide internal zone.

A complete pressure-temperature-deformation-time (P-T-D-t) path has been deciphered involving an early clockwise P-T loop followed by high temperature, low-pressure metamorphism. Successive generations of monazite were identified using microstructure and FIA trends and then dated. The succession of four FIAs trending ENE–WSW (FIA 1), E–W (FIA 2), N–S (FIA 3), NE–SW (FIA 4) plus four matrix foliations, S 1 –S 4 were accompanied by three periods of garnet and two periods of staurolite growth. Monazite grew in response to most of these events. Isopleth thermobarometery, using P-T pseudosections in the MnNCKFMASH system for garnet porphyroblasts selected based on FIA trends in their core, reveal that pressure increased progressively from 3 – 4 kb at 530 – 550 °C to 6 – 7 kb at 600 – 620 °C during medium pressure-temperature metamorphism. This was accompanied by changing bulk shortening directions from NNW-SSE to N–S to E–W (perpendicular to FIAs 1, 2 and 3). The development of FIA 1 and FIA 2 occurred between 1655 ± 2. 2 Ma and 1625 ± 15 Ma.

D 2, the first stage exhumation of the Pelona Schist along the upper section of the subduction channel during return flow, was recorded by <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism,</b> isoclinal folding, and a pervasive schistosity that wraps around earlier porphyroblasts. Metagreywacke was deformed mainly by quartz pressure solution and metachert was deformed dominantly by dislocation creep during D 2. The shear stress in metagreywacke was less than 10  MPa and that in metachert was between 8. 3  +  2. 7 /−  1. 5 and 12. 9  + . 9 /−  2. 3  MPa, resulting in a strain rate of 1. 4  [*]×[*]  10 − 13 to 5. 5  [*]×[*]  10 − 13  s − 1. A topography driven model is proposed as the main driving force of D 2 exhumation. D 3 records normal-sense movement on the Vincent Fault, which separates the schist from overlying arc and continental basement. This resulted in the second stage of exhumation, creating a major synform and associated mylonitic fabric in the upper section of the Pelona Schist. Conditions at the beginning of D 3 were 390  ±  13  °C and 5. 8  ±  0. 8  kbar given by the TitaniQ thermometer and phengite geobarometer.

40|$|In this thesis, I present field, microstructural, and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) {{analyses}} of rock fabrics from high strain zones in exposures of lower crustal Cretaceous plutons at Breaksea Entrance, Fiordland, New Zealand. The interplay between deformation and metamorphism occurs across multiple scales {{at the root}} of a continental arc. I show a series of steps in which <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism</b> is linked to the accommodation of deformation. I define three main phases of deformation and metamorphism at Breaksea Entrance. The first phase (D 1) involved emplacement of dioritic to gabbroic plutons at depths up to 60 km. The second phase (D 2) is characterized by deformation and metamorphism at the granulite and eclogite facies that produced high strain zones with linear fabrics, isoclinal folding of igneous layering, and asymmetric pressure shadows around mafic aggregates. New structural analyses from Hāwea Island in Breaksea Entrance reveal the development of doubly plunging folds that define subdomes within larger, kilometer-scale gneiss domes. The development and intensification of S 2 foliations within the domes was facilitated by the recrystallization of plagioclase and clinopyroxene at the micro-scale (subgrain rotation and grain boundary migration recrystallization), consistent with metamorphism at the granulite and eclogite facies and climb-accommodated dislocation creep. EBSD data show a strong crystallographic preferred orientation in plagioclase during D 2 deformation. The third phase (D 3) is characterized by deformation and metamorphism at the upper amphibolite facies that produced sets of discrete, narrow shear zones that wrap and encase lozenges of older fabrics. Structural analyses reveal a truncation and/or transposition relationship between the older S 2 and the younger S 3 foliations developed during D 3. Progressive localization of deformation during cooling, hydration, and retrogression, resulted in the breakdown of garnet and pyroxene to form hornblende, biotite, fine plagioclase and quartz. EBSD data show a strong crystallographic preferred orientation in hornblende. During D 3, hornblende and biotite accommodated most of the strain through fluid-assisted diffusion creep. The last two events (D 2 and D 3) reflect a transition in deformation and metamorphism during exhumation, as well as a focusing of strain and evolving strain localization mechanisms {{at the root of}} a continental arc. An examination of structures at multiple scales of observation reveals that fabrics seen in the field are a composite of multiple generations of deformation and metamorphism...|$|E
40|$|Fannich Forest {{consists}} geologically of {{a complex}} of Moinian and Lewisian rocks. The area was mapped, and from the field-evidence a stratigraphy and structural interpretation were worked out. The structural interpretation was fitted into a regional interpretation of Moinian structure in Western and Central Ross. The petrology of the different rock-types was studied and {{used to assess the}} metamorphic grade of the area, while geochemical evidence strongly suggested that a Lewisian Inlier is present in Fannich. Mapping showed that the Lewisian inlier extends south of Loch Fannich on Beinn nan Ramh and on Moine Mor. The stratigraphic succession worked out is tabulated below: Sgurr Mor Pelite Psammites Meall an t-Sithe Pelite Moinian UNCONFORMITY Silicic Gneisses and Amphibolite Lewisian Complex early folding caused these units to form a repetitive succession deformed by the readily visible structures in the area. Three fold-events have occurred: F 1 folding initiated the formation of an isoclinal anticline with a Lewisian core, and a complementary isoclinal syncline, exposed at present with Sgurr Mor Pelite in its core. F 2 folds refold the Lewisian of Fannich in near-isoclinal folds, and a larger F 2 fold may refold the main F 1 anticline so that it now closes east. F 3 folds, with axial traces broadly trending north-south, are asymmetrical open folds, deforming the foliation developed in the rock during the previous fold-events. They deform an apparent succession in which the Lewisian core of the F 1 anticline forms the second-highest unit. The most important of these folds is the Fannich Synform. Since the Sgurr Mor Pelite occurs in the core of an F 1 syncline, open to the east, the Lewisian of Fannich is separated from the Lewisian of the Central Ross-shire Inliers. It is considered to form part of the upper limb of the refolded Moine (=Morar) Nappe, and to underlie the postulated Central Ross-shire Nappe. It is admitted that sliding may have occurred in Fannich, but the available evidence in Fannich does not require such a slide in order to explain the regional structure. Petrological studies reveal differences in mineralogy and texture between Lewisian and Moinian amphibolites; differences also occur between different amphibolite groups within the Moinian, which are considered to originate from different magmas. In calo-silicate strips from the Sgurr Mor Pelite, a reaction in which biotite forms from hornblende was observed, often accompanied by a reaction forming zoisite at the expense of plagioclase. It was found to be directly influenced by the CaO/Al 2 O 3 ratio of the rock. The different ratios at which this reaction proceeded in different places are considered to indicate differences of metamorphic grade. The reaction is retrogressive; the apparent increase of grade with increasing altitude is more probably a result of lessening influence of second, <b>retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism</b> with increasing height, thus allowing the original (higher-grade) mineralogy to be preserved more fully. Breakdown of kyanite in politic schist, and the accretion of calcic rims around almandines, were also interpreted as signs of retrogression. Electron probe microanalysis of almandines from pelite suggested that much of western Fannich may have been subjected to sillimanite-grade metamorphic conditions, and that the subsequent milder metamorphic episode induced retrogression. By analogy with Morar, places where the hornblende-biotite reaction in calc-silicates occurs at a CaO/Al 2 O 3, ratio of 0. 4, are approximately on the kyanite isograd. The metamorphic grade now preserved in Fannich is of almandine grade in the north and east, and mainly kyanite grade in the south-west and centre. The earlier metamorphic episode reached maximum intensity about the time of F 2 folding, while the milder late event probably accompanied F 3 deformation. In this respect, as in others, the structural and metamorphic history of Fannich is comparable to that of other Moinian areas. Geochemical evidence reveals differences between Moinian and Lewisian rocks that are not eliminated by metamorphism. Silicic gneisses and amphibolites from the Lewisian rocks contain FeO/TiO 2, K/Rb ratios and zirconium contents {{different from those of the}} Moinian, but often resembling those of rocks from the Lewisian Foreland, west of the Moine Thrust. Alteration of these ratios and Increase in zirconium content during sedimentation accounts adequately for the overall persistent differences in composition between Moinian and Lewisian rocks. The very high FeO/TiO 2 ratio of the Lewisian rocks suggests that they may be Scourian, rather than Laxfordian gneisses. Increase in K 2 O content and decrease in the FeO/TiO 2 ratio observed in the Lewisian near the junction with the Moinian is tentatively attributed to the effects of weathering of the Lewisian before the deposition of the Moinian. Some K 2 O enrichment of the Lewisian may also have occurred during metamorphism, resulting in the secondary growth of biotite in the amphibolites, but little other evidence of metasomatism was seen. Therefore the present chemical composition of the Moinian rock-units is considered to be broadly that of the original sediments. Chemical evidence was used to confirm petrological evidence that Lewisian rocks occur in Fannich, both where previously mapped, and south of Loch Fannich, and the interpretations of the structure are based on this conclusion. </p...|$|E
40|$|SECTION A. Understanding the {{relationships}} of inclusion trail geometries in porphyroblasts relative to matrix foliations is vital for unravelling complex deformation and metamorphic histories in highly tectonized terranes and the approach used to thin sectioning rocks is critically important for this. Two approaches {{have been used by}} structural and metamorphic geologists. One is based on fabric orientations with sections cut perpendicular to the foliation both parallel (P) and normal (N) to the lineation, whereas the other uses geographic orientations and a series of vertical thin sections. Studies using P and N sections reveal a simple history in comparison with studies using multiple-vertical thin sections. The {{reason for this is that}} inclusion trails exiting the porphyroblasts into the strain shadows in P and N sections commonly appear continuous with the matrix foliation whereas multiple vertical thin sections with different strikes reveal that they are actually truncated. Such truncations or textural unconformities are apparent from microstructures, textural relationships, compositional variations and FIA (Foliation Intersection Axis) trends. A succession of four FIA trends from ENE-WSW, E-W, N-S to NE-SW in the Robertson River Metamorphics, northern Queensland, Australia, suggests that these truncations were formed because of the overprint of successive generations of orthogonal foliations preserved within porphyroblasts from growth during multiple deformation events. At least four periods involving multiple phases of porphyroblast growth can be delineated instead of just the one previously suggested from an N and P section approach. SECTION B. A succession of four foliation intersection/inflection axes preserved in porphyroblasts (FIAs) trending ENE-WSW, E-W, N-S and NE-SW has been distinguished in the Proterozoic Robertson River Metamorphics (Georgetown Inlier, Queensland, Australia) based upon relative timing plus inclusion texture and orientation. The successions of asymmetries of inclusion trails defining these FIAs document the geometry of deformation associated with folding and fabric development during discreet episodes of bulk shortening. The successions of asymmetries bear no relationship to the geometry of macroscale folds present in the area suggesting that these folds predate porphyroblast growth, the widespread metamorphism and matrix fabric development. The onset of regional macro-scale folding may have begun soon after the deposition at around 1655 Ma in Georgetown Inlier. These folds were then amplified, overturned and refolded during NNWSSE, N-S, E-W and NW-SE regional bulk shortening. Earlier deformations were erased from the matrix because of bedding-induced shearing (reactivation) on the limbs of pre-existing macro-scale folds. Four foliations, S 1 to S 4, identified in the matrix provided information about the youngest deformations preserved in these rocks. SECTION C. Contouring XMn, XFe and XCa for garnet porphyroblasts and XAn for plagioclase inclusions in the MnNCKFMASH system provides an estimation of the P-T variation during the growth history of these porphyroblasts. Integration of this approach with relative timing constraints obtained from successions of Foliation Intersection/Inflection Axes within porphyroblasts (FIAs) reveals a more extensive P-T-D history than previously recognised in the Robertson River Metamorphics, Georgetown Inlier (NE Australia). A succession of four FIA trends (ENE-WSW, E-W, N-S, NE-SW) reveals three extended periods of garnet porphyroblast growth and two of staurolite growth in this region. Chemically zoned garnet porphyroblasts were selected based on successively formed FIAs in their cores from four representative rock samples. The intersection of XMn, XFe and XCa isopleths for the cores of the successively generated garnet porphyroblasts plus that of XCa and XAn isopleths for garnet and plagioclase inclusions suggests that pressures progressively increased from 3. 2 to 5. 8 kb and at temperatures from 530 º to 560 º C. This accompanied an orogenic progression from NNWSSE (O 1), N-S (O 2) to E-W (O 3) shortening. The maximum pressures and temperatures achieved, around 6 - 7 kb at 590 º- 610 º C, were followed by decompression and retrograde metamorphism with andalusite replacing an early formed generation of staurolite. These rocks were overprinted by NW SE shortening (O 4) occurring synchronously with low pressure – high temperature metamorphism, resulting in the overprint of early minerals by sillimanite and prograde muscovite. This last event was attributed to widespread granitic intrusion in all NE Australian Craton at around 1550 Ma. SECTION D. Electron microprobe dating of monazite confirms the relative timing of a succession of Foliation Intersection Axis trends in porphyroblasts (FIAs) and two extended periods of metamorphism, revealing a lengthy history of orogenesis in the Robertson River Metamorphics (NE Australia). A complete pressure-temperature-deformation-time (P-T-D-t) path has been deciphered involving an early clockwise P-T loop (not previously recognized in the NE Australian Craton) followed by an anticlockwise P-T trajectory. Metamorphism continued episodically throughout orogenesis changing from medium pressures and temperatures to lower pressures and higher temperatures after an intervening retrogressive phase. Successive generations of fine-grained monazite (5 μm- 20 μm) were identified using microstructure and FIA trends and then dated. The succession of four FIAs trending ENE-WSW (FIA 1), E-W (FIA 2), N-S (FIA 3), NE-SW (FIA 4) plus four matrix structures, S 1 -S 4 reveal three periods of garnet and two of staurolite growth, and suggest that monazite grains were episodically grown, dissolved and regrown due to successive periods of foliation development or reactivation. Isopleth thermobarometery, using P-T pseudosections in the MnNCKFMASH system for garnet porphyroblasts selected based on FIA trends in their core, reveal that the pressure increased progressively from 3 - 4 kb at 530 º- 550 ºC to 6 - 7 kb at 600 º- 620 ºC during medium pressure temperature metamorphism. This was accompanied by changing bulk shortening directions from NNW-SSE to N-S to E-W (perpendicular to FIAs 1, 2 and 3). The development of FIA 1 and FIA 2 occurred between ca. 1655 (depositional age) and 1592 Ma. FIA 3 developed over a 30 Ma period from 1592 Ma to 1559 Ma. <b>Retrogressive</b> <b>metamorphism,</b> decompression and exhumation occurred over a 10 Ma period. Further metamorphism accompanied regional granite intrusion around ca. 1550 Ma and generated lower pressure - higher temperature metamorphism during the development of FIA 4 (NW-SE bulk shortening). This period of orogenesis possibly extended for another 30 - 50 Ma based on the ages obtained from the youngest foliations in the matrix. Correlation of these data with other NE Australian Proterozoic Inliers suggests that they were all once part of a single orogen that developed from 1655 to 1500 Ma...|$|E
