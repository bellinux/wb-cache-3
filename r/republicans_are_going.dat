Did you know that more people over the age of 50 play video games than under the age of 18? As a gamer, I’m in good company with folks like Jodie Foster, Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams. Maybe it’s the Republican Party that is out of touch." ...|$|E

Stupak's vote {{in support of}} the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act fueled an outpouring of support for Benishek, who had no Internet presence aside from a basic website on the day the bill was passed. He received more than $50,000 in unsolicited donations in the first 48 hours after Stupak's vote for the bill on March 21, 2010. [...] "It's amazing, I just can't believe it," [...] he said regarding the support he has gotten. [...] "I need to use this momentum to repeal this health care bill and I'm going to do it. We're going to take over, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to regain the House of Representatives and we're going to repeal this health care bill." [...] The American Spectator called him [...] "The Most Popular Republican in America" [...] on March 21, in the wake of Stupak's yea vote. Stupak announced his retirement on April 9, 2010. Benishek won the Republican primary against State Senator Jason Allen by 15 votes.|$|E

50|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that no prominent <b>Republicans</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to challenge popular incumbent Tennessee governor Ned McWherter for re-election in 1990, Henry entered the fray, winning the primary election easily, apparently with the understanding that his chances of defeating McWherter in the general election were incredibly low, and that McWherter, a moderate who was also supported by many prominent Republicans, including many of their major contributors and fund raisers, would control the vast majority of all financial contributions made to the race. Henry's appeal was essentially solely to Republican straight-ticket voters and conservatives, and he received only about one-third of the votes in the November general election.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nationalist}} revolt, suppressed {{in all of}} Catalonia, {{has happened}} successfully only in the island of Mallorca, but the <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to occupy it. The Italian government has a strong interest (not just strategic) for the Balearic Islands. Action is needed urgently. Need someone skilled enough, smart, determined and ruthless, and they remember the beefy bolognese squadrista Bonaccorsi. On August 26, 1936 he landed at Palma, calling himself Count Aldo Rossi ("Conde Rossi" [...] or el Conde de Leon y Son Servera for Spanish). Resolutely takes command of the disorganized local nationalist forces, puts together 2.500/3.500 men between soldiers, legionaries of Tercio, volunteers, soldiers of the Guardia Civil and Falange, and deals with strong decision against the Republican forces (6000 to 10,000 men) landed 10 days prior to Manacor, commanded by General Alberto Bayo, a theorist of guerrilla warfare and the future [...] "ideal teacher" [...] of Fidel Castro. With {{the support of the}} Italian airforce on September 3 Bonaccorsi defeats the Republicans who begin a disastrous retreat that ended on day 12. After the victory of Manacor Bonaccorsi appoints himself military commander and inspector general of all the troops, creating the [...] "Dragones de la muerte". On 20 September with 500 men he landed in Ibiza, camouflaged. He also takes Formentera and Cabrera. Only Minorca remains {{in the hands of the}} Reds, protected by a secret agreement between Italy and England. Bonaccorsi then starts to do the [...] "pacificacion" [...] of Majorca, [...] "cleaning" [...] the island from marxists. George Bernanos describes the nearly 3,000 executions of communists done by Bonaccorsi's Dragones de la muerte, but he did not see the early violence (nearly 1,500 nationalists and priests killed only in Majorca) of the marxists done before the arrival of Bonaccorsi. In reality, the Bonaccorsi murders were only 700 (or 1500, as reported by the Italian consul in the Balearic islands), but this was enough to create huge complaints from France and England (even if in Majorca the civil war deaths were in percentage nearly one tenth of those happened in continental Spain). The pressures were such, that he was forced -by diplomatic missions- to be returned to Italy on December 23, 1936. Additionally, Mussolini did not like the Bonaccorsi boasting that Italy was to remain forever in Majorca.|$|E
40|$|The {{semantic}} {{category of}} modality specializes in expressing {{the relation between}} text and world, especially highlighted in approaches that invoke the analytical apparatus of ‘possible worlds’. Its theoretical assumption (cf. Rescher 1979 : 16 ff) is that a proposition {{can be said to}} be true in one specific (real or virtual; past, present, or future) world and false in another. This corpus-based study investigates the potential of the semiotic noun chance to participate in modal expressions in PDE. In examples like (1) have no chance functions as a secondary modal auxiliary expressing dynamic participant-imposed impossibility (cf. Nuyts 2005) (‘Clifton could not make a tackle’), and in (2) there is a very good chance functions as a modal marker signaling the speaker’s epistemic assessment of the propositional content coded by the that-complement (‘the Republicans will take back the Senate’). In addition, examples like (3) indicate that NPs with chance also occur in semi-insubordinate constructions (cf. Van linden & Van de Velde 2014), which can be interpreted as elliptical counterparts of modal marker structures like in (2) (‘Couldn’t he be kidding?’). (1) 	During an interception return, when Clifton had no chance of making a tackle, Sapp blindsided Clifton. He went down. And stayed down for 15 minutes. (COCA, news) (2) 	Let me ask {{you a little bit about}} politics. You have got the midterm election coming up here. My sense is that there’s a very good chance the <b>Republicans</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to take back the Senate. (COCA, spoken) (3) 	A: He says I would have done him in if he was still alive. And he says I found a person that met his description as far as abusiveness. And I says, yeah? And he says, well, I shot him in the head and killed him. B: No chance that he was kidding or not telling the truth? A: I knew he was telling the truth. (COCA, spoken) In addition, chance also has lexical uses (e. g. take [your] chances as an idiomatized complex predicate ‘give it a try’). Based on data extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) or WordBanksOnline, this study will provide detailed lexicogrammatical descriptions of the constructions featuring chance NPs, taking into account such decategorialization reflexes as determiner drop, reduction in adjectives, loss of singular-plural contrast, etc. From a theoretical point of view, this study aims to adduce corroborating evidence for the role of negation as a trigger of the shift from lexical uses to grammatical ones (cf. Van linden et al. 2011; Saad et al. 2012; Davidse et al. 2015; Van linden et al. 2016). status: publishe...|$|E
