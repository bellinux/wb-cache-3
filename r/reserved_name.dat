50|$|But {{according}} to new trends in nomenclature, the old names of IL-1 family returned. In 2010, laboratories {{all around the world}} agreed that IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1Ra and IL-18 are more familiar to the general scientific knowledge. According to that, they suggested that IL-1F6, IL-1F8 and IL-1F9 should get new names IL-36α, IL-36β and IL-36γ, even though they are encoded by distinct genes, they use the same receptor complex IL-1Rrp2 and coreceptor IL-1RAcP and deliver almost identical signals. The nomenclature also proposes that IL-1F5 should be renamed to IL-36Ra, because it works as an antagonist to IL-36α, IL-36β and IL-36γ similar to how IL-1Ra works for IL-1α and IL-1β. Another revision was the renaming of IL-1F7 to IL-37 because this suppressing cytokine has many splicing variants, they should be called IL-37a, IL-37b and so on. For IL-1F10 there is a <b>reserved</b> <b>name,</b> IL-38.|$|E
5000|$|The pound sign or hash symbol {{is often}} used in {{information}} technology to highlight a special meaning. (It {{should be noted that}} the words [...] "Pound Sign" [...] in the UK refer specifically to currency [...] "£"—extended ASCII character 156—and not weight.) In 1970 for example, the number sign was used to denote immediate address mode in the assembly language of the PDP-11 when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor. In the 1986 SGML standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a <b>reserved</b> <b>name</b> indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals,--e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data. In usage predating the current meaning of hashtag, the pound sign was called the [...] "hash symbol" [...] in some countries outside of North America so as to avoid confusion with the UK currency symbol.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{this was}} a stratagem {{that was used to}} merge a [...]Africa {{proposal}} that had been put forward by Nii Quaynor under “dotafrica.org” (his registered domain, to merge with the (the “Africa in One Space” umbrella) which is now {{the front page of the}} ICANN contracted ZACR registry [...] and supported by AfriNIC and the Afr* organizations - including the ARC/AfTLD. DCA has run a “No” campaign on Mr.Quaynor to expose all of his associations. [...] These associations were using the AU-DotAfrica Task Force as the platform to propose to the AUC to request for the [...]Africa name to be included in the List of Top-Level Reserved Names by ICANN as a special legislative protection to benefit the AUC; which would then enable the AUC to delegate [...]Africa outside the ICANN new gTLD Program to the structure they recommend This is essentially how the AUC came into the picture directly even though the organization had no prior intentions to apply for, or participate directly in [...]Africa proposal, as it has already issued an endorsement to DCA Trust.Therefore,the plan to get the [...]Africa new gTLD as a <b>reserved</b> <b>name</b> was formulated by the AU DotAfrica Task Force members who had hoped to use their connections at ICANN to win [...]Africa for themselves with the supposed backing of the AUC - the organization that was also expected to identify a structure and appoint that structure to run [...]africa after receiving special treatment from ICANN.Hence, during the ICANN-42 International Meeting in Dakar, Senegal in October 2011, a request was submitted by AUC to ICANN as part of an ‘African Agenda’ Ministerial Roundtable meeting to reserve the DotAfrica name and its equivalent in other languages such as DotAfrique and DotAfrikia to the AUC as special legislative protection, so to be managed and operated by “the structure” that is “selected and identified,by the African Union “ ...|$|E
