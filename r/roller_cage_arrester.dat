40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} oil spraying system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, spraying angle, oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of oil spraying was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system. Originality/value: The computer simulation allows to better understand the interdependence betweenparameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|R

40|$|Two {{differential}} (dual input, single output) drives (a roller-gear and a pure roller), and {{a momentum}} balanced (single input, dual output) drive (pure roller) were designed, fabricated, and tested. The differential drives are each rated at 295 rad/sec (2800 rpm) input speed, 450 N-m (4, 000 in-lbf) output torque. The momentum balanced drive is rated at 302 rad/sec (2880 rpm) input speed, and dual output torques of 434 N-m (3840 in-lbf). The Dual Input Differential Roller-Gear Drive (DC- 700) has a planetary roller-gear {{system with a}} reduction ratio (one input driving the output with the second input fixed) of 29. 23 : 1. The Dual Input Differential Roller Drive (DC- 500) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of approximately 24 : 1. Each of the differential drives features dual roller-gear or roller arrangements consisting of a sun, four first row planets, four second row planets, and a ring. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive (DC- 400) has a planetary roller system with a reduction ratio of 24 : 1 with both outputs counterrotating at equal speed. Its single roller cluster consists of a sun, five first and five second row planets, a <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> or spider and a ring. Outputs are taken from both the <b>roller</b> <b>cage</b> and the ring which counterrotate. Test results reported for all three drives include angular and torque ripple (linearity and cogging), viscous and Coulomb friction, and forward and reverse power efficiency. Of the two differential drives, the Differential Roller Drive had better linearity and less cogging than did the Differential Roller-Gear Drive, but it had higher friction and lower efficiency (particularly at low power throughput levels). Use of full preloading rather than a variable preload system in the Differential Roller Drive assessed a heavy penalty in part load efficiency. Maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 % for the Differential Roller-Gear Drive and 86 % for the Differential Roller Drive. The Momentum Balanced (Grounded Ring) Drive performed as expected kinematically. Reduction r-atios to the two counterrotating outputs (design nominal= 24 : 1) were measured to be 23. 98 : 1 and 24. 12 : 1 at zero load [...] At 25 ONm (2200 in-lbf) output torque the ratio changed 2 % due to roller creep. This drive was the smoothest of all three as determined from linearity and cogging tests, and maximum measured efficiency (ratio of power out to power in) was 95 %. The disadvantages of full preloading as comvared to variable preload were apparent in this drive as in the Differential Roller Drive. Efficiencies at part load were low, but improved dramatically with increases in torque. These were consistent with friction measurements which indicated losses primarily from Coulomb friction. The initial preload level setting was low so roller slip was encountered at higher torques during testing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) is {{state of}} the art among the radiation field shaping systems for conformal radiotherapy techniques. Some advantages of this system are as follow: reduction of treatment time, higher precision in conforming the radiation field to the projection of the target volume and lowering the chance of errors made by technologists. The purpose of this research was to design and construct the mechanical section of a prototype MLC.   Material and Methods: The MLC consists of a base plate, 52 leaves, 2 leaf carriages, 2 nuts and 52 triangular thread screws. The leaves are arranged in two opposing banks each containing 26 leaves. The carriages are used to extend the movement of the leaves. The components of the MLC are fabricated by machining processes. The MLC is designed to be mounted on the conventional linear accelerators as an add-on accessory. The leaves were made of aluminum. The dimensions of the leaves are 5 x 200 x 50 mm.   Result: The collimator system weighs approximately 37 kg excluding the leaves. The projected width of each leaf on the isocenter of a Varian linear accelerator is 10 mm. The movement of the leaves is accomplished by using the triangular thread screws. The screws required to have a low axial backlash which in turn results in lower precision positioning of the leaves. The positioning accuracy of each leaf is approximately 1. 4 mm. Discussion and Conclusion: Mashhad MLC system, in it’s present form and design weighs 37 kg. but if Aluminum blades are replaced by tungsten ones then the over all weights of MLC may exceed the weight limit a linac may hold. Therefore futher modifications are required to reduce the MLC total weight.

Techniques with lower costs than conventional undersowing by separate drilling are often regarded as unreliable. Undersowing by drilling after sowing spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was compared with broadcast sowing simultaneously with drilling barley. Various implements were coupled behind the combined drill in cases where seed was broadcast: a press-wheel attachment, a long-tined harrow and a <b>cage</b> <b>roller.</b> A fourth treatment did not include an implement coupled behind the drill. The undersown crop was sown as a seed mixture of 3 kg ha- 1 red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and 6 kg ha- 1 meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Hudson). The numbers of plants and weeds and the plant height were measured five times during the growing season. Above-ground biomass of the undersown species was determined at barley harvest and in late autumn. Grain yield of spring barley was recorded. Drilling resulted in the highest yield of undersown crop when an early summer drought occurred, but broadcasting in combination with use of seed covering equipment led to the least variation in biomass production over the 4 years the experiment was conducted. The relative proportion of meadow fescue in the crop was low in three years, and lower when broadcast than when drilled. Barley grain yield was highest when the seed was broadcast and seed covering equipment was used.

30|$|Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and {{polyimide}} (PI) are {{two kinds}} of engineering polymer materials widely used as <b>roller</b> bearing <b>cages</b> and rings under extreme environment because of their noise reduction and corrosion resistance properties. The Si 3 N 4 ceramic is the most common ball bearing material. Many current engineering applications of ball bearings require aqueous lubrication. Therefore, this study presents the aqueous lubrication of tribopairs formed by PEEK and PI material sliding against Si 3 N 4 ceramic. Experimental results show that two tribopairs exhibited the similar tribological properties under the dry condition. Water as a lubricant for the PI–Si 3 N 4 tribopair pairs effectively reduces both friction coefficients by 35.5 % and wear rates by 32 %. The water absorption of PI induces better tribological properties by changing the tribopair surface properties. In addition, the dimples appearing on the PI tribopair surface under water generate additional hydrodynamic lubrication and further improve the friction properties of surface. The PEEK–Si 3 N 4 tribopair shows similar friction coefficients under two kinds of environments. The wear rates under water are approximately more than two times of that under dry sliding. However, water inhibits the appearance of the crush phenomenon and enhances the carrying capacity of the tribopair. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra demonstrate no chemical corrosion. The 3 D profiler and SEM morphologies illustrate that the transfer film would be formed from the surface of PEEK under water but hindered under dry friction. Overall, the PI–Si 3 N 4 tribopair exhibits better properties than PEEK under water and is promising for future applications in the bearing industry.|$|R

40|$|Unstable {{movement}} in <b>roller</b> bearings like <b>cage</b> or <b>roller</b> slip {{can lead to}} damages or eventually even to an early break of the bearing. To prevent slip, inadequate operating states should be avoided. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the dynamic behavior of the bearing. Unfortunately, there is only a limited range of measurement methods for the dynamic of bearing components. Two possible approaches are using solely a high-speed camera or the combination of an optomechanical image derotator and a high-speed camera. This work focuses on a proposal which is suitable for both. Initially, the influence of the rotational velocity in the images is eliminated. In the next step the measurement data is reduced to a region of interest which displays a particular rolling-element. A rolling element is equipped with a linear marker which, in the next stage, is segmented by a thresholding method to multiple regions. The region representing the marker is extracted from the background and the position is calculated by a Principle Component Analysis. Depending on the shift of the angular position and the lag time between two images, the rotational velocity of the rolling element is calculated. Thus, it is possible to determine whether the rolling element is operating under ideal conditions. In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} this approach enables a simple and flexible non-invasive method to depict the occurrence of roller slip in roller bearings. © 2017 SPIE...|$|R
