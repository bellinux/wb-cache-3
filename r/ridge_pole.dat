500|$|Facing {{southeast}} on the Norwichtown green, the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded {{building with}} a gambrel roof. Constructed between 1772 and 1774, the building was built on a stone foundation and has a stone stoop leading to the front entrance. The gambrel roof is framed without a <b>ridge</b> <b>pole.</b> It overhangs {{the front and back}} facades by , but does not project the sides. At the time of the National Historic Register of Places nomination, the roof used wooden shingles. The interior has a single brick chimney that was used for the forge. The main floor was originally open, with only a single supporting post in the center, but this was later partitioned into several rooms. Modern additions to the shop include modern doors, electric lighting and heat, and a disappearing overhead stairway that leads to the attic. The shop's cellar was not described in the survey. In 1915, the house passed out of the Carpenter family, and it was restored by Norman Isham in 1916. In 1956, the building came into the ownership of the [...] "Society of the Founders of Norwich, Connecticut, Inc.". According to the 1966 edition of Fodor's Modern Guides, the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop was [...] "still furnished as it was when Mr. Carpenter plied his trade." [...] The National Historic Register of Places noted that the partitioning was [...] "recent" [...] {{at the time of its}} 1970 nomination. In 1997, a $5000 grant was used to replace the roof.|$|E

2500|$|The Susquehannock (an Algonquian name meaning [...] "people of {{the muddy}} river" [...] {{adopted by the}} English of Maryland and Virginia) were known {{by a variety of}} ethnonyms such as the Andastes by the French (adapted from the Huron name Andastoerrhonon, meaning [...] "people of the {{blackened}} <b>ridge</b> <b>pole,)</b> the Minquas by the Dutch and Swedes (adapted from the Lenape name for their traditional enemy, which meant [...] "treacherous"), and the Conestogas by the English of Pennsylvania (adapted from Kanastoge or [...] "place of the immersed pole", the name of a Susquehanna village in Pennsylvania), although their Iroquoian autonym is unknown. The Susquehannock were separated into two groups known as the White Minquas and the Black Minquas. The White Minquas were located in villages along the Susquehanna River and its tributaries from Pennsylvania to southern New York. The Black Minqua were located in the West Virginia (Grant, Hampshire and Hardy counties) and Maryland (Allegany County) areas that share the Potomac River as a border. They may {{have been part of the}} Erie people, and were bitter enemies of the Iroquois Confederacy for control of the fur trade like their Erie and Huron allies. These tribes ought to have been centered east of the Kanawha River and held little land in what is now West Virginia.|$|E

Coal was loaded in the Cumberland basin, {{which consisted of}} dumping four carloads of coal into the boat. Some of the coal had to be shoveled by hand into the spaces beneath the cabins. During the loading process, nobody {{would be on the}} boat due to the dust, and mules were kept off, in case the boat sank from being loaded. Despite closing windows, dust usually entered the cabins. After loading, the <b>ridge</b> <b>poles</b> would be put, then the hatches over the <b>ridge</b> <b>poles</b> and openings.

[...] In January 1865 the regiment drew shoes and marched from Tupelo to West Point, Mississippi, where they boarded a train that took them first to Meridian and then to Demopolis, Alabama, where they were forced to sleep in the mud along the tracks because they could not find any branches to make <b>ridge</b> <b>poles</b> out of for their tents. On the way to Selma the next day, their train derailed in an eerie repeat of the episode in late 1862; several men from Companies B and G were sitting on top of the cars, and were injured when their boxcars left the tracks.

6000|$|The dry-salter's {{premises}} {{seemed to}} have been set on fire for poor Ned's special benefit that night. They suited his case exactly. There was more than the usual quantity of smoke to suffocate, and fire to roast, him. There was considerable danger too, so that the daring men of the brigade were in request--if we may say that of a brigade in which all the men were daring--and Ned had congenial work given him to do. The proverbial meeting of Greek with Greek was mere child's play to this meeting of fire with fire. The inflamed Ned and the blazing dry-salter met in mortal conflict, and the result was tremendous! It made his brother firemen stand aghast with awful admiration, to observe the way in which Ned dashed up tottering staircases, and along smoke-choked passages, where lambent flames were licking about in search of oxygen to feed on, {{and the way in which}} he hurled down brick walls and hacked through wood partitions, and tore up fir-planking and seized branch and hose, and, dragging them into hole-and-corner places, and out upon dizzy beams, and <b>ridge</b> <b>poles,</b> dashed tons of water in the fire's face, until it hissed again.

5000|$|Cabin tents are single-skin tents used {{mainly in}} the USA. They often have nylon walls, {{polyester}} roof, and a polyethylene floor, plus an awning at one or both ends. With a hydrostatic head of only 1000 mm, they may best be considered as summer tents. Removable internal dividers allow the cabin to be split into 'rooms'. Sizes may range from 13 ft by 8 ft (2 rooms) up to 25 ft by 10 ft (4 rooms), with wall and roof heights {{similar to those of}} frame tents.

50|$|The birch bark {{itself does}} not form {{the top layer of}} the roof. Once the main log frame of the {{building}} is constructed, the main horizontal roof poles are laid down; after this comes thin timber slats placed at right-angles to the base roof poles. On top of these then come the layers of birch-bark, each row overlapping the next. The number of layers could vary from 2 to 6 depending on the building. On top of the birch-bark layers were then placed long heavy wooden poles (usually de-barked young trees). The poles {{on either side of the}} pitched roof would be interlocked at the roof <b>ridge.</b> The <b>poles</b> were held in place at the eaves by an eaves board.

60|$|The elastic bamboo {{floor of}} the hut bent under the heavy weight of the old seaman, who, {{standing}} within the threshold, tried {{to look into the}} smoky gloom of the low dwelling.

In the obscurity of the more remote parts of the house a lance-head, a brass tray hung on the wall, the long barrel of a gun leaning against the chest, caught the stray rays of the smoky illumination in trembling gleams that wavered, disappeared, reappeared, went out, came back--as if engaged in a doubtful struggle with the darkness that, lying in wait in distant corners, seemed to dart out viciously towards its feeble enemy. The vast space under the high pitch of the roof was filled with a thick cloud of smoke, whose under-side--level like a ceiling--reflected the light of the swaying dull flame, while at the top it oozed out through the imperfect thatch of dried palm leaves. An indescribable and complicated smell, made up of the exhalation of damp earth below, of the taint of dried fish and of the effluvia of rotting vegetable matter, pervaded the place and caused Lingard to sniff strongly as he strode over, sat on the chest, and, leaning his elbows on his knees, took his head between his hands and stared at the doorway thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|Thus far, all was well, {{our success}} much {{exceeding}} our hopes. The hunters {{were sent to}} look for a spring; and, one being found at no great distance, we all repaired to the spot, and hutted for the night. Nothing could be more simple than our encampment; which consisted of coverings made of the branches of trees, with leaves and skins for our beds. Next day, however, Traverse finding the position favourable for his work, he determined to select the spot as head-quarters; and we all set about the erection of a log-house, in which we might seek a shelter {{in the event of a}} storm, and where we might deposit our implements, spare ammunition, and such stores as we had brought with us on our backs. As everybody worked with good-will at the erection of this rude building, and the labourers were very expert with the axe, we had it nearly complete by the setting of the next day's sun. Traverse chose the place because the water was abundant, and good, and because a small knoll was near the spring, that was covered with young pines that were about fourteen or fifteen inches in diameter, while they grew to the height of near a hundred feet, with few branches, and straight as the Onondago. These trees were felled, cut into lengths of twenty and thirty feet, notched at the ends, and rolled alternately on each other, so as to enclose an area that was one-third longer than it was wide. The notches were deep, and brought the logs within two or three inches of each other; and the interstices were filled with pieces of riven chestnut, a wood that splits easily and in straight lines; which pieces were driven hard into their beds, so as to exclude the winds and the rains. As the weather was warm, and the building somewhat airy at the best, we cut no windows, though we had a narrow door in the centre of one of the longer sides. For a roof we used the bark of the hemlock, which, at that season, came off in large pieces, and which was laid on sticks, raised to the desired elevation by means of a <b>ridge</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of variability of a coupled atmosphere-ocean model are investigated through {{the study of}} two coupled configurations: an aquaplanet in which gyres are absent, and an aquaplanet in which a <b>ridge</b> extending from <b>pole</b> to pole supports gyres. Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) are used to explore the main features of variability exhibited by extended integrations of both configurations. In the aqua-planet a decadal variability is observed in the atmosphere and the ocean. Stochastic driving of the annular modes in the atmosphere generates an anomalous Sea Sur-face Temperature (SST) dipole through latent heat fluxes and Ekman pumping. A feedback of this SST dipole on the atmosphere enables a damping slow enough for anomalies to persist over decadal time scales. This air-sea feedback combined with a slow advection of the anomalies by mean ocean currents result in the observed decadal oscillation. A simple stochastic model captures the essence of this mechanism. In the ridge decadal variability is absent but centennial variability is observed in the atmo-sphere and the ocean.

40|$|The {{influence}} of realistic Arctic sea ice anomalies on the atmosphere during winter is investigated with version 3. 6 of the Community Climate Model (CCM 3. 6). Model experiments are performed for the winters {{with the most}} (1982 / 83) and least (1995 / 96) Arctic ice coverage during 1979 – 99, when ice concentration estimates were available from satellites. The experiments consist of 50 -member ensembles: using large ensembles proved critical to distinguish the signal from noise. The local response to ice anomalies over the subpolar seas of both the Atlantic and Pacific is robust and generally shallow with large upward surface heat fluxes (. 100 W m 22), near-surface warming, enhanced pre-cipitation, and below-normal sea level pressure where sea ice receded, and the reverse where the ice expanded.
