The relationship between wettability of superhydrophobic metal carboxylate and substrate roughness has been studied by choosing sandpaper with <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> from 80 to 2000 grit as substrates. The superhydrophobic effect has been found interrelated to substrate roughness. This phenomenon has been analyzed both experimentally and theoretically.

Film morphology for different temperature annealing was probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the values of <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> from 0. 59 up to 2. 15 nm. The best photovoltaic performance was found for devices with active layer annealed at 200 °C with power conversion efficiency (η) of 2. 8 % while devices without annealing presented only 0. 4 %. This performance enhancement is attributed to the reduction of traps and increased hole mobility after the thermal annealing...|$|E
30|$|As {{summarized}} above, {{there is}} no general trend which relates the surface roughness with the strength of adhesive bonded joints. An optimum surface <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> is differing {{with respect to the}} adhesive-adherend combinations in order to get high performance of bonded joints. Therefore, for different adhesive-adherend joints, there will be a different optimum range of roughness with regard to bond strength. It is of interest to study the change in behaviour of adhesively bonded joint with change in adherend material. The objective of the present study is to investigate the influence of surface roughness using aluminium and wood adherend material on the adhesive bond strength.|$|E

We demonstrate by three different ways that morphology is ruled by the growth rate, and therefore strongly influences the optical properties of the layers. Whereas small size well-connected grains are obtained at high growth rate, the crystals evolve toward large disoriented nanorods since the kinetic of the reaction is hindered. The corresponding RMS <b>roughnesses</b> <b>ranges</b> from 35 nm to 119 nm, resulting in diffusion of the light from far UV to visible-wavelength.

Electroless Ni/electroless Cu/electroplated Cu and electroless Ni/electroplated Cu were {{the two types of}} plate contacts tested. It was found that smoother surfaces had higher pull strength than rougher, chemically etched surfaces. The presence of the electroless Cu layer was found to be important to adhesion. The mode of fracture of the contact as it left the silicon was studied, and it was found that in almost all cases separation was due to fracture of the bulk silicon phase.

30|$|Although {{there are}} fewer studies of micro topographies on other marine invertebrates, these studies also {{indicated}} that micro topographies have varying effects on other larvae settlements. Larvae of Bugula neritina have diameters that are approximately 300 - 400  μm which explains the reduced settlements on sine wave grooves that were only 256  μm wide. As expected, the largest sine wave grooves (512  μm) were able to fit the zooids of this bryozoa. The increased settlement densities of B. neritina larvae on smaller grooves that ranged from 8 – 64  μm were unexpected and difficult to explain. Grooves of this range have an overall exposed surface area that is greater than larger sine wave grooves. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} the amount of adhesives adsorbed on grooves of this <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> would be high and could have aided in retaining more bryozoan larvae [44].|$|E

The LB films were obtained from monomers of 3 -hexadecyl-pyrrole (3 HP); the polymerization of the film was performed directly at the air-subphase interface, and the films were collected on hydrophilic glass. Very homogeneous polymeric and monomeric LB films were collected on glass with a transfer rate near unity, the typical average <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> was 0. 9 +/- 0. 4 nm, {{and the quality of}} films was independent of the dipping speed.

40|$|Plated silicon wafers with surface <b>roughness</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 4 to 130 microinches, {{subjected}} to tensile pull-strength tests, were analyzed. Results {{show that the}} measured pull-strength of plated metals decrease with increasing silicon surface roughness, effecting a weakening of the cohesive strength of the wafer, possibly caused by microcracks or 'etch pits' in the silicon surface. The mean value of pull-strength for all wafers plated with the Ni-Cu-Cu sequence exceeded the required 450 g/ 0. 02 sq cm, and at Ra = 0. 4 microinches, the mean pull-strength for the Ni-Cu-Cu and Ni-Cu wafers were 2290 and 850 g/ 0. 02 sq cm, respectively. The development of standardized methods for measuring contact pull-strength is suggested. These results may have some bearing on solar cell arrays problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{weighted}} curvature approximation (WCA) {{was recently}} introduced by Elfouhaily et al [7] as a unifying scattering theory that reproduces formally both the tangent-plane and the small-perturbation {{model in the}} appropriate limits, and is structurally identical to the former approximation with some different slope-dependent kernel. Due to the simplicity of its formulation, the WCA is interesting from a numerical {{point of view and}} the aim of the present paper is to establish its accuracy on some representative test cases. We derive statistical formulae for the coherent field and the cross-section in the case of stationary Gaussian random surfaces. We then specialize to the case of isotropic Gaussian spectra and perform numerical comparisons against rigorous method of moments (MoM) -based results on 2 D dielectric surfaces. We show that the WCA remains extremely accurate in a <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> where other first-order classical approximations (small-slope and Kirchhoff) clearly fail, at the same computational cost.

40|$|Phase change {{technology}} is a science that is continually finding new applications, from passive refrigeration cycles to semiconductor cooling. The primary heat transfer techniques associated with phase change heat transfer are pool boiling, flow boiling, and spray cooling. Of these techniques, spray cooling is the least studied {{and the most recent}} to receive attention in the scientific community. Spray cooling is capable of removing large amounts of heat between the cooled surface and the liquid, with reported heat flux capabilities of up to 1000 W/cm 2 for water. Many previous studies have emphasized heat flux as a function of spray parameters and test conditions. Enhanced spray cooling investigations to date have been limited to surface roughness studies. These studies concluded that surface tolerance (i. e. variations in machined surface finish) had an impact upon heat flux when using pressure atomized sprays. Analogous pool boiling studies with enhanced surfaces have shown heat flux enhancement. A spray cooling study using enhanced surfaces beyond the surface <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> may display heat flux enhancement as well. In the present study, a group of extended and embedded surfaces (straight fins, cubic pin fins, pyramids, dimples and porous tunnels) have been investigated {{to determine the effects of}} enhanced surface structure on heat flux. The surface enhancements were machined on the top surface of copper heater blocks with a cross-sectional area of 2. 0 cm 2. Measurements were also obtained on a flat surface for baseline comparison purposes. Thermal performance data was obtained under saturated (pure fluid at 101 kPa), nominally degassed (chamber pressure of 41. 4 kPa) and gassy conditions (chamber with N 2 gas at 101 kPa). The study shows that both extended and embedded structures (beyond the surface <b>roughness</b> <b>range)</b> promote heat flux enhancement for both degassed and gassy spray cooling conditions. The study also shows that straight fins provide the best utilization of surface area added for heat transfer. An Energy conservation based CHF correlation for flat surface spray cooling was also developed. CHF predictions were compared against published and non-published studies by several researchers. Results for the correlations performance show an average mean error of ± 17. 6 % with an accuracy of ± 30 % for 88 % of the data set compared against...|$|E

Radial vibration measurements taken directly from rotors using Laser Vibrometry are known to show a significant cross-sensitivity to the orthogonal radial vibration component. A process for resolving the individual components is now well established and is suitable for both radial measurements and pitch / yaw measurements which show an equivalent cross-sensitivity. All of the work conducted {{in the development of}} this system was done using surfaces treated with retro-reflective tape, a common surface treatment for Laser Vibrometer measurements. In this paper investigations have been conducted on untreated surfaces with roughness close to or less than the wavelength of light. These investigations have highlighted an inherent uncertainty for measurements in this <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> related to changes in the effective centre of the incident laser beam. This uncertainty is shown to be influenced by surface roundness and incident beam diameter {{as well as by the}} surface roughness itself.

Alumina films with thickness lower than 40 nm deposited under vacuum present a non-negligible void content that induces {{a decrease of}} the effective refractive index of the layers.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes a}} simple and versatile approach to engineering surface roughness gradients via combination of microfluidics and photo-polymerization. Through UV-mediated polymerization, N-isopropylacrylamide with concentration gradients are successfully grafted onto PDMS surface, leading to diverse roughness degrees on the obtained PDMS substrate. Furthermore, the extent of surface roughness can be controllably regulated via tuning the flow rate ratio between the monomer solution and deionized water. Average <b>roughness</b> <b>ranging</b> from 8. 050 nm to 151. 68 nm has well been achieved in this work. Such PDMS samples are also demonstrated {{to be capable of}} working as supporting substrates for controlling cell adhesion or detachment. Due to the different degrees of surface roughness on a single substrate, our method provides an effective approach for designing advanced surafecs for cell culture. Finally, the thermosensitive property of N-isopropylacrylamide makes our sample furnish as another means for controlling the cell detachment from the substrates with correspondence to the surrounding temperature...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{titanium}} (Ti) and {{titanium alloys}} are promising scaffold biomaterials for bone tissue engineering, {{because they have}} the potential to provide new bone tissue ingrowth abilities and low elastic modulus to match that of natural bone. In the present study, a new highly porous Ti 6 Ta 4 Sn alloy scaffold with the addition of biocompatible alloying elements (tantalum (Ta) and tin (Sn)) was prepared using a space-holder sintering method. The strength of the Ti 6 Ta 4 Sn scaffold with a porosity of 75 % was found to be significantly higher than that of a pure Ti scaffold with the same porosity. The elastic modulus of the porous alloy can be customized to match that of human bone by adjusting its porosity. In addition, the porous Ti 6 Ta 4 Sn alloy exhibited an interconnected porous structure, which enabled the ingrowth of new bone tissues. Cell culture results revealed that human SaOS 2 osteoblast-like cells grew and spread well on the surfaces of the solid alloy, and throughout the porous scaffold. The surface roughness of the alloy showed a significant effect on the cell behavior, and the optimum surface <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> for the adhesion of the SaOS 2 cell on the alloy was 0. 15 to 0. 35 mm.

40|$|The TIS formula, {{relating}} the rms surface roughness parameter R(q) to the specularly reflected light by TIS = specularly reflected light/total reflected light = exp [-((pi/lambda) R(q)) (2) ], has been derived for surfaces with a Gaussian height distribution. This study investigates {{the validity of}} this formula for Various realistic and artificial surface height distributions with and without skewness. The specular light intensity is calculated by using a Fourier transform expression for the Kirchhoff formalism of diffraction. The Kirchhoff formalism is valid for gently sloped metallic surfaces producing small scattering angles. In the case where the scattered light is collected by a lens, the light distribution in the focal plane of this lens {{is proportional to the}} power spectrum of the optical field close to the scattering surface. This optical input field can be related to the surface height distribution by geometrical optics, resulting in a phase modulation expression for the input field E(i) (x) proportional to exp[i 2 kyx) ] where k = 2 pi/lambda and y(x) is the surface profile. Normal incidence illumination with wavelength lambda is assumed in this study. The theoretical surface profiles under investigation can be divided into profiles with and without skewness. They have the following surface height distributions: (i) zero skewness (can be produced by grinding triangular profile diffraction grating), exponential, Gaussian, uniform, sinusoidal, square wave; Iii) non-zero skewness (can be produced by diamond turning split triangular profile resembling plateau honing) : parabolic cusp, pseudo-uniform. The results of this study are: (i) in the surface <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> R(q) < 0. 08 lambda, the percentage error in the roughness value obtained by the TIS formula is limited to 10 % and (ii) skewness in the surface height distribution tends to reduce the light scatter for a given surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|Horizontal Marine Hydro-Kinetic (MHK) {{energy in}} the form of currents/tides/rivers is {{worldwide}} available. The vast majority flows at speeds slower than 3 knots while tur-bines require an average of 5 - 7 knots to be financially viable. The VIVACE Converter (Vortex Induced Vibration for Aquatic Clean Energy) is an innovative energy converter, which is highly scalable and can thus extract energy from even slow flows using the po-tentially disastrous phenomenon of Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) or galloping. Due to the self-limiting nature of VIV, the range of synchronization and the amplitude of oscillation restrict the amount of energy generated. The goal of this thesis is to enable VIVACE to attain higher power generation with higher efficiency using high damping required for energy harnessing. Passive Turbulence Control (PTC) utilizing roughness strips is developed and tested experimentally to en-hance Flow Induced Motion (FIM). Experiments are conducted for 4 × 104 <Re< 1. 2 × 105 using PTC on a circular cylinder undergoing VIV and galloping. PTC is applied as straight roughness strips at specific circumferential locations on a circular cylinder surface to alter its FIM in a steady flow. Effectively, geometry is changed to non-circular, which results in a flow incidence angle, leading to high-amplitude oscillations known as galloping. All model tests were conducted with broad-field laser visualization at 4 × 104 <Re< 1. 2 × 105 in the Marine Renewable Energy Laboratory of the University of Michigan. The following observations and conclusions are made: (1) PTC coverage of 16 ° is effective in the range of 10 °- 64 °. (2) PTC reduces VIV amplitudes, but extends the VIV synchronization range followed by high-amplitude galloping. (3) Galloping initiates at a critical reduced velocity U*gallop, manifests to fully-developed galloping with no re-duced velocity upper-end reached. (4) U*gallop is found to depend primarily on the PTC location. (5) Wake structures change dramatically reaching up to ten vortices shed per cycle of galloping oscillation.

40|$|This is a {{progress}} report {{on the subject of}} fatigue-enhanced photoemission. In our studies on fatigue-enhanced photoemission, the ultimate goal is {{to see whether or not}} the photoyield can be used as a tool to uniquely define the early and later stages of fatigue on structural materials. This yield results in an electron current off the specimen. It seems to be customary now in the literature to call this current 11 exo-electrons 11, alth~ugh this term was used earlier for non-stimulated electron current only. We should clearly distinguish between non-stimulated and photo-stimulated "exo-electrons". The intensity of the non-stimulated effect is much smaller than it is for the stimulated one. All our work is done using the photo stimulation in which an outside light source and a monochromator for energy selection are used. A variety of mechanisms for stimulated emission have been proposed, such as: 1) Release of stored energy 2) Change of the work function of the metal or metal oxide 3) State of the internal stress 4) Formation of cracks 5) Exposing fresh metal surface 6) Change of surface roughness At the time we began with our ~ork, we became aware of the surface roughness studies by Endriz and Spicer 2, 3 at Stanford. They looked at the photostim-ulated yield on relatively smooth aluminum specimens with the rms roughness in the range of a few Angstroms to about 25 A. The yield changed-markedly over the <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> they had available. We thought that this was a very attractive idea and thus included this possibility in our list of mechanisms. Since we concentrated mostly on this roughness effect, let me briefly outline the Endriz and Spicer ideas. It is well known that oscillations of surface charges on the metals or alloys do exist. It is further possible to couple incident photons to the oscillations of surface charges if a grating exists on this surface. These oscillations can decay by transferring their energy to a single electron, ejecting it from the metal and contributing to the photoyield. This model may be described by the dispersion curves, shown in Fig. 1. The straight line in this figure represents the ~k curve for the incident radiation.

40|$|The 1 DV {{structure}} of turbulent oscillatory boundary layers throughout the full relative <b>roughness</b> <b>range</b> 0 < r/A < 1 and Reynolds numbers (Aω/v) up to 6 × 10 is investigated through experimental data, A is the free stream semi excursion, r the bed roughness, ω the angular frequency and v the kinematic viscosity. It is shown that smooth and rough flows alike can be scaled using the universal vertical scale z 1 = 2 v/ω+ 0. 0081 rA, which becomes the Stokes 2 ̆ 7 length 2 v/ω for smooth beds (r = 0) and 0. 09 rA for roughness dominated flows. Extraction of z and hence r from experimental data provides {{a method for}} determining the effective hydraulic roughness of live sand-beds under waves in analogy with the log-fit method for determining the r from the zero intercept, z = r/ 30 in steady flows. In fairly rough flows, e. g. over vortex ripples, the velocity structure is analogous to laminar flow and hence the eddy viscosity is constant with the value v = 0. 004 ωrA, corresponding to z 1 = 0. 09 rA= 2 vt/ω. In the opposite limit of vanishing roughness and high Reynolds numbers, z/A < 10, the velocity structure, which corresponds to von Karman 2 ̆ 7 s v = kuz, agrees reasonably with data. However, this asymptotic velocity structure deviates considerably from measurements through the naturally occurring r/A-range for sand beds. In the intermediate range 10 < r/A < 0. 06 the velocity structure {{does not seem to}} correspond to any real-valued, time invariant eddy viscosity. Comparison of the Kelvin function solution, which corresponds to v = κuz, with smooth and almost-smooth, high Reynolds number measurements, shows that, the optimal zero intercepts are not the steady flow values 0. 11 v/u respectively r/ 30, but generally significantly larger. For low-roughness, high-Reynolds number oscillatory flows (z/A < 0. 002), the magnitude of the velocity defect function universally follows |D| exp [-(z/z) ]. This 1 / 3 -power is interesting in that it has previously been shown to correspond maximum energy dissipation. In turbulent 2 ̆ 72 nd order Stokes flows 2 ̆ 7 the vertical boundary layer scale of the second harmonic is smaller than that of the primary, but by a factor smaller than 2, which applies in laminar flow.

All the samples have grain-like surface morphology {{with an average}} surface <b>roughness</b> <b>ranging</b> from 4 to 5  nm and an average grain size ranging from 13 to 16  nm. Zn 3 N 2 samples grown at lower N 2 /Ar ratio are polycrystalline with secondary phases of ZnO present, whereas at higher N 2 /Ar ratio, no ZnO phases were found. Highly aligned films were achieved at N 2 /Ar ratio of 0.60. Hall effect measurements reveal that films are n-type semiconductors, and the highest carrier concentration and Hall mobility was achieved for the films grown at N 2 /Ar ratio of 0.60. X-ray photoelectron study was performed to confirm the formation of Zn–N bonds and to study the presence of different species in the film. Depth profile XPS analyses of the films reveal that there is less nitrogen in {{the bulk of the}} film compared to the nitrogen {{on the surface of the}} film whereas more oxygen is present in the bulk of the films possibly occupying the nitrogen vacancies.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} with modular implants is that they begin to loosen over time. Implant loosening issue is of concern to physicians since implant revision surgery is an extremely difficult operation. A st able fixation between modular taper junctions is necessary to prevent motion and corrosion. There are many factors that can affect the loosening problem. This study aimed to determine the influence of surface roughness and taper angle on junction strength of modular biomedical implant in two different compression forces including 1500 N and 2500 N. The study was carried out on three different taper angles including 2 °, 4 ° and 6 ° and surface <b>roughness</b> <b>ranging</b> from 1 to 4. 18 μm, to keep track of changes in pull out force. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that taper angle and surface roughness affect the pull out force. The highest pull out force was observed at smoother surface roughness and tighter taper angles, declining gradually in rougher surf aces and drastically in wider taper angles. It can be inferred that implant s {{are less likely to be}} loosened in 1. 04 μm surface roughness and taper angle 2 ° considering the scope of experiments...|$|R
40|$|BADIALListeria monocytogenes is {{involved}} in food-borne illness with a high mortality rate. The persistence of the pathogen along the food chain {{can be associated with}} its ability to form biofilms on inert surfaces. While most of the phenotypes associated with biofilms are related to their spatial organization, most published data comparing biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes isolates are based on the quantitative crystal violet assay, which does not give access to structural information. Using a high-throughput confocal-imaging approach, the aim of this work was to decipher the structural diversity of biofilms formed by 96 L. monocytogenes strains isolated from various environments. Prior to large-scale analysis, an experimental design was created to improve L. monocytogenes biofilm formation in microscopic-grade microplates, with special emphasis on the growth medium composition. Microscopic analysis of biofilms formed under the selected conditions by the 96 isolates revealed only weak correlation between the genetic lineages of the isolates and the structural properties of the biofilms. However, a gradient in their geometric descriptors (biovolume, mean thickness, and <b>roughness),</b> <b>ranging</b> from flat multilayers to complex honeycomb-like structures, was shown. The dominant honeycomb-like morphotype was characterized by hollow voids hosting free-swimming cells and localized pockets containing mixtures of dead cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA) ...|$|R

A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, Floodarea was applied to simulate the flood inundation area and flood depth in Manas basin, China. Two scenes of Landsat TM images were also used in this research. One image was used to pro-duce the spatial distributed manning roughness to feed the model, {{the other one was}} used to delineate the actual inun-dated area by a modified NDWI method. The model and the manning roughness were validated by the comparison of simulated flood inundation extent and the corresponding actual inundated area obtained from Landsat image. The re-sults show that the actual inundation extent obtained from Landsat image was 240. 45 km 2, and the modeled inundation area was 276. 15 km 2. It indicates that manning <b>roughness</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0. 025 to 0. 833 is appropriate in the basin. In addition, the modeled flood depth varied from 0 to 7. 77 m. Taking land use into account, five hazard zones were identi-fied in the study area. This study would be beneficial to flood control and disaster reduction...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{achievable}} height of polymer structures produced by deep X-ray lithography has been increased from typically some hundred microns to several millimeters. The resist coating, irradiation and development processes were systematically analyzed and optimized. This enabled the fabrication {{of up to}} 3100 #mu#m high microstructures. The average peak-to-valley sidewall <b>roughness</b> <b>ranged</b> from 4. 5 nm to 20. 8 nm depending on the structure height. The different parameters of the single process steps mutually influence relevant properties like structure accuracy, side wall quality, and cracking of the resist. One major source of defects are the varying process temperatures: Decreasing the development temperature from standardly 37 C to 21 C reduces the thermically induced stress. Additionally, the contrast of the system PMMA-resist / GG-developer rises by 50 %. This lowers the susceptibility to cracking and enhances the structure accuracy. Applying highly crosslinked PMMA instead of the normally uncrosslinked resist further increases the contrast by 30 %. Atomic force measurements, scanning electron micrographs and {{the evaluation of the}} optical performance of test spectrometers validate the improved structure accuracy. (orig.) Dissertation by: S.
