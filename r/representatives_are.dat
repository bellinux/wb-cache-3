5|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance of a united, multiracial Parliament. In fact, minority <b>representatives</b> <b>are</b> required to vote according to their party line; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups. The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented.|$|E

5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less likely to lead to civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that <b>representatives</b> <b>are</b> forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E
