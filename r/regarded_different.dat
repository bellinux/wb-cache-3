In contention of composers' supposed indifference to instrumental timbres, Brown has also pointed out that as early as 1533, Pierre Attaignant was already marking some vocal arrangements as more suitable for certain groups of like instruments than for others. [...] Furthermore, Count Giovanni de' Bardi, host of a gathering of prominent 1580s scholars and artists known as the Florentine Camerata, was demonstrably aware of the timbral effects of different instruments and <b>regarded</b> <b>different</b> instruments as being suited to expressing particular moods.|$|E
50|$|In 1848 Carl Heinrich 'Bipontinus' Schultz {{described}} Schnittspahnia rueppellii, {{which he}} {{assigned to the}} Annonaceae, based on a specimen that was collected by Eduard Rüppell and Georg Wilhelm Schimper, from high elevations in the Semien Mountains in Ethiopia, and now reside in the Kew herbarium. Georg Carl Wilhelm Vatke realised this plant belonged to the Asteraceae, and renamed it to Landtia rueppellii in 1875. Karl August Otto Hoffmann thought the species should be assigned to the genus Arctotis, creating the new combination A. rueppellii in 1895. A plant collected by Ernest Edward Galpin on Mount Kinangop in the southern Aberdare Range of Kenya, and also kept at Kew, was <b>regarded</b> <b>different</b> enough by the very young John Hutchinson, who named it Landtia lobulata in 1914. Gustave Beauverd merged the genus Landtia with Haplocarpha, and created the new combination H. rueppellii in 1915. Later, in 1930, Hutchinson and Marion Beatrice Moss described a plant collected by Arthur Disbrowe Cotton on Mount Kilimanjaro, since stored at Kew, naming it Landtia kilimanjarica. All of these names are now regarded synonymous.|$|E

However, both two diseases are <b>regarded</b> <b>different</b> diseases since their mechanisms of development are quite different. Therefore, both two diseases require different assessment, monitoring, and pharmacological treatments.

The influence of diversified production programs with locally customized products and {{the relevance of the}} location of multiple sources in the network should be <b>regarded.</b> <b>Different</b> alternative measures for the reduction of CO 2 emissions in logistics should be evaluated and compared in terms of effectiveness, cost and realization potential. It might even prove that measures in areas not related to logistics are much more efficient in the reduction of CO 2 emissions. Also, dynamic simulation of logistics network’s behavior at fluctuating oil prices would provide further insight into benefits of network restructuring at high oil prices. For this purpose, the static model provides valuable results about oil price levels that are of concern for restructuring considerations.|$|E

The purpose of the thesis {{was to understand the}} activity system of using an integrated digital technology in a municipality’s school organization. The research questions <b>regarded</b> <b>different</b> perceptions between organizational levels, as well as contradictions in the activity system and the consequences of these contradictions. A qualitative approach was chosen, where interviews were conducted with seven personnel in the municipal school organization, both principals and development workers. In analyzes, an activity theoretical approach was used to expand the understanding of the activity system. Main findings included a detailed representation of perceptions of informants, as well as contradictions in the activity system. The contradictions were related to many components of the activity system with varying consequences to both organization and individual. Specifically, findings indicate that integrated digital technologies require certain institutional assumptions, and many difficulties and challenges are related to the intent of having many stakeholders of school organizations interacting in the same integrated technology...|$|E

This paper aimed at investigating perceived benefits of and barriers to exporting among small and medium sized non-exporting firms in Malawi. An investigation was also made into the extent to which managers regarded the achievement of some common business goals as important to their firms. Data was collected from 100 owner-managers of non-exporting small and medium sized firms in Malawi using a structured questionnaire. The findings of the study showed that managers regard steady growth of their firms, increased sales and profitability as well as development of new markets as very important. The managers agreed to the fact that exporting can significantly help their firms achieve their business goals. They however perceived many barriers to export involvement. The most important barrier was related to personnel problems, in that they felt that they lacked sufficient knowledge about export opportunities and personnel knowledgeable in exporting. Significant differences were found in the extent to which firms in the three industries studied, <b>regarded</b> <b>different</b> barriers as important. The findings of the study have wider implications on promotion of exports and these have been highlighted in the paper...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} cover the {{adoption}} of the concept in various instruments such as the Convention for the International sale of goods (CISG) in Article 7 (1), the UCC of the United States, UNIDROIT in article 1. 7, and the most important adoption on the European continent, the Principles of European Contract Law (PECL), specifically article 1 : 202 (1) and 1 : 106 (1) of the principles. The question that will be raised and probably answered {{in the course of this}} paper is whether, {{the adoption of the}} concept of good faith and fair dealing has made a difference in international commercial contracts, the extent of its contribution, the hindrances faced, whether such problems can be addressed, how they can be addressed and finally whether uniformity in interpretation and application of the doctrine is maintained. Under domestic law, the adoption of good faith and fair dealing notion into various legal systems and its implementation and enforcement thereof will be looked into, an attempt will be made to determine the main reasons why some states refuse to adopt the doctrine, and whether adoption of the doctrine in such states would make a substantial impact on their legal systems. Under the approaches adopted by various domestic legal systems in incorporating the doctrine into their laws, and in trying to deduce whether uniformity in interpretation and application of the doctrine can be attained, the jurisdictions that will be looked into are; German, which is a pioneer when it comes to the adoption of the doctrine within the European Union. The German Treu und Glauben provides for such, and has been included in the BGB (German Civil Code). In the provisions of the BGB, one is not only required to act reasonably, but there must be a relationship of trust based on the commercial dealings of the parties in a particular transaction. It has been noticed that most European countries, for instance France and Italy have this similar approach towards the concept of good faith and fair dealing, of course there are always minor differences in every legal system, and these will be highlighted. England of course is an exception, and in this paper it will be considered separately. It is <b>regarded</b> <b>different</b> due to its historical background, thus the doctrine in England is approached differently, and there are limitations in its application. In the United States the doctrine of good faith and fair dealing has been adopted through the Uniform Commercial Code, section 1 - 203. This section unfortunately does not apply to the formation or negotiation of the contract. Numerous other sections seem to refer to the doctrine, even the Second Restatement on Contracts does touch on the concept. In fact it is the most recent re-enactment of some of the provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code. In the United States the doctrine basically applies to performance and enforcement in contracts. English law reluctantly recognizes a general duty to act in good faith, it arrives at similar results as those arrived at by other countries when it comes to the implementation of the doctrine, even though the avenues used are different. The starting point in English Law was the judgment of Justice Steyn in Banque Financiere and of course the judgment of Sir Thomas Bingham in the Interfoto case. The cause started by these judges was later fueled by the unwavering support of the European Community. Before long it had become accepted that the doctrine could not be ignored anymore in England, and slowly its inception began. Even though the concept is legally accepted, it has not yet managed to get complete acceptance from the English legal fraternity, it is still approached and applied with caution. This paper intends to discuss the reasons for such slow progress of the concept in England, and further compare the position to that of other European states. In South Africa the doctrine of good faith has existed for quite sometime, mostly referred to as bonae fides, a doctrine which played a great role in the development of Roman contract law, and further influenced the development of the principle of equity in civil law. But this did not give the doctrine of good faith formal acceptance in the South African legal system, it has over the years been regarded as an elusive concept which could only destabilize well established legal rules. Most judges regard the doctrine as a threat to their views on freedom of contract being an absolute basis of the law of contract. The concept was accepted in a couple of instances, for instance, in Eerste Nasionale Bank van Suidelike Africa Bpk v Saayman in 1997, it was later dismissed in Brisley v Drotsky, where it was held that the doctrine could not be accepted as a basis to set aside or enforce a contractual relationship. This was confirmed in Afrox Healthcare Bpk v Strydom in 2002, it is now settled that in South Africa, the concept of good faith cannot be used in dealing with cases involving contractual unfairness that cannot be handled by pre existing rules, but public policy can. This work intends to follow up on the development of the concept of good faith in South Africa, and the reasons for its subsequent dismissal in Drotsky, not forgetting to outline the doctrine's future in the country's legal system and the effects of dismissing such doctrine...|$|E
