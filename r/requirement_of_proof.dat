40|$|Although {{much has}} been written {{on the history of the}} <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of crimes beyond a {{reasonable}} doubt, this is the first study to probe the history of its civil counterpart, proof by a preponderance of the evidence. It turns out that the criminal standard did not diverge from a preexisting civil standard, but vice versa. Only in the late eighteenth century, after lawyers and judges began speaking of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, did references to the preponderance standard begin to appear. Moreover, U. S. judges did not start to instruct juries about the preponderance standard until the mid-nineteenth century, and English judges not until after that. The article explores these developments and their causes with the help of published trial transcripts and newspaper reports that have only recently become accessible.

40|$|Technology killed slander. Slander, the tort of {{defamation}} by spoken word, {{dates back}} to the ecclesiastical law of the Middle Ages and its determination that damning someone’s reputation in the village square was worthy of pecuniary damage. Communication in the Twitter Age has torn asunder the traditional notions of person-to-person communication. Text messaging, tweeting and other new channels of personal exchange have led one of our oldest torts to its historic demise. At common law, slander was reserved for defamation by speech; libel was actionable for the printed word. This distinction between libel and slander, however, rests on a historical reality that is no longer accurate. Originally, permanence and breadth of dissemination always coincided. Slander carried only as far as one’s voice. Because of slander’s presumed evanescence, common law required plaintiffs to plead special damages—proof of economic harm—in order to recover for slander. The advent of broadcast technology, with its ability to amplify the spoken word, challenged the traditional division of defamation and forced courts and legislatures to reconsider old classifications. Jurisdictions split in their decision to characterize broadcast speech as libel or slander, largely because of divergent views about which aspect of the speech—permanence or breadth of dissemination—was more important. Post-broadcast technology has further complicated the defamation arena, leaving parties unsure of how best to plead their defamation case. In the past decade technology has again changed the way we communicate. The digital communication revolution has created instances of widespread dissemination through quick, nonreflective and often passing statements. This past year, for example, Wael Ghonim’s tweet to join him in an Egyptian village square lead to the downfall of Egypt’s political powers. His fleeting comments to those willing to listen caused an entire nation to fall. This Article considers how courts should rule when these tweets, or text messages, not quite printed, not quite spoken, are defamatory. This Article argues that the advent of text messaging, tweeting and other forms of digital communication, which I call “technospeech,” renders the medieval tort of slander irrelevant in today’s technological world. The article provides new support for the contention that courts and legislatures should treat libel and slander uniformly and should abolish the archaic <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of special damages, a burden traditionally reserved for the spoken word. Maintaining slander in the Twitter Age, with its <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> of economic harm, vitiates the common law purpose of defamation. Treating all defamation similarly promotes fairness for plaintiffs seeking to rehabilitate their damaged reputation and provides predictability to those bringing defamation claims. A thoughtful and orderly treatment of technospeech mandates that courts and legislatures put the proverbial final nail in the coffin of slander...|$|E
40|$|To take {{provocation}} at {{face value}} is to plead and prove it as a manslaughter offense, as it is defined in most criminal codes. To do {{this seems to be}} both unnecessary and impossible. The defendant has the best access to evidence of provocation and will benefit from the proof of this partial defense, so why should he not be required to prove it? The prosecution has no incentive to prove provocation manslaughter because the definition of this offense includes a murder. Why would the prosecution, having proved a murder, set out to prove a lesser crime than the crime for which it already has a conviction? However, this Article will demonstrate that normative theory obligates us to treat provocation manslaughter as an offense, and {{that it is possible to}} do this as a practical matter. The argument is a conceptual argument in the normative theory of punishment. The best theoretical description of provocation manslaughter is as an offense, and not as a partial justification defense or as a partial excuse premised on a partial loss of responsible agency. Once we distinguish three things that are usually conflated—intentions, intentional actions, and intent elements—we can see that provocation manslaughter depends on proof of a particular intentional act of killing, and that this proof brings a particular set of the defendant’s intentions to the fore for purposes of determining his desert for punishment. This set of intentions is different from the set of intentions that proof of a killing with intent, murder, brings to the fore for purposes of determining desert. Regardless of any reference to an intent to kill in the definition of provocation manslaughter, this kind of manslaughter is logically and normatively different from, and exclusive of, murder—in just the same way that reckless manslaughter is. If reckless manslaughter is an offense, then provocation manslaughter is an offense as well—and should be proved as one—because there is no conceptual difference between the two kinds of manslaughter, relative to the other homicides. This Article shows how we can treat provocation manslaughter as an offense as a practical matter. We should adopt a set of rules that provide discovery to the prosecution, that obligate it to make a prima facie case on pain of a mistrial and bar to reprosecution, and that reverse the ordinary order of jury deliberations so that provocation manslaughter is considered first and murder is considered second—or not at all, if the jury has convicted the defendant of provocation manslaughter. These rules will provide an incentive for the prosecution to prove provocation manslaughter and a disincentive to sandbagging that proof in an attempt to obtain a murder conviction instead. More importantly, the proposed rules enable us to live up to our rule of law ideals—including the principle of lenity as well as the <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> beyond a reasonable doubt—in a way that treating provocation as a partial defense does not. If we take provocation {{at face value}}, then we can better preserve criminal law’s constitutional principles, theoretical consistency, and moral integrity...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] “The {{prosecution}} {{must prove}} every {{element of the}} crime {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} for a valid conviction. The Constitution nowhere explicitly contains this requirement, but the Supreme Court in In re Winship 1 stated that due process commands it. Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, noted that the Court had often assumed that the standard existed, that it {{played a central role in}} American criminal justice by lessening the chances of mistaken convictions, and that it was essential for instilling community respect in criminal enforcement. The reasonable doubt standard is fundamental because it makes guilty verdicts more difficult. As Winship said, the requirement “protects the accused against conviction.... ” Justice Harlan’s eloquent concurring opinion in Winship elaborated by noting that “a standard of proof represents an attempt to instruct the factfinder concerning the degree of confidence our society thinks he should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication. ” Incorrect factual conclusions can lead either to the acquittal of a guilty person or the conviction of an innocent one. “Because the standard of proof affects the comparative frequency of these two types of erroneous outcomes, the choice of the standard to be applied in a particular kind of litigation should, in a rational world, reflect an assessment of the comparative social disutility of each. ” Society views the harm of convicting the innocent as much greater than that of acquitting the guilty. Thus, Harlan concluded, “I view the <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal cased as bottomed on a fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free. ” The reasonable doubt standard was constitutionalized because of the societal function it now serves. Winship did not find it constitutionally required because the original meaning of a constitutional provision required it. Indeed, the Court indicated that the standard had not fully crystalized until after the Constitution was adopted. Even so, the reasonable doubt standard provides a fertile field for examining the methodology of finding the original meaning of constitutional criminal procedure rights. First, its status seems secure No debate questions the constitutional requirement that an accused can only be convicted if the crime is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Its original meaning can be explored uncolored by the partisanship often engendered when present seekers of original meaning hope to define a new contour to a constitutional guarantee. Furthermore, serious scholars have studied the reasonable doubt standard’s early development and its original meaning, purposes, and intent. An examination of those scholarly sources, methods, and conclusions provides a number of valuable insights that should affect the search for finding the original meaning of other American criminal procedure guarantees. These are first that the seeker of original meaning of evolved criminal procedure rights has to go beyond traditional legal sources and explore the broader epistemological developments in religion, philosophy, and science that affected the development of the right. Second, conclusions about original meaning drawn primarily from English and other European sources can be misleading without a consideration of American developments. What might seem like a sound conclusion when English sources are examined may look suspect when viewed in the light of American developments. Finally, the reasonable doubt scholarship reveals that definitive conclusions about the original meaning of American constitutional rights will often be impossible to find both because the necessary American record is absent and because evolved rights never really had a definitive original meaning. The starting point here is with the scholars who have concluded that the original purpose of the reasonable doubt standard was not, as the Court now has it, to protect the accused, but instead emerged to make convictions easier. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} native title has the {{potential}} to be an empowering process, but that achieving this requires a clear and economically valuable property right that supports Indigenous governance and traditions and long term prosperity. Introduction The 20 th anniversary of the commencement of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (‘NTA’), the legislative response to the High Court’s recognition of native title in Mabo v Queensland [No. 2] (1992) (‘Mabo’), passed in December 2012 with little fanfare. The Commonwealth response was designed to recognise and protect native title from abrogation by the states, as well as to create an orderly system for the identification of where native title might exist, to determine how native title would be dealt with in the future, and to resolve any implications that recognition may have on other titles and interests. Among the largely procedural provisions of the NTA, the definition of native title in section 223 has come to be understood as setting the parameters for the <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> as to whether native title exists. This specific section of the NTA has been a focus of jurisprudence in the courts, as well as a source of contention in public commentary on the perceived injustices and complexities of the native title system. Section 223, in part, sets the terms for native title groups and government entering into settlement negotiations, and casts a long shadow over negotiations. By defining native title, section 223 sets the requirements for proving native title and the High Court has said that this is where the inquiry must start if the end sought is a determination that native title exists. In 2014, section 223 of the NTA will again be at the centre of public policy and legal scrutiny as the Australian Law Reform Commission (‘ALRC’) holds an inquiry into, among other things, the requirements of connection ‘relating to the recognition and scope of native title rights and interests’. The ALRC inquiry builds upon a long debate about ways in which the requirements of proof could be reformed, including two private members bills introduced to the Parliament; the most recent in 2013. In particular, the ALRC has been asked to consider various proposals including: 	a presumption of continuity of acknowledgement and observance of traditional laws and customs and connection; 	clarification of the meaning of ‘traditional’ to allow for the evolution and adaptation of culture and recognition of ‘native title rights and interests’; 	clarification that ‘native title rights and interests’ can include rights and interests of a commercial nature; 	confirmation that ‘connection with the land and waters’ does not require physical occupation or continued or recent use; and 	empowerment of courts to disregard substantial interruption or change in continuity of acknowledgement and observance of traditional laws and customs where it is in the interests of justice to do so. As may be evident from this list, the limitations of section 223 have been criticised, not necessarily because of the terms of the definition, but because of the way they have been interpreted and applied. This article focuses on four key limitations that should underpin the ALRC inquiry: 	Section 223 as a statutory definition separates native title negotiation and judicial reasoning from the common law history and principles of justice, including international and comparative law. 	Section 223 has been interpreted by the courts as requiring an unnecessarily complex and high benchmark for proving native title. 	The narrow and reductive interpretation of native title rights, when combined with section 225 has negatively impacted on the scope of the enjoyment of native title. 	The courts’ interpretations have unnecessarily been relied upon by state governments in negotiating consent determinations (under the shield of section 87), and the flexibility of the law has been underutilised...|$|E

Despite heavy criticism that came down on the Constitutional Court for what was seen by law enforcement agents as unwarranted judicial activism, the Russian Parliament soon amended the article in line with the interpretation offered by the Court. This, however, did not end the controversy as critics raised a valid point: an automatic transfer of facts from civil proceedings with a priori more lenient <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> is likely to distort outcomes, harming defendants, the prosecution, and, ultimately, societal interests.
