40|$|A {{technique}} for obtaining accurate, high (spatial) resolution measurements of sediment redeposition levels is described. In certain regimes, the method {{may also be}} employed to provide measurements of sediment layer thickness {{as a function of}} time. The method uses a uniform light source placed beneath the layer, consisting of transparent particles, so that the intensity of light at a point {{on the surface of the}} layer can be related to the depth of particles at that point. A set of experiments, using the impact of a vortex ring with a glass ballotini particle layer as the <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanism,</b> are described to test and illustrate the technique...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a novel technique for obtaining accurate, high (spatial) resolution measurements of sediment redeposition levels. A sequence of different random patterns are projected onto a sediment layer and captured using a high-resolution camera, producing {{a set of}} reference images. The same patterns are used to obtain a corresponding sequence of deformed images after a region of the sediment layer has been displaced and redeposited, allowing {{the use of a}} high-accuracy pattern matching algorithm to quantify the distribution of the redeposited sediment. A set of experiments using the impact of a vortex ring with a glass ballotini particle layer as the <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanism</b> are described to test and illustrate the technique. The accuracy of the procedure is assessed using a known crater profile, manufactured to simulate the features of the craters observed in the experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{collision}} of a rigid {{body with a}} layer of dust may dislodge and resuspend the dust particles through two distinct mechanisms: a ballistic mechanism, where kinetic energy is transferred from the impacting body to the dust particles through direct contact, and a hydrodynamic mechanism, where the flow disturbance generated by the body moving towards or away from the wall is responsible for resuspending the dust. We present a study of the hydrodynamic <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanism</b> by considering the flow around a sphere moving with a constant velocity towards a wall and comes impulsively to rest on making contact with the wall. We examine the rôle this flow plays in resuspending a layer of dust. The experiments were performed using a sphere moving perpendicular to the wall for Reynolds numbers, Re, in the range 300 to 3500. A wider range of Re was investigated by releasing dense rigid spheres above the wall. The flow generated by the sphere impacting the wall, and the ability of this to dislodge and resuspend a layer of dust is reported. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this chapter is twofold. First, it provides a general overview of the Eulerian-Lagrangian modelling approach to the numerical simulation of turbulent dispersed flows in the point-particle limit. Second it reviews the phenomenology of particle deposition and resuspension in wall-bounded turbulence as brought to light by Eulerian-Lagrangian studies {{over the last two}} decades. Specific interest is devoted to the case of inertial particles, which are ubiquitous in environmental and industrial flow-systems. Effects due to particle shape on deposition and <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> as well as on numerical modelling are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Deposition and <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in particle-laden {{turbulent}} flows {{are dominated}} by the coherent structures arising in the wall region. These turbulent structures, which control the turbulent regeneration cycles, {{are affected by the}} roughness of the wall. The particle-laden turbulent flow in a channel bounded by irregular two-dimensional rough surfaces is analysed. The behaviour of dilute dispersions of heavy particles is analysed using direct numerical simulations (DNS) to calculate the three-dimensional turbulent flow and Lagrangian tracking to describe the turbophoretic effect associated with two-phase turbulent flows in a complex wallbounded domain. Turbophoresis is investigated in a quantitative way {{as a function of the}} particle inertia. The analysis of the particle statistics, in term of mean particle concentration and probability density function (p. d. f.) of wall-normal particle velocity, shows that the wall roughness produces a completely different scenario compared to the classical smooth wall. The effect of the wall roughness on the particle mass flux is shown for six particle populations having different inertia...|$|R
40|$|Resuspension of {{deposited}} pathogen-laden expiratory aerosols from solid surfaces {{can occur}} in indoor environments when disturbed by air turbulence or human activities, such as walking or cleaning. The viable pathogens can then be airborne again and thus pose additional risk to susceptible people. However, this infection risk is always underestimated because of the incomplete understanding of infectious particle resuspension. In this preliminary study, the adhesive forces of expiratory droplets on different common indoor surfaces were measured using the centrifugal technique. Droplets generated by a monodispersive droplet generator were evenly loaded to surfaces of different materials. The resuspension rate was calculated according to the initial number of droplets on the samples {{and the number of}} droplets at different rotating speeds. The dependence of resuspension rate on the floor materials was observed. This study provides {{a better understanding of the}} <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of expiratory particles from indoor surfaces and the results can supplement risk assessment of airborne infectious diseases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMetallic {{contents}} (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) of {{suspended solids}} (SS) were measured in two sites (Suresnes and Chatou) {{in the river}} Seine, downstream Paris, during three summer periods. These two sites, which are respectively located downstream and upstream {{two of the most}} important combined sewer overflows (CSO's) of the Parisian sewer system (Clichy and La Briche), allow us to assess these CSO immediate impacts. Samples were collected using sediment traps, weekly during dry weather and daily during the week following the major CSO's events. The heavy metal concentrations, relatively large but stable during summer periods, were shown to further increase downstream Paris after main rain discharges occurred. Metal concentrations measured within the Seine SS during rain events, allowed us to establish that the observable immediate impact of Clichy overflows is only 5 % of what it could be. The general principle demonstrated through this work is that most SS originating from CSO's rapidly settle once they reach the river. These polluted particles greatly contribute to the SS chronic pollution downstream Paris during dry weather, through a slow <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the deposited sediments...|$|E
40|$|Circulation {{patterns}} and sediment dynamics were studied over the Gulf of Valencia (GoV) continental slope during spring and winter 2011 – 2012. Two moorings were deployed at two locations; at 450 m depth from February to May 2011, and at 572 m depth from October 2011 to February 2012. At both mooring sites, observations {{were made of}} currents, temperature and near-bottom turbidity within the lowermost 80 m above the seafloor. The temperature measurements allowed distinction of the different water masses and their temporal evolution. The fluctuations of {{the boundary between the}} Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) and the Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) masses were monitored, and several intrusions of Western Mediterranean Intermediate Water (WIW) were observed, generally coinciding with changes in current direction. At both mooring sites, the currents generally maintained low velocities 20 cm s- 1, and few reaching up to 35 cm s- 1, associated with mesoscale eddies and topographic waves. The current direction was mainly towards the SSE on the first deployment and to the ESE on the second deployment. This second location was affected by a strong bottom offshore veering presumably generated by local topographic effects. Increases in suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were observed repeatedly throughout the records, reaching values > 3 mg l- 1. However, these SSC variations were uncorrelated with changes in velocity magnitude and direction and/or with temperature oscillations. Results presented in this paper highlight the complex relation between the hydrodynamics and sediment transport over the GoV continental slope, and suggest that other potential sediment <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanism</b> not linked with current fluctuations, might {{play a key role in}} the present-day sedimentary dynamics.

40|$|Symposium on Integrating New Advances in Mediterranean Oceanography and Marine Biology, 26 - 29 November 2013, Institut de Ciències del Mar (CSIC), Barcelona, Catalunya, SpainStudies of hydrodynamics and {{particulate}} matter distribution on the NW Mediterranean have described nepheloid layers on the continental shelf and slope, suggesting that these layers could be generated and/or {{maintained by the}} interaction of internal waves with the seafloor. On the Gulf of Valencia (GoV) continental slope several intermediate (INL) and bottom (BNL) nepheloid layers were observed, focussed where the Levantine Intermediate Waters (LIW) interacts with the seafloor. Additionally, direct observations of internal waves have been recently recorded on the GoV slope. The present study has the intention to improve the understanding on the hydrographic structure and the regional circulation of the GoV and discuss the relation with the sediment dynamics on the continental slope. Two instrument moorings were deployed from February to June 2011 and from October 2011 to March 2012, on the GoV continental slope, at 450 m and 572 m water depth, respectively. The slope morphology was considered to locate the mooring lines, which were deployed on structural heights to avoid interfering with the bottom trawling activities from the local fishing fleets. Direct observations of current velocity components and temperature allowed detecting several water mass types on the sampled water column. The interface between the LIW and the Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) was observed on the two mooring lines and appear {{to be controlled by}} 5 - 11 day oscillation linked to the passage of topographic waves. Several intrusions of cold Western Mediterranean Intermediate Water (WIW) mass were observed in both records, coinciding with changes in the current speed and direction. During the second deployment, the near-bottom currents were affected by a strong Ekman veering, contributing to the off-margin sediment transport near the sea floor. Observations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) showed multiple increases, up to 5 mg/l, in the near-bottom turbidity throughout the records. However, these SSC variations were poorly correlated with changes in velocity magnitude and direction or with temperature oscillations. In addition, no resuspension peaks were observed linked to the presence of internal waves. These results suggest that other potential sediment <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanism</b> unrelated with current fluctuations might play an important key in the present-day sedimentary dynamics. Bottom trawling appears to be the most plausible mechanismPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} particle size distributions (PSD) of aerosol of powdery building materials {{commonly used in}} construction work (cement, chalk, clay, wood sawdust, wood grinding dust, gypsum, hydrated lime, masonry grout, quartz sand, sand and structural lime) by two aerosolization methods: fluidization and gravitation. Fluidization and gravitation methods represent industrial activities such as pneumotransportation and unloading. Both particle <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been modelled in laboratory conditions. The particle size distributions of resuspended particulate matter from powdery building materials were rather similar identified by both fluidization and gravitation methods, with an exception of wood sawdust and sand. The PM 10 fraction ranged between 30 % and 87 %, PM 2. 5 from 7 % to 28 % and PM 1. 0 from 3 % to 7 % of the total mass of particulate matter. The highest PM 10 /PM total ratio was calculated for masonry grout - 0. 87, and the lowest ratio for quartz sand - 0. 30. The highest ratio of PM 2. 5 /PM total was calculated for sand - 0. 23, the lowest for quartz sand - 0. 07. Substantial quantities of PM 2. 5 {{were found to be}} emitted implying a potential threat to human health. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of inertial particles in turbulent flows is highly non-uniform and {{is driven by}} the local dynamics of the turbulent structures of the underlying carrier flow field. In the specific context of dilute particle-laden wall-bounded flows, deposition and <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are dominated by the interaction between inertial particles and coherent turbulent structures characteristic of the wall region. The macroscopic behavior of these two-phase systems is influenced by particle inertia, which plays a role at the microscale of a single dispersed element. These turbulent structures, which control the turbulent regeneration cycles, are strongly affected by the wall roughness. The effect of the roughness on turbulent transport in dilute suspension has been still poorly investigated. The issue is discussed here by addressing direct numerical simulation (DNS), at friction Reynolds number Ret = 18 0, of a dilute dispersion of heavy particles in a turbulent channel flow, spanning two orders of magnitude of particle inertia. The irregular wall roughness is obtained through the superimposition of four sinusoidal functions of different wavelengths and random amplitudes. We use DNS combined with Lagrangian particle tracking to characterize t h e effect of inertia on particle preferential accumulation, looking at the effect of roughness on particle distribution, by comparing the statistics computed for fluid and particles of different size and observing differences in terms of distribution patterns and preferential sampling...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of sediment-bound metals (Cs, Cu, Ni, Pb, Ti and Zn) were studied off the Tet River (western Gulf of Lion), a typical Mediterranean coastal river punctuated by short and violent flash-floods. Spatial and temporal sampling strategies were combined to elucidate {{the fate of}} these elements in response to both the riverine sediment input and the offshore transport of these sediments through hydrodynamics. Our results show the temporal entrapment of riverborne particles and associated metals, consecutively to a major flood event, in the nearshore sedimentary unit called prodelta. Here, deposition and <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> define a sedimentological cycle that could be followed completely in this study. In terms of speciation between reactive (labile) and residual fractions along the fluvio-deltaic continuum, our results show that Cu, Pb and Zn are the most labile (potentially mobile) metals in the river, {{in accordance with their}} contributions from anthropogenic sources. But in the marine surficial sediments, two main behaviours can be discriminated when compared to the riverine suspended particulate matter. While Pb and Zn depict rather a constant labile fraction, Cu is characterized by decreasing levels (up to 50 % difference). In terms of environmental impact, these contrasting trends have direct repercussions for the contaminant dispersal in the coastal area. Whereas Pb and Zn conserve their enhanced levels because of their stronger affinity with fine sediments, Cu is marked by the entire loss of its anthropogenic component that is progressively transferred to the dissolved phase, likely mediated by organic ligands. We ascribe these behaviours to different post-depositional partition mechanisms with respect to oxidation of the particulate organic phase at the bottom sediment/water interface. Also, analysis of one sediment core from the prodelta indicates that these early diagenetic processes govern the chemical forms of land-derived contaminants sequestrated in the nearshore sedimentary archives.

40|$|The Sahelian {{region is}} {{characterized}} by significant variations in precipitation, impacting water quantity and quality. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has {{a significant impact on}} inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD 09 GQ, MYD 09 GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R 2 = 0. 70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in January‒March; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April–May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27 % in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were performed in order to investigate how fine particles are resuspended from a surface once they are adhered to the surface through van der Waals interactions. Model spherical particles were generated, deposited on well- characterized substrates, and exposed to various types of forces. Impulsive forces were applied to the particles using impacting particles and impinging shock waves, and steady shearing forces were applied by impinging gas jets and a laminar channel flow. In each case, the threshold conditions to resuspension were determined by optically monitoring particle removal from the substrate. Particles of various size and material properties were considered. Resuspension thresholds were reproducible and unambiguous in the model experiments. The threshold to resuspension of the model spheres exposed to impinging gas jets was evidenced by abrupt changes in removal efficiency at specific locations. An analytical method to solve the flow field produced by an impinging jet was developed in order to calculate the shear stress experienced by the particles at the threshold locations. An inviscid model of normal jet impingement provided the free stream conditions for the ensuing boundary layer analysis. Calculated shear stress distributions using the model agree with previous measurements. Theoretical descriptions of the <b>resuspension</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were inferred from the observed resuspension thresholds. Such an undertaking involves the combination of existing equilibrium adhesion models and the kinetics of aerodynamic or particle collisional interactions. Resuspension models based on equilibrium adhesion theories did not accurately describe the observed size dependence of threshold applied shear stress, or the effect on resuspension of force duration. A kinetic model was developed to qualitatively describe these observed trends. The particle removal techniques were applied to a study of particle sampling from explosive fingerprint transfer deposits and fingerprint simulations. A crude sampling system consisting of an impinging gas jet and a suction tube/filter assembly was calibrated with model composite spheres made from a mixture of polystyrene and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene. Observed removal and collection efficiencies {{were related to the}} results of the model experiments. It was found that calibrated sampling systems could be used effectively to test the accuracy of fingerprint simulations. ...|$|R
40|$|We present high-resolution, two- and {{three-dimensional}} direct numerical {{simulations of}} laboratory-scale, fully nonlinear internal solitary waves of elevation shoaling onto {{and over a}} small-amplitude shelf. The three-dimensional, mapped coordinate, spectral collocation method used for the simulations allows for accurate modelling of both the shoaling waves and the bottom boundary layer. We focus on wave-induced instabilities during the shoaling and de-shoaling processes. The shoaling of the waves {{is characterized by the}} formation of a quasi-trapped core which undergoes a spatially growing stratified shear instability at its edge and a lobe-cleft instability in its nose. Both of these instabilities develop and three-dimensionalize concurrently, leading to strong bottom shear stress. During the de-shoaling process, the core breaks up and ejects fluid that forms a vortex-rich region near the down-sloping portion of the shelf. The flow in this region is highly turbulent and the bottom shear stress is extremely strong. Experiments with a corrugated bottom boundary are also performed. Boundary layer separation is found inside each of the corrugations during the wave’s shoaling process. Our analyses suggest that all of these wave-induced instabilities can lead to enhanced turbulence in the water column and increased shear stress on the bottom boundary. Through the generation and evolution of these instabilities, the shoaling and de-shoaling cycles of internal solitary waves of elevation are likely to provide systematic mechanisms for material mixing and sediment <b>resuspension.</b> These <b>mechanisms</b> have significant environmental implications on the near-coastal regions of the world’s oceans...|$|R
30|$|The aim {{of project}} house water is to {{investigate}} the environmental and socioeconomic impacts and risks of sediment-associated contaminants distributed during and after flood events through close co-operation between ecotoxicologists, hydrologists, water engineers, chemists, geoscientists, water economists, and sociologists to develop new interdisciplinary assessment and management strategies for the distribution of contaminated sediments during flood events. Pollutants enter the aquatic environment and the water cycle {{from a variety of}} anthropogenic sources, where they are transported, bound, deposited, and re-released (pathway) or interact with humans, animals, and plants (receptors). A source-pathway-receptor-evaluation allows for technological developments in order to remediate and manage released or bound substances during and after flood events. An integrated water resource management strategy is needed not only to maintain long-term sustainable water quality for both ecosystem and human health but to also protect one of our most important resources—water. The interdisciplinary collaboration of project house water will (i) provide more detailed information on the historic, current, and future sources, and sinks of contaminants in surface waters and sediments; (ii) provide insight into the processes affecting erosion, <b>resuspension,</b> and transport <b>mechanisms</b> of contaminated sediment during flood events; (iii) investigate the bioavailability and effects of contaminated sediments remobilization during flood events; (iv) assess and develop innovative and advanced technologies for the treatment of water affected during flood events; (v) establish a novel methodology for the evaluation of societal impacts from the distribution of contaminants during flood events and subsequent risk communication efforts; and (vi) determine the economic costs associated with societal and environmental impacts from flood events to contribute to a systematic improvement of surface waters {{within the context of the}} EU-WFD. These objectives will be achieved through the implementation of six “proof-of-concept” studies outlined later, which will be structured in such a way that researchers from different disciplines work together closely to attain the deliverables.|$|R
