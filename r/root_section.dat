40|$|The {{induction}} and reinduction of {{nitrate reductase}} in root tip or mature <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> show essentially a similar pattern: a lag, {{a period of}} rapid increase in enzyme activity and finally a period of relatively minor change. Both inductions are sensitive to 6 -methylpurine and cycloheximide. Kinetic studies with 6 -methylpurine suggest that the half-life of the messenger RNA for nitrate reductase in both sections is about 20 minutes. The rate of decay of nitrate reductase activity induced by transfer to a nitrate-free medium is slower in root tips (t½ = 3 hours) than in mature <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> (t½ = 2 hours). The enzyme from mature <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> is also less stable to mild heat treatments (27 C; 40 C) than the enzyme from <b>root</b> tip <b>sections.</b> The results indicate that factors regulating enzyme turnover show important changes as root cells mature and may be significant in determining steady state levels of the enzyme...|$|R

All categories of roots from always well watered plants, including mature tissues con-taining no apex, could synthesize ABA when dehydrated. Mature primary <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> and their previously associat-ed secondary roots accumulated less ABA in response to dehydration than the young primary roots and primary root tips did, and their ABA accumulation was not sub-stantial until dehydration was below 65 % of relative water content (RWC).

The ends of the roots were submerged in the nutrient reservoir, while the middle of the <b>root</b> <b>section</b> received nutrient mist and the upper portion was above the mist. Their results showed that dissolved O2 is essential to root formation, but went on to show that for the three O2 concentrations tested, the number of roots and root length were always greater in the central misted section than either the submersed section or the un-misted section. Even at the lowest concentration, the misted section rooted successfully.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{provided}} which decisively demonstrates that the Pisum Satiuum roots growing continuously in the inhibitory medium of 2, 4 -D and IAA become less sensitive to their inhibitory action and to the inhibitory action of the other growth substances (TIBA x CNB). The reduced sensitivity of IAA grown <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> to applied IAA may partly {{be due to the}} induced formation of the IAA-oxidizing enzymes which in fact lower the auxin level in the cells by oxidizing it. This, however, can not be the case with 2, 4 -D since {{there is no evidence that}} this compound can induce the formation of an adaptive oxidase. Furthermore, it has been found that IAA grown <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> are less sensitive to the inhibitory action of 2, 4 -D which can not be oxidized by the enzyme IAA-oxidase. It is therefore concluded that both IAA and 2, 4 -D induce basical changes in the constitution of the growth enzymes of the cells formed in their presence that they become less sensitive to their inhibitory action. As far as anti-auxins are concerned TIBA and DCA grown <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> also show much reduced sensitivity towards auxin IAA and this has been found to be explainablein the terms of the induced formation of adaptive oxidase already present. TIBA inhibition might be due to the increased destruction of endogenous auxin as the IAA <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> show less response to the inhibitory action of applied IAA. It is therefore suggested that the auxin in the normal <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> is at a sub-optimal level. Roots grown in the inhibitory medium of CNB show anincreased sensitivity towards applied IAA. There is alsono effect of CNB on the oxidase contents of roots grownin its solution. Furthermore, 2, 4 [...] -D grown <b>root</b> <b>sections</b> are less sensitive to the inhibitory action of CNBindicating a direct antagonism by 2, 4 [...] -D retained in their cells. The conclusion drawn from the above results is that IAA, 2, 4 -D, TIBA ana DCA reduce the sensitivity of the cells formed in their presence to their inhibitory action and to the inhibitory action of the other three. 2, 4 -D indicates a direct action on the growth system while IaA, TIBa and DCA may, in addition, cause an apparent loss of sensitivity to IAA by stimulating the production of oxidizing enzymes.

50|$|This {{patented}} {{aircraft wing}} design (StratosLiner 2014) comprises backward and forward swept aircraft wing sections in a decagonal box wing configuration, {{as well as}} a pair of middle wings. Both the backward swept front and the forward swept rear wings are divided into root and tip sections, wherein the tip sections of the front wings are more backward swept than the root sections, and the tip sections of the rear wings are more forward swept than the root sections. The middle wing is divided into a backward swept <b>root</b> <b>section</b> and two tip sections, one forward and another backward swept. The four wingtips on each side are interconnected by a wingtip fence, obtaining seven strong and stiff closed frame structures, as well as seven aerodynamic channels for the stream flow. The preferred embodiment has one third smaller wingspan compared to a conventional cantilever aircraft with the same wing area, making it possible to build very large airliners (1000+ passengers) still manageable for our airports. In addition to reasonability assessments, serious multidisciplinary evaluation must be carried out in order to verify the great number of claimed benefits.|$|E
50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the {{tensile stress at}} which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net <b>root</b> <b>section</b> of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength.
