5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main hall of the Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main hall of the Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket sets are connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket sets are testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{the stone}} masonry was {{repaired}} {{and the walls}} were reconstructed to match those that existed. Similarly, in 1937, more repairs were completed on the walls, including the corners, chemin de ronde, parapets in the southern facade; reconstruction of the stoneworks, chemin de ronde, vaulted arches on the southern and western facade; construction of the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> in the keep; construction of pavements and staircase, between the floors of the keep; replacement of the exterior gates; and excavations in the military square. This continued into 1938 with the reconstruction of walls to a state comparable to its original construction; the complete reconstruction of the southern barbican, including the consolidation of the crenelations, battlements and staircases to better resemble its original state.|$|E
25|$|The line {{continues}} north past Forwards Lookout {{and then}} passes Robb's Monument, a stone monolith {{east of the}} track. There is a timber trestle bridge at 29.93km, before Bridge 50 over Mervyn Creek at 30.18km, with steel girders on concrete piers. Barron Falls Station, between 30.65km and 30.82km, includes a modern platform, shelter shed and lookout over the Barron Falls, {{as well as a}} footbridge over the line {{at the south end of}} the station. The shelter shed has a similar timber <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> to the shelter at Stoney Creek Station, although it uses steel posts. The line continues along the west bank of the Barron River past the site of Hydro Station, to Jumrum Creek Bridge at 32.54km. This bridge has timber trestles at each end, with a central span of steel broad flanged beams between concrete piers.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} form of <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> is {{a common}} rafter <b>roof.</b> This <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> has nothing but rafters and a tie beam at the bottoms of the rafters. The {{next step in the}} development of <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> was to add a collar, called a collar beam roof. Collar beam roofs are suitable for spans up to around (4.5 meters).|$|R
50|$|A crown post is a {{compression}} member, a post, in <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> {{which carries}} a longitudinal beam called a crown plate. The crown plate in turn carries collar beams which help support and carry the rafters, thus collar beams are always found in crown post <b>roof</b> <b>framing.</b>|$|R

500|$|Simon Jenkins has {{described}} Little Moreton Hall as [...] "a feast of medieval carpentry", but the building technique is unremarkable for Cheshire {{houses of the}} period– an oak framework set on stone footings. Diagonal oak braces that create chevron and lozenge patterns adorn the façades. The herringbone pattern with quatrefoils present at the rear, which {{can also be seen}} at Haslington and Gawsworth Halls, is a typical feature of 15th-century work, while the lozenge patterns, continuous middle rail and lack of quatrefoils in the front façade are typical of 16th-century early Elizabethan work. The south range containing the gatehouse, the last to be completed, has lighter timbers with a greater variety of patterns. The timber frame is completed by rendered infill and Flemish bond brick, or windows. The windows contain 30,000 leaded panes known as quarries, set in patterns of squares, rectangles, lozenges, circles and triangles, complementing the decoration on the timber framing. Much of the original 16th-century glazing has survived and shows the colour variations typical of old glass. Old scratched graffiti is visible in places. The older parts of the <b>roof</b> <b>frame</b> are decorated, and the brickwork of some of the chimneys has diapering in blue brick.|$|E

40|$|The First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia is an {{historically}} significant building whose complex timber <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> {{system has}} exhibited large deflections. It is desired that these deflections be stopped or reversed by some method. A computer {{model of the}} framing system allows different design schemes to be "tried out" without altering the building itself. However, because the <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> system consists of truss-like structures on intersecting planes, coupled so as {{to work as a}} unit, previous two-dimensional modeling using the WOODFRAME structural analysis program has been unsuccessful. Three-dimensional modeling of the system is accomplished using ANSYS, with preliminary two- dimensional modeling performed using WOODFRAME. By altering the ANSYS model of the <b>roof</b> <b>framing</b> system, design configurations using metal tie rods are analyzed, and one such scheme is recommended as a method for halting the deflections of the church...|$|R
