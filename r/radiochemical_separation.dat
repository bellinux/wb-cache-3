5000|$|Essentially, if {{a nuclear}} {{material}} {{has been put}} through a refinement process to remove the daughter species, the time elapsed since purification can be [...] "back-calculated" [...] using <b>radiochemical</b> <b>separation</b> techniques in conjunction with analytical measurement of the existing parent-daughter ratios. For example, the α decay of 239Pu to 235U {{can be used as}} an example of this procedure. with the assumption of a perfect purification time T0 then there will be a linear relationship between the in-growth of 235U and time elapsed since purification. There are, however, various instances where the correlation is not as clear. This strategy may not apply when the parent-daughter pair achieve secular equilibrium very rapidly or when the half-life of the daughter nuclide is significantly shorter than the time that has elapsed since purification of the nuclear material, e.g. 237Np/233Pa. Another possible complication is if in environmental samples, non-equivalent metal/ion transport for parents and daughter species may complicate or invalidate the use of chronometric measurements. Special age-dating relationships exist, including the commonly employed 234U/230Th and 241Pu/241Am chronometers. In special circumstances, parent-granddaughter relationships can be used to elucidate the age of nuclear materials when the material is intentionally made to look older through the addition of daughter nuclides.|$|E

40|$|Alpha-particle {{spectrometry}} {{is routinely}} {{performed with the}} aim of measuring absolute activities, activity ratios between different alpha-emitting nuclides or decay data such as branching factors, alpha emission probabilities and relative half-lives. It is most commonly performed with ion-implanted silicon detectors. Strong features of the technique are the low background levels that can be achieved due to low sensitivity to other types of radiation, the intrinsic efficiency close to 1 which reduces the efficiency calculations to a geometrical problem and the uniqueness of the energy spectra for each alpha-decaying nuclide. The main challenge is the limitation to the attainable energy resolution, even with thin and homogenous sources, which causes alpha energy peaks to be partially unresolved due to their width and low-energy tailing. The spectral deconvolution often requires fitting of analytical functions to each peak in the alpha spectrum. True coincidence effects between alpha particles and subsequently emitted conversion electrons cause distortions of the alpha spectra which lead to significant changes in the apparent peak area ratios. Optimum energy resolution can only be achieved on very thin sources, which puts constraints on the source preparation techniques. <b>Radiochemical</b> <b>separations</b> may be needed to extract the alpha emitters from voluminous matrices and efficiency tracing is performed by adding in another isotope by known amounts.

This problem is especially severe for elements in groups 4 and 5 of the periodic table, where hydrolysis is present.
