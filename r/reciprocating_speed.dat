40|$|In the {{handling}} of bulk metals, it is common practice to use a sawing machine, such as a bandsaw or power hacksaw to reduce the workpiece to a manageable size for downstream processing. Recently, stationary power hacksaws have been replaced with more versatile portable electric reciprocating saws. These machines differ from bandsaws and power hacksaws {{in that they are}} portable, light-weight, and saw by rapidly reciprocating a blade over a short stroke length. In industrial applications, the speed of metal sawing is an important economic factor. The mechanics of metal sawing with traditional machines have been described in the literature, but virtually no research has been published on the mechanics of reciprocating sawing. Research was undertaken to describe metal sawing with reciprocating saws by the application of metal cutting mechanics. Cutting rates of metals with a reciprocating saw are dependent upon several process parameters, such as the applied pressure on the saw, the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>speed</b> of the saw blade, and the geometry of the cutting edges. An analytical model was developed to predict the cutting rate of metals with a reciprocating saw. Particular attention was placed on the sawing rates of steel due to their broad commercial usage. The analytical model for reciprocating sawing rates was compared to empirical studies of important process parameters. A wear model for the cutting edges of saw blade teeth was also derived. Using a Design of Experiments technique, a test matrix was developed to determine the significance of applied thrust force and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>speed</b> on cutting rates of steel. Results of analytical predictions from the newly developed sawing model and empirical data compared reasonably well...|$|E

In the present paper, parametric relationships have been developed between three input process parameters namely, <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>Speed,</b> Over-run, and Rotational speed and three response parameters i. e.

The two parts are agglutinated by adhesive which can keep a good insulation of the inlayer during the mechanical process.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} removing and smoothing a single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC) surface under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) solution. In this method, a SiC substrate was excited by UV irradiation that transmitted synthetic quartz, and then an oxide layer on the SiC substrate was formed by photochemical reaction. Simultaneously, hydroxyl radical (OH*) was generated by the decomposition of H 2 O 2 solution by UV irradiation. OH* {{plays an important role}} of oxidation of SiC surface. With these chemical reactions, oxide layer was effectively formed on the SiC surface. Finally, the oxide layer generated on a SiC substrate was chemically and/or mechanically removed by synthetic quartz and solutions. The polishing characteristics of this method were investigated by controlling the process parameters. Additionally, surface quality and removal depth were measured and evaluated by a phase-shift interference microscopy. Obtained results show that the surface morphology and the removal rate are strongly dependent on the existence of the UV irradiation. Moreover, it is shown that the removal characteristics of the SiC substrate depend on the process parameters such as the process time, <b>reciprocating</b> <b>speed,</b> and contact load. The processed surface has revealed that many scratches on the preprocessed surface were completely removed. The microroughness of the processed surface was improved to 0. 15 nm (Rms) and 1. 62 nm (p-v), respectively.

40|$|During recent years, {{legislation}} regarding {{emissions and}} fuel consumption levels for {{the automotive industry}} has become increasingly comprehensive. In order for automotive manufacturers to reach the demands, engine friction needs to be reduced. The cylinder liner {{is considered to be}} one of the most critical engine components regarding friction and high demands are put their surface texture. No process has been found to create efficient cylinder liners as good as honing. Honing is an abrasive process, using three simultaneous movements of abrasive stones to remove material and create grooves. Since honing is an abrasive process, analytical prediction of the process outcome is difficult. In order to describe the process, empirical modeling has to be applied. The objective of this thesis is to, by using design of experiments, understand the honing process in the cylinder liner manufacturing at Scania CV AB and identify key parameters in the process control connected to surface roughness. Furthermore, the aim is to find an optimal setting of the machine to produce the demanded surface texture. Through screening experiments, five parameters were found to be the most significant in the process. These parameters were then further investigated in an optimization test. The results of this test showed that the plateau honing step was of main importance for the resulting surface texture. The factors with the largest impact were the honing force and number of strokes used in this operation. The results also suggested that the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>speed</b> influences the surface parameters and can be used to decrease the core roughness of the surface without affecting the valley depth negatively. Due to high correlation between surface parameters, compromises need to be made in order to find an optimal setting...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{are perhaps the}} most ubiquitous power source in the modern world. Their heavy use in the vehicle industry and the current impetus to improve efficiency whilst reducing emissions means that OEMs are driving research to provide cleaner and 'greener' engines. Though significant effort is being channelled into teasing out improvements in thermodynamic Efficiency by such methods as pressure boosting and power management. the nature of an engine means many moving parts contribute to parasitic frictional loss. Of these interfaces. the reciprocating contacts between cylinder. piston rings and skirt are arguably subject to the most demanding tribological conditions within an engine. required to seal against the high temperature' combustion gases whilst supporting the large side loading inherent to the system. Given that the piston of an engine may perform this action hundreds of millions of times in its lifespan. the lubrication strategy and component design is of key importance in minimising wear frictional losses. Though the use of numerical simulation tools for improving design has seen significant growth as computational capabilities improve and provide cost advantages to full scale testing. robust validation methods are required to guide the development of the underlying models. The aim of this project was to assess the suitability of an ultrasonic method to monitor the condition of lubrication at the aforementioned contacts by measuring film thickness. Though various techniques involving optical and electrical principles have been employed in the past they generally require the cylinder of the engine to be penetrated and implementation. for the most part. is limited to the test cell. The results of investigations at the piston ring contact have shown that the ultrasonic technique can be used to measure lubricant film thickness and have shown the influence of cylinder pressure and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>speed.</b> Measurements correlate well with work by other authors using the alternative methods mentioned. giving confidence in the robustness of the method. Film measurements at the skirt have been also been successful. not only in quantifying the minimum films present. but also in detailing the profile of the film over its surface and enabling some of the secondary motions of the piston to be deduced. It has been shown that the ultrasonic technique offers the ability and freedom to measure film thickness within an operational engine whilst having the distinct advantage of limiting the degree structural modification required. It shows promise as a research tool and with further development. offers the potential to be incorporated into a lubricant monitoring and control System to help reduce friction losses and emissions.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to characterise piston ring lubrication in reciprocating test rigs and engines in terms of film thickness {{as a function of}} oil properties, <b>reciprocating</b> <b>speed</b> and load. A purpose-built test rig, which consists of a moving liner and a fixed piston ring, is used to measure the oil film thickness employing the capacitance and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques. The intensity of the fluorescent light measured as voltage is interpreted as film thickness through calibration. Ring profile fitting is being used as the standard calibration method, but also a dynamic technique has been proposed whereby a groove of known depth on a piston ring specimen is used to provide in-situ dynamic calibration, circumventing the uncertainties of oil film temperature and properties variation during the cycle. A micrometer based static calibration method is compared directly to the dynamic one. The power output of the fibres should be taken into account as well as background noise and resident voltage on the fluorescence detector. Extensive oil parametric studies have been conducted and oil film thickness, LIF, friction and oil film pressure measurements are presented and compared for different speed, load, temperature, lubricant type and piston-ring geometry. The goal of enhancing the repeatability of the parametric study was achieved through the different positioning of the capacitance transducer and through the increased rigidity of the simulation rig. Useful results were drawn and the effect of properties such as viscosity, viscosity index, HTHS, piston - ring curvature and ring "effective width" on film thickness, film pressure and friction could be determined. Viscosity remains an important factor. Oil flow visualisation using a CCD camera allowed observation of cavitation throughout the stroke through a glass liner. At mid-stroke the presence of string cavities was evident, whereas near the dead centres the initiation of cavitation was observed in the form of fern-shaped cavities at the diverging wedge of the piston ring specimen at all times. The cavities take the shape of ferns, grown ferns, fissures, strings and bubbles. The existence of the cavities, previously identified indirectly with the LIF technique, was further supported by measurements using a new aluminium liner which incorporates a miniature pressure transducer used for the first time for oil film pressure measurements and an optical fibre. The oil film pressure measurements provided further support to the interpretation of cavitation at different parts of the stroke. The transition between different cavitating conditions (from P vapour to P atm) previously identified in the minimum oil film thickness measurement signal was further supported by the addition of the glass liner and the pressure transducer. Eventually, an insight was obtained into the onset and development of cavitation in the piston assembly via the simulation test rig, which will encourage further efforts in modelling cavitation under a much wider range of operating conditions than those examined here. Engine testing under motoring conditions was conducted in a modified single cylinder engine with parts of the liner cut and fitted with quartz windows for visualisation experiments. Comparable cavity forms to the test rig were identified and an approach towards their formation is presented. It became clear that the numerous factors affecting the lubrication between the piston-rings and cylinder liner in the engine are giving a different picture compared to the single-ring test rig where the structures are more uniform and the transition fi-om one cavitation type to another is much clearer. The unavailability of the oil film pressure measurements for the engine, though, does not support as strongly the findings from imaging. The top compression ring operates under starved lubrication conditions. Oil droplets were captured by the camera emerging from the ring side clearances that contribute to oil transport. Higher magnification imaging gave further evidence and was compared with previous engine research on oil transport. The engine study was limited by the unclear images obtained from the CCD camera and the window size which on one hand has the required size for the fixture firing tests and on another is quite small to provide adequate information about the residence time of the cavities that were identified. Another limiting factor of the study regarding the simulation test rig is that it can only provide data for the case of atmospheric conditions. Imperial Users onll...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{referring}} to a vapor compression refrigeration plant subjected to a commercially available cold store, a control algorithm, based on the fuzzy logic and able to select the most suitable compressor speed in function of the cold store air temperature, is presented. The main aim is to evaluate the energy saving obtainable when the fuzzy algorithm, which continuously regulates the compressor speed by an inverter, is employed to control the compressor refrigeration capacity instead of the classical thermostatic control, which imposes on/off cycles on the compressor that works at the nominal frequency of 50 Hz. The variation of the <b>reciprocating</b> compressor <b>speed</b> is obtained by controlling the compressor electric motor supply current frequency in the range 30 – 50 Hz, as {{it is not possible}} to consider values smaller than 30 Hz because of the lubrication troubles due to the splash system.

Once the acoustic performance is analyzed, it is verified that the compressor running most {{part of the time}} at frequencies lower than the ones of the electric nets imply lower sound level for VSRC and, therefore, many home appliances manufacturers direct their use in the premium refrigerator models. Following a general market trend for comfort items, home appliances noise {{is becoming more and more}} important nowadays, implying even VSRCs demand acoustic improvements in order to reduce the sound level of the refrigerators. In such a scenario, this paper presents numerical and experimental studies carried out in an existing platform of variable speed compressors, identifying some sources and transmission paths associated to the overall sound level of the compressor itself and a representative refrigerator model. Based on the foreseen opportunities, a design optimization focusing on sources and paths is presented and, as a result, the acoustic performance of the new generation is compared to the performance of the current version of this variable speed compressor platform...|$|R
40|$|To {{shed light}} on the {{mechanisms}} with which surface texture improves the tribological performance of piston–liner contacts, we have measured the transient friction response as individual pockets pass through a reciprocating sliding contact. Tests were performed at different sliding speeds and results compared to those from a non-textured, reference specimen under different lubrication regimes. At low speed when the contact is in the boundary regime, friction force falls abruptly as each pocket leaves the contact zone, before gradually returning to an approximately steady-state value. This suggests that each pocket acts to temporarily increase the film thickness, which then decays to its non-textured value as oil is squeezed out. At higher speeds, friction is seen to reduce in a stepwise fashion, since the period between pockets being entrained is less than the time taken for the film to decay. In addition, friction results obtained when the contact is operating {{in the middle of the}} mixed regime point to a temporary film thickness collapse as the pocket enters the contact, and this agrees with recent modelling predictions. At higher speeds, the compound effect of successive pockets is to shift the contact to the right on Stribeck curve. These results imply that each pocket gives rise to an increase in film thickness that is both short-lived and small in magnitude (we estimate a few tens of nm). However, the resulting effect on friction can be significant (up to 82 % in this study) for two reasons: (1) provided the pocket frequency is sufficiently high, each successive pocket entrainment builds the film up without there being time for it to reduce back to its steady-state value; (2) when the contact is in the mixed regime, the Stribeck curve is at its steepest and friction is therefore most sensitive to film thickness changes. This has important practical implications in that pocket spacing on piston liners should be varied as a function of <b>reciprocating</b> sliding <b>speed...</b>|$|R
40|$|At {{the present}} time {{ignition}} by high tension electric spark is almost universal on high <b>speed</b> <b>reciprocating</b> internal combustion engines other than the compression ignition type. The growing demands for greater efficiency, higher specific power output and increasing speed range with the associated high compression pressures has made greater demands on the ignition system. The modern magneto and coil, having progressed from the early hot wire and hot tube ignition, {{have been developed to}} a high stage of efficiency, although other systems have been suggested. Improvements in performance have been noted with dual ignition and this system is standard on aircraft engines, although in this case improved performance is only a secondary consideration to safety. With dual ignition, one set of plugs is connected to the first magneto and the other set to the second magneto, the sparks occurring simultaneously at the two plugs. As a result explosion is propagated from two points in the cylinder. The sparking plugs are usually placed as apart as possible and it was Swaine who suggested that better results might be obtained with sparking plugs placed very close together. As far as the author is aware, no experimental work has been carried out along these lines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} alloying method {{process has been}} innovatively used to prepare Cu-Cr coating on the inner wall of steel pipe. The effect of the rotating speed on thickness, microhardness and friction coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating was investigated. The coating thickness was measured from all samples using optical microscope. The microhardness was analyzed by Digital Microhardness Tester. The friction coefficient was tested by high <b>speed</b> <b>reciprocating</b> friction testing machine. The {{results show that the}} coating thickness is 26, 29 and 31 µm at the rotating speed of 200, 250 and 300 rpm. The microhardness of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 200, 250 and 300 rpm are about 760, 780 and 830 Hv. The friction coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 200 rpm are about 0. 25, 0. 40 and 0. 38 at the frequencies of 3, 4 and 5 Hz. The friction coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 250 rpm are about 0. 30, 0. 29 and 0. 20 at the frequencies of 3, 4 and 5 Hz. The friction coefficient of the Cu-Cr coating prepared at 300 rpm are about 0. 10, 0. 13 and 0. 09 at the frequencies of 3, 4 and 5 Hz...|$|R
