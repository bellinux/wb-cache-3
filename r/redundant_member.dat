40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a new methodology for redundancy analysis of structural systems in general and truss bridges in particular. The proposed methodology depicts the required steps to build a block diagram, composed of members in series and parallel configuration, representing the structural system or the truss bridge. The proposed block diagram accounts for the system’s degree of redundancy and the possible amount of redundant members ’ combinations, in a parallel configuration, to be laid in series with the non-redundant members in the system. Multiple failure modes, related to the system’s components, are integrated in the structural system in a series system layout. General equations are then derived for the pre-failure and post-failure phases of the system’s reliability index and probability of failure. The post-failure phase is defined as the phase when a <b>redundant</b> <b>member</b> fails without causing the collapse of the system. The proposed methodology is then applied to a truss bridge. Ten cases are presented, representing the system’s health and its updated block diagram following modification of four lower chord members separately and the complete failure of six redundant members separately. The proposed methodology is applied on each case in order to categorize the truss bridge as a very redundant, redundant, or a nonredundant system. ...|$|E

To overcome this difficulty of searching for minimum weight, a method of arriving at lower bound solutions to pin connected structures, by means of prestressing their <b>redundant</b> <b>members</b> is presented. The method employs linear weight equations derived from equilibrium considerations and stress constraints. Prestressed structures allow the designer an additional degree of freedom; he may control not only {{the shape of the}} structure and its cross-sectional dimension but also the level of prestressing. The methodology of prestressing is derived and formulated for single and multiple loading conditions. Prestressing of various truss configurations and application to bridge truss design is performed to illustrate the advantage and efficiency of the method.

40|$|Proteases play an {{important}} role in regulating protein maturation, activity and life-time. The Clp protease system in Arabidopsis thaliana plastids accumulates at relatively high levels and consists of a proteolytic core and associated chaperones. The core is an assembly of five different catalytic ClpP subunits, four non-catalytic ClpR subunits, and two ClpS proteins with unknown function. ClpR,S are unique to photosynthetic organisms. Three ATP-dependent chaperones, ClpC 1,C 2,D, are expected to deliver substrates to the ClpPRS core. Control of Clp activity is not understood and Clp substrates are unknown. 	 	Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion Clp mutants were isolated and genotyped. Null mutants for ClpP 4,P 5 are embryo-lethal under both auto- and heterotrophic conditions. Mutants of ClpP 3,R 4 did not form seedlings under autotrophic conditions but developed albino seedlings under heterotrophic conditions, displaying limited greening under low light. Null mutants for the chaperones ClpC 1 and ClpD have pale-green and wild-type phenotypes, respectively. ClpP,R core subunits are likely essential, while there are redundancies in the ClpC,D subfamily. Two mutants with partial loss of gene expression for ClpR 1 and ClpR 2 (clpr 2 - 1) exhibited pale-green phenotypes, with clpr 2 - 1 having a stronger phenotype. 	ClpR 2 protein accumulation in clpr 2 - 1 chloroplasts was 5 -fold reduced, while the ClpPRS core was 3 -fold downregulated, suggesting an induction of core composition heterogeneity. Stromal chaperones were upregulated several fold and ClpC was recruited to the thylakoid membrane. Thylakoid protein homeostasis was unbalanced as deduced from increased accumulation of thylakoid proteases, plastoglobules, protein precursors and degradation products. Clpr 2 - 1 chloroplasts were smaller, with 30 % less thylakoids than wild-type. Clearly, ClpR 2 is not a <b>redundant</b> <b>member</b> of the Clp family and reduced CLPR 2 gene expression has adverse effects on plastid and plant development. 	A comparative proteome analysis using differential stable isotope labeling of clpr 2 - 1 and wild-type stroma identified 298 proteins, and 113 were quantified. The Calvin cycle was down-regulated, explaining the slower development of clpr 2 - 1. The most striking response was the high accumulation of the chloroplast protein translation machinery and chaperones. This suggests that the ClpPRS core complex may be involved in regulation of plastid gene expression, providing a first understanding of the functional role of the Clp family in plastids.

40|$|The {{transmission}} line (TL) tower {{is an important}} component in electrical network system. These towers consist of members (angle sections) and connections (bolted connections) plus foundation, which act together to resist externally applied loads. The latticed towers are used to support conductors in transmission network for transmission and distribution of electricity. These towers are constructed in large numbers all over the world. The connections in electric TL classical latticed towers are peculiar compared to other types of bolted connections in buildings and bridges because (i) the angle members are connected directly or through gusset plates with bolts, (ii) the eccentric application of load due to the non-coincidence of centroid axes of angle members near the connection and (iii) members are designed as beam column element to sustain tensile or compressive forces. Bearing type bolts are used in TL towers in preference to friction type bolts, because they (i) connect thin walled angle members, (ii) are easy to use for erection at all heights, (iii) can be galvanized, (iv) erosion of galvanizing can be remedied and (v) do not require skilled personnel for installation. However, these connections are subjected to reversal of stresses due to wind load. Damage in the bolted connections generally occur due to loosening of bolts due to stress reversals (Feenstra et al. (2005) [23). The damage induced after extreme wind and earthquake may lead to collapse of the whole tower. The failure of a TL tower results in power shut down, which has huge impact on national economy. Hence, the structural safety and reliable performance of these towers are extremely important. The design of TL tower is based on minimum weight philosophy. The TL towers are highly repetitive and therefore, their designs need to be commercially competitive. The TL tower design has the following deficiencies such as misappropriate design assumptions, deficit detailing, defects in material, errors in fabrication, force fitting of members during erection, variation in grade of bolts, improper gusset plate detailing, notch cutting of member, vocalization of bolt holes, etc. Hence, to check the design and detailing aspects of members along with bolted connections and to study the behavior of tower under complex loading conditions, the prototype testing of tower is made mandatory requirement in many countries throughout the world. The structural behavior of TL tower is determined from its deflection response. Thus, the full scale testing of the towers is the only way that one can counteract the un conservatism due to structural analysis. The premature failure of TL towers occurs during prototype testing due to deficiencies in joint detailing, uncertainties in framing eccentricity, force fitting of members, unequal force distribution in bolts and gusset plate connections, etc. To have better structural response of TL tower to be tested, there is need to develop reliable model for bolted connections in TL towers. The bolted connection model {{plays an important role in}} determining the deflection response and predicting the premature member buckling failure of TL towers. The issues related to prototype testing of full scale TL towers such as fabrication errors, force fitting and notch cutting of members, application of loads, joint and crossarm detailing are discussed. The need to develop bolt slip model to simulate the actual behaviour of bolted connection in TL towers is also discussed. The bolted connections in TL towers play an important role in determining its structural behavior. The angle members used in TL towers are subjected to bi-axial bending in addition to axial load. The slip will occur in the bolted connections, due to the provision 1. 5 mm bolt hole clearance. In the conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the bolted connections are modeled as pin joint assuming the axial load transfer. The deflection predicted from pin joint analysis in TL towers generally does not match with experimental results. The analytical and experimental deflection value varies in the range of 30 to 50 %. Hence, there is need to develop model to account bolt slip for accurate deflection and dynamic characteristic prediction of TL towers. Experimental and analytical investigations have been carried out to develop and validate bolt slip model for bolted connections in TL towers. All six degrees of freedom (both translational and rotational) have been considered to simulate the exact behaviour of bolted connections in TL towers. The model is developed based on experimental results of Ungkurapinan’s bolt slip model for axial stiffness. The rotational stiffness is formulated based on the component level experiment conducted on lap joint made of steel angle with single and double bolt subjected to tensile loading. The axial and rotational stiffness for different stages of bolt tightening is also formulated based on component level experimental investigation on lap joint. The proposed model is validated by comparing with experimental results at sub-structural level on full scale king post truss subjected to tensile loading. Further the bolt slip model is validated for different bolt tightening and failure prediction of TL tower sub panel subjected to tensile loading. Finally the proposed model is also validated for full scale TL tower for deflection prediction. NE NASTRAN, a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) software is used for analytical simulation and the load-deflection predictions, which are compared with the corresponding experimental results. The experimental and analytical results are in good agreement with each other. The steel pole structures are replacing the conventional lattice towers, because they have smaller plan dimension and occupy less space, when compared to lattice towers. The steel pole structures are dynamically sensitive structures and the determination of their natural frequency is extremely important. For the calculation of wind load through gust factor method, the preliminary estimation of natural frequency is required. Hence, the primary step involved in dynamic analysis is the evaluation of its natural frequency. Hence, a simplified model is proposed based on model order reduction technique for the evaluation of natural frequency of TL towers and steel pole structures. For the development of base line model to detect damage in TL towers, the natural frequency has to be updated. A semi empirical approach is proposed based on the deflection by using the proposed bolt slip model. The proposed approach of updating natural frequency is validated for different cases of member damage in TL tower sub panel, such as removal of tension, compression and hip bracing members. The transmission pole structures accumulate damage during their service life. Damage in these structures will cause a change in stiffness of the system and the physical properties of these structures, such as modal frequencies and mode shapes. Hence in the present study, the damage localization study based on modified modal strain energy approach is carried out for steel pole structures and the location of damage is identified correctly. To prevent premature failure of towers during its service life testing and failure analysis of TL towers is a mandatory requirement. In the present study, forensic failure investigation of a full scale TL tower due to deficient design of a <b>redundant</b> <b>member</b> is emphasized and the remedial measures are explained in detail. The stub failure of TL tower due to reduction in cross sectional area due to unfilled bolt hole is also discussed. To investigate the effect of unfilled bolt holes on the compression capacity of leg member, detailed FEA is carried out and compared with experimental results. The reason for failure of 9 m roof top communication tower due to <b>redundant</b> <b>member</b> deficiency is also discussed. The importance of guyed tower accessories in the guy rope design of 7 m roof top guyed pole structure is also investigated. Finally, failure investigation of compression bracing member, which has failed during testing of TL tower sub panel has been investigated. The failure load is predicted by using the proposed bolt slip model in the analysis. Thus the overall research contributions emerging from this thesis are, i) development of bolt slip model accounting for rotational stiffness, ii) development of direct method of damage detection for steel pole structures based on modified modal strain energy approach, iii) development of simplified model for prediction of natural frequency of TL tower and steel pole structures, iv) development of model updating technique through natural frequency based on semi-empirical approach and v) prediction of failure load for TL tower panel using the proposed bolt slip model...|$|E

LPS treatment differentially up-regulated expression of the peptides and receptors. Among the three peptides, IMD mRNA content was lowest both in primary rat AMφ and NR 8383 cells, whereas IMD peptide dominated in basal and LPS-stimulated secretion from NR 8383 cells. Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis and TNF-α production were inhibited by AM, IMD, and CGRP, whereas pro-IL- 1 β mRNA was slightly down-regulated exclusively by CGRP. Neither of these peptides affected IL- 6 or IL- 10 production. None increased intracellular calcium concentration, but AM significantly inhibited store-operated calcium entry.

ANXUR 1 (ANX 1) and ANX 2, two <b>redundant</b> <b>members</b> of the CrRLK 1 L subfamily, are required for tip growth of the pollen tube (PT), and their closest homolog, FERONIA, controls root-hair tip growth.

Along with a GUS-GFP reporter, randomly selected TRANSPLANTA lines were tested and confirmed for conditional transgene expression upon beta-estradiol treatment. As a proof of concept for the exploitation of this resource, beta-estradiol-induced proliferation of root hairs, dark-induced senescence, anthocyanin accumulation and dwarfism were observed in lines conditionally expressing full-length cDNAs encoding RHD 6, WRKY 22, MYB 123 /TT 2 and MYB 26, respectively, in agreement with previously reported phenotypes conferred by these TFs.

For instance, ANAC 058 and a TINY/AP 2 TF were identified as modulators of ABA-mediated germination potential, and RAP 2. 10 /DEAR 4 was identified as a regulator of cell death in the hypocotyl-root transition zone. Seeds of TRANSPLANTA lines have been deposited at the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre for further distribution...|$|R
5000|$|According to Charles Roeder, a {{professor}} of civil engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, through-truss bridges were a common bridge design in the 1950s (there are 10,200 through-truss bridges in the US), but [...] "if you take {{out some of the}} top framing, you set that bridge up for a stability failure." [...] Before computers, bridge engineers analyzed truss forces by slide rule, with each calculation being time-consuming. Although the finite element method and plastic design theory, both capable of analyzing redundant structures, had recently been formulated and had seen occasional use, they required significantly more calculation than the simple calculation methods for statically determinate structures, which precluded the use of <b>redundant</b> structural <b>members.</b> A great number of bridges were being designed at that time, and there were insufficient design engineers available to design many bridges as indeterminate structures.|$|R

40|$|Resistance (R) gene-mediated {{immunity}} provides {{plants with}} rapid and strain-specific protection against pathogen infection. Our recent study using the genetically tractable Arabidopsis and turnip crinkle virus (TCV) pathosystem revealed a novel component, named CRT 1 (compromised for {{recognition of the}} TCV CP), that is involved in general R gene-mediated signaling, including that mediated by HRT, an R gene against TCV. The Arabidopsis CRT 1 gene family contains six additional members, of which two share high homology to CRT 1 (75 and 81 % a. a. identity); either CRT 1 or its closest homolog restore the cell death phenotype suppressed by crt 1. Analysis of single knock-out mutants for CRT 1 and its closest homologs suggest that each may have unique and redundant functions. Here, we {{provide insight into the}} screening conditions that enabled identification of a mutant gene despite the presence of functionally <b>redundant</b> family <b>members.</b> We also discuss a potential mechanism that may regulate the interaction between CRT 1 and R proteins...|$|R
5000|$|The through-truss {{bridge was}} built in 1955 and connects the Skagit County cities of Mount Vernon and Burlington. It had {{recently}} been evaluated as safe. Although not structurally deficient, it was considered [...] "functionally obsolete", meaning it did not meet current design standards. The bridge's design was [...] "fracture-critical," [...] meaning {{that it did not}} have <b>redundant</b> structural <b>members</b> to protect its structural integrity {{in the event of a}} failure of one of the bridge's support members. The overhead support structure was known to have been struck by a truck as recently as October 2012. From an engineering standpoint, the bridge actually consists of four consecutive spans which are structurally independent. The deck and overhead superstructure of only the northernmost span collapsed into the river. The span south of the collapsed span also sustained damage from being struck by the same truck, but not severe enough to result in a collapse. Also, the piers below the deck were not damaged.|$|R
30|$|Albermani and Kitipornchai [28] {{present an}} {{analytical}} technique {{that takes into}} account both geometric and material non-linearities. The geometric non-linearity analysis considers the effects of accumulated stresses and the effect of the changes in the geometry on the structural stiffness of the elements as the load is increased. The material non-linearity considers the effect of plasticity occurring in the sections if the elastic limit is exceeded. Their investigation was used to upgrade old towers by reinforcing them using a horizontal diaphragm bracing system. They also used their analysis to verify a new tower design which showed good agreement with the actual full-scale tower test. Very large towers considered in the literature usually use a K-type truss bracing system to support the main leg, and within these bracings there are secondary and <b>redundant</b> <b>members.</b> As discussed in [29], linear analysis calculates the forces in these secondary bracing members to be negligible. However, results from real tests show that these members are substantially loaded and {{play a role in the}} stability of the main members. In fact, in one of the full-scale tower tests carried out in [13], the main member buckled because of end tearing failure of these ‘redundant’ members. Other literature compares results from the non-linear structural analysis to full-scale tower tests subjected to the same load cases [6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 29, 30, 31]. Albermani et al. [30] concluded that the predicted failure loads and failure modes of their models were in good agreement with those obtained in tests. The same conclusion was made by Rao et al. [29], in which the forces acting on the bracing members of the tower before failure were consistent with test results. On the other hand, Rao et al.’s [31] results from the non-linear analysis slightly over-predicted the experimental buckling failure load for two of the towers analysed by a few percent. They put forward a number of observations which might have contributed to this difference, mainly bolt hole clearances, force fitting of members, non-triangulated bracings and other imperfections which were claimed to be difficult to incorporate into the finite element model.|$|R
40|$|The non‐receptor {{tyrosine}} kinase c‐Src, hereafter {{referred to as}} Src, is overexpressed or activated in multiple human malignancies. There has been much speculation about the functional role of Src in colorectal cancer (CRC), with Src amplification and potential activating mutations in up to 20 % of the human tumours, although this has never been addressed due to multiple <b>redundant</b> family <b>members.</b> Here, we have used the adult Drosophila and mouse intestinal epithelium as paradigms to define a role for Src during tissue homeostasis, damage‐induced regeneration and hyperplasia. Through genetic gain and loss of function experiments, we demonstrate that Src is necessary and sufficient to drive intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation during tissue self‐renewal, regeneration and tumourigenesis. Surprisingly, Src plays a non‐redundant role in the mouse intestine, which cannot be substituted by the other family kinases Fyn and Yes. Mechanistically, we show that Src drives ISC proliferation through upregulation of EGFR and activation of Ras/MAPK and Stat 3 signalling. Therefore, we demonstrate a novel essential role for Src in intestinal stem/progenitor cell proliferation and tumourigenesis initiation in vivo. </i...|$|R
50|$|Since the Conservatives' 1988 Education Reform Act, the ironclad tenure {{that used}} {{to exist in the}} UK has given way to a less secure form of tenure. Technically, {{university}} vice-chancellors can make individual faculty <b>members</b> <b>redundant</b> for poor performance or institute departmental redundancies, but in practice, this is rare. The most noted use of this policy happened in 2012 at Queen Mary University where lecturers on permanent contracts were fired. The institutions now has a stated policy of firing and replacing under-performing teaching staff members. This policy is complicated by the 2008 Ball vs Aberdeen tribunal decision, the distinction between teaching and research faculty is blurring- with implications for who can and cannot be made redundant at UK universities, and under what conditions.|$|R
40|$|Protein O-mannosyltransferases {{initiate}} O mannosylation of secretory proteins, {{which are}} of fundamental importance in eukaryotes. In this study, the PMT gene {{family of the}} human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus was identified and characterized. Unlike the case in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the PMT family is highly <b>redundant,</b> only one <b>member</b> of each PMT subfamily, namely, Afpmt 1, Afpmt 2, and Afpmt 4, is present in A. fumigatus. Mutants with a deletion of Afpmt 1 are viable. In vitro and in vivo activity assays confirmed that the protein encoded by Afpmt 1 acts as an O-mannosyltransferase (AfPmt 1 p). Characterization of the ΔAfpmt 1 mutant showed {{that a lack of}} AfPmt 1 p results in sensitivity to elevated temperature and defects in growth and cell wall integrity, thereby affecting cell morphology, conidium formation, and germination.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the digital transformation in UK cinemas between 2000 and 2014, as viewed by cinema projectionists. During this period digital projectors replaced mechanical 35 mm film projectors throughout UK cinemas. This resulted in many redundancies and {{a fundamental change}} in the way films are shown. This article draws on interview material with a number of current and former cinema projectionists (including a number who were made <b>redundant</b> and some <b>members</b> of the trade union BECTU) to provide an account of this period of change as it was experienced by those most affected by it. The ways in which the speed of the change was perceived are examined in detail. The article also considers how narratives of personal and professional change and redundancy are mediated through the attachment to technology and the experience of technological change. The respondents' descriptions of the arrival of the digital projectors and the focus on ‘the final show’ are common themes around which such narratives are constructed. ...|$|R
