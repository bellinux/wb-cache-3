Bounded by dense vegetation of different kinds ranging from ferns to <b>reeds</b> used <b>for</b> <b>weaving</b> mats, taro fields and plant varieties such as Syzygium cumini (jambul), pond-apple, mango, pineapple, screwpine, tropical almond, cheese fruit, ambarella and banana fields as well, there is the continuation of a large marsh land area towards the south of the island associated with the lake.|$|R
40|$|We {{review and}} {{synthesize}} recent South African work that examines {{the role and}} importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in {{the daily lives of}} rural people in South Africa. The most commonly used such products are wild spinaches, fuelwood, wooden utensils edible fruits, grass hand-brushes, and twig hand-brushes, used by 85 % or more of households. More than half the households investigated also make use of edible insects, wood for construction, bushmeat, wild honey and <b>reeds</b> <b>for</b> <b>weaving.</b> Individual households may exploit dozens of animal and plant species. The range in annual, direct-use values is large, from less than R 1000 per household per year to over R 12 000. The value to rural households is manifest through a daily net function which represents a cost saving to the families involved and to the state, as well as through an emergency net, which serves as an insurance in times of misfortune, such as drought, disease, and unexpected economic hardship. The emergency net function has hardly been quantified in South Africa and internationally. Ad hoc trade in NTFPs is a common emergency net, which in some instances evolves into a permanent way of life. Financial returns from trade are variable, depending on resource type and hours worked, but are typically low. Despite the small cash incomes from trade, they provide an important contribution that complement the diverse livelihood strategies within a household, especially for the poorer sectors of rural society. Moreover, there are non-financial benefits of NTFP trade that are commonly overlooked...|$|R
40|$|Weaving {{frames are}} {{powerful}} tools in {{wireless sensor networks}} and pre-processing signals. In this paper, we introduce the concept of <b>weaving</b> <b>for</b> g-frames in Hilbert spaces. We first give some properties of weaving g-frames and present two necessary conditions in terms of frame bounds <b>for</b> <b>weaving</b> g-frames. Then we study the properties of weakly woven g-frames and give a sufficient condition <b>for</b> <b>weaving</b> g-frames. It is shown that weakly woven is equivalent to woven. Two sufficient conditions <b>for</b> <b>weaving</b> g-Riesz bases are given. And a weaving equivalent of an unconditional g-basis <b>for</b> <b>weaving</b> g-Riesz bases is considered. Finally, we present Paley-Wiener-type perturbation results <b>for</b> <b>weaving</b> g-frames. Comment: Part of the argument is wrong. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1503. 03947 by other author...|$|R

40|$|An {{iterative}} decoding scheme <b>for</b> <b>woven</b> convolutional codes is presented. It {{is called}} pipeline decoding and operates {{in a window}} sliding over the received sequence. This exploits the nature of convolutional codes as sequences and suits the concept of convolutional encoding and decoding as a continuous process. The pipeline decoder is analyzed in terms of decoding delay and decoding complexity. Additional interleaving <b>for</b> <b>woven</b> convolutional constructions is introduced by employing a convolutional scrambler. It is shown that some types of interleaving preserve the lower bound on the free distance of the original woven construction. Simulation results <b>for</b> <b>woven</b> convolutional codes are presente...|$|R
