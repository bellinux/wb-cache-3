But {{whether this}} be granted me or not, the fact is, that every idea {{respecting}} size, proportion, decoration, or construction, {{on which we}} are at present {{in the habit of}} acting or judging, depends on presupposition of such materials: and as I both feel myself unable to escape the influence of these prejudices, and believe that my readers will be equally so, it may be perhaps permitted to me to assume that true architecture does not admit iron as a constructive material,[7] and that such works as the cast-iron central spire of Rouen Cathedral, or the iron roofs and pillars of our railway stations, and of some of our churches, are not architecture at all. Yet it is evident that metals may, and sometimes must, enter into the construction to a certain extent, as nails in wooden architecture, and therefore as legitimately rivets and solderings in stone; neither can we well deny to the Gothic architect the power of supporting statues, pinnacles, or traceries by iron bars; and if we grant this I do not see how we can help allowing Brunelleschi his iron chain around the dome of Florence, or the builders of Salisbury their elaborate iron binding of the central tower.[8] If, however, we would not fall into the old sophistry of the grains of corn and the heap, we must find a rule which may enable us to stop somewhere. This rule is, I think, that metals may be used as a cement but not as a support. For as cements of other kinds are often so strong that the stones may easier be broken than separated, and the wall becomes a solid mass without for that reason losing the character of architecture, there is no reason why, when a nation has obtained the knowledge and practice of iron work, metal rods or rivets should not be used in the place of cement, and establish the same or a greater strength and adherence, without in any wise inducing departure from the types and system of architecture before established; nor does it make any difference except as to sightliness, whether the metal bands or rods so employed, be {{in the body of the}} wall or on its exterior, or set as stays and cross-bands; so only that the use of them be always and distinctly one which might be superseded by mere strength of cement; as for instance if a pinnacle or mullion be propped or tied by an iron band, it is evident that the iron only prevents the separation of the stones by lateral force, which the cement would have done, had it been strong enough. But the moment that the iron in the least degree takes the place of the stone, and acts by its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing,</b> and bears superincumbent weight, or if it acts by its own weight as a counterpoise, and so supersedes the use of pinnacles or buttresses in resisting a lateral thrust, or if, in the form of a rod or girder, it is used to do what wooden beams would have done as well, that instant the building ceases, so far as such applications of metal extend, to be true architecture.|$|E

For briquetting the functional {{model of the}} briquetting press of our own construction was used.

By {{the evaluation of the}} measured values the relations between the briquettes volume density and the briquetting pressure and between the force needed for the briquette destruction and the briquetting pressure were obtained. It was proved that the briquettes volume density depends very much on the material which the briquettes are made from. Next influences (cutting method, chips size) are less meaningful. From {{the point of view of}} the relation between the destruction force and the briquetting pressure it was found that the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> of briquettes made from copper alloys was minimal, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> of briquettes made from aluminium alloys was major and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> of briquettes made from zinc alloys was the highest...|$|E

Included are overcoming the drag and lift forces that can limit tow vehicle depth and eliminating cable strumming,which causes fatigue failures. The usual solution is to add segments of fairing to the tow cable to change its hydrodynamic characteristics. However, this is normally a costly, time-consuming effort, especially on tow cable {{that does not have}} metallic armor. This report describes a method that greatly simplifies one part of the fairing installation procedure and is especially useful on plastic jacketed cable. A. C. Esau, Captain, USN Commanding Officer, NORDA Executive summary The construction and installation details of mechanical stops for use with fairing segments on plastic jacketed underwater tow cables are explained. Installation is easy, consumes about one man-minute per stop, and requires no tools. The parts {{do not have to be}} threaded onto the tow cable from one end, they are very inexpensive, and are available off the shelf. Slight modifi-cation of the off-the-shelf parts is generally necessary. The technique does not require the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crush,</b> which is usually available only with metallic armored cable.

40|$|At present, {{the ease}} of {{subdivision}} of scored tablets is estimated in vivo. In order to replace such in vivo testing {{and to develop a}} surrogate test which uses in vitro techniques, the association between physical parameters of scored tablets and their ease of subdivision was studied. The physical properties of 23 brands of scored tablets of which their ease of subdivision in vivo was known were established. Statistical modeling using a logistic regression model was used to fit the data and estimate the contribution of each physical parameter to the goodness of the fit. For scored oblong tablets, the critical parameters for their ease of subdivision are: diameter; diameter/width ratio; depth of score line and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing.</b> Criteria for each of these parameters were derived. All criteria need to be complied with to guarantee sufficient ease of subdivision of scored oblong tablets. For scored round tablets the critical parameters, in decreasing order of importance, for their ease of subdivision, are: <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing,</b> diameter, score mark (one- or two-sided), and shape (flat or biconvex). A five-parameter predictive model was developed, showing excellent discrimination. For development, the proposed surrogate tests are sufficiently reliable.

40|$|Abstract Background Intrinsic {{apoptosis}} of neuronal somas is {{one aspect}} of neurodegenerative diseases that can be influenced by genetic background. Genes that affect this process may act as susceptibility alleles {{that contribute to the}} complex genetic nature of these diseases. Retinal ganglion cell death is a defining feature of the chronic and genetically complex neurodegenerative disease glaucoma. Previous studies using an optic nerve crush procedure in inbred mice, showed that ganglion cell <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> was affected by the Mendelian-dominant inheritance of 1 â 2 predicted loci. To assess this further, we bred and phenotyped a large population of F 2 mice derived from a resistant inbred strain (DBA/ 2 J) and a susceptible strain (BALB/cByJ). Results Genome wide mapping of the F 2 mice using microsatellite markers, detected a single highly significant quantitative trait locus in a 25 cM (58 Mb) interval on chromosome 5 (Chr 5. loc 34 - 59 cM). No interacting loci were detected at the resolution of this screen. We have designated this locus as Retinal ganglion cell susceptible 1, Rgcs 1. In silico analysis of this region revealed the presence of 578 genes or expressed sequence tags, 4 of which are highly expressed in the ganglion cell layer of the mammalian retina, and 2 of which are suspected susceptibility alleles in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, 25 genes contain 36 known single nucleotide polymorphisms that create nonsynonymous amino acid changes between the two parental strains. Collectively, this analysis has identified 7 potential candidate genes that may affect ganglion cell death. Conclusion The process of ganglion cell death is likely one of the many facets of glaucoma susceptibility. A novel dominant locus has been identified that affects sensitivity of ganglion cells <b>to</b> optic nerve <b>crush.</b> The allele responsible for this sensitivity may also be a susceptibility allele for glaucoma. </p...|$|R

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 57 - 59) Rollovers {{tend to be}} {{very severe}} crashes because of the energy required to roll a vehicle over unlike front and side crashes. This study is an effort towards reducing the severity of a rollover crash by strengthening the roof of a passenger car. The main focus of this thesis is to study the effect of reinforcing the roof of a car, {{in the event of a}} rollover. An Eglass/polypropylene isogrid composite panel, which is known for high specific energy absorption under impact, is used in reinforcing the roof of a ford Taurus car and the force-displacement response of the roof structure is observed in contrast to the same while without the roof reinforcement. The non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation of this rollover event is performed in LS DYNA computer code. The simulation setup is done in accordance with Federal Motor Vehicle Standard (FMVSS) No. 216, which is a static study of roof strength in the case of rollover accidents. A study of roof strength characteristics under dynamic loading, involving rollover forces and velocities, is also carried out. The simulation in the latter case involves dropping the car, inverted at a certain pitch and roll offset against gravity from a certain predetermined height onto a concrete surface. The results of the above simulations show that Isogrid composite panels are excellent reinforcements for a car roof, stiffening the roof and increasing its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> in a rollover accident. This study will help in recommending the use of isogrid panels in the design of car roofs with better roof crush characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a number of physical and chemical attributes upon muskmelon texture as described by sensory evaluation. Measurements of turgor pressure, percent moisture, total sugars, alcohol-insoluble-solids, three pectic fractions, total pectic materials, starch and cellulose were performed on 50 melons. The melons were purchased at random from a retail market in Corvallis, Oregon, over a five-week period during July and August, 1966. Subjective evaluation of textural quality was provided by a five-membered panel employing a pre-tested ballot. On five-point scales, judges rated resistance to cutting, resistance to biting, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing,</b> crispness, fibrousness and sweetness. Simple and multiple correlation analyses were performed to elucidate relationships between the objective and subjective observations. Considerable variation was found among melons for most of the attributes. Variation was largest in the case of water-soluble pectic substances and cellulose and least for alcohol-insoluble-solids. According to the results of this study, melon texture is determined to a great extent by the type and amount of cell wall constituents. Significant multiple correlations were found between cell wall constituents, cellulose and protopectin, and sensory panel scores for resistance to cutting, resistance to biting, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> and crispness. Fruit maturity, as inferred from starch and protopectin content, also exerted an effect upon texture. Significant multiple correlations were found between starch and protopectin and panel scores for resistance to cutting, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> and crispness. Although not specifically related to texture, a significant and positive simple correlation was found between total sugars and sweetness. Similarly, significant negative correlations were found between starch and total sugars and starch and sweetness. Turgor pressure, percent moisture, alcohol-insoluble-solids, total sugar, water-soluble pectic substances, pectates-pectinates and total pectic materials were found not to be reliable indicators of muskmelon texture. Although turgor pressure did not exhibit a significant relationship to any textural aspects, a trend was observed in the data. As a result of this observation and difficulty encountered in measuring turgor pressure, further work with this variable is recommended. Proximate composition of the melons analyzed compared favorably with published data. This observation lends confidence to the methods and analyses employed. Large standard deviations calculated for some of the attributes measured emphasize the extent of variation among melons, the difficulty in assessing texture in an objective manner and the problem encountered in marketing and purchasing the fresh fruit...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{procedure}} of designing {{the composition of}} concrete with the method of three equations demands to accept the assumptions regarding the consistence of concrete mixture. For the assumed consistency the water demand of aggregates and water demand of concrete is specified. In case of natural aggregates (NCA) the formulas, among others, of Sterne's of Bolomey's are used conditioning the water demand of aggregates from its granulation, kind and consistence of concrete mixture. There is lack of such dependencies in case of water demand of recycled aggregates (RCA). In such case there remains the empirical determination of the water demand, which in practice disqualifies {{the usefulness of the}} method of three equations to specify the concrete composition of on RCA aggregates. A way to solve this problem is looking for the relations between RCA water demand and its other qualities which are easy to specify in laboratory conditions in short time.

Theseresults are the following :i) <b>Resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crushing</b> : the breakage loads are multipliedby a coefficient which varies from 1, 5 to 3 without the densityperceptibly increasing. 2) Resistance to extension : no change. 3) Resistance to flexion is increased by about 1, 5. 4) Power of resisting shocks : no improvement. 5) Hardness : it is from 3, 4 to 6 times greater than the hardnessof natural wood. The total of these results explains the multitude of applicationsof bakelised wood. Microscopic study has shown that there is no chemical combinationbut simply partial filling of the cellular cavities...|$|E
50|$|Pinto {{served as}} an officer in various Portuguese colonies in Africa.Â First from 1902 to 1911, in Portuguese Angola, in {{following}} his fathers footsteps.Â InÂ Portuguese Guinea, he played a decisive role in the pacification of the Oio RegionÂ between 1912 and 1916. Between 1913 and 1915, Pinto used Askari troops to impose Portuguese rule and <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> hut tax by destroying villages and seizing cattle, which caused many to flee to Senegal or the forests. The cost of his forces and the return to budget deficits led to his recall in 1915.|$|R

There were many instances where rallies of opposition parties were physically broken up by Sandinsta youth or pro-Sandinista mobs. Opponents to the State of Emergency argued its intent was <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the FSLN. James Wheelock justified the actions of the Directorate by saying [...] "... We are annulling the license of the false prophets and the oligarchs to attack the revolution." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{negotiations}} Omer Pasha, Governor of Lebanon, led {{an army of}} 30000 men towards Monastir. The first <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Omer Pasha's forces was in Kicevo, though resistance did {{not last}} as Ottoman forces pushed back the rebels into their strongholds in Uskub, Kumanovo and Kalkandelen. After Gostivar fell, Omer Pasha directed all forces <b>to</b> Kalandelen <b>to</b> <b>crush</b> the rebellion. As to not underestimate Dervish Cara and his feats, Omar Pasha armed his forces with heavy artillery and shelled the stronghold. The battle lasted from May to September 1844, resulting in the capture of Kalkandelen and Dervish Cara.|$|R
