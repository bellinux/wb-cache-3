40|$|One of the {{simplest}} and most popular antennas is the half-wave dipole, {{so it is not}} surprising that it was one of the earliest 1 feed antennas for a parabolic dish. A dipole antenna has a simple radiation pattern that most hams are familiar with – in free space, it looks like a donut with the dipole through the hole. If it is near ground or a reflector, the pattern in the plane perpendicular to the dipole (Hplane) is distorted to emphasize radiation away from the reflector. The distance between the dipole and reflector influences the shape of the radiation in this plane, while the shape of the radiation in a plane parallel to the dipole (E-plane) does not change significantly. Thus the pattern might be adjusted somewhat by varying the reflector spacing. Figure 6. 2 - 1 shows the radiation pattern calculated using NEC 2 for a dipole with a simple <b>rod</b> <b>reflector</b> spaced 0. 24 λ, which can also be described as a 2 -element Yagi-Uda antenna. The radiation patterns in the H-plane is much broader than the E-plane, and the front-to-ratio is poor, only about 10 dB. These two factors result in the mediocre efficiency shown in the lower plot in Figure 6. 2 - 1; a calculated dish efficiency of about 66 % would probably result in about 50 % efficiency in practice. We can also see that the dipole feed is better for very deep dishes, with best f/D around 0. 25. The calculated phase center is 0. 06 λ behind the dipole (toward the reflector).

The {{performance of the}} new capability is verified using two-dimensional core cases with control <b>rods</b> in <b>reflector</b> and fuel blocks. Cross sections for VHTR components were generated using the DRAGON and HELIOS codes. For rodded block cross sections, the DRAGON calculations used a single-block model or the multi-block models combined with MCNP 4 C flux solutions, whereas the HELIOS calculations utilized multi-block models.

40|$|A RELAP 5 - 3 D {{model has}} been {{developed}} for the RBMK Kursk 1 NPP. The primary features of this model are the three-dimensional neutronics model of the reactor core and the user subroutine that generates the neutron cross-sections. This subroutine contains the same neutron cross-section libraries that are presently {{being used in the}} Russian STEPAN/KOBRA calculations. The implementation of the neutronics mesh into the reactor core is described along with the results done to validate the accuracy of this representation.

40|$|The gamma heating {{evaluation}} in different materials found in {{current and future}} generations of nuclear reactor (EPRTM, GENIV, MTR-JHR), is becoming an important issue especially {{for the design of}} many devices (control <b>rod,</b> heavy <b>reflector,</b> in-core & out-core experiments…). This paper deals with the works started since 2009 in the Reactor Studies Department of CEA Cadarache in ordre to answer to several problematic which have been identified as well for nuclear data production and calculation as for experimental measurement methods.

40|$|The authors {{summarize}} {{the results of}} detailed neutronic and thermal-hydraulic evaluations of the heat pipe cooled thermionic (HPTI) reactor design, identify its key design attributes, and quantify its performance characteristics. The HPTI core uses modular, liquid-metal core heat transfer assemblies to replace the liquid-metal heat transport loop employed by in-core thermionic reactor designs of the past. The nuclear fuel, power conversion, heat transport, and heat rejection functions are all combined into a single modular unit. The reactor/converter assembly uses UN fuel pins to obtain a critical core configuration with in-core safety <b>rods</b> and <b>reflector</b> controls added to complete the subassembly. By thermally bonding the core heat transfer assemblies during the reactor core is coupled neutronically, thermally, and electrically into a modular assembly of individual power sources with cross-tied architecture. A forward-facing heat pipe radiator assembly extends from the reactor head {{in the shape of}} a frustum of a cone on the opposite side of the power system from the payload. Important virtues of the concept are the absence of any single-point failures and the ability of the core to effectively transfer the TFE waste heat load laterally to other in-core heat transfer assemblies in the event of multiple failures in either in-core and radiator heat pipes...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of nodal cross sections and equivalence parameters for prismatic VHTR core components is discussed. For fuel-block cross section generation, a conventional single-block {{model with a}} reflective boundary condition is used. A one-dimensional fuel-reflector model is proposed for reflector cross section generation in order to accurately represent the significant neutron spectrum variation at the core-reflector interface. Two-dimensional multi-block models are used for obtaining control rod cross sections for <b>rodded</b> fuel and <b>reflector</b> blocks to best approximate actual spectra in the blocks. The verification of the models was performed by generating cross sections with the DRAGON and HELIOS codes, using the cross section data in 2 -D and 3 -D DIF 3 D nodal calculations, and comparing the results to MCNP 4 C ones. The {{results show that the}} use of discontinuity factors reduces errors in nodal solutions for the multiplication factor and power distribution. Surface-dependent discontinuity factors are found essential for improving the accuracy of the power distribution of cores with asymmetrically rodded blocks when nodal calculations are performed with one node per hexagonal block.

40|$|In {{this report}} the {{systematic}} classification of the ATWS has been undertaken by analogy to the considerations made for water-cooled nuclear reactors. The initiating events of ATWS and protection actions of safety systems resulting from {{monitoring of the}} system variables have been described. The main emphasis of this work is {{the analysis of the}} core dynamic consequences of scram failure during the anticipated transients. The investigation has shown that because of the temperature feedback mechanisms a temperature rise during the ATWS results in a seif-shutdown of the reactor. Further inherent safety features of the HTR - conditioned by thehigh heat capacity of the core and by the compressibility of the coolant - do effectively counteract an undesirable increase of temperature and pressure in the primary circuit. In case of the longöterm failure of the forced cooling and following core heatup, neutron physical phenomena appear which determine the reactivity behaviour of the HTR. They are, for instance, the decay of Xenon 135, release of the fission products and subsiding of the top reflector. The results of the computer simulations show that a recriticality has to be excluded during the first 2 days if the reactor is shutdown by the <b>reflector</b> <b>rods</b> {{at the beginning of the}} accident...|$|R
40|$|The Basic Radiation Effects Reactor (BRER) {{is a small}} fast core {{surrounded}} by a segmented radial reflector. The NaK-cooled fast core operates at a thermal power of 1 Mw, with all the reactor heat being rejected to the atmosphere through a secondary heat exchange system. The secondary heat exchange system is another NaK loop which dissipates heat to the atmosphere {{by means of an}} air-blast cooler. The reactor core is composed of small-diameter rods of uranium [...] zirconium alloy, arranged in a close-packed triangular pattern. The maximum core loading is approxi-mately 60 kg of U/sup 235 /. Reactor control is effected by moving control <b>rods</b> in the <b>reflector</b> region immediately adjacent to the core. Reactor instrumentation and fuel handling are similar to other heterogeneous reactor systems. Relatively large volumes for experiments are available in the large radial reflector surrounding the core. The physics of the BRER system was investigated, using a 15 -group set of cross sections, for a series of reflector materials. The materials studied were lead, aluminum, iron, zirconium, depleted uranium, and natural aranium. Based on the criterion of producing two widely spaced and relatively sharply peaked neutron spectra, these preliminary calculations indicate that a major portion of the reflector would be lead, with an aluminum region starting at some intermediate point and extending to {{the outer edge of the}} reflector.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an integrated diffusion/transport (IDT) method to substantially improve the accuracy of nodal diffusion methods for the design and analysis of Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTR). Because of the presence of control <b>rods</b> in the <b>reflector</b> regions in the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR-VHTR), traditional nodal diffusion methods do not accurately model these regions, within which diffusion theory breaks down in the vicinity of high neutron absorption and steep flux gradients. The IDT method uses a local transport solver based on a new incident flux response expansion method in the controlled nodes. Diffusion theory is used {{in the rest of the}} core. This approach improves the accuracy of the core solution by generating transport solutions of controlled nodes while maintaining computational efficiency by using diffusion solutions in nodes where such a treatment is sufficient. The transport method is initially developed and coupled to the reformulated 3 -D nodal diffusion model in the CYNOD code for PBR core design and fuel cycle analysis. This method is also extended to the prismatic VHTR. The new method accurately captures transport effects in highly heterogeneous regions with steep flux gradients. The calculations of these nodes with transport theory avoid errors associated with spatial homogenization commonly used in diffusion methods in reactor core simulator...|$|R
