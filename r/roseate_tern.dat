5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The <b>roseate</b> <b>tern</b> is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{is largely}} insectivorous and feeds on both pest and other arthropods. The food range includes spiders, crane flies, moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel flies, grasshoppers, earwigs, lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps and ants. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on earthworms, snails, small amphibians and lizards. While {{the consumption of}} invertebrates is necessary for successful breeding, common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains, seeds, fruits, nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered <b>roseate</b> <b>tern.</b> Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.|$|E

They contain by far the largest colonies of wedge-tailed shearwater in the eastern Indian Ocean, with over a million breeding pairs recorded there in 1994. They also contain Western Australia's only breeding colonies of the lesser noddy, and the largest colonies in Western Australia of the little shearwater, white-faced storm petrel, common noddy, Caspian tern, crested tern, <b>roseate</b> <b>tern</b> and fairy tern. In addition, they contain important breeding areas for the Pacific reef heron, Pacific gull, bridled tern, white-bellied sea eagle and osprey.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of this tiny group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), Madeiran storm-petrel (1000), yellow-legged gull, the <b>roseate</b> <b>tern</b> and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, {{the island}} {{became part of}} the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge after it was {{acquired}} from the U.S. Coast Guard. According to the Connecticut Audubon Society, [...] "it currently supports over 95% of the nesting Common Terns in Connecticut. It is the site of one of the ten largest <b>Roseate</b> <b>Tern</b> (~45 pairs) colonies in Northeastern North America, and is the only regular nesting location for this federally endangered species in the state." [...] Also living on the island is the American oystercatcher, with one to two breeding pairs noted each year. Although the erosion control project was completed, Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy greatly reduced the breeding habitat of the terns to just [...] In spring 2014, the dock damaged by Hurricane Sandy was scheduled to be rebuilt.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, <b>roseate</b> <b>tern,</b> bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
5000|$|Juvenile common terns {{are easily}} {{separated}} from similar-aged birds of related species. They show extensive ginger colouration to the back, {{and have a}} pale base to the bill. Young Arctic terns have a grey back and black bill, and juvenile <b>roseate</b> <b>terns</b> have a distinctive scalloped [...] "saddle". Hybrids between common and <b>roseate</b> <b>terns</b> have been recorded, particularly from the US, and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall. Such birds may have more extensive black on the bill, but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on the exact details of individual flight feathers.|$|R

40|$|Survival of {{tropical}} <b>Roseate</b> <b>Terns</b> (Sterna dougallii) {{from the western}} Indian Ocean was modeled using a capture-mark-recapture dataset of 102 breeding adults ringed and resighted on Aride Island, Seychelles, from 2002 to 2007. The effect of covariates reflecting oceanographic conditions and resighting effort was also examined during the modeling. A time-invariant survival rate was best supported by our data, with annual adult survival estimated at 0. 807 ± 0. 033 (SE). Resighting probability {{was found to be}} influenced by sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies, as expressed by the mean Indian Ocean Dipole mode index recorded during the nonbreeding period. Years of higher SST {{in the western part of}} the Indian Ocean in September-April (8 months) corresponded to a lower probability of resighting adults at the colony during the breeding season (May-August), which may be related to a tendency for some adults to refrain from breeding in less favorable years. Comparing our results with temperate studies, <b>Roseate</b> <b>Terns</b> breeding on Aride were found to exhibit similar survival estimates. Consequently, this study does not support the hypothesis that tropical <b>Roseate</b> <b>Terns</b> may counterbalance their lower fecundity (clutch size and breeding success) compared to their temperate and northern-hemisphere counterparts (Europe, North America, Caribbean) by relatively higher survival rates.
