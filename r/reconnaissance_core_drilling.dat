50|$|HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from High Speed Steel material. These are most popular <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> or annular cutters in market. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for smaller {{diameter}} i.e 40 mm. The biggest advantage of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is its ability to}} re-sharpen. Unlike TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills,</b> HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> re-sharpened and used with good efficiency until the desirable length is remaining. HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> have longer service life, high heat resistance: the charecteristics of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is that <b>drilling</b> with these <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be done without the use of excessive force.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are {{categorized}} by the material used to manufacture them: Primarily a metal <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is made from}} High Speed Steel and Tungsten Carbide Tips. So commercially the types of <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> and TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b>|$|R
50|$|The HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with Hard Coating are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a coating on it, {{generally}} TiN Coating. This {{make the}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{more resistant to}} heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are gaining lot of popularity over the Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> these days. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are used Structural steel, Stainless steel, etc.|$|R
50|$|TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from Tungsten Carbide {{material}} on their tips. Tungsten carbide is a very hard material and supposed {{to be one of}} the hardest materials made by man. TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are more expensive then HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> but are faster and easy to make bigger holes. There are also different types in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper for bigger diameter i.e. above 41 mm. They are very efficient for cutting hard material. The chances of tip breakage in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is more compared to HSS <b>Core</b> <b>drills.</b> TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> has a disadvantage that it can not be reground. Once the TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is damaged it has to be thrown away, it can not be re used like the HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills.</b> It is always recommended by manufacturers to use TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> only for larger diameter and for very hard material, while giving priority to HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> because of its price and re-sharpening advantages.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used {{in metal}} are called annular cutters. <b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> used for {{concrete}} are generally called Diamond <b>Core</b> <b>Drills</b> and are water cooled. [...] For <b>drilling</b> masonry, carbide <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be used.|$|R
50|$|A Standard TCT <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> has {{tungsten}} carbide tips. These types of <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are now available}} in vast range of diameter, for up to 150 mm. These are popularly used <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> on magnetic <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> machines. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are popularly used to drill materials like railway tracks, structural steel, stainless steel, cast iron, etc.|$|R
50|$|The TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with Hard Coating are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a coating on it, {{generally}} TiN Coating. This {{make the}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{more resistant to}} heat, longer tool life and even removal of chips just like the advantage of HSS <b>core</b> <b>drill.</b> The biggest advantage of hard coated <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is that these cutters are very good for cutting larger diameters on hard material. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are popularly used to drill materials like corroded or weathered material, structural and stainless steel.|$|R
50|$|The HSS Cobalt are <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{made from}} M42 Steel. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> have 8% Cobalt in HSS. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are {{harder than the}} Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> which gives better {{performance}} to drill harder material. A high percentage of Cobalt in HSS makes it faster, stronger and durable. Cobalt HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are used to drill materials like Structural Steel, Stainless Steel, Cast iron, etc.|$|R

50|$|The HSS Standard <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are made}} from M2 steel. These <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are one of the}} most popular <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> in western {{countries}} due to its cost and resharpening advantage. The Standard HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are used to drill Mild and Structural steel, Aluminium, Stainless steel of lower BHN., etc.|$|R
50|$|HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{are cheaper}} than the TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> for smaller diameters up to 40 mm, while TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are cheaper than HSS for diameters above 41 mm.|$|R

50|$|The biggest {{disadvantage}} of <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> or annular cutter {{is that it}} can not drill blind holes. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> due to its hollow geometry can only make through holes. Another disadvantage is in drilling a pile of many plates. There are some <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> with a different geometry which can be used for drilling piles of plates, but still it is not 100% successful. The cost of a <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is high compared to twist drill, but the cost per hole made with <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> is less as compared to twist drills, this is because a single <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> makes 5 to 10 times more holes than a twist drill.|$|R
50|$|The {{chances of}} defect in TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> is more because the {{tungsten}} carbide tips are glued on the <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{and when the}} <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> falls down or crashes on the material, the chances tip breakage is more. HSS cutter {{on the other hand}} are completely made out of one material.|$|R
50|$|A single <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> makes 5 to 10 {{times more}} holes then a twist <b>drill,</b> plus <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> can be again {{reground}} {{to make another}} 1500 holes, thus saving a lot of tool cost.|$|R
50|$|As <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> has to cut less {{material}} {{as compared to}} twist drill, the time required is also too less. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> {{is considered to be}} 3 to 4 times faster than twist drills.|$|R
40|$|My {{thesis is}} {{considering}} the options of manufacturing of the <b>core</b> <b>drill.</b> One of these options is {{technology of the}} laser welding, which was described in details in the theoretical part of this thesis. In applied part of this thesis there were experimentally manufactured two pieces of <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> by using Yb-YAG fibre laser technology. One <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> was used for testing of the welding parameters {{and in the next}} step, these parameters were applied in real working conditions and were evaluated in final. Result is written down in the final part of my thesis. The second <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> was welded using the best values measured in the fixture, which was especially designed for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOn {{the request}} of the current level of the {{geological}} <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> design, refer to oil drilling design software, a geological <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> computer aided design system was developed by means of advanced web design technology. The system covers all procedures of geological <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> design, and presets reference value according to system database information, and automatically draws geological column and borehole columnar section according to the user design information, and finally produces overall and standard design report. The development technology is based on ZK and Hibernate framework with MVC and MVVM model. Consequently, the system will be easy to be used and maintained, and will contribute to the geological <b>core</b> <b>drilling</b> design information exchange and share online...|$|R
50|$|TCT cutter biggest {{advantage}} is speed and ease {{in which it}} may cut harder materials. Especially for larger diameter TCT <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are very successful. While HSS <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are good when drilling not very hard material and for small diameter hole sizes.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> {{were those}} used by the ancient Egyptians, invented in 3000 BC. <b>Core</b> <b>drills</b> are used for many applications, either where the core needs to be preserved (the drilling apparatus used in obtaining a core sample {{is often referred to}} as a corer), or where drilling can be done more rapidly since much less material needs to be removed than with a standard bit. This is the reason that diamond-tipped <b>core</b> <b>drills</b> are commonly used in construction to create holes for pipes, manholes, and other large-diameter penetrations in concrete or stone.|$|R

25|$|These <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bits {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to reamers as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. <b>Core</b> <b>drill</b> bits differ from reamers {{in the amount of}} material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A <b>core</b> <b>drill</b> bit may be used to double the size of a hole.|$|R
