40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} Shorea mujongensis P. S. Ashton was {{investigated}} {{in order to ensure}} this species belongs to yellow meranti group. Such study is very important since this species is already listed in the red list of IUCN and classified as critically endangered species. The microscopic slides were prepared according to the Johansen 2 ̆ 7 s method, while the anatomical features observed according to the IAWA List. The results show that S. mujongensis wood exhibit brown heartwood, light brown sapwood, rough texture, straight grain sometimes interlocked and somewhat rough. The main microscopic characters are growth rings indistinct; vessel diffuse, mostly solitary, rounded to oval; simple perforation plate and alternate intervessel pits; parenchyma scanty paratracheal to thin vasicentric; axial intercellular canals in long tangential line, <b>radial</b> <b>intercellular</b> <b>canal</b> and vasicentric tracheids present; rays uniseriate and multiseriate, prismatic crystal in procumbent cells; fiber length 1, 294 µm, diameter 26 µm and wall thickness 4 µm. Macroscopic and microscopic observation of S. mujongensis wood confirms the species belongs to yellow meranti group. The assesment on fiber dimensions and derived values of the wood fibers classified the wood into class quality II. It indicates that this species is moderately favorable as raw material for pulp and paper manufacture...|$|E
40|$|One way to {{overcome}} the shortages of raw material for wood based industries in Indonesia nowadays is to utilize the lesser known wood species. Therefore, the basic properties of these lesser known wood species should be studied. Wood anatomy of nine lesser known wood species from East Kalimantan have been observed and described for identification purposes and for evaluation of their properties and then appropriate uses. For identification purpose several main features have been noted : 1) Perforation plat scalariform in Mastixia trichotoma and Drypetes sp.; 2) Closely spaced parenchyma bands and <b>radial</b> <b>intercellular</b> <b>canal</b> in Ficus variegata; 3) Parenchyma reticulate in Drypetes sp, Diospyro macrophylla and Koilodepas sp.; 4) Fiber septate in Glochidion philippicum; 5) Rays almos exlusively homocelullar with gum-like deposite in vessels o/Lansium sp. Seven out of nine wood species examined containfibers of medium quality for pulp and paper among others : Blumeodendron kurzii, Ficus variegata and Mastixia trichtoma. The other two species contain fibers with poor quality.

40|$|Tropical {{hard wood}} species written at TABLE 1, mainly from East-South Asia, were {{examined}} with light microscope, {{scanning electron microscope}} and by the ashing method. Woods were maintained at the Laboratory of Wood Science, Kyushu University and used as experimental materials. Results were revealed the fundamental information of wood identification listed up in TABLE 2 and others as follows: 1) Cell inclusives founded by light microscope and electron microscope were different but these were attributable to treatment methods. 2) Ashing method was useful to examine the presence of crystal in cell and to test the chemical reaction which indicates silica or calcium salt. 3) Generally wood contained different shapes of crystal in ray parenchyma and axial parenchyma. Sometimes same tissue contained a few kinds of crystal shape. 4) The crystal presenting in parenchyma was an important key for identification of experimental woods. 5) The species belonging to the DIPTEROCARPACEAE possessed the vertical intercellular canal but in other species, they were absent. 6) Jongkong and Rengas possessed the <b>radial</b> <b>intercellular</b> <b>canal.</b> Rose wood and Jelutong possessed the laticifer.

40|$|Background: The {{terminal}} {{phase of}} cytokinesis in eukaryotic cells involves breakage of the <b>intercellular</b> <b>canal</b> containing the spindle midzone and resealing of the daughter cells. Recent observations {{suggest that the}} spindle midzone is required for this process. In this study, we investigated the possibility that targeted secretion {{in the vicinity of}} the spindle midzone is required for the execution of the terminal phase of cytokinesis. Results: We inhibited secretion in early C. elegans embryos by treatment with brefeldin A (BFA). Using 4 D recordings of dividing cells, we showed that BFA induced stereotyped failures in the terminal phase of cytokinesis; although the furrow ingressed normally, after a few minutes the furrow completely regressed, even though spindle midzone and midbody microtubules appeared normal. In addition, using an FM 1 - 43 membrane probe, we found that membrane accumulated locally at the apices of the late cleavage furrows that form the persisting <b>intercellular</b> <b>canals</b> between daughter cells. However, in BFA-treated embryos this membrane accumulation did not occur, which possibly accounts for the observed cleavage failures. Conclusions: We have shown that BFA disrupts the terminal phase of cytokinesis in the embryonic blastomeres of C. elegans. We observed that membrane accumulates at the apices of the late cleavage furrow by means of a BFA-sensitive mechanism. We suggest that this local membrane accumulation is necessary for the completion of cytokinesis and speculate that the spindle midzone region of animal cells is functionally equivalent to the phragmoplast of plants and acts to target secretion to the equatorial plane of a cleaving cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of the longitudinal intercellular spaces in normal softwoods was examined. The morphological characteristics of those longitudinal intercellular spaces were also studied by means of light and scanning electron microscopes. The results are summarized as follows; 1. For all the softwood species examined, about 21 to 77 percent of the intercellular regions formed from a ray and two tracheids had the longitudinal intercellular spaces. 2. From the observation on tangential sections, the longitudinal intercellular spaces were existed {{on both sides of}} the ray. However, they were coincided at the ends of the ray and running into the intercellular regions located among tracheids. 3. The longitudinal and <b>radial</b> <b>intercellular</b> spaces were found to cross each other.

40|$|SummaryGenomic {{abnormalities}} {{are often}} seen in tumor cells, and tetraploidization, which results from failures during cytokinesis, is presumed to be an early step in cancer formation. Here, we report a cell division control mechanism that prevents tetraploidization in human cells with perturbed chromosome segregation. First, we found that Aurora B inactivation promotes completion of cytokinesis by abscission. Chromosome bridges sustained Aurora B activity to posttelophase stages and thereby delayed abscission at stabilized <b>intercellular</b> <b>canals.</b> This was essential to suppress tetraploidization by furrow regression in a pathway further involving the phosphorylation of mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (Mklp 1). We propose that Aurora B {{is part of a}} sensor that responds to unsegregated chromatin at the cleavage site. Our study provides evidence that in human cells abscission is coordinated with the completion of chromosome segregation to protect against tetraploidization by furrow regression...|$|R
40|$|Mesophyll {{structure}} and water relations were studied in expanding and expanded dorsiventral leaves of Ballota acetabulosa Benth., a wild perennial sbrub from tbe Mediterranean. The spongy mesophyli was developed earlier than tbe palisade in expanding leaves and exhibited a larger internal exposed surface. By contrast, in fully expanded leaves tbe internal exposed surface was much larger in the palisade tban in spongy mesophyll, Tbe development of chloroplasts in cells of both mesophyll tissues, {{as well as}} their arrangement along tbe cell walls exposed to <b>intercellular</b> <b>canals,</b> coincided with the formation of intercellular spaces. Leaf expansion appears to be positively related to increasing internal exposed surface and declining water potentials. As a result, mature leaves possess a higb ratio of internal exposed surface per leaf area and low values of turgor. It is considered that an increase in the internal exposed surface migbt be an adaptive feature for small-leaved shrubs, grown under water deficiency.

40|$|The {{effects of}} forest fire on wood were studied on fifteen dead and living trees of various {{tropical}} species. The wood reacted {{in the following}} ways: (1) creating smaller but denser pores than normal in a concentric pattern, (2) changing dimension and numbers of axial parenchyma, (3) producing more axial <b>intercellular</b> <b>canals,</b> (4) forming decay spots in the wood, (5) creating the concentric area of fibres area or forming the vessels late, (6) creating new calluses and the bole losing its cylindrical form, (7) producing abnormal gums in the wood and (8) the bole becoming hollow. These abnormalities decrease physical or mechanical properties depending on how serious the defect is in the wood. Wood deterioration was more strongly influenced by the conditions caused by the forest fire and subsequent attacks by fungus, bacteria and insects than by fire itself. There were various effects depending on the durability and other properties of the wood. The wood was classified into four groups: “merkubung/sengon”, “akasia/medang”, “ulin” and “leda”, according to condition in the field...|$|R

Detarieae is the largest of four tribes of Caesalpinioideae, with 84 genera, only eleven occur in Venezuela with species of timber importance. The speci-mens were collected in Venezuela and include wood samples {{from the collection of}} the Laboratorio de Anatomía de Maderas de la Facultad de Ciencias Forestales y Ambientales de la Universidad de Los Andes, Venezuela, and of the Forest Products Laboratory of the USDA Forest Service in Madison, Wisconsin, USA. The terminol-ogy and methodology used followed the iAWA List of Microscopic Features for Hardwood identification of the iAWA Committee, 1989. Measurements from each specimen were averaged (vessel diameters, vessel element lengths, intervessels pit size, fibre lengths and ray height).

40|$|Various {{in vitro}} {{models have been}} {{described}} that emulate {{one or more of}} the processes involved in angiogenesis in vivo. In the present study endothelial cells were cultured in three-dimensional type I collagen lattices in the presence of a mixture of basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor, and phorbol myristate acetate. Under these conditions, the endothelial cells rapidly assemble into an interconnected network of tube-like structures with a high frequency of <b>intercellular</b> <b>canals</b> or lumens. The formation of the networks and lumens was completely blocked by cycloheximide and by actinomycin D. Monoclonal antibodies directed against CD 31 or vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) inhibited the formation of endothelial tubes. A subtle difference in the morphology of cells treated with anti-CD 31 versus anti-VE-cadherin was noted; namely, cells incubated in the presence of CD 31 antibodies were rounded or formed attenuated tube-like structures, both of which were characterized by a single, large intra- or intercellular vacuole. In contrast, tube formation by cells incubated in the presence of VE-cadherin antibodies was also impaired and, most notably, demonstrated a reduction in either vacuole formation or vacuole fusion, depending upon the monoclonal antibody used. We suggest that the two endothelial-junction-associated proteins, CD 31 and VE-cadherin, play different roles in the process of tube formation. CD 31 appears to be required for cell elongation, migration, and/or invasion in the gels as well as for cell-cell association to form the network structures. VE-cadherin also appears to be required for cell-cell association, but additionally appears to play some role in the process of vacuolization or vacuole fusion leading to intercellular lumen formation...|$|R

The purpose of this work is to study anatomical structure of Campanula rotundifolia grass to determine its diagnostic features. Methods. The study for anatomic structure was carried out in accordance with the requirements of State Pharmacopoeia, edition XIII. Micromed laboratory microscope with digital adjutage was used to create microphotoes, Photoshop CC was used for their processing. Result. We have established that stalk epidermis is prosenchymal, slightly winding with straight of splayed end cells. After study for the epidermis cells we established that upper epidermis cells had straight walls and are slightly winding. The cells of lower epidermis have more winding walls with prolong wrinkled cuticule. Presence of simple one-cell, thin wall, rough papillose hair on leaf and stalk epidermis.

40|$|Relationships between {{structure}} and function in apples were assessed {{in a series of}} experimental studies on different aspects of fruit quality development. A holistic model is presented that describes the major contributing elements. Special attention is directed to the mechanisms underlying the various physiological responses. The study of the relationship between seed set, fruit shape and fruit minerals showed that fruit growth was modular and was strongly influenced by seed distribution and seed growth. This pattern influences the spatial distribution of minerals (e. g. calcium) within the fruit and thus is likely to impact on fruit storage quality. The nature of the developmental stimulus was investigated by in situ applications of the auxin-transport inhibitor, N-(1 -Naphthyl) phthalamic acid (NPA). NPA application reduced vessel differentiation in the stalk, enhanced fruit abscission, and led to a reduced seed and flesh growth. Because of the specificity of the action of NPA, the identity of the developmental stimulus is most likely to be auxin. The slowing and eventual stoppage of calcium import by apples is probably due to a decline in the functionality of its xylem. This decline in functionality was shown to be due to a physical disruption of the vascular bundles caused by flesh expansion. The extent of xylem dysfunction was governed by the {{structure and}} character of the tissue surrounding a particular bundle type. Flesh expansion also influences the textural properties of the fruit. The spatial distribution of intercellular air within the fruit and the shape and mutual disposition of the flesh cells were assessed using novel techniques. The <b>radial</b> pattern of <b>intercellular</b> air was not uniform indicating features that are likely to impact upon gas transfer within the fruit and thus on storage behaviour.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the ovary {{organization}} and oogenesis in Tubificinae have revealed that their ovaries are small polarized structures that are composed of germ cells in subsequent stages of oogenesis {{that are associated with}} somatic cells. In syncytial cysts, as a rule, each germ cell is connected to the central cytoplasmic mass, the cytophore, via only one stable <b>intercellular</b> bridge (ring <b>canal).</b> In this paper we present detailed data about the composition of germ-line cysts in Tubifex tubifex with special emphasis on the occurrence and distribution of the cytoskeletal elements. Using fixed material and live cell imaging techniques, we found that the entire ovary of T. tubifex is composed of only one, huge multicellular germ-line cyst, which may contain up to 2, 600 cells. Its architecture is broadly similar to the cysts that are found in other clitellate annelids, i. e. a common, anuclear cytoplasmic mass {{in the center of the}} cyst and germ cells that are connected to it via intercellular bridges. The cytophore in the T. tubifex cyst extends along the long axis of the ovary in the form of elongated and branched cytoplasmic strands. Rhodamine-coupled phalloidin staining revealed that the prominent strands of actin filaments occur inside the cytophore. Similar to the cytophore, F-actin strands are branched and they are especially well developed in the middle and outermost parts of the ovary. Microfilaments are also present in the ring canals that connect the germ cells with the cytophore in the narrow end of the ovary. Using TubulinTracker, we found that the microtubules form a prominent network of loosely and evenly distributed tubules inside the cytophore as well as in every germ cell. The well-developed cytoskeletal elements in T. tubifex ovary seem to ensure the integrity of such a huge germ-line cyst of complex (germ cells-ring canals-cytophore) organization.
