40|$|Co-organized by the East Asian History of Science Foundation (Hong Kong), Hong Kong Maritime Museum and Education Bureau of the HKSAR GovernmentIn April 1984, a {{relic of}} ship {{component}} used in Ming governmental shipbuilding was unearthed during sediment removal at Penglai 蓬萊 Water Fortress (referred to as the harbour of Dengzhou 登州 in the pre-modern age), Shandong 山東. This relic of 8. 2 m long was a zitan紫檀 wood <b>rudderstock</b> with an inscription “Sixth Month of the Tenth Year of Yongle Reign 永樂 of Ming” (1412). Starting from the <b>rudderstock,</b> the lecture delineates the history of Chinese seafaring, shipbuilding {{and the making of}} sea chart from Tang Dynasty to Zheng He’s 鄭和 voyages in the Ming and reveals the influence of Chinese seafaring technology over countries of East Asia...|$|E
40|$|It is {{observed}} that frequent rudder failures of Sri Lanka Navy’s fast attack craft which {{are equipped with}} conventional propulsion system. Therefore, it was unable to effectively utilize these craft for operational requirements in the Navy. In this research it was analyzed both recently failed fast attack craft rudder and existing rudder fabrication process {{in order to minimize}} this type of rudder failures in future. Analysis of failed rudder and the existing rudder fabrication process was done through macro/micro level inspection, chemical composition analysis and micro hardness testing of relevant materials. Analysis revealed that rudder failed from the welded joint where rudder blade connected to <b>rudderstock</b> and weakening of the weld joint during fabrication. The weld joint was weakened due to formation of intermetallic phases, carbide precipitation, porosities and hot cracks in the heat affected zone of the weld. Therefore, finally rudder was failed as a result of fatigue failure. Use of similar low carbon stainless steel with suitable welding electrodes to ensure final weld lies in austenite region with containing 4 % to 12 % ferrite in the weld could overcome this issue...|$|E
5000|$|Engineers use {{finite element}} method {{analysis}} software to verify designs using DDAM computer simulations that model the known characteristics of underwater explosion phenomena {{as well as the}} surface ship or submarine body responses to shock loading and application of a shock spectra in order to apply the appropriate shock responses at the mountings of shipboard equipment (e.g., masts, propulsion shafts, rudders, <b>rudderstocks,</b> bearings, exhaust uptakes and other critical structures) due to underwater explosions. [...] The analytical process is described in NAVSEA 0908-LP-000-3010, Shock Design Criteria for Surface Ships which provides technical criteria for shock design calculations, and provides general background and educational material concerning application of the DDAM.|$|R
