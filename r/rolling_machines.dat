40|$|Abstract. Virtual {{prototype}} {{technology as}} a new design means, is applied in engineering design and mechanical system performance more and more. In this paper, the change rule {{of the speed of}} cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> was inferred according to the work principle of the machine. And then the model of the cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> was designed, and imported it into the ADAMS software. At last, have a simulation analysis of the cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> with the ADAMS software. From the simulation analysis can know that the characteristic of motion of the cloth <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> is reasonable...|$|R

50|$|The {{least amount}} of {{supplies}} needed to roll one's own cigarettes includes tobacco and rolling papers. However, some prefer to use equipment to aid them in rolling. These can include mechanical <b>rolling</b> <b>machines</b> and cigarette injectors (both mechanical and electric). Filters can also be added when using a rolling machine, and filter tubes are used when making cigarettes with an injector.|$|E

The stud bolt to be manufactured has two varying shank diameter, which cannot be balanced while threading operation in normal machine setup. So this new experimental setup gives a balanced rolling operation and hence improves productivity of the machine in making stud bolt...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{rolling mill}} {{was made by}} the German Company [...] "Demag" [...] {{introducing}} a quick order change system, where the <b>Rolling</b> <b>machines</b> (that weighed around 200 tonnes) were lifted out of the ground put in a dummy pit and the next machine for the next order was dropped in. This method reduced the time to change from one order to another down from around 8 hours to about 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Northwestern Steel used steam {{locomotives}} to move {{scrap metal}} to the furnaces and to transfer hot ingots to the <b>rolling</b> <b>machines,</b> {{long after the}} era of steam engines was bygone in the broader culture. The company usually bought second hand switchers from railroads such as the Illinois Central. The engines used in the mill weren't graceful or agile, like many of those that once pulled passenger trains. They were unseemly and barely capable of moving 40 mph.|$|E

25|$|Threads {{of metal}} {{fasteners}} are usually created on a thread <b>rolling</b> <b>machine.</b> They {{may also be}} cut with a lathe, tap or die. Rolled threads are stronger than cut threads, with increases of 10% to 20% in tensile strength and possibly more in fatigue resistance and wear resistance.|$|R
50|$|In 1936 Washington Dillon's son, P.W. Dillon, {{installed}} two {{electric furnaces}} and <b>rolling</b> <b>machines</b> in {{the barbed wire}} factory {{in order to make}} low carbon steel. Two years later the company became known as Northwestern Steel and Wire. The systems and furnaces were successively upgraded in the ensuing years. During World War II, to keep up with escalating demand, two 50 ton electric furnaces were installed. By 1950 150 ton furnaces were in use. Throughout the years, as production increased, larger furnaces became the norm.|$|E
50|$|In 1872, when Jackson began inventing tea {{processing}} machinery, {{the cost}} of tea production in India was 11 pence a pound. By 1913, improved machinery had cut the cost to 3 pence a pound. Eight thousand <b>rolling</b> <b>machines</b> {{took care of the}} tea which previously would have called for the hand work of a 1.5 million local plantation workers. When tea was first cultivated on plantations, the leaf was rolled by hand, dried over charcoal fires, and trampled into the chests by the workers’ feet. Jackson ushered in the new era of scientific preparation of the leaf in sanitary surroundings with meticulous attention to hygienic requirements.|$|E
5000|$|Pope Manufacturing Company {{was listed}} in the 1876 Boston City Directory, located at 54 High Street. In March 1877, the company drafted {{incorporation}} documents in Connecticut, naming Albert Pope, Charles Pope, and Edward Pope as shareholders. At the time of incorporation, Albert Pope held 595 shares, his father Charles held 400 shares, and his cousin Edward held five shares. [...] The incorporation documents stated the company's intended business activities, [...] "to make, manufacture and sell and licence to others to make, manufacture and sell air pistols and guns, darning machines, amateur lathes, cigarette rollers and other patented articles and to own, sell and deal in patents and patent rights for the manufacture thereof." [...] Pope Manufacturing Company was already selling air pistols and cigarette <b>rolling</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|E
