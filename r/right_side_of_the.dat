5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, and vice versa. Thus, the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull is very {{different from that of the}} left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body is Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai {{is one of the}} rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body is the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E
