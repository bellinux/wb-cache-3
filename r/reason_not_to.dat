5|$|After winning 15 {{games again}} in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give him a raise. He held out {{for much of the}} year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Cross {{recipient}} Cecil Meritt {{cited the}} fact that he already held Canada's highest decoration as a <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be admitted to the Order of Canada. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion; however, he refused on the grounds that, as the consort of the Queen, he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment. In 1993, the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada, making the sovereign's spouse automatically a Companion, but Prince Philip again refused, stating that if he was to be appointed, it should be on his merits. Congruent with these arguments, he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia. In 2013, the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013. Former Premier of Newfoundland Joey Smallwood declined appointment as a Companion because he felt that, as a self-proclaimed Father of Confederation, he deserved a knighthood. Smallwood was never knighted and later accepted induction as a Companion.|$|E

40|$|Using {{attachment}} theory, I examined <b>reasons</b> for <b>not</b> marrying, including {{doubts about}} the self and {{doubts about the}} partner, among emerging adults (N = 89; age range 18 ‐ 25). To explain these <b>reasons</b> for <b>not</b> marrying, I used attachment theory to examine attachment dimensions: avoidance (positive view of self; negative view of others) and anxiety (negative view of self; positive view of others). Also from attachment theory, I examined reports of parental divorce, given its associations with relational struggles. I hypothesized that individuals: 1) higher on anxiety will have more <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> marry based on doubts about self, whereas individuals higher on avoidance will have more <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> marry based on doubts about their partner and; 2) experiencing parental divorce will have more overall <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> marry than individuals not reporting parental divorce. Using proc mixed and a t‐test to examine each hypothesis respectively, I found that neither hypothesis was supported. I conclude that attachment dimensions during emerging adulthood are not associated with marital behaviors at this life stage. Further, parental divorce is <b>not</b> associated with <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> marry, likely given unequal sample sizes (n = 20 reported parental divorce; n = 69 reported no parental divorce) ...|$|R

40|$|Exclusive {{breastfeeding}} and breastfeeding durations in the United States are {{shorter than}} recommended. No U. S. media content analyses assess exclusive breastfeeding. No studies assess exclusive breastfeeding or breastfeeding portrayals in U. S. newspapers. We fill these gaps. Framing theory suggests media present breastfeeding in particular ways {{and that such}} presentations impact breastfeeding. We contribute a systematic theoretical approach {{to the study of}} exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding representations in 819 newspaper articles published across five U. S. regions. This study is limited by its focus on newspapers. However, since exclusive breastfeeding information is identified using a systematic theoretical approach this study contributes new knowledge on the understudied topic of exclusive breastfeeding. Results indicate exclusive breastfeeding is rarely mentioned. Within articles that mention exclusive breastfeeding, articles published in the West had a wider variety of breastfeeding content. The majority of articles were positively valenced. Frequent breastfeeding frames in each region included breastfeeding support, breastfeeding benefits, and breastfeeding problems and/or solutions. In the South, <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> breastfeed was also a frequent frame. In the West, the frames <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> breastfeed and the normalization of breastfeeding were also common and relatively equally frequent. Findings suggest journalists should include more articles about exclusive breastfeeding and fewer articles mentioning <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> breastfeed, particularly in the Southern regions where the <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> breastfeed frame was not accompanied by relatively equally frequent frames such as the normalization of breastfeeding {{as it was in the}} West.
