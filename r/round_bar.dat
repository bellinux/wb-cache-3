25|$|The {{twist drill}} bit {{was invented by}} Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1861. The {{original}} method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a <b>round</b> <b>bar,</b> then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes {{in the same manner}} as cutting helical gears.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E

60|$|The jail at {{the county}} town of the shire of----was one of those old-fashioned dungeons which disgraced Scotland until of late years. When the prisoners and their guard arrived there, Hatteraick, whose {{violence}} and strength were well known, was secured in {{what was called the}} condemned ward. This was a large apartment {{near the top of the}} prison. A <b>round</b> <b>bar</b> of iron,[Footnote: See Note 9.] about the thickness of a man's arm above the elbow, crossed the apartment horizontally at the height of about six inches from the floor; and its extremities were strongly built into the wall at either end. Hatteraick's ankles were secured within shackles, which were connected by a chain, at the distance of about four feet, with a large iron ring, which travelled upon the bar we have described. Thus a prisoner might shuffle along the length of the bar from one side of the room to another, but could not retreat farther from it in any other direction than the brief length of the chain admitted. When his feet had been thus secured, the keeper removed his handcuffs and left his person at liberty in other respects. A pallet-bed was placed close to the bar of iron, so that the shackled prisoner might lie down at pleasure, still fastened to the iron bar in the manner described.|$|E
60|$|There were a {{great many}} booths and stands about, some in open spaces and some under the trees. At one they had all sorts of cakes for sale; at another toys of every kind, such as hoops, balls, kites, balloons, rocking horses, and all such things; and at a third pictures, some large, some small, some plain, and some beautifully colored. At one place, {{by the side of}} the avenue where most of the people were walking, there stood a man, with a tall and gayly-painted can on his back. It was covered with common drapery below; but the top was bright, and towered like a spire above the man's head. There was a <b>round</b> <b>bar,</b> like the leg of a chair, which went from the bottom of the can to the ground, to support it, and take the weight off the man's {{shoulders}} when he was standing still. The man was standing still now, and was all the time tinkling a little bell, to call the attention of the people to what he had to sell. It was something to drink. There were two kinds of drink in the can, separated from each other by a division in the interior. There were two small pipes, one for each kind of drink, leading from the bottom of the can round {{by the side of the}} man to the front, with stopcocks at the end, where he could draw out the drink conveniently. There was also a little rack to hold the glasses. There were three glasses; for the man sometimes had three customers at a time. While Rollo and Jane were looking at this man, a boy came up for a drink. The man took one of the glasses from the little rack, and filled it by turning one of the stopcocks. When the boy had taken his drink and paid the money, the man wiped the glass with a towel which he kept for the purpose; and then, putting it back in its place on the rack, he went on tinkling his little bell.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-roll}} {{process is}} a significant technique {{in the production of}} wire rod, <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles for structural applications. Better mechanical properties of wire rod, <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles can be achieved due to large plastic deformation by the three-roll process. Asymmetric rolling is a novel technique characterised by a kinematic asymmetry linked to the difference in peripheral speed of the rolls, able to introduce additional shear strains through the bar thickness. In order to achieve this, asymmetrical three-roll rolling process was investigated to better control the deformation compared to the conventional three-roll rolling process in a stand with two three-roll calibers located very close to each other. Simulation of round-triangle-triangle pass rolling was performed. FEM simulations were carried out with using software DEFORM 3 D. The influence of the friction coefficient and speed asymmetry on the shear strain and material flow was discussed. The results of simulation can be used to optimize the asymmetric three-roll rolling process to improve the mechanical properties of wire rod, <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles...|$|R

40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. Assumed loading conditions included both remote tension and nut loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the thread flank were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth <b>round</b> <b>bars.</b> Results showed that the stress concentration of a thread causes a considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth <b>round</b> <b>bars.</b> Nut loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of thread root acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter.

40|$|Solid <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> with a {{shoulder}} fillet are frequently used in engineering structures because it facilitates {{a smooth transition}} in thickness. However, the presence of shoulder fillets is currently neglected in the prediction of fatigue crack growth in engineering practice. Since stress concentrating locations like {{a shoulder}} fillet can {{have a significant effect}} on the fatigue crack growth behaviour, neglecting the presence of a shoulder fillet may introduce unacceptable inaccuracies in the current fatigue crack growth predictions done in solid <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> with a shoulder fillet. Experimental research was done on characterizing the effect of shoulder fillets on the fatigue crack growth behaviour in solid <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> loaded in tension. The problem was approached from two points of view: the conventional stress intensity approach and a novel energy approach. Proven methodologies were used for the stress intensity approach, the energy approach had a more exploratory character. The first goal of the research was to investigate the influence of a shoulder fillet on the fatigue crack growth behaviour in solid <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> loaded in tension. The influence of a shoulder fillet was quantified by the development of a stress intensity solution based on the results of fatigue crack growth experiments. The developed stress intensity factor solution was implemented in a fatigue crack growth prediction model for solid <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> with a shoulder fillet loaded in tension. The stress intensity factor range is conventionally used as similarity parameter to predict fatigue crack growth. An issue with this similarity parameter that has received a lot of attention in the past decades is the effect of the stress ratio. Empirically derived equations are proposed in literature to take the effect of the stress ratio into account for fatigue crack growth predictions. Recent literature suggests that this effect of the stress ratio is a reflection of the inadequacy of the stress intensity factor range to uniquely describe the applied load cycle; it was suggested that these stress ratio correction equations mostly compensate for the fact that cyclic stress has been used in a methodology where cyclic energy should have been used instead. The second goal of the research was to investigate how the energy used for a fatigue crack to grow in a complete load cycle relates to the fatigue crack growth rate. A prediction methodology was developed based on the energy released in a complete fatigue cycle rather than at maximum and/or minimum load as is the case in the conventional stress intensity approach. It was found that the average cyclic strain energy release rate could be used as similarity parameter in the developed methodology. The methodology was used to develop fatigue crack growth prediction model for solid <b>round</b> <b>bars</b> with a shoulder fillet loaded in tension. As a result of the research project, it was concluded that the developed fatigue crack growth prediction model, which makes use of the developed stress intensity factor solution, is able to predict fatigue crack growth for different shoulder fillet geometries at one stress ratio; it was less accurate at other stress ratios. It is recommended to do further research to validate the developed stress intensity factor solution. Next to that, it was concluded that the proposed prediction methodology with the average cyclic strain energy release rate as similarity parameter was able to predict fatigue crack growth independently of the applied stress ratio and shoulder fillet geometry. Points of further research are identified to continue the development of the average cyclic strain energy release rate as similarity parameter for the prediction of fatigue crack growth in general.
