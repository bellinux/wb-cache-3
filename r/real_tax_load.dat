Improvement of {{the mechanism of}} use of these tools allows to stimulate cumulative demand therefore develops productions. As, cumulative demand defines a level of production of goods and services. However in many countries with a transitional economy rather high level to <b>tax</b> <b>loading,</b> deficiency of the state budget is observed that negatively influences stability of macroeconomic growth. In this article topical issues of the tax and {{budgetary policy}} {{of the government of}} the Republic of Uzbekistan are considered and scientific and practical recommendations about its improvement are developed. Key words: state budget, public debt, deficiency, surplus, <b>tax</b> <b>loading.</b> One of key questions of a tax policy is providing an optimum level of <b>tax</b> <b>loading</b> for taxpayers. High <b>tax</b> <b>loading</b> limits financial opportunities of managing subjects and by that constrains production development. Besides, the increase in rates of taxes will lead to decrease in expenses of the companies and house farms. Below we will consider level to <b>tax</b> <b>loading</b> in separately taken countries (Karimov, 2009, p. 4) ...|$|R

Analysis showed the <b>tax</b> <b>load</b> of the banks is rather low and does not reach the fifth part of 1 percent. At the same time, by individual branches of the real sector of economy this indicator is in an average for 5 years 5 – 8 percent, which confirms violation {{of the principle of}} proportionality of the taxation system of Ukraine.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of real estate-urbanization relationship, <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> is closely link to urbanization. As {{an important component of}} land urbanization, the number of real estates is positively correlated to the rate of urbanization. As urbanization progresses, real estate prices increases, and hence, increases the amount of <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> revenue; this increment can be used to provide better public services, construct urban infrastructures, and promote the development of real estate industry. In addition, the scarcity of land does not affect <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> as greatly as it affects land finance; <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> allows for a more sustainable tax revenue as compared with land finance, and using <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> to replace land finance helps the modernization of China’s tax system. In addition, <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> may help regulate and control the real estate market, curbing speculative demand and transforming the speculation-oriented market to a consumption-oriented one. <b>Real</b> estate <b>tax</b> is helpful in pushing forward a healthy development of real estate industry, and it is also helpful in improving the urban housing guarantee system, another important part of urbanization system.|$|R
40|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has adopted several contrasting policies {{to address the}} urban housing problem. Among them have been changes in <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> law. The first <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> laws in the PRC were promulgated in January 1950. Amended several times, they became ineffective after 1973. In September 1986, the State Council promulgated a new <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> law affecting all urban properties. According to this new law, <b>real</b> estate <b>taxes</b> are to be levied on owners, so that most <b>real</b> estate <b>taxes</b> have been paid by enterprises rather than households. However, with the recent drive to privatize housing in urban China, property rights are being transferred from public to private ownership, and in conjunction with <b>real</b> estate <b>taxes,</b> this is producing undesired inequalities. This paper investigates the development of real estate taxation, examines the role of property tax in the ongoing housing reform, and recommends changes in <b>real</b> estate <b>taxes</b> that would better achieve the government's egalitarian goals.

40|$|Income {{taxation}} {{may affect}} the regional allocation of population when prices vary over space. Our contribution is to compare different income tax systems in a migration equilibrium model for Norway using improved measure of regional wage differences. We apply register data of individual wages for the entire population to identify wage differences, while controlling for both observable and unobservable worker characteristics and allowing for dynamic learning effects on wages. We estimate regional differences in cost of living based on detailed data on housing prices. The model is calibrated to the current nominal income tax system and compared to an undistorted equilibrium without income tax. We investigate two alternative <b>tax</b> systems: <b>Real</b> income taxation where the <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> burden is proportional to real wages and equal <b>real</b> <b>taxes</b> across regions motivated by taxation of amenities. The numerical simulations document large shifts in the regional distribution of the population {{as the result of}} income taxation. The elasticity of population with respect to tax payments comes out with a value of - 2. 64. Nominal income taxation creates a disincentive to locate in productive high-wage regions, and generates a deadweight loss due to locational inefficiencies equal to 0. 028 % of income. Real income taxation gives a geographic distribution of the population closer to the undistorted equilibrium, and hence with lower deadweight loss, while equal <b>real</b> <b>taxes</b> is the least efficient tax system...|$|R

30|$|Imposing a <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> in Ukraine as a {{stimulus}} for housing {{supply in the}} higher-demand areas is another promising reform. Without a <b>real</b> estate <b>tax,</b> housing is historically treated as a relatively inexpensive consumption commodity by many insiders (e.g. poor elderly citizens). The imposition of a <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> would change the perception of housing from a consumption good to a capital good and expand the rental market for rooms, apartments and houses. This could be particularly beneficial {{as a source of}} affordable housing for potential migrants. The <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> is also worth considering because {{in addition to being a}} source of revenue, it is beneficial for decentralization of public finances – a policy goal that is being pursued by the Ukrainian government with the donor community, and is on the top of the current reform agenda.|$|R
30|$|According to Olivera–Tanzi effect, {{the nexus}} between budget deficit and {{inflation}} exhibits a two-way interaction. That is, {{not only does}} the budget deficit through its impact on money aggregates and expectations produces inflationary pressures, but high inflation also has a feedback effect pushing up the budget deficit. Basically, the process works due to significant lags in tax collections. The problem {{lies in the fact that}} the time of tax obligation’s accrual and the time of actual tax payment do not coincide, with the payment usually made at a later date. We may therefore have the following self-strengthening phenomenon. Persistence of budget deficit props inflation which in turn lowers <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> revenues, a fall in the <b>real</b> <b>tax</b> revenue then necessitates and further increases in the budget deficit and so on. In economic literature, this is referred to as the ‘Olivera–Tanzi effect’ (Olivera 1967).|$|R

40|$|Did {{the mass}} media report in a {{different}} way about the <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> before the Swedish national election 2006 than they did after the election? If there were differences, what could be the cause? This study aims to answer these questions by using a quantitative analysis of articles about the <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> published in the Dagens Nyheter (DN), the biggest morning daily.   The summer before the election, the ‘Alliance’, (the non-socialist coalition, launched an election promise to abolish the <b>real</b> estate <b>tax.</b> Instead they planned to introduce a low community charge. The Alliance won the election and formed a government to implement their election promise.   The analysis was made on all the published articles in DN that covered the <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> issue. In total there were 43 such articles. These where all published between the launch of the campaign promise until the electionday and a month before the proposal was launched 19 / 9 2007, until the proposal was implemented in 2008.   The study results in three interesting conclusions. After the election, when the election promise was about to become political reality, DN reported more negatively about this specific issue. The genre of the articles varied heavily before and after the election. Before the election more news articles where published than after the election and the letters-to-the-editor about the <b>real</b> estate <b>tax</b> were published almost only before the election.
