5|$|It {{has been}} <b>retrospectively</b> {{calculated}} by the International Cricket Council's LG Ratings {{that he was}} the best bowler in the world for much of his career.|$|E
5|$|<b>Retrospectively,</b> McDowell was {{impressed}} {{at how many}} people made {{the connection between the}} film's title and the star Betelgeuse. He added that the writers and producers had received a suggestion the sequel be named Sanduleak-69 202 after the former star of SN 1987A.|$|E
5|$|<b>Retrospectively,</b> Nimrod {{is noted}} for its musical {{diversity}} and experimentation. It contains elements of folk, surf rock, and ska; the lyrical themes discussed on the record include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.|$|E
5|$|EUA, FRG, GDR. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a Unified Team (EUA), {{representing}} the National Olympic Committees of both West Germany and East Germany. <b>Retrospectively,</b> the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) participated as two distinct teams at the Games of 1968-1988.|$|E
5|$|Early 4X {{games were}} {{influenced}} by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen <b>retrospectively</b> as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E
5|$|Jack Rozinsky, 9th dan (Jidokwan), {{founded the}} Shuto Karate Club in 1963; it {{later became the}} Melbourne Taekwondo Centre. As Rozinsky taught tang soo do there, he might be {{considered}} the first taekwondo school founder in Australia (again, if tang soo do were recognised as taekwondo <b>retrospectively),</b> and so might lay claim to the title. Rozinsky did not introduce taekwondo outside Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Ke Hyung No, 8th dan (WTF), {{was invited}} to Australia by the Victoria Judo Federation in 1965, and taught taekwondo {{alongside}} judo. If tang soo do were not recognised as taekwondo <b>retrospectively,</b> No might lay claim to the title. He travelled back to South Korea for further training, returned to Australia in 1971, and established his own martial arts centre at that time. As with Rozinsky, No did not introduce taekwondo outside Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do's {{position}} as the first taekwondo school in Australia might be challenged by the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre (originally the Shuto Karate Club), as tang soo do {{was one of the}} arts taught there. Such status would, however, involve recognising tang soo do as taekwondo <b>retrospectively.</b> The Melbourne Taekwondo Centre incorporated taekwondo into its name in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Stones Bitter has {{suffered}} a decline in sales since the closure, {{and a member of}} the Bass board of directors that took the decision to close the brewery has admitted that, given the subsequent resurgence in golden ales and local provenance in beer, the decision to close the brewery was the wrong one. <b>Retrospectively,</b> he argues that Bass should have backed Stones over Worthington.|$|E
5|$|The ICC player rankings {{have been}} applied <b>retrospectively</b> to cricket history and Trumble {{achieved}} the top ranking as a bowler. By June 1896, he was ranked fifth {{in the world and}} never again slipped lower; from 1899 until his retirement he was the first or second best bowler in the world according to the ratings. As a batsman, Trumble's ranking peaked at twelfth in the world after the Third Test in Adelaide in 1901–02.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} grading scales {{available}} for SAH. The Glasgow Coma Scale is ubiquitously used for assessing consciousness. Three specialized scores {{are used to}} evaluate SAH; in each, a higher number {{is associated with a}} worse outcome. These scales have been derived by <b>retrospectively</b> matching characteristics of people with their outcomes.|$|E
5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest <b>retrospectively</b> described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will <b>retrospectively</b> report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{international}} {{ratings were}} introduced only in 1970, Chessmetrics (a website that uses algorithms to rank performances <b>retrospectively</b> and uniformly throughout chess history) determined that Fischer's peak rating was 2895 in October 1971—the highest in history. His one-year peak (1971) average was 2881, {{the highest of}} all time. His three-year peak average was 2867, from January 1971 to December 1973—the second highest ever, just behind Garry Kasparov. Fischer was ranked as the number one {{player in the world}} for a total of 109 different months, running (not consecutively) from February 1964 until July 1974.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona's Luis Suárez had {{previously}} been involved in two controversies with players in the Juventus squad: in 2012, he was found guilty by an FA commission of using racially insulting language towards Patrice Evra in a game between their respective former clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, and at the 2014 FIFA World Cup he escaped punishment for biting Chiellini but was punished <b>retrospectively.</b> Evra stated that he would shake Suárez's hand before the game, having refused to in a previous game.|$|E
5|$|Chan Yong Kim, 9th dan, was {{the first}} tang soo do {{instructor}} in Australia. He arrived in the early 1960s, sponsored by the Silvertop Taxi Karate Club or the Judo Federation of Australia, and stayed {{for one or two}} years before moving overseas. Kim might be considered the first taekwondo instructor in Australia if tang soo do were recognised as taekwondo <b>retrospectively,</b> and so might lay claim to the title. Kim did not establish a taekwondo school in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{was delighted}} with his team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was <b>retrospectively</b> banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{international}}-class chess at the strong London 1932 tournament, which World Champion Alexander Alekhine won. Milner-Barry's best results in international competition were achieved in three straight {{years at the}} Margate tournaments from 1937–39, and at Hastings 1938. In all four events he finished just above the middle against strong fields, with performance ratings (as calculated by Chessmetrics) between 2538 and 2565. This places him at a solid International Master standard, although he never received this title. He reached as high as No. 65 in the world between June and August 1941, according to Chessmetrics, which ranks historical chess performances <b>retrospectively,</b> using modern algorithms.|$|E
5|$|In Vancouver, the {{organization}} Save the Grizzlies {{was established to}} find a local investor to purchase the team. Led by among others Peter Ufford, they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford <b>retrospectively</b> stated that had the attempt been given more time, {{they may have been}} able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came too quickly for any plan to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30% discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that the team would remain in town.|$|E
5|$|Now, {{the match}} is {{recognised}} as the initial first-class match {{to be played}} in Australia. At the time, {{it is likely that}} the players realised that the game was the first to take place between two Australian colonies, and was therefore a historic occasion. Although there were attempts in Australia to identify first-class matches, no formal definition was applied in Australia until 1947. A meeting of the International Cricket Conference in 1981 agreed that all intercolonial and interstate matches played in Australia before 1947, including the 1851 match, should <b>retrospectively</b> be considered first-class.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, <b>retrospectively</b> known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|Released {{in theaters}} during the film industry's summer season, Deep Blue Sea was a {{moderate}} commercial success, grossing more than $73 {{million in the}} United States and Canada, and $164 million worldwide. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences. Criticism was targeted at its unoriginality and B movie conventions. <b>Retrospectively,</b> Deep Blue Sea has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that {{has been dominated by}} Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic Jaws.|$|E
5|$|<b>Retrospectively,</b> GoldenEye 007 is {{considered}} an important game {{in the history of}} first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Shigesato Itoi {{announced}} in late August 2000 that Mother 3 was cancelled following {{a number of}} delays. Iwata and Miyamoto clarified {{in an interview that}} resources had been moved {{to the development of the}} GameCube, the next Nintendo console. Itoi stated that an additional two years would have been required to finish the game, which was 30% complete at the time of cancellation. Iwata stated <b>retrospectively</b> that the focus on 3D graphics made the project overly complex. Miyamoto also stated that the Mother franchise was not abandoned and that he was still interested in bringing the game to fruition.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita <b>retrospectively</b> in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari {{attempted}} to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|The company bought five bogie trams. They {{had pointed}} ends to ease meeting the shorter trams in the city, {{and had a}} low-floor center section, with {{internal}} steps. The body and mechanical equipment was built by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk, while the electrical components were built by Siemens-Schuckertwerke. Capacity was for 40 or 38 seated passengers. In early 1917, Barth was replaced by H. A. Mørk as director. Trial runs of the tramway started on 11 June 1917. It was <b>retrospectively</b> decided by the ministry that the official opening date was 1 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} to financial success, but initial reviews were mixed, which criticized its violence, later {{contributing to the}} creation of the PG-13 rating. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. Some of the film's cast and crew, including Spielberg, <b>retrospectively</b> view the film in a negative light, partly due to the film being the darkest and most overtly violent Indiana Jones film. The film has also been the subject of controversy due to its portrayal of India and Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|The reigns {{of most of}} the Angevin monarchs were {{marred by}} civil strife and {{conflicts}} between the monarch and the nobility. Henry II faced rebellions from his own sons, the future monarchs Richard I and John. Nevertheless, Henry managed to expand his kingdom, forming what is <b>retrospectively</b> known as the Angevin Empire. Upon Henry's death, his elder son Richard succeeded to the throne; he was absent from England for most of his reign, as he left to fight in the Crusades. He was killed besieging a castle, and John succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|To {{coincide}} with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016, France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995, when only European players were eligible to win the award. 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players; in addition to Pelé and Diego Maradona, Garrincha, Mario Kempes, and Romário were <b>retrospectively</b> recognized as worthy winners. The original recipients, however, remain unchanged. Maradona and Pelé received honorary Ballons d'Or for their services to football in 1996 and 2013, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson (<b>retrospectively)</b> {{delegated}} {{his authority}} from the President under the War Powers Act of 1941 in a memorandum to Groves dated April 17, 1944. Groves delegated {{the authority to}} Nichols, except that contracts of $5 million or more required his authority. The written authority was only given in 1944 when Nichols was about to sign a contract with Du Pont, and {{it was found that}} Nichols original authority to sign project contracts from Colonel Marshall was based on a verbal authority from Styer, and Nichols only had the low delegated authority of a divisional engineer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Miller was {{selected}} for the New Zealand tour, under the captaincy of Queensland's Bill Brown. Miller started the tour well, top-scoring with 139 against Auckland. Along with seven other debutants, Miller made his test debut in the match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, a match that was <b>retrospectively</b> accorded Test status in 1948. On a sticky wicket, New Zealand won the toss and batted. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings as O'Reilly and Ernie Toshack skittled the home side for just 42. Australia made 8/199 with Miller scoring 30. He was allowed to take the new ball in the second innings, taking 2/6 in six overs before a flare-up of his back injury forced him to be removed from the attack. Australia bowled their hosts out for 54, securing an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Australia played its inaugural Test against New Zealand in Wellington, a {{match that}} was <b>retrospectively</b> given Test status. The {{uncertain}} {{status of the}} tour saw the players wearing blazers that were labelled ABC (Australian Board of Control), rather than the Australian coat of arms. Brown led from the front, topping the tour aggregates and averages, with 443 runs at 73.83 in five matches. In the opening tour match against Auckland, Brown elected to bat and opened with 68 as Australia amassed 579 and took victory by an innings and 180 runs. This {{was followed by a}} match against Canterbury in Christchurch, in which Brown top-scored with 137. This laid the foundation for a total of 8/415 and another innings victory. Brown made his second consecutive century in the third match against Otago at Carisbrook in Dunedin, again top-scoring with 106 in an eight-wicket victory. Brown made 34 in the final tour match as Australia defeated Wellington in another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was {{selected}} for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against Queensland making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring New Zealanders, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127not out against Western Australia, but the New South Wales Cricket Association <b>retrospectively</b> deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering Barnes. He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in {{the final game of}} the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by Ernie McCormick. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 runs, averaging 50.56), Barnes {{was selected}} as the youngest member of the Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. <b>Retrospectively,</b> Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. He also noted that the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1891 season, both Crosby and John A. Hartwell, {{the other}} {{starting}} end, who later followed Crosby as Navy football coach, {{were injured in}} a game. While observing a team practice, Hartwell and Crosby noticed the play of backup end Frank Hinkey. After watching Hinkey for a time, Hartwell {{decided to return to}} practicing for fear of losing his starting position; Crosby did not consider this necessary. By the next game, Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and he did not regain the position. The team finished the season with a perfect record and would be <b>retrospectively</b> named national champions. Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university, {{and he was one of}} three graduates presented with a class award. Upon graduation from the school, Crosby enrolled in New York Law School and joined a law office in New York City.|$|E
