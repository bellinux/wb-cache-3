40|$|International audienceFinite Element {{methods are}} {{well suited to}} the {{computation}} of the light distribution in mostly diffuse scenes, but the resulting mesh is often far from optimal to accurately represent illumination. Shadow boundaries are hard to capture in the mesh, and the illumination may contain artifacts due to light transports at different mesh hierarchy levels. To render a high quality image a costly final gather reconstruction step is usually done, which re-evaluates the illumination integral for each pixel. In this paper an algorithm is presented which significantly speeds up the final gather by exploiting spatial and directional coherence information taken from the <b>radiosity</b> <b>solution.</b> Senders are classified, so that their contribution to a pixel is either interpolated from the <b>radiosity</b> <b>solution</b> or recomputed with an appropriate number of new samples.

However these methods are not suitable for obtaining high quality images {{due to the lack}} of error control. Two-pass methods allow to achieve that level of quality computing illumination at each pixel and thus introducing a high computing overhead. We present a two-pass method for radiosity that allows to produce high quality images avoiding most of the per-pixel computations. The method computes a coarse hierarchical <b>radiosity</b> <b>solution</b> and then performs a second pass using current graphics hardware accelerators to generate illumination as high definition textures...|$|E

Before lightmaps were invented, realtime applications relied purely on Gouraud shading to interpolate vertex lighting for surfaces. This only allowed low frequency lighting information, and could create clipping artefacts close to the camera without perspective-correct interpolation. Discontinuity meshing was sometimes used especially with <b>radiosity</b> <b>solutions</b> to adaptively improve the resolution of vertex lighting information, however the additional cost in primitive setup for realtime rasterization was generally prohibitive. Quake's software rasterizer used surface caching to apply lighting calculations in texture space once when polygons initially appear within the viewing frustum (effectively creating temporary 'lit' versions of the currently visible textures as the viewer negotiated the scene).|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} image-space radiosity and {{a hierarchical}} variant {{as a method}} for interactively approximating diffuse indirect illumination in fully dynamic scenes. As oft observed, diffuse indirect illumination contains mainly low-frequency details {{that do not require}} independent computations at every pixel. Prior work leverages this to reduce computation costs by clustering and caching samples in world or object space. This often involves scene preprocessing, complex data structures for caching, or wasted computations outside the view frustum. We instead propose clustering computations in image space, allowing the use of cheap hardware mipmapping and implicit quadtrees to allow coarser illumination computations. We build on a recently introduced multiresolution splatting technique combined with an image-space lightcut algorithm to intelligently choose virtual point lights for an interactive, one-bounce instant <b>radiosity</b> <b>solution.</b> Intelligently selecting point lights from our reflective shadow map enables temporally coherent illumination similar to results using more than 4096 regularly-sampled VPLs...|$|E
