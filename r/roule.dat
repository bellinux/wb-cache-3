50|$|The {{village of}} Lirac lies {{to the west}} of the Rhone in the {{department}} of Gard, a little over 10 km due west of Châteauneuf-du-Pape which is on the opposite side of the river. Besides Lirac itself, the appellation includes the villages of Saint Laurent des Arbres, Saint Géniès de Comolas and Roquemaure which forms a girdle around the appellation. The terroir in Lirac is somewhat similar to Châteauneuf-du-Pape both in variety and hours of sun (2700). The best terroir for red wine is perhaps on the windy plateau Vallongue, shared with Tavel that is only 5 km. away. In the relatively newly planted vineyards one finds plenty of galets <b>roulés</b> that retain heat. The area is slightly cooler that the lowlands.|$|R
50|$|The {{appellation}} {{stretches from}} the eastern bank of the Rhône near Orange in the north-west to Sorgues near Avignon in the south-east. The altitude reaches 120 meters at its highest {{and is in the}} northern part of the appellation. It covers 3200 hectares of land with at least three distinct types of soil or terroirs. In the north and north-east the famous galets <b>roulés,</b> round rocks or pebbles covering the clay soil. The rocks are famous for retaining the heat from the plentiful sun, some 2800 hours a year, releasing it at night, ripening the grapes faster than in the eastern part of the appellation, where the soil is mostly sand, as well as to the south where the soil is more gritty. The powerful mistral wind carries away the moisture, intensifying the dry climate.|$|R
50|$|Crozes-Hermitage, {{along with}} the rest of {{northern}} Rhône has a continental climate that differs from its southern neighbour, which has a more Mediterranean climate. Winters are wet and marked by the cold le mistral winds that can last into the Spring. The appellation is fairly large by Northern Rhône standards, with its 1,238 hectares accounting for approximately half of the entire region's 2,400 hectares. The appellation's boundary begins around 10 km north of Tain-l'Hermitage, extends around the village of Gervans with its south- and south-western granite slopes and then spreads south around Larnage where the land flattens and consists of more clay. Approaching Tain and the village of Mercurol the land rises again and the appellation spreads east. In this region, the soil is mostly rocks, sand and clay. Just south of Tain galets <b>roulés,</b> small surface stones also found extensively in Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the southern Rhône, appear. The southernmost part of the appellation is flat and newly planted.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY The {{first part}} of this study of a Senufo kinship system {{describes}} the descent system, the <b>roules</b> of incorporation and residence, names and behaviour of three subgroups, fodombèlè, sénabèlè and fono : bèlè, who cohabit a restricted geographic area (Ivory Coast Republic, sub-prefecture of Dikodougou). It reconstitutes for these groups, with a social system in the process of changing, the " traditional " kinship system, {{as can be seen in}} aged generations from the rural milieu. It is done through statistical and genealogical surveys, and interviews, but favours spontaneous expression, where there has not been a direct intervention of that poser of questions the researcher often is. Hence the important place given to extracts of songs, biographies and other recordings done as circumstances permitted. The section dealing with alliances, which will appear later, is indissociable from it. Real social engineers, these Senufo sub-groups are equipped with a set of rules closely linked in an integrated system allowing a village type society to produce and reproduce a social fabric of an exceptional cohesion..

25|$|Grenache prefers hot, dry soils {{that are}} well drained but it {{relatively}} adaptable to all vineyard soil types. In southern France, Grenache thrives on schist and granite soils and has responded well to the stony soil of Châteauneuf-du-Pape with the area's galets <b>roulés</b> heat retaining stones. In Priorat, the crumbly schist soil of the region retain enough water to allow producers to avoid irrigation in the dry wine region. Vineyards with an overabundance of irrigation tend to produce pale colored wines with diluted flavors and excessive alcohol. The skin of Grenache is thin and lightly pigmented, making wines with pale color and low tannins. Older vines with low yields can increase the concentration of phenolic compounds and produced darker, more tannic wines such as {{those found in the}} Priorat region of Spain where yields are often around 5-6 hectoliters/hectare (less than half a ton per acre). Yield control is intimately connected with the resulting quality of wine with yields below 35 hl/ha (2 tons/acre), such as those practiced by many Châteauneuf-du-Pape estates, producing very different wines than those with yields closer to 50 hl/ha (5 tons/acre) which is the base yield for Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) wines labeled under the Côtes du Rhône designation. The strong wood canopy of Grenache makes the vine difficult to harvest with mechanical harvesters and pruning equipment and more labor-intensive to cultivate. In highly mechanized wine regions, such as Australia and California, this has contributed to a decline in the vine's popularity.|$|R

[...] Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell [...] Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air [...] 540 [...] In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. [...] As when Alcides from Oealia Crown'd [...] With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore [...] Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, [...] And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw [...] Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde, [...] Retreated in a silent valley, sing [...] With notes Angelical to many a Harp [...] Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall [...] By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate [...] 550 [...] Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. [...] Thir song was partial, but the harmony [...] (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) [...] Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment [...] The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet [...] (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) [...] Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, [...] In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high [...] Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, [...] Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, [...] 560 [...] And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. [...] Of good and evil much they argu'd then, [...] Of happiness and final misery, [...] Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, [...] Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: [...] Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm [...] Pain for a while or anguish, and excite [...] Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest [...] With stubborn patience as with triple steel.

[...] Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, [...] Lethe the River of Oblivion <b>roules</b> [...] Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, [...] Forthwith his former state and being forgets, [...] Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. [...] Beyond this flood a frozen Continent [...] Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms [...] Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land [...] Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems [...] 590 [...] Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, [...] A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog [...] Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, [...] Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air [...] Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. [...] Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, [...] At certain revolutions all the damn'd [...] Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change [...] Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, [...] From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice [...] 600 [...] Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine [...] Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, [...] Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.

6000|$|A day or {{two before}} the Prefect called upon us, however, some {{important}} information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion of Le Commerciel's argument. Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du <b>Roule,</b> chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name [...] "Marie Rogêt." [...] Fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.|$|E
