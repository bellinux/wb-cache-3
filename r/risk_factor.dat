In addition is explored whether the <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and problems are related with the neighborhoods the children live in, or is related with their ethnicity. Method Youth Healthcare registers <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and problems in child development. The registrations of 868 children in the age of two and three years old are collected in four different neighborhoods. Results The results suggest that there is a linear relation between the amount of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and the amount of problems. The accumulation of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> correlates stronger with problems in child development compared to the individual <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Categories of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> which correlate the strongest with problems in child development are contextual <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and parental <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Within the group of children who live in a neighborhood marked as a ´Impulse neighborhood`, or who have a immigrant background, more <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and problems are found. Conclusions The results support the theory that accumulation of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> correlate stronger with negative developmental outcomes then individual <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> do. This study also suggests that children with an immigrant background and children that live in ´Impulse neighborhoods´ have more <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and problems in their development.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for ischemic stroke may vary between {{different groups of}} stroke patients. We examined the distribution of individual well-established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> {{as well as the}} multiplicity of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> in different age groups and among subtypes. Methods: In the Lund Stroke Register, we consecutively enrolled 2, 505 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke from 2001 to 2009 and registered hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, current smoking, hypercholesterolemia as well as stroke subtype. Results: Among young patients (< 55 years), at least 50 % had ≥ 2 <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and 20 - 25 % had ≥ 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> In patients aged 55 years or older, the proportion with ≥ 2 <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> was 70 - 80 % and with ≥ 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> 35 - 45 %. Men and women had a similar burden of <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Approximately 50 % of the cases classified as cardioembolism (CE) and large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) had ≥ 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> which was significantly more than the other TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) subtypes (CE p < 0. 001, LAA p = 0. 001). Conclusions: The {{prevalence of}} well-established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> is similar among young and old stroke patients with large proportions (50 - 80 %) having ≥ 2 <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Even though the prevalence of well-established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> differs between pathogenetic subtypes, these <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> as well as the multiplicity of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> seem to be of clinical importance in all major subtypes of ischemic stroke. © 2014 S.

After controlling for potential <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> of hypertension, the odds ratio of hypertension compared with the absence of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> was 1. 91, 2. 65, 3. 88, 6. 54, and 8. 18 {{for the presence of}} 1, 2, 3, 4, and ≥ 5 <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> respectively (P for trend< 0. 001).

5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> is not the main <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.

Cross-sectional data were obtained on educational level and on the prevalence of smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and low HDL-cholesterol. A total of 36 000 men and women, aged 20 — 59 years participated. For all <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> except alcohol intake, a significant inverse association was found with educational level.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{occurrence}} of well-established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for depression differs across the lifespan. <b>Risk</b> <b>factors</b> {{may be more}} strongly associated with depression at ages when occurrence, and therefore expectance, is relatively low ("on-time off-time" hypothesis). This large-scale study examined absolute and relative risks of established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for depression across the lifespan. METHODS: Participants were 2, 215 currently or never depressed adults aged 18 to 93 years from two cohort studies: NESDA and NESDO. The {{occurrence of}} 19 established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> (absolute <b>risk)</b> was examined in different age groups. In addition, the relative risk of these <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for depression was compared across age groups by examining risk factor[*]×[*]age interaction. RESULTS: The occurrence of all <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> differed significantly across age groups. Although most <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> had significant associations with depression across the lifespan, for five <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> {{the strength of the}} association was age-dependent. Stronger associations with depression in younger age were found for childhood abuse, pain, higher body mass index (BMI) and number of chronic diseases, whereas low income imposed a stronger risk in older age. Associations with depression were strongest in age groups where occurrence was lowest. CONCLUSIONS: Although the exposure to <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> changes across the lifespan, the relative risk associating them to depression remains similar for most <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Some specific <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> (low income, and health factors pain, BMI, and number of chronic diseases), however, seem more strongly associated with depression in ages in which occurrence is lowest and least expected...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} our {{previous}} systematic review of prospective longitudinal studies and examines the early <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> associated with life-course persistent offending (LCP), adolescence-limited (AL) and late-onset (LO) offending. Out of the 55 prospective longitudinal studies which theoretically could possess the relevant information, only four provided information about <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> {{associated with the}} different offending types. An additional three provided data so that relevant analyses could be conducted. The results suggested {{that there was little}} evidence that specific early <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> were associated with specific offending types. There was also limited evidence that specific <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> predicted specific offending types when criminal career duration was included in the definitions of LCP, AL, and LO offending. However, LCP offenders tended to have a greater number of <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> and the magnitude of these was somewhat greater than for AL offenders, who in turn tended to have more <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> (and of a greater magnitude) than LO offenders.
