The central idea of the {{control algorithm}} is to design a H ∞ controller for the structural system and use this controller to determine the optimum control force in the semiactive device. The H ∞ controller is designed using appropriate input and output weighting lters {{that have been developed}} for optimal performance in reducing near-fault earthquake responses. A novel semiactive variable friction device is also developed and with the H∞ controller shown to be eective in achieving response reductions in smart base isolated buildings in near-fault earthquakes. The new variable friction device developed consists of four friction elements and four <b>restoring</b> <b>spring</b> elements arranged in a rhombus conguration with each arm consisting of a friction–stiness pair. The level of friction force can be adjusted by varying the angle of the arms of the device leading to smooth variation of friction force in the device. Experimental results are presented to verify the proposed analytical model of the device. The H ∞ algorithm is implemented analytically on a ve storey smart base isolated building with linear elastomeric isolation bearings and variable friction system located at the isolation level. The H ∞ controller along with the weighting lters leads to the smooth variation of friction force, thus eliminating the disadvantages associated with rapid switching...|$|E

40|$|Construction of {{inductor}} contactless electrical {{machine is}} introduced: generator with excitation from permanent magnets with the decreased moment of resistance at starting. Contactless disk-type multipolar generators with excitation from permanent magnets {{are becoming more}} common in small scale wind and hydropower generation now. It is known {{that this type of}} generators have characteristic disadvantages. In particular, these generators have the effect of magnetic freezing. The effect makes the start of rotation of windwheel and its subsequent acceleration to the rate rpm difficult. To eliminate the effect and to improve starting characteristics construction of generator with variable air gap is suggested. Variable air gap’s size is regulated by centrifugal regulator. For this purpose the part of magnetic circuit of rotor is a moving element. Air gap δ has its maximum value at a motionless rotor or low rotation angular frequency. Herewith magnetic linkage is minimal and generator has an insignificant resistive starting torque. With the increasing of angular frequency magnetic system of rotor moves along the axis of rotation by the force caused by centrifugal regulator. In result air gap decreases, magnetic system increases flux linkage and generator starts to produce electric energy. At reduction of angular rotation frequency under the influence of <b>restoring</b> <b>spring</b> magnetic system of a rotor moves to original position. Technical-economical effect comes from the decreasing of resistive torque of the inductor machine shaft, i. e. improvement of starting characteristics.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a feasibility study on air-riding seal aeroelasticity for large-diameter aero-engines. A literature survey of previous seal studies revealed a significant amount of experimental work but numerical modeling using CFD techniques was relatively scarce. Indeed, most existing theoretical studies either deal with the structural behavior, or use simplified flow modeling. The aeroelasticity stability of a simplified air-riding seal geometry, devised for this particular feasibility study, was analyzed in three dimensions for typical engine operating conditions. Both the unsteady flow and structural vibration aspects were considered in the investigation. The boundary conditions and the seal gap were varied to explore the capabilities and limitations of a state-of-the-art unsteady flow and aeroelasticity code. The methodology was based on integrating the fluid and structural domains in a time-accurate fashion by exchanging boundary condition information at each time step. The predicted characteristics, namely lift and flow leakage as a function of pressure and seal gap, were found to be in agreement with the expected behavior. Operating seal gaps were determined from the actual time histories of the seal motion under the effect of the aerodynamic and the <b>restoring</b> <b>spring</b> forces. Both stable and unstable cases were considered. It was concluded that, in principle, the existing numerical tools could be used for the flow and aeroelasticity analyses of hydrostatic seals. However, due to large Mach number variations, the solution convergence rate was relatively slow and it was recognized that a preconditioner was needed to handle seal flows. For small gaps of about 10 microns, typical of spiral groved seals, the flow has a high Knudsen number, indicating that the Navier-Stokes formulations may no longer be valid. Such cases require a totally different treatment for the modeling of steady and unsteady aerodynamics, either by modifying the transport parameters of the Navier-Stokes equations or by considering rarefied gas dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Many {{wave energy}} convertors are {{designed}} to use either vertical (heave) or horizontal (surge) movements of waves. But the frequency response of small heaving buoys and oscillating water column devices shows that they are too stiff and so their resonance is at too short a period. A device moving in the horizontal (surge) direction has less <b>restoring</b> <b>spring</b> and so its resonance is at too long a period. It follows that a device that moved at some intermediate slope angle could have an intermediate value of hydrodynamic stiffness and so be resonant at a variable and desirable part of the wave spectrum. There have been two series of model tests in this work. The first used a simple free-floating model with no power take-off apparatus and with constraint achieved {{by means of a}} large inertia plate lying in the slope plane. The second used a rig that constrained the slope movement of the buoy head by means of hydrostatic bearings running on a guide rod set to the chosen slope angle. An external power take-off system was used to simulate a linear damper for absorbing the incident wave energy and control the motion of the model. This thesis firstly studies the potential of varying the slope angle as a way of tuning the natural period of the device to suit useful wave periods. Secondly, it studies the experimental and theoretical power capture ability of models with different slope angles in regular waves in the frequency domain. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the model were determined both experimentally and numerically based on linear hydrodynamic concepts. The power absorption of the models was calculated using the experimental data of the hydrodynamic coefficients and also measured directly. Some control of power take-off was also investigated. Some irregular wave tests were carried out for the 45 degrees slope angle case. The results show that it is feasible to alter the slope angle of the device as a way of tuning its natural period. However, in further studies of the power capture ability for different slope angles, the device shows a very wide bandwidth and high efficiency performance when it is set to 45 degrees slope angle. This suggests that to constrain the device to a 45 degrees slope angle is suitable for most of the sea states...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an {{endoscopic}} forceps manipulator with 2 -DOFs bending {{mechanism by}} multi-slider linkage mechanisms and 1 -DOF wire-driven grasping mechanism. Careful {{design of the}} linkage channels and <b>restoring</b> <b>springs</b> enabled unique, independent and stable bending procedure from − 90 to 90 degrees on the horizontal and vertical plane to secure large working space. The manipula-tor consisted of a multi-DOFs end-effector, three linear-drive units and a computer-based control unit. For the interface, various systems were available according to the application, such as a handheld-type and a master-slave-type. In mechanical performance analyses, 2 -DOFs bending mechanism enabled high accuracy of less 1. 0 degree manipulation and stable bending power of up to 0. 85 kgf. In vivo experiments, this manipulator performed some laparoscopic sur-gical tasks, such as raising the liver and the stomach, suturing and ligation the cystic duct. In master-slave control evaluation, we confirmed a possibility of so-phisticated operation for telesurgery. In conclusion we are sure of a usefulness of an endoscopic forceps manipulator for speedy and dexterous surgery. ...|$|R

Large space structure technology (LSST) systems {{will have to}} accommodate (among others) : ocean data systems; electronic mail systems; large multibeam antenna systems; and, space based solar power systems. The structures are to be delivered into orbit by the Space Shuttle. Because of their inherent size, modelling techniques and scaling algorithms must be developed so that system performance can be predicted accurately prior to launch and assembly. When the size and weight-to-area ratio of proposed LSST systems dictate that the entire system be considered flexible, {{there are two basic}} modelling methods which can be used. The first is a continuum approach, a mathematical formulation for predicting the motion of a general orbiting flexible body, in which elastic deformations are considered small compared with characteristic body dimensions. This approach is based on an a priori knowledge of the frequencies and shape functions of all modes included within the system model. Alternatively, finite element techniques can be used to model the entire structure as a system of lumped masses connected by a series of (<b>restoring)</b> <b>springs</b> and possibly dampers.
