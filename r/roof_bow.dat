As {{part of an}} order for North Carolina, the company produced 200 wood-bodied school buses for $195-$225 (depending on size), beginning a long tradition with that state that continues to the present day. [...] In 1938, Thomas made a major change to its design as it introduced its first bus body made completely of steel. [...] Although not the first manfucturer to construct an all-steel body, an innovation of the company would later become adopted by all school bus manufacturers. Thomas used <b>roof</b> <b>bows</b> stamped from {{a single piece of}} metal (rather than several pieces welded to one another); essentially, the design of the bus allowed the roof to be supported by several internal roll bars welded to each side of the floor. [...] In practice, while the design has been updated for added strength, single-piece <b>roof</b> <b>bows</b> are in use in all school buses manufactured in North America today.|$|R

This study was carried out at Volvo Group Trucks Technology with the purpose {{to learn about the}} aeroacoustics around a <b>roof</b> <b>bow</b> in combination with cavities as well as looking into methodologies. This Master's thesis is focused on the first part of a two step hybrid approach for noise simulation, meaning to simulate the ow using computational uid dynamics (CFD). Both stationary and transient simulations with aeroacoustic treatment were performed. Different turbulence models such as large eddy simulations (LES), detached eddy simulations (DES) and unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) were tested. Acoustic sources were looked upon with help of acoustical analogies such as Curle and Proudman, both derived from Lighthill's analogies. It was realized that the bow studied introduces broad banded noise, which could be related to its shedding frequency. Also the cavities seemed to produce broad banded noise, particularly at higher frequencies. The results reveals that LES is costly and requires approximately twice the computation time of DES and a considerably denser mesh...|$|E

5000|$|The 2007 Delica D:5 {{is built}} around Mitsubishi’s {{next-generation}} RISE unibody design (GS platform). It employs a [...] "rib bone frame" [...] design that uses closed-section joins to link the pillars, <b>roof</b> <b>bows</b> and underfloor cross members in hoops at the pillars and the rear door opening to realize significant improvements in body rigidity and durability {{as well as to}} provide better crashworthiness. It makes more extensive use of rust-resistant steel in the floor structure than the previous generations. Body corrosion resistance has also been significantly improved through the more extensive use of underfloor sealing and with the application of more undercoat. It uses fender panels made of a plastic resin that is flexible and can recover its shape. The switch to this material reduces weight by about 4 kg and makes the fenders more resistant to damage in minor impacts.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} long span load bearing roof systems made of wooden elements. The first part {{explains}} the general characteristics of wood. It also describes the mechanical properties and presents {{their relation to}} wood type and the direction of loading by means of informational values. This part continues with the presentation of most commonly used fasteners {{as well as all}} required elements for proving the load-bearing capacity and specific features of glued laminated timber (glulam). The second part concentrates on glued laminated timber and describes its production and advantages and weaknesses in comparison to solid wood. It concentrates on particularities that are not connected to the use of solid wood. It analyizes the behaviour of these elements, the types of failure and the characteristics that lead to failure. Modelling of glued laminated elements is analyzed and the models for manual and computer analysis are shown that are continuously perfected. The next theme of this chapter are glues, the choice of which, besides the choice of wood, is of vital importance in the production of glued laminated trusses. The specificities of <b>roof</b> <b>bows</b> are shown, where the influence of the choice of statics system and longitudinal connections on the global stability of the construction is determined. The third part presents wooden trusses and different forms of roof constructions in relation to the greatest possible span, allowed by each construction. The analysis of most commonly used elements for connecting wooden parts of a truss is made. The development of models of trusses and their optimisation leads to the conclusion that deformations in the truss often result from movements at joints. The diploma thesisr presents other possibilities of using composite construction timber that is not glued laminated timber (glulam), with the intention of increasing the span of wooden load-bearing structures of roofs. Some examples of wooden load-bearing structures of roofs are presented and the diploma thesis notes that greatest spans are achieved both by trusses and by glued laminated timber, a combination of both or by other composite structures. ...|$|R

Inside, much greater changes were made--there, indeed, the old house was completely remodelled, new paper, new paint, new furniture and fittings of every description. Modern windows were put in where practicable, that is, wherever they could be inserted without violent incongruity with the style of architecture; part of the house indeed--that part containing the principal apartments--was entirely modernized, party walls were pulled away, small rooms thrown into large ones, the ceilings and <b>roofs</b> raised, <b>bow</b> windows thrown out, and a bright, cheerful air given to it.|$|R

50|$|The White County Courthouse {{is located}} at Court Square {{in the center of}} Searcy, Arkansas, the county seat of White County. It is a two story structure, built out of stone and brick, with a hip roof capped by an {{elaborate}} cupola with clock faces in its <b>bowed</b> <b>roof.</b> The building is roughly H shaped, with wings at the sides that project slightly to the front and rear. The ground floor is faced in dressed stone, while the upper floor is finished in brick. Entrance is made through an arcade of rounded arches, which support a Greek pedimented temple projection that has four fluted Corinthian columns. The courthouse was built in 1871 and enlarged by the addition of the wings in 1912. In addition, repairs were conducted by the Civil Works Administration in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|Bushnell's {{house is}} a Richardsonian Romanesque {{structure}} built primarily of stone: besides the various stone types composing the foundation and walls, the house features a slate roof and elements of granite. A large porch is placed {{at the front of}} the house, with a semicircular bow window above the porch and a two-story octagonal tower to the side. The roofs are of various types: that of the tower rises to a steep point, while other sections are gabled. Vertical elements include numerous chimneys, placed at widely separated points on the roofline, as well as the paired columns that support the porch roof. Small oculi are built into several sides of the tower, above the second-story windows, while a semicircular window in the front gable overlooks the <b>roof</b> of the <b>bow</b> window. [...] These elements combine to convey a sense of sheer mass, typical of houses built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style.|$|R
50|$|The {{workshop}} and saddle shed combine {{to form a}} large covered work space to serve a number of functions - garage, workshop, stables and saddle shed. A feature of these buildings {{is the use of}} corrugated iron <b>bow</b> <b>roofs.</b> The workshop is constructed of heavy bush timber uprights and bearers supporting the central bow-roof section, descending to skillion roof sections {{on each side of the}} shed. The building, which was used at various times as a workshop, garage, storeroom and living quarters; is open except on the eastern side where corrugated iron partitions form two lock-up rooms fitted with sawn timber storage shelves and corrugated iron push-out shutters. The floor for the storerooms is of concrete. The remainder of the building has an earth floor. Timber shelves for tools and spare parts extend along one wall. The interior of the workshop also retains a heavy timber anvil stand. A low-set timber tank stand is located at the southern end of the workshop adjacent to the horse yard site. As Laura station covers mainly black soil and sandy country the stock horses did not require shoeing. There has not been a smithy for shoeing at the homestead since the early 1940s.|$|R

Of which spire the {{largeness}} and age {{are also}} opposed exactly {{to the chief}} appearances of modern England, as one feels them on first returning to it; that marvellous smallness both of houses and scenery, so that a ploughman in the valley has his head on a level with the tops of all the hills in the neighborhood; and a house is organized into complete establishment,--parlor, kitchen, and all, with a knocker to its door, and a garret window to its <b>roof,</b> and a <b>bow</b> to its second story,[3] {{on a scale of}} twelve feet wide by fifteen high, so that three such at least would go into the granary of an ordinary Swiss cottage: and also our serenity of perfection, our peace of conceit, everything being done that vulgar minds can conceive as wanting to be done; the spirit of well-principled housemaids everywhere, exerting itself for perpetual propriety and renovation, so that nothing is old, but only [...] "old-fashioned," [...] and contemporary, as it were, in date and impressiveness only with last year's bonnets. Abroad, a building of the eighth or tenth century stands ruinous in the open street; the children play round it, the peasants heap their corn in it, the buildings of yesterday nestle about it, and fit their new stones into its rents, and tremble in sympathy as it trembles. No one wonders at it, or thinks of it as separate, and of another time; we feel the ancient world to be a real thing, and one with the new: antiquity is no dream; it is rather the children playing about the old stones that are the dream. But all is continuous; and the words, [...] "from generation to generation," [...] understandable there. Whereas here we have a living present, consisting merely of what is [...] "fashionable" [...] and [...] "old-fashioned;" [...] and a past, of which there are no vestiges; a past which peasant or citizen can no more conceive; all equally far away; Queen Elizabeth as old as Queen Boadicea, and both incredible. At Verona we look out of Can Grande's window to his tomb; and if he does not stand beside us, we feel only that he is in the grave instead of the chamber,--not that he is old, but that he might have been beside us last night. But in England the dead are dead to purpose. One cannot believe they ever were alive, or anything else than what they are now--names in school-books.|$|R
