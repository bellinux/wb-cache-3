50|$|U.S. 171 is a {{major highway}} and is mostly divided, except through some towns. Beginning south to north from U.S. 90 the highway crosses I-10 then through Moss Bluff and the {{community}} of Gillis before entering Beauregard Parish. Next the community of Ragley, at the junction of U.S. Route 190 and Louisiana Highway 12. U.S. 171 continues north running concurrent with U.S. 190. The highway travels through the community of Longville before entering DeRidder. In DeRidder U.S. 171 crosses the Kansas City Southern Railroad tracks and passes through the DeRidder Commercial Historic District before splitting with U.S. 190. The old Sawmill community of Luddington is within the northern city limits. The northern city limits is also the Vernon Parish line. The old sawmill town of Midway {{is less than a}} mile north of DeRidder. About two miles north is the community of Rosepine. Two miles north of Rosepine is the site of the old Neame sawmill community. At a point in history this was a booming town with only two abandoned graves and a mill pond as memories. One graveyard, in a field south of a chip mill, is blocked by trees surrounding it or it would otherwise be in plain sight of the highway. U.S. 171 travels through the community of Pickering and the junction of LA 10, the main entrance to Fort Polk, Louisiana, New Llano, then into the city of Leesville. In Leesville U.S. 171 intersects with west Louisiana Highway 8 (to Texas) and runs concurrent with east LA 8 to the junction of LA 8/LA 28 east to Alexandria at the north Leesville city limits. A newly opened <b>roundabout</b> (<b>traffic</b> circle) completes the junction with LA 28, to hopefully correct several fatal car crashes at the intersection.|$|E
50|$|A {{collector}} road usually {{consists of a}} mixture of signaled intersections, <b>roundabouts,</b> <b>traffic</b> circles, or stop signs, often {{in the form of}} a four&#8209;way stop.

In North America, a {{collector road}} normally has traffic lights at an intersection with an arterial road, whereas roundabouts are more commonly used in Europe.|$|R

40|$|Abroad, large roundabouts are {{accepted}} as a safe and efficient basic form for intersections. In Germany, large roundabouts are also regarded as very efficient but have, until now, exhibited major safety-related shortcomings. It is particularly the solutions based on design principles from {{the sixties and seventies}} which have developed into accident black spots as the level of car ownership has increased. The objective of the research paper was to establish and portray traffic-related and surroundings-oriented fields of application for these solutions on classified roads {{on the basis of a}} systematic investigation of the problem areas of roundabouts with andd without traffic lights. This was based on the results not only of extensive empirical investigations on eleven selected large <b>roundabouts</b> without <b>traffic</b> lights but also of a before-and-after comparison relating to the conversion of three large <b>roundabouts</b> without <b>traffic</b> lights into <b>roundabouts</b> with <b>traffic</b> lights. For existing large <b>roundabouts</b> without <b>traffic</b> lights, recommendations for efficient and cost-saving conversion measures which are intended to reduce safety-related shortcomings were derived from the investigation results. In this respect, the spectrum ranged from the reorganisation of individual designing elements to the subsequent installation of traffic lights. The efficiency of large <b>roundabouts</b> with <b>traffic</b> lights was determined with the aid of empirical investigations and on the basis of results from traffic-simulation runs. As a rule, it is considerably higher than the efficiency of large <b>roundabouts</b> without <b>traffic</b> lights. On the basis of the results of this research paper which, for the first time, went beyond an analysis of the obviously existing safety-related shortcomings of large roundabouts, a distinction with regard to utilisation criteria was made between large roundabouts with and without traffic lights as well as between their locations inside or outside built-up areas. In this respect, it must be borne in mind that it has not yet been possible to prove that large <b>roundabouts</b> without <b>traffic</b> lights are safer with improved designing elements. Therefore, these utilisation criteria must be regarded as provisional. The question relating to the expediency of switching off the traffic lights in periods of light and normal traffic was discussed once again for <b>roundabouts</b> with <b>traffic</b> lights. However, it could not be investigated in great detail within the framework of this research paper. (orig.)

30|$|The {{proposed}} {{system for}} automated traffic data collection for roundabouts takes recorded videos of <b>roundabout</b> <b>traffic</b> as inputs.

In other words, the developed system is currently processing videos offline. However, online processing of the videos is very approachable if the computing systems, such as a regular PC, were integrated into the camera-based vision systems, which {{is beyond the scope}} of this paper.|$|E

40|$|This report {{gives an}} account of a study into rules {{governing}} priority for cyclists on roundabouts constructed in The Netherlands after the year 1985, with separate cycle paths. At these relatively new roundabouts, approaching traffic has {{to give way to}} <b>roundabout</b> <b>traffic.</b> Until recently, cyclists in these traffic situations were not given priority. Attention is also given to the `right-of-way rule' on Dutch roundabouts dating from before 1985. Traffic usually does not have `right-of-way' on these older roundabouts. The study consisted of the following parts: (1) a brief literature study; (2) a survey conducted among Dutch highway department members; (3) traffic observation tests carried out at Dutch roundabouts with separate cycle paths; and (4) a small-scale, comparative accident study. Priority should be given to traffic on roundabouts dating from before 1985, in the interests of both safety and of road capacity. It is also recommended that cyclists should not be given `right-of-way' on roundabouts with separate cycle paths. This recommendation is made in view of both the local safety situation and of the safety on roundabouts in general (standardization) ...|$|E
