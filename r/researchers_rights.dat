Her account offered a rare, thoughtful consideration of a complex Caribbean sexual culture, and continues to challenge conventional knowledges and practices of <b>researchers,</b> <b>rights</b> advocates and policy makers engaged in the struggle for sexual justice. In April 2009, Professor Wekker and I met at her home in Amsterdam—where she is both Chair in Gender and Ethnicity Studies at the Faculty of Arts at Utrecht University and Director of the Centre of Expertise on Gender, Ethnicity and Multiculturalism—and shared our thoughts about some contemporary debates and questions her work informs and inspires...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{concerns}} about competence and voluntariness, the mentally disordered constitute a vulnerable population {{in the context of}} nontherapeutic biomedical research and, as such, are in need of protection. Despite others ’ concern about protecting the mentally disordered, their decision-making potential should also be respected and maximized, allowing such individuals to consent to participate in experiments subject to an evaluation of their competence to make such a decision. Competent mentally disordered persons who anticipate future incapacity should be able to issue research directives or durable powers of attorney whereby they can provide explicit consent to participate in nontherapeutic research. When he or she becomes incompetent, a substitute decision maker should be able to provide consent on behalf of the mentally disordered person within established parameters. Nontherapeutic experimentation with the mentally disordered should be permitted, but only within the boundaries of ethical permissibility delineated by legislated guidelines. At present, the legal status of substituted consent for nontherapeutic procedures is uncertain and requires legislation, which in addition to legalizing such consent, would provide guidelines for substitute decision makers and for the creation of research directives. These guidelines should include restrictions on the scope of research, obligations of <b>researchers,</b> <b>rights</b> of subjects, and responsibilities of research ethics committees (RECs). In all cases, the voluntary and informed consent of the person or substitute decision maker must be obtained...|$|E
