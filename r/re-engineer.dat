5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to <b>re-engineer</b> and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E
25|$|When {{the process}} becomes too complex or inefficient, and {{optimization}} is not fetching the desired output, {{it is usually}} recommended by a company steering committee chaired by the president / CEO to <b>re-engineer</b> the entire process cycle.

25|$|Evaluations {{of various}} types of foreign {{aircraft}} were conducted to find a replacement; however, it was determined in 1965 that the most economical solution would be to <b>re-engineer</b> the existing aircraft with a modern turboprop engine. Accordingly, work began {{under the direction of}} Jean-Pierre Weibel to convert the 102nd C-3603 into the prototype C-3605.|$|E

25|$|A better {{solution}} was proposed {{as long ago}} as 1980 by Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA Maryland, USA) who called their device a 'dynapod'. Their idea is to <b>re-engineer</b> common Home appliance with small (fractional – less than 1-horsepower) electric motors (c. 500W – 1000W) which are used for short periods, for example food mixers, grinding machines, hand-held power-drills and light wood-working equipment.|$|E
25|$|Highway {{fatalities}} {{have decreased}} nationally, but by 2001, had increased in Florida and locally. Officials {{were focused on}} setting and enforcing speed limits and widening the local turnpike. The flatness of the area prevented runoff during rainstorms and caused cars to hydroplane. The highway department has taken measures to <b>re-engineer</b> roads to avoid hydroplaning. Fatalities reached a high of 99 in 2007. In 2009 there were 51 fatalities.|$|E
25|$|According to Clayton Christensen, {{disruptive}} innovation {{is the key}} to future success in business. The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity. The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and <b>re-engineer</b> their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E

25|$|Despite a U.S. ban on {{the export}} of helium under the Helium Control Act of 1927, the Germans {{designed}} the airship to use the far safer gas {{in the belief that}} they could convince the US government to license its export. When the designers learned that the National Munitions Control Board would refuse to lift the export ban, they were forced to <b>re-engineer</b> Hindenburg to use hydrogen for lift. Despite the danger of using flammable hydrogen, no alternative lighter-than-air gases could provide sufficient lift. One beneficial side effect of employing hydrogen was that more passenger cabins could be added. The Germans' long history of flying hydrogen-filled passenger airships without a single injury or fatality engendered a widely held belief they had mastered the safe use of hydrogen. Hindenburgs first season performance appeared to demonstrate this.|$|E
25|$|Continuing their {{participation}} of AVTC's, CSULA {{is involved with}} General Motors' new competition series called EcoCAR3. This competition is a 4-year competition where 16 Universities across northern America were donated a 2016 Chevy Camaro and are focused on converting this traditional fossil fuel vehicle into a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. CSULA's team has focused on developing a post transmission parallel architecture for their vehicle. Additionally, the team has decided to deviate from the standard expectation of marketing their developed vehicle to consumers and is instead targeting Law Enforcement Fleets as a business to business focus. The EcoCar3 team will have four years (2014–18) to redesign and <b>re-engineer</b> a Chevy Camaro {{in an effort to}} reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of the vehicle, while maintaining consumer acceptability, performance, utility and safety. At the end of the four year, the student-build vehicles will participate in an over-the-road event, raising the stakes for vehicle, dependability and safety.

25|$|Aguinaldo was {{captured}} at Palanan, Isabela on March 23, 1901 and {{was brought to}} Manila. Convinced of the futility of further resistance, he swore allegiance to the United States and issued a proclamation calling on his compatriots {{to lay down their}} arms, officially bringing an end to the war. However, sporadic insurgent resistance continued {{in various parts of the}} Philippines, especially in the Muslim south, until 1913.In 1900, President McKinley sent the Taft Commission, to the Philippines, with a mandate to legislate laws and <b>re-engineer</b> the political system. On July 1, 1901, William Howard Taft, the head of the commission, was inaugurated as Civil Governor, with limited executive powers. The authority of the Military Governor was continued in those areas where the insurrection persisted. The Taft Commission passed laws to set up the fundamentals of the new government, including a judicial system, civil service, and local government. A Philippine Constabulary was organized to deal with the remnants of the insurgent movement and gradually assume the responsibilities of the United States Army.|$|E

500|$|By this stage, Holden's 24‑year‑old six-cylinder was {{thoroughly}} outmoded {{and would have}} been difficult to <b>re-engineer</b> to comply with pending emission standards and the introduction of unleaded fuel. This led Holden to sign a deal with Nissan of Japan to import their RB30E engine. This seemed a good idea in 1983 when the Australian dollar was strong; however by 1986 the once viable prospect became rather expensive. The public quickly accepted what was at first a controversial move, as reports emerged of the improvements in refinement, 33percent gain in power and 15percent better economy over the carburettor version of the VK's Black straight-six. An optional turbocharger appeared six months later and lifted power output to [...] In October 1986, an unleaded edition of Holden’s carburettored V8 engine was publicised. Holden had originally planned to discontinue the V8 to spare the engineering expense of converting to unleaded. However, public outcry persuaded them to relent. VLs in New Zealand were also available with the 2.0-litre six-cylinder RB20E engine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{necessity}} to <b>re-engineer</b> the forward fuselage was time-consuming but, {{after several months}} of delays, the [...] "205N" [...] was ready. The C.205N1 first flew on 1 November 1942, with armament consisting of a 20mm cannon firing through the propeller hub, and four cowling-mounted 12.7mm (.5in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns for which it carried 300-400 and 1,400 rounds of ammunition respectively. This configuration allowed a higher ceiling, but less speed (629km/h/391mph), however, the better aerodynamics (with a longer and more streamlined rear fuselage) provided an overall advantage over the Macchi C.205V/MG151 (620km/h/385mph).|$|E
2500|$|One {{compromise}} {{that had to}} be reached over the placement of the engines was that they were mounted in a straight line. Most airships of the period had their engines mounted at different heights {{along the length of the}} hull, which allowed each propellor to operate in relatively [...] "clean" [...] air that had not been displaced by the propeller in front. However, attempting to <b>re-engineer</b> the structure of the hull to try and stagger the placement of the engines was seen as both adding too much weight and being too complex.|$|E

2500|$|Oldsmobile's {{original}} intention for {{the second}} generation was to move the Aurora further upmarket, retaining its V8-only drivetrain and sharing a platform with the new Buick Riviera, as the original Aurora had done. This would have created more room within the Oldsmobile lineup for a four-door Eighty-Eight successor known as the [...] "Antares". However, Buick dropped its Riviera development plans and fiscal trouble found Oldsmobile, so Oldsmobile was forced to <b>re-engineer</b> the Antares into an acceptable Aurora in short time. Still using the G-body design, the re-engineered Aurora was the result, but retaining its 4.0 V8 Northstar still mounted to a 4T80-E.|$|E
