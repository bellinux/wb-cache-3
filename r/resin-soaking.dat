5000|$|Heterobasidion irregulare causes both {{above and}} below-ground {{symptoms}}. Above-ground symptoms of infected trees consist of reduced height growth, patches of dead and declining trees, wind-thrown trees, reduced shoot and diameter growth, and <b>resin-soaking</b> {{at the root}} collar. Additionally, the crown may become thin and foliage (leaves or needles) becomes chlorotic. The characteristic symptom of most tree root disease, including this type, is a disease center. This occurs when the fungus has infected one tree and then spreads through the roots to other trees and kills them too. This creates a pattern of old dead trees {{in the center of}} the pocket and progressively newer dead, chlorotic, then healthy trees, usually in a circular area. Below-ground symptoms of H. irregulare include excessive pitch production, stringy, white root decay, and root lesions. Signs include the formation of white mycelia between bark scales followed by conks (fruit bodies) that usually form in the duff layer at the base of the tree or stump. The fruit bodies can also form as [...] "foam" [...] on the ground rising from roots under the surface.|$|E
500|$|Burning pitch {{was used}} on occasion; the Mongols {{were known to}} fire {{containers}} of burning tar during sieges using catapults and trebuchets. [...] Wheels could be covered in pitch, set alight, and rolled along; this technique was commonly used during the Crusades. [...] The besieged Carthaginians in Motya, 398 BC, [...] set alight the siege engines of the attacking Syracusan forces under Dionysius I by dropping burning charred logs and <b>resin-soaked</b> oakum; however, the Syracusans were able {{to put out the}} fires.|$|R
5|$|Lit torches (burning sticks) {{were likely}} the {{earliest}} form of incendiary device. They {{were followed by}} incendiary arrows, which were used throughout the ancient and medieval periods. The simplest flaming arrows had oil- or <b>resin-soaked</b> tows tied just below the arrowhead and were effective against wooden structures. Both the Assyrians and the Judeans used fire arrows at the siege of Lachish in 701 BC. More sophisticated devices were developed by the Romans which had iron boxes and tubes which were filled with incendiary substances and attached to arrows or spears. These arrows needed to be shot from loose bows, since swift flight extinguished the flame; spears could be launched by hand or throwing machine.|$|R

The text reads as : (Side 1) 2 ̆ 2 The naval stores {{industry}} was important to maritime power worldwide. Pine tar and pitch were used to seal wooden ships and protect sails and rigging. When settlers came to America - in Florida (1565), in Virginia (1607) and in Massachusetts (1620) - they found vast pine forests with resinous tar and pitch, a scarce commodity for European competitors with wooden fleets. Settlers at first produced pine pitch and tar by distilling <b>resin-soaked</b> fat pine wood from dead tree logs, limbs and knots, covering them with soil and burning them to yield tar and charcoal. After fat pine wood became scarce, pitch was made by chopping deep cavities or boxes near the base of living trees to collect gum. Only crude gum was exported until simple distillation techniques separated volatile turpentine from the residual rosin poured hot into barrels for domestic use or export. During the next three hundred years, with little change, this forest product industry prospered, first in the Carolinas, then Georgia and Florida to become a major U. S. industry. Production of gum was greatly accelerated and tree life protected when the Herty clay cups, introduced in early 1900 ’s, replaced cut boxes. 2 ̆ 2 Sponsors: FLORIDA SOCIETY OF AMERICAN FORESTERS AND THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF STATE[URL]...|$|R
