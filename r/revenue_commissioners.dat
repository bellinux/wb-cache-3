5|$|In December 2006, the Irish High Court held in Zappone v. <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> that {{marriage}} {{as defined in}} the Irish Constitution was {{between a man and}} a woman and that there was no breach of rights in the refusal of the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> to recognise foreign same-sex marriages.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} amendment {{designed to}} postpone a vote attracted much acrimony. This postponement was {{to allow for}} input from then ongoing investigations: the Law Reform Commission, the High Court Zappone v. <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> case on a Canadian marriage and the Constitutional Review Committee. Eventually, it was agreed to debate the bill but adjourn a vote indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples {{would be open to}} constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption of partnership for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v. <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners.</b>|$|E

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners,</b> ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

In August 2003 Haughey was forced to sell his large estate, Abbeville, in Kinsealy in north County Dublin for €45 million to settle legal fees he had incurred during the tribunals. He continued to live at Abbeville and own the island of Inishvickillane {{off the coast of}} County Kerry until his death.|$|E
25|$|The Standards in Public Office Commission {{was asked}} to {{investigate}} the Taoiseach's declaration of tax compliance after the 2002 general election. In mid-January 2008 it emerged in the press, reportedly as leaks from parties to the Mahon tribunal, that Ahern {{would not be in}} a position to present a Tax Clearance Certificate to the Dáil, as required under Ethics' legislation. This certificate is issued by the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners,</b> to persons who have shown themselves to be tax compliant. To meet legal requirements, this certificate should have been presented to a Dáil committee by 31 January 2008 by all those elected to the Dáil. A caveat allowed that in the absence of this, a certificate stating that the Dáil member was in negotiation with the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> would suffice. An inability to declare tax compliance by a prominent individual, such as Ahern, would prove highly embarrassing, and could potentially have had more serious repercussions. The Standards in Public Office Act (2001) determines the tax clearance requirements for persons elected to the Oireachtas, and others. The making of a false declaration will be an offence. They will also have to produce a tax clearance certificate. There will, therefore, be considerable policing of tax compliance of members.|$|E

25|$|The {{judgment}} of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin. The Court cited {{the decision of the}} House of Lords in Inland <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> v. National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Limited (1981), in which the judges unanimously decided that the lower court's decision on standing was open to review on appeal. This conclusion was justified as the court at the leave stage might not have the full evidence to make a conclusive determination of the applicant's standing.|$|E
25|$|Again on 20 and 21 December 2007, Ahern {{spent two}} further days under {{questioning}} by the Mahon tribunal about his finances in the 1990s. In January 2008, {{it was revealed}} that Ahern was in discussion with the <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> about his liability for tax on the sums received in Manchester and on his tax clearance status as declared in 2002, before details of the Manchester payments were revealed. The then opposition leader Enda Kenny said it was not acceptable to have a Taoiseach who could not declare compliance with the tax codes.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners</b> on 28 March 2006 {{imposed a}} tax {{settlement}} plus penalties on four former senior executives for their interest, while employed by AIB, arising from investments they maintained in Faldor Limited. Faldor was {{an investment company}} {{set up in the}} British Virgin Islands that between 1989 and 1996 hold funds on behalf of these senior AIB executives as well as people connected to them. Allied Irish Banks Investment Managers then managed the funds in the company on their behalf; at the time Mr Gerry Scanlan was CEO of the bank. Faldor subsequently benefited from inappropriate deal allocations, and artificial deals that amounted to €48,000 out of AIB Investment Managers' own funds.|$|E
25|$|Protection of {{procedural}} legitimate expectations {{has since been}} firmly entrenched {{as one of the}} court's roles in judicial review. The importance {{of procedural}} fairness as enunciated in the GCHQ case is further illustrated by Re Police Association for Northern Ireland's Reference (1990). Applying the principles in the GCHQ case, the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland held that the Police Association had neither been deprived of a legitimate expectation nor treated unfairly. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales also protected procedural interests by stating that a public authority cannot, without some form of warning, change a long-standing practice that it is aware an individual has acted in the light of and derived a benefit from, in the case of R. v. Inland <b>Revenue</b> <b>Commissioners,</b> ex parte Unilever plc (1996).|$|E
