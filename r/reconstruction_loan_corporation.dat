5|$|The Meadowbrook State Parkway {{was first}} envisioned in 1924 {{as part of}} the Long Island State Park Commission (LISPC) and Robert Moses's system to connect several parks in Nassau and Suffolk counties. One park {{included}} in the proposal was Jones Beach State Park, which opened along with the Ocean Parkway in 1929. Construction of the Meadowbrook and Loop causeways began in July 1933, and was slated for completion in January 1935. The <b>Reconstruction</b> Finance <b>Corporation</b> <b>loaned</b> $5,050,000 toward the project, which was completed in October 1934. Nassau County acquired the right-of-way for an extension to the Northern State Parkway in 1936, and the highway was originally intended to be finished for the 1939 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. The start of construction was ultimately delayed until December 1953, and the $10million (1953 USD) highway was completed in October 1956.|$|R
2500|$|Frustrated in its {{expansion}} attempt, the Bellefonte Central was sustained {{throughout the}} Great Depression by the shipment of construction material to State College. Penn State extensively expanded its campus {{in the late}} 1920s and 1930s, in part {{to keep up with}} increased enrollment during the Depression, and many supplies traveled over the railroad. A new station was built on North Atherton Street in State College in 1930, and the line was cut back to the power plant. (The Hammond Building now occupies the old right-of-way to the original station.) Shipments from the lime quarries fell as the steel industry collapsed, and Chemical Lime went into bankruptcy in 1935. However, the company continued operating during the bankruptcy, and was prompted to modernize its operations, building a new rail-served lime plant at [...] "Chemical" [...] and abandoning quarrying for deep-shaft mining. While it was bought out by National Gypsum Company at the end of 1940, the modernization (paid for by a <b>Reconstruction</b> Finance <b>Corporation</b> <b>loan)</b> would keep the lime operation competitive for decades, and make it the largest shipper on the Bellefonte Central.|$|R
