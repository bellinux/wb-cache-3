5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their <b>rationality</b> <b>and</b> needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold <b>rationality</b> <b>and</b> the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, but is still a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E
5|$|Some {{arguments}} from moral order suggest that morality {{is based on}} <b>rationality</b> <b>and</b> that this can only be the case {{if there is a}} moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative {{arguments from}} moral order have proposed that {{we have an obligation to}} attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.|$|E

It explores how policymakers sought {{to respond to the}} uncertainties of this unusual period in British politics. We see the ‘shallow roots’ of the 2010 – 15 coalition: in the face of novel challenges, policymakers grasped for traditional, exclusionary <b>rationalities</b> <b>and</b> practices.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to make a {{theoretical}} discussion about the <b>rationality</b> concept <b>and</b> its impacts over the organization’s context. Starting from the philosophical influences by notions of reason <b>and</b> <b>rationality,</b> a brief historical and philosophical approach is making, discussing about the duality of two basics notions: logic (thought) and pragmatic (action). On sequence, the rationality concept it’s considered with regard to Weber’s theory ofbureaucracy. After that, the cognitive boundaries of human <b>rationality</b> are considered <b>and</b> the relationships between <b>rationality,</b> legitimacy <b>and</b> institutionalization are overviewed. Finally, rationality is overviewed based on Critical Theory authors like Habermas (1987 a), Horkheimer (2002) and Marcuse (1975). In conclusion, this discussion tries to evidence the range and implications of the multiple facets of <b>rationality</b> concept <b>and</b> also brings concepts to go forward the debates about rationality on organizational theory field...|$|R

40|$|We deploy {{aspects of}} Foucault's concept of governmentality {{to discuss the}} {{argument}} that the recent shift towards a 'rights and responsibilities' agenda in urban policy is part of broader transformations in the <b>rationalities</b> <b>and</b> techniques of government. Following Rose, we characterise the emergent forms of urban policy as part of `advanced liberalism' or strategies which seek to activate citizens, individually and collectively, to take greater responsibility for their own government. Such strategies are, as Rose notes, seeking to govern through the instrumentalisation of the self-governing properties of the subjects of government themselves in a whole variety of locales. We develop the argument in three parts. The first part justifies the use of a Foucauldian framework in seeking to understand the new political and policy agenda on 'rights and responsibilities'. In a second part, we investigate the changing nature of governmental <b>rationalities</b> <b>and</b> techniques of governmentality primarily through the context of the Single Regeneration Budget. In so doing, we consider two interrelated dimensions of the <b>rationalities</b> <b>and</b> techniques of government which seek to shape and guide what Foucault refers to as `the conduct of others' or those that are the objects of government, that is, active citizens. These dimensions are government through community and the specification of subjects of government. We conclude by specifying the importance we attach to using a Foucauldian framework for the analysis of urban policy and policy processes more generally. ...|$|R
25|$|Hence, it is {{important}} to distinguish the rational-expectations assumption from assumptions of individual <b>rationality</b> <b>and</b> to note that the first does not imply the latter. Rational expectations is an assumption of aggregate consistency in dynamic models. In contrast, rational choice theory studies individual decision making and is used extensively in, among others, game theory and contract theory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{some key}} terms {{in a cultural}} analysis of economic systems. During empirical research I have concluded that radical geography {{in the tradition of}} political economy must employ cultural terms such as symbol, imaginary, <b>and</b> <b>rationality.</b> These terms link the material, through experience and interpretation, to the mental [...] consciousness, intentionality, <b>and</b> <b>rationality.</b> I argue that culture understood as symbolic practice is compatible with historical materialism in the tradition of Gramsci, Thompson, and Williams. The paper applies cultural materialism to the explanation of economic <b>rationalities</b> <b>and</b> developmental logics by drawing on Weberian sociology. These ideas are exemplified by a brief account of the New England moral economy. The paper concludes by calling for a new type of critical inquiry called cultural economy. ...|$|R
