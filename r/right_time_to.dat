5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> launch a decoy operation.|$|E

25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> mount an attack.|$|E

This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.|$|E

25|$|Lois first {{appeared}} in season four as a recurring character but was made part of the regular cast after several episodes. Lois was introduced as the cousin of Chloe Sullivan. The series explored her progression from rebellious teenager to resolute investigative reporter. She began as an annoyance to Clark Kent during season four, but slowly their relationship evolved with Lois demonstrating an insight into Clark even in his more private moments. Eventually, she became his love interest in season eight and his fiancée in the final tenth season. Clark and Lois had a wedding ceremony in the series finale of the show, but the ceremony was interrupted by the coming of Darkseid and Apokolips. The series ends with Clark finally becoming Superman, and a flash forward seven years into the future, where Clark and Lois are still working at the Daily Planet and still {{trying to find the}} <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get married.|$|E
25|$|Point-and-click {{adventure}} {{games are}} those where the player typically controls their character through a point-and-click interface {{using a computer}} mouse or similar pointing device, though additional control schemes may also be available. The player clicks to move their character around, interact with non-player characters, often initiating conversation trees with them, examine objects in the game's settings or with their character's item inventory. Many point-and-click games would include a list of on-screen verbs to describe specific actions {{in the manner of}} a text adventure, but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach. Often, these games come down to collecting items for the character's inventory, and figuring where is the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> use that item; the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game, descriptions of the various items, and dialogue from other characters to figure this out. Later games developed by Sierra Online including the King's Quest games, and nearly all of the LucasArts adventure games, are point-and-click based games.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{news of the}} {{concentration}} of rebels in Rotunda were received, the military command of the city organised a detachment to break them up. The column, {{under the command of}} Colonel Alfredo Albuquerque, was formed by units that had been removed from the protection of the Palace of Necessidades: Infantry 2, Cavalry 2 and the mobile battery of Queluz. The latter included the colonial war hero Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro. The column advanced until near the prison, where it assumed combat positions. However, before these were completed, the column was attacked by rebels. The attack was repelled but resulted in a few wounded men, several dead pack animals and the scattering of about half the infantry. Paiva Couceiro responded with cannons and the infantry that remained during 45 minutes, ordering an attack that was carried out by around 30 soldiers, but which was beaten with some casualties. Continuing the gunfire, he ordered a new attack, but only 20 soldiers followed the order. Thinking that he had found the <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> assault the barracks of Artillery 1, Paiva Couceiro requested reinforcement to the division's command. However, he received the perplexing order to retreat.|$|E

40|$|Sea stars {{typically}} {{live with}} their oral side facing the substratum, {{and the ability to}} right themselves when turned over is important response to avoid desiccation and predation. The <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> of 8 species of sea stars; Henricia leviuscula (3 color variations), Henricia pumila sp. nov., Leptasterias hexactis, Pyconopodia helianthoides, Pisaster ochraceus, and Pteraster tesselatus were tested on two different substrata to determine if it affects <b>righting</b> <b>time.</b> The <b>righting</b> <b>times</b> were measured when sea stars were placed with their aboral side on the substratum in two different tanks, one covered with sand and another with no sediment. Since podia adhesion to the substratum is required for a sea star to right itself, it was expected that substrata with a smaller grain size would cause an increase in <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> compared <b>to</b> a flatter surface. Sea star diameter was measured to determine the correlation between size and <b>righting</b> <b>time.</b> Leading arm identification was also observed to test the initiating arm preference. P. tesselatus was the only species that was unable to right itself in sand. In most species, sand increased the average <b>righting</b> <b>time</b> compared <b>to</b> other substrata. Individuals with a larger diameter were found to have an increased <b>righting</b> <b>time.</b> No significant relationship was found to which arm initiated the response in all individuals.

50|$|The dam {{removes the}} peak of the {{flooding}} and the trough of low water in the dry season. It reduces the natural seasonal variation of the river flow. The designers intended for the dam to 'open the floodgates' for the duration of March, and allow a flow of 300 m³/s to flood the Kafue Flats in order to maintain natural cycles. However, this has not happened in practice, mainly because the reservoir has not contained sufficient water at the <b>right</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> facilitate such a flow. The demand for electric power takes priority, and this, compounded by erratic rainfall since 1990, has prevented the dam from releasing water at the originally intended flow rates.|$|R
