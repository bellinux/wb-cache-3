5|$|In {{a couple}} of Lexus firsts, the {{fifth-generation}} LS is the first Lexus sedan to feature a six-sided window design, while the flush-surface windows integrate smoothly with the pillars. In the company’s efforts to reconcile two conflicting goals, sufficient headroom with a low <b>roofline,</b> the new LS employs an available outer-slide-type panoramic moonroof instead of the conventional, internally retracting item.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 1935, at Forbes Field, Babe Ruth hit {{the last}} three home runs of his career as his Boston Braves lost to the Pirates, 11-7. His last home run cleared the right field stands <b>roofline,</b> making him {{the first player to}} ever do so.|$|E

5|$|Route 31 was Ace of Spades – {{cutting across}} the city and Midlothian with orange uppers and <b>roofline,</b> and a black spade symbol, which was worn by buses 751–768. However, these buses have been repainted into madder and white with no route branding.|$|E
5|$|Buses for routes 37, 47 and X47 between Edinburgh and Penicuik were branded as Penicuik City Link, {{with blue}} uppers and <b>roofline,</b> and the {{positions}} of the red and madder on the skirting transposed. In 2011, one of these buses was repainted into madder and white, with no roof colour. However, the other vehicles in Penicuik City Link colours were repainted into the new madder and white livery with a turquoise mint coloured roof and the name Pen-Y-Cog. This is to celebrate the history of the area as Pen-Y-Cog is the original name for Penicuik. These buses were de-branded in 2014 due to high fuel consumption of the B7TL's used and the 37/47/X37 is now worked by standards liveries Volvo B9TL's.|$|E
5|$|From about 1493 until 1525 the {{architect}} {{appears to have}} been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory. He also built the central tower, southwest porch and cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the <b>roofline</b> {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting light into the crossing. Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19thcentury.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, {{when the}} stadium was {{in need of}} {{redesign}} to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu. In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous <b>roofline.</b> It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where the}} original <b>roofline</b> was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the <b>roofline</b> are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E

40|$|An optical {{resonator}} cavity configuration has {{a unitary}} mirror with oppositely directed convex and concave reflective surfaces disposed into one fold and concertedly reversing {{both ends of}} a beam propagating from a laser rod disposed between two total internal reflection prisms. The optical components are rigidly positioned with perpendicularly crossed virtual <b>rooflines</b> by a compact optical bed. The <b>rooflines</b> of the internal reflection prisms, are arranged perpendicularly to the axis of the laser beam and to the optical axes of the optical resonator components...|$|R
5000|$|The 1893 First Presbyterian Church at 120 W. Pleasant St. was {{designed}} in Richardsonian Romanesque style, with multiple <b>rooflines,</b> cream brick walls, wood shingling, Palladian windows, and buttresses.|$|R
5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the <b>roofline.</b> The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E
25|$|Nissan's American {{designers}} sculpted {{the rear}} {{three quarters of}} the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the <b>roofline.</b>|$|E
25|$|The lateral {{view of the}} {{building}} from Hyde Park is marked by the regular progression of Gothic windows with pointed arches and simple tracery. The upper <b>roofline</b> is finished with a pierced parapet, broken by decorative gables above the clerestorey windows, above which rises a steeply pitched slate roof with many small dormers in the French manner. The <b>roofline</b> of the aisles is decorated with carved bosses between the sturdy buttresses which support flying buttresss to the clerestorey.|$|E
5000|$|The 1965 {{full-sized}} Pontiacs {{were completely}} restyled with more flowing sheetmetal featuring [...] "Coke-bottle" [...] profiles and fastback <b>rooflines</b> on two-door hardtops. Wheelbases increased to 121 in on all models.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the current}} development, the Carbureted Water Gas Building is being {{restored}} and connected onto the Vertical Retort House via a glass atrium mimicking {{the profile of the}} buildings' <b>rooflines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later workers' houses, built after 1915, were {{constructed}} in other styles with varying <b>rooflines,</b> including shotguns, 6-room duplexes, and 4-room gabled houses with attached porches. At this time, renters were given limited options for paint colors.|$|R
25|$|The naïve <b>Roofline</b> {{provides}} just {{an upper}} bound (the theoretical maximum) to performance. Although {{it can still}} give useful insights on the attainable performance, it {{does not provide a}} complete picture of what is actually limiting it. If for instance the considered kernel or application performs far below the <b>Roofline,</b> it might be useful to capture other performance ceilings, other than simple peak bandwidth and performance, to better guide the programmer on which optimization to implement, or even to assess the suitability of the architecture used with respect to the analyzed kernel or application. The added ceilings impose then a limit on the attainable performance that is below the actual <b>Roofline,</b> and indicate that the kernel or application cannot break through anyone of these celining without first performing the associated optimization.|$|E
25|$|A one-story porch fronts {{the entire}} east elevation, {{with a flat}} roof, {{bracketed}} cornice, piers with decorated capitals and a plain frieze similar to the <b>roofline.</b> Elaborate cutouts form the guardrail between piers.|$|E
25|$|Somewhat more rounded {{sheet metal}} and a swoopier {{fastback}} <b>roofline</b> for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{clerestory}} denoted {{an upper}} {{level of a}} Roman basilica or of the nave of a Romanesque or Gothic church, the walls of which rise above the <b>rooflines</b> of the lower aisles and are pierced with windows.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} three-and-a-half-story, eight-by-two-bay clapboard-sided frame structure on a stone foundation topped by a moderately pitched side-gabled roof. Brick chimneys rise at either end. At {{the front and rear}} <b>rooflines</b> are eaves supported by decorative brackets.|$|R
50|$|The {{house itself}} shows Downing's {{influence}} in the irregularity and asymmetry of its three main blocks. The varied <b>rooflines,</b> truncated and cross gables, large veranda and chimneys decorated with medieval crosses are also found in many of Downing's patterns.|$|R
25|$|The Rebel name reappeared in 1966 on the top-of-the-line {{version of}} the Rambler Classic two-door hardtop. It {{featured}} bucket seats, special trim, and a revised <b>roofline.</b> For 1967, AMC's entire intermediate line took the Rebel name.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the central}} window is another {{decorative}} cornice along the gabled <b>roofline,</b> corbeled by a miniature {{version of the}} arcade. At {{the apex of the}} gable is a weathervane. The roof itself is clad in copper.|$|E
25|$|New grilles and {{taillights}} {{along with}} a 5mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new <b>roofline</b> with a side rear opera windows.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the only}} year of the 1971-1976 models the Impala had a {{different}} front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The <b>rooflines</b> of the Impala coupes were revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe {{was no longer a}} hardtop, with large fixed rear quarter glass and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down quarter glass like that of the 1971-73 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window similar to the 1966-68 Caprice coupes. The four-door sedan, four-door hardtop Sports Sedan and station wagons used carryover <b>rooflines</b> from 1973.|$|R
5000|$|Catalinas {{and other}} 1959 Pontiacs were {{completely}} restyled {{on a new}} General Motors B-body that was shared by all GM divisions from Chevrolet to Cadillac, replacing the previous A-body utilized for Pontiacs and Chevrolets that was used only for 1958. Twin tailfins, two on each side, were new and only in 1959. Styling highlights include thin-pillar <b>rooflines</b> and greater use of glass for increased visibility. Pillared four-door sedans feature six-window styling, while two-door hardtops were dubbed [...] "bubbletops" [...] due to the thin c-pillar and large rear window and four-door hardtops feature flat-blade <b>rooflines</b> with an overhang past the rear window. Wheelbases on all models remained at 122 inches, but overall length is 213.7 in.|$|R
2500|$|On the church's east (front) facade is a 6-by-15-foot (...) shed-roofed porch. Several {{piles of}} loose stones {{help support the}} wooden deck. In turn, two smooth round wooden Doric columns support the {{shingled}} roof. Below the <b>roofline's</b> overhanging eave is a wide plain frieze.|$|R
