5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced <b>rolling),</b> <b>her</b> name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys {{might not want to}} read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
500|$|Lord Clyde had a {{very low}} centre of gravity which meant that she rolled very badly; {{she was said to}} be the worst roller in the Victorian fleet. This {{characteristic}} was so dramatic that when the rolling propensities of ships were compared, it was usual to say [...] "as bad a roller as the Prince Consort", the Lord Clydes being beyond compare. Lord Clyde generally performed worse than did her sister ship, Lord Warden. In sea trials in 1867 with , Lord Clyde was <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> gun ports under, while Bellerophon could have fought her main armament in safety. [...] She was, however, very handy and sailed well in all weathers under sail or steam; her first captain reported that she was [...] "as handy as a frigate". Her crew consisted of 605 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was one of}} those [...] "moments on Animal that are nearly as {{experimental}} as an Animal Collective record, but instead of some wistful, Brian Wilson-loving artiste at the song's center, there's this girl, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> eyes and snapping her gum." [...] Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard magazine also thought that the verse by 3OH!3 [...] "severely slow down the momentum and never quite gel with Kesha's catty, aggressive delivery," [...] but praised the song for its [...] "danceability". Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH said that while [...] "3OH!3 makes a lame attempt to assert the case for male equality , Kesha comes off as so infectiously dominating, it's hard to take [...] seriously." [...] Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave the song two out of five stars, stating that it was not as catchy as her debut, slamming the lyrics for being [...] "thick" [...] and adding that she failed to deliver on many lines, calling them [...] "faux-outrageous, faux-feminist trash". [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the song, calling 3OH!3 [...] "slumming" [...] and [...] "wretched." ...|$|E

500|$|At 04:20 on 14 January, lookouts on {{all three}} ships sighted waves {{breaking}} immediately eastwards. Desperate to escape the heavy surf, Indefatigable turned north and Amazon turned south, while the battered Droits de l'Homme was unable to make any maneuvre and drove straight onto a sandbar {{near the town of}} Ploz√©vet, the force of the waves <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> onto her side. Amazon too was wrecked, although in a more sheltered position which enabled the frigate to remain upright. The only surviving ship was Indefatigable, which was able to round the Penmarck rocks and reach open water. While Reynolds fashioned rafts to bring his men safely to shore, the French officers on Droits de l'Homme were unable to launch their boats, their exposed position in the heavy surf destroying every attempt to reach shore and drowning hundreds of men. [...] Losses on board the wreck mounted as the storm continued, breaking open the stern of the ship and flooding the interior. On the morning of 15 January a group of prisoners from Cumberland reached the shore in a small boat, but subsequent attempts failed and it was not until 17 January that the sea calmed enough for the small naval vessel Arrogante to approach the wreck and remove the remaining 290 survivors.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum. The video was first shown on Disney Channel on August 25, 2006, following the premiere of The Cheetah Girls 2. Hudgens walks onto the set of a music video, applies her makeup and changes her shoes. She then performs while dancing against a brightly lit backdrop. Next, she is shown performing and dancing in a black room with numerous chandeliers flickering on and off. She later appears on a red stage with circles flickering in various colors. Afterwards, more shots of the black room is shown, including one in which she is swinging on a chandelier. In the last scene, she sings and dances {{in front of a}} colorful background. Black-and-white shots of her and her friends are interspersed throughout the video, and Hudgens' friend, actress Alexa Nikolas, makes an appearance. The Arizona Republic writer Bill Goodykoontz wrote that Hudgens shows a somewhat mature side in the video: [...] "hen your only context for ever having seen Hudgens is starring as Gabriella, the sweet little brainiac in High School Musical, it's certainly different to see her flouncing around in spaghetti-strap tops, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and whatnot." [...] A director's cut version of the video appears on the physical release of the single.|$|E

2500|$|Robinson still {{believed}} the vessel {{was a small}} fishing boat {{and that it was}} also turning into the Potomac River, sounded his whistle in acknowledgement and turned further west. Robinson realized {{that he was about to}} collide with a freighter and ordered [...] "all engines stop," [...] then [...] "full reverse". At 9:07pm, the bulbous underwater bow of Santa Cruz tore through Cuyahoga's midship, 40feet from the stern, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> over at a 50 degree angle. Robinson had reversed back into the path of Santa Cruz.|$|E

She loved him that he compelled her with his strength and decision. He was all-powerful, the tower of strength which rose out of her sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, Miss," [...] she said, an unbidden tear <b>rolling</b> down <b>her</b> cheek as she {{surveyed}} the garment and folded {{it over her}} breast.|$|R

6000|$|She was grave--he {{had never}} seen her so pale and never so beautiful. She had stopped <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> parasol; her hands were folded in her lap and her eyes bent on them.

6000|$|... "Did he now?" [...] cried Miss Fotheringay, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> eyes first {{upon the}} Major with surprise, then towards Sir Derby with gratitude--but {{the latter was}} proof against those glances: and far from {{appearing}} to be pleased that the Apothecary, his father, should have saved Major Pendennis's life, the young man actually {{looked as if he}} wished the event had turned the other way.|$|E

6000|$|... "That 's my sister," [...] said Mr. Acton. And Gertrude Wentworth {{put her arm}} {{round the}} young girl and led her forward. It was not, apparently, that she needed much leading. She came toward the Baroness with a light, quick step, and with perfect self-possession, <b>rolling</b> <b>her</b> {{stocking}} round its needles. She had dark blue eyes and dark brown hair; she was wonderfully pretty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] replied Jo modestly. [...] "I {{do think}} The Witches Curse, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I'd {{like to try}} Macbeth, if we only had a {{trapdoor}} for Banquo.
