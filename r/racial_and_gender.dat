In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game drew from well-established <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> based discrimination.|$|E

As a result, her time travel experiences cause her to revise her <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gendered</b> identity from a historically fragmented Black woman, who defines herself solely on her contemporary experiences, to a Black woman who defines herself based on her present life and her personal and ancestral history of experiencing <b>and</b> overcoming <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gendered</b> oppression. Using Black feminist theory scholarship, this thesis examines Dana’s movement out of in medias res, through temporal double-consciousness, into a historically integrated identity or interstitial consciousness...|$|R

25|$|Some {{challenge}} the perceived 'whiteness' of camp aesthetics, noting barriers for gender exploration in queer black communities relative to white LGBT communities. Uri McMillan identifies Nicki Minaj as a contemporary black icon of camp. Minaj's flamboyant performances and aesthetics increase her notoriety. She invokes multiple personalities or accents in her music to assert personal autonomy in the patriarchal musical industry. Such performances challenge <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> politics, while interrupting the male gaze. Nicki Minaj, thus, dismisses and dismantles notions of black sexual morality and normativity.|$|E

40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This project {{examines}} the <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gendered</b> meanings of vocal sound, focusing {{specifically on the}} ways voices and their cultural associations are circulated through media. I employ methods and theoretical assumptions drawn from cultural studies, rhetoric, and feminist and critical race theory to examine mediated voices. The traditional textual analysis methods and more innovative approaches specific to vocal communication studies I outline here are designed to map the relationship between two tenets of vocal ideology: vocal identity and vocal intimacy. Through this project, then, I extend previous literature on vocal sound's ability to construct and communicate aspects of <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gendered</b> identities. Additionally, this study theorizes the way these identities work with media's structures and the broader cultural context to encourage a sense of intimacy for consumers. The theoretical tenets of what I call "critical cultural vocalics" are concretized through analyses of Morgan Freeman's acting career, political impersonations on Saturday Night Live, and Whitevoice impressions by stand-up comedians of color. By examining these two intersecting and co-constitutive processes {{in the context of}} three case studies, I propose and demonstrate a critical cultural vocalics designed to foreground the ways vocal identity and vocal intimacy work together to idealize particular performances of race <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> through media's voices...|$|R

The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that [...] "black is beautiful". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to <b>racial</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender</b> disparities, and highlighting [...] "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the [...] "most steadfast voices for social justice".|$|E
