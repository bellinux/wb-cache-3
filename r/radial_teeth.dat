It consisted {{of a pair of}} escape wheels on the same axle, with alternating <b>radial</b> <b>teeth.</b> The verge rod was suspended between them, with a short crosspiece that rotated first in one direction and then the other as the staggered teeth pushed past.

In {{order to}} reduce the surface {{roughness}} and improve the manufacturing precision of the outer rotor surface of the cycloidal pump, the method that outer rotor tooth surface on the abrasive flow machining (AFM) is adopted. First of all, a power-law model to describe the form of abrasive flow was created, simulation analysis on AFM for the external rotor tooth surface, and the distribution of shear stress that the boundary layer abrasive subjected near the various parts of the outer rotor tooth surface can be draw. Then, choose abrasives with different particle size for processing. Experimental results demonstrate that tooth top, tooth surface and tooth root surface roughness Ra of the outer rotor from the 2. 48 um 2. 192 um and 2. 107 um down to processed 0. 054 um, 0. 094 um and 0. 185 um, material removal is 0. 4 g.

40|$|The {{labyrinth}} seal is a non-contact annular type sealing device {{used to reduce}} the internal leakage of the working fluid which {{is caused by the}} pressure difference between each stage in a turbomachine. Reducing the leakage mass flow rate of the working fluid through the {{labyrinth seal}} is desirable because it improves the efficiency of the turbomachine. The carry-over coefficient, based on the divergence angle of the jet, changed with flow parameters with fixed seal geometry while earlier models expressed the carry-over coefficient solely as a function of seal geometry. For both compressible and incompressible flows, the Reynolds number based on clearance was the only flow parameter which could influence the carry-over coefficient. In the case of incompressible flow based on the simulations for various seal geometries and operating conditions, for a given Reynolds number, the carry-over coefficient strongly depended on <b>radial</b> clearance to <b>tooth</b> width ratio. Moreover, in general, the lower the Reynolds number, the larger is the divergence angle of the jet and this results in a smaller carry-over coefficient at lower Reynolds numbers. However, during transition from laminar to turbulent, the carry-over coefficient reduced initially and once the Reynolds number attained a critical value, the carry-over coefficient increased again. In the case of compressible flow, the carry-over coefficient had been slightly increased if <b>radial</b> clearance to <b>tooth</b> width ratio and <b>radial</b> clearance to <b>tooth</b> pitch ratio were increased. Further, the carry-over coefficient did not considerably change if only <b>radial</b> clearance to <b>tooth</b> width ratio was decreased. The discharge coefficient for compressible and incompressible flows depended only on the Reynolds number based on clearance. The discharge coefficient of the tooth in a single cavity labyrinth seal was equivalent to that in a multiple tooth labyrinth seal indicating that flow downstream had negligible effect on the discharge coefficient. In particular, for compressible fluid under certain flow and seal geometric conditions, the discharge coefficient did not increase with an increase in the Reynolds number. It was correlated to the pressure ratio, Pr. Moreover, it was also related {{to the fact that the}} flow of the fluid through the constriction became compressible and the flow eventually became choked. At low pressure ratios (less than 0. 7), Saikishan?s incompressible model deviated from CFD simulation results. Hence, the effects of compressibility became significant and both the carry-over coefficient compressibility factor and the discharge coefficient compressibility factor needed to be considered and included into the leakage model. The carry-over coefficient compressibility factor, phi, had two linear relationships with positive and negative slopes regarding the pressure ratios. This result was not associated with the seal geometry because the seal geometry ratios for each instance were located within the nearly same ranges. Further, the phi-Pr relationship was independent of the number of teeth regardless of single and multiple cavity labyrinth seals. The discharge coefficient compressibility factor, psi, was a linear relationship with pressure ratios across the tooth as Saikishan predicted. However, in certain flow and seal geometric conditions, Saikishan?s model needed to be modified for the deviation appearing when the pressure ratios were decreased. Hence, a modified psi-Pr relationship including Saikishan?s model was presented in order to compensate for the deviation between the simulations and his model...|$|R

In the process of machining titanium alloys, cutting force is an important physical quantity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (S-CO 2) flow through labyrinth seals, both experimentally and numerically. An experiment facility has been constructed at UW-Madison to measure the leakage rate and pressure drop of S-CO 2 flow through labyrinth seals. Various geometries and conditions have been tested to study the flow characteristic and provide validation data for numerical study. The CFD simulation of this scenario is performed under the framework of an open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Fluid properties of S-CO 2 are implemented into the code. The primary goal is to verify the code's capability to predict leakage rate through seals, with a secondary goal focused on using the code to optimize the seal geometry for S-CO 2 flow, and understand how changing the operating condition will affect {{the performance of the}} seal. Optimization of the seal geometry is performed by studying the effects of geometrical parameters like <b>radial</b> clearance, <b>tooth</b> width, cavity depth, cavity width, and the number of teeth. It has been found that as the cavity width is increased individually the leakage rate through the seal decreases, whereas increasing the radial clearance causes an increase in the leakage rate. Cavity depth studies indicate that there is an optimum value that results in minimum leakage rate. For a fixed total seal length, as the number of teeth are increased reduction in leakage rate associate...|$|R

40|$|A tendÃªncia da fabricaÃ§Ã£o de moldes e matrizes Ã© utilizar a tecnologia de usinagem HSM (High Speed Machining), pois esta pode produzir superfÃ­cies com melhor qualidade. Isto Ã© possÃ­vel, pois pode-se aumentar o nÃºmero de passes laterais de um molde, sem que haja perdas de tempo de ciclo de usinagem, melhorando assim a qualidade do produto. No entanto, com a crescente utilizaÃ§Ã£o desta tecnologia, o perfil gerado de uma superfÃ­cie usinada com uma fresa de ponta esfÃ©rica, Ã© alterado. Isto ocorre porque, normalmente, Ã© possÃ­vel medir-se a rugosidade em duas direÃ§Ãµes, obtendo-se em cada uma delas um valor de rugosidade mÃ¡xima: um Ã© o pico (crista) entre passes laterais e o outro Ã© a altura de crista entre avanÃ§os por dente sucessivos. Cada um deles tem maior importÃ¢ncia em funÃ§Ã£o dos parÃ¢metros utilizados. Estudar os fatores que alteram o perfil de rugosidade se faz, portanto, necessÃ¡rio. O objetivo deste trabalho Ã© verificar experimentalmente como os parÃ¢metros de usinagem: avanÃ§o por dente, passe lateral, diÃ¢metro da ferramenta, Ã¢ngulo de inclinaÃ§Ã£o do eixo axial da ferramenta de corte e direÃ§Ã£o de corte (unidirecional ou bidirecional) influenciam o perfil de rugosidade e a rugosidade mÃ¡xima, alÃ©m de criar um modelo matemÃ¡tico que possa prever estas alteraÃ§Ãµes. Foi mostrado neste trabalho que o perfil de rugosidade para corte unidirecional Ã© diferente do corte bidirecional, e que, Ã  medida que a relaÃ§Ã£o entre avanÃ§o por aresta e passe lateral cresce, a rugosidade mÃ¡xima tambÃ©m aumenta. Mas, ao se inclinar o eixo axial da ferramenta e aumentar o diÃ¢metro da fresa esfÃ©rica a rugosidade mÃ¡xima diminui. Em resumo, este trabalho visa mostrar quais sÃ£o os fatores que influenciam o acabamento de superfÃ­cies usinadas com fresas de topo esfÃ©rico em condiÃ§Ãµes, cuja relaÃ§Ã£o entre o passe lateral e avanÃ§o por dente sÃ£o tÃ­picas da HSM. The {{trend in}} molds and dies {{manufacturing}} {{is the use}} of the HSM (High Speed Machining) technology, since it is able to produce surfaces with a better quality. This is possible because the number of radial passes, can be increased without lossing in the machining cycle times, enhancing the product quality. But with the arising utilization of this technology, the generated profile in a surface machined with a ball nose end milling cutter is changed. This happens because, it is usually possible to measure the surface roughness in two directions, getting in each of them a maximum surface roughness value: {{one of them is the}} peak to valley height between radial passes and the other one is the same parameter between successive feed per tooth. Each of them has major importance depending on the used cutting parameters. To study the factors that change the surface roughness profile is, therefore, necessary. The goal of this work is experimentally verify how the cutting parameters: feed per <b>tooth,</b> <b>radial</b> pass, tool diameter, spindle inclination angle and cutting direction (unidirectional or bidirectional) influences the surface roughness profile and the peak to valley roughness, besides of creating a mathematical model able to predict these changes. It was showed in this work that the surface roughness profile generated in a unidirectional cut is different of the profile generated in a bidirectional cut and that, as the ratio between feed per <b>tooth</b> and <b>radial</b> pass increases the same happens with the peak to valley surface roughness. But when the spindle is tilt and the ball nose cutting tool diameter is bigger the surface roughness decreases. This work aims to show which are the factors that influences the finishing of surfaces milled with ball nose end milling cutters using conditions whose ratio between the radial pass and feed per tooth are typical of HSM...|$|R
