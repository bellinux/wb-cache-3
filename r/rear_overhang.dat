25|$|The station wagon, {{added to}} the range in November 1960, lacked the American version's {{extended}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> due to concern that {{the back of the}} car might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains.|$|E
500|$|Tyler's report led to {{an unusual}} alteration, as it was {{discovered}} that the loading gauge of the line was too small. The internal width of the overbridges was only , but the railway's passenger carriages were [...] wide, leaving less than [...] clearance on either side, less than the minimum required clearance of [...] To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers {{to get out of the}} carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.1 suffered from excessive [...] "vertical motion" [...] and No.2 was said to suffer from [...] "horizontal oscillation". No.1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> and the springs on No.2 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation.|$|E
2500|$|... 1969 saw the Autumn {{launch of}} the Peugeot 304 which was {{essentially}} a 204 with a slightly larger engine, a restyled front end and, {{in the case of}} the saloon version, a substantially increased <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> giving rise to more luggage space. The 204 range was correspondingly pruned: [...] the 204 coupé and cabriolet received the dashboard of the new 304 in 1969 only to be withdrawn in 1970, replaced by similarly bodied 304 equivalents. The estate and fourgonette continued to be offered, along with the saloon, until the 204 range was withdrawn in 1976.|$|E
50|$|The Bertone-designed {{exterior}} featured short {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs,</b> rode on 22-inch aluminum wheels, and was painted in Canyon Mist metallic tricoat.|$|R
5000|$|Bogdan T701.20 (12,0 meter low-floor, 2 doors, {{situated}} {{in front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> Made for Crimea intercity trolleybus system). Launched in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The company {{maintained}} its activities by manufacturing bus bodies on different chassis supplied by Mercedes, MAN, Renault, which were with engines installed on <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> At that time, such buses were manufactured {{for the needs}} of different state-owned organizations and private companies, as well as the armed forces.|$|R
2500|$|The basic cargo {{model was}} a prime mover used to tow the M114 155 mm {{howitzer}} and transport gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch {{at the rear}} to tow up to [...] off-road and [...] on road. With a short wheelbase and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> the body could only be [...] feet long. It had sideboards with fold down troop seats and bows for an overhead tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, across the front. Early models had all steel bodies, in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve steel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the wheelbase increase (47mm), overall length has increased by [...] and track [...] by [...] The bodywork and aerodynamics have been altered to offer maximum down-force, featuring a longer front bonnet with flaps, a closed underbody and a new <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> with adjustable rear wing and race-derived diffuser. These are intended to translate into increased aerodynamic efficiency and down-force for maximum cornering speed. It is {{also noted that the}} car's new rear bodywork is minimal in the extreme, being composed mostly of vent. This is thought to be symptomatic of the need to keep the engine cool enough, even under hard track use. Again, this is similar to the gutted bodywork of the Ferrari FXX Evoluzione.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>overhang</b> {{may present}} {{a problem in}} large {{vehicles}} such as buses. Long <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> would require the driver {{to pay attention to}} nearby vehicles when turning at 90 degrees. Since the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> is outside the wheelbase, it may hit a vehicle in the adjacent lane, especially when turning 90 degrees right (in a right-hand drive country).|$|E
5000|$|... "The key to {{the look}} of the Trailhawk," [...] said Nick Vardis, Principal Exterior Designer, [...] "is the vehicle's {{distinctive}} proportions, due in part to its 116 in wheelbase. The dash-to-front-axle dimension is dramatically long, giving the vehicle a sense of forward motion, while the front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> are tight and abbreviated." ...|$|R
50|$|When Chrysler {{discontinued}} the Eagle brand after 1998, the Chrysler 300M {{was introduced}} {{as a replacement}} for the Vision. All models again shared a wheelbase of 113 in. The 300M was several inches shorter than Concorde, Intrepid, & LHS, due to shorter front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> in order to bring the car's length under 5 meters.|$|R
50|$|Long {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> {{on the body}} were to assist with {{crossing}} crevasses up to 15 ft wide. The front wheels were to be retracted so the front could be pushed across the crevasse. The front wheels were then to be extended (and the rear wheels retracted) to pull the vehicle {{the rest of the}} way across. This process required a complicated, 20-step procedure.|$|R
50|$|The {{angle of}} the front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> varies {{depending}} on {{the position of the}} suspension from 45 to 55 degrees. The minimum turn radius is 7 m.|$|E
50|$|The station wagon, {{added to}} the range in November 1960, lacked the American version's {{extended}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> due to concern that {{the back of the}} car might scrape on rough roads and spoon drains.|$|E
5000|$|Optima Mid (all of the Optima models {{below are}} belt drive models. The {{location}} of the motor was changed from the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> to an RMR layout. The frame was made of duralumin and fibre-reinforced plastic) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Schwebeklasse {{came with}} a strikingly more {{streamlined}} silhouette than its predecessor, with longer front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> Timber frame construction was at this stage retained, {{but there was no}} further increase in the wheelbase length, and the body was more rigid than that of the earlier model, though durability remained an issue. [...] The choice of bodies was now between a four-seater “limousine” (sedan/saloon) and a soft-topped four seater “cabrio-limousine”: a two-seater cabriolet was no longer offered.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} Grenadiers were a Reliance 590 for Harris of Greys and a Leopard PSU3 for Grey Green, {{both of which}} were shown at the 1962 Earls Court Commercial Motor show. In the initial season a further 36 ft Reliance 590 went to Abbott of Blackpool, two Leopards to Gliderways of Smethwick, five to Northern General (the only BET order) and a unique 33 ft Grenadier went to Hawkey of Newquay on a Reliance 590 with {{specially}} reduced front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs,</b> it was registered 900SAF and sat 47.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} Proton Saga measures 4,331 mm long, 1,689 mm wide and 1,491 mm tall. The wheelbase length at 2,465 mm has remained unchanged since the Saga BLM, but both front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> have been extended by 44mm and 30mm respectively. The boot volume is rated at 420 litres, 7 litres {{larger than the}} outgoing model. The {{third generation}} Saga is approximately 74mm longer, 9mm wider and 11mm shorter than the Saga BLM and 53mm longer, 9mm wider and 29mm shorter than the Saga FL and Saga FLX family.|$|R
50|$|The Enviro350H has its {{powertrain}} {{located at}} the nearside of the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> similar with the full-low-floor buses in Europe. It can be equipped with BAE Systems' HybriDrive series-hybrid system with a Cummins ISBe engine as generator.|$|E
50|$|Like its competitor, the Volvo B7L, {{the engine}} is mounted at {{the left side of}} the <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> (thus the rear door can be located as {{rearward}} as possible), but the radiator is mounted on the roof.|$|E
50|$|Payload is 2 300 kg in {{terrain and}} 4 000 kg on road. The front {{overhang}} is 1 300 mm and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> 1 000 mm. The turning radius is 7.6 metres and top speed 90 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|The '675' in the 675LT {{model name}} {{refers to the}} power output of 675 PS, {{following}} the naming scheme started by the McLaren 650S. The LT in the model name is {{a reference to the}} [...] "Long Tail" [...] 1997 McLaren F1 GT which was the final incarnation of the F1 road car built to comply with FIA homologation regulations for the 1997 F1 GTR. The F1 GT featured extended front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> that produced similar downforce to the previous homologation special, the F1 LM, without the use of a drag-inducing fixed rear wing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bodywork}} was {{beefed up}} with wider lightweight aluminium front and steel <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs,</b> these covered a substantially widened track {{at both the}} front and rear requiring longer drive shafts unique to the Racing Puma. A front aerodynamic air splitter and modified wider front bumper with sports grill. The wheels are Speedline Corse Turini alloys; 17" [...] x 7.5 (with an ET28 Offset) and use 215/40 17 tyres (original fitment tyres were Michelin SXGT 215/40 R17), this increases the width from 1674mm to 1770mm. The S1600 rally Puma is just 35mm wider than this.|$|R
50|$|The third {{generation}} Saga features a stronger body structure than its second generation predecessors. Torsional rigidity has been increased to 12,000 Nm/deg from 10,000 Nm/deg previously. The new Saga is {{fitted with a}} number of ultra high strength steel (UHSS) components at critical sections throughout its body structure to reinforce and protect the passenger compartment {{in the event of a}} collision. The front and rear crumple zones have both increased courtesy of longer front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> However, Proton's new hot press forming (HPF) technology and the Reinforced Safety Structure are not offered in the {{third generation}} Saga.|$|R
50|$|Put into {{production}} to integrate hull improvements {{brought by the}} M5 into the M3 series. Turret with <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> to house SCR-508 radio. Welded hull with sloped armor, 20° in from the vertical, on front and sides.|$|E
50|$|Overhangs are {{the lengths}} {{of a car}} which extend beyond the {{wheelbase}} at the front and rear. They are normally described as front overhang and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b> Practicality, style, and performance {{are affected by the}} size and weight of overhangs.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} launch of the Mégane II, an all-new Scénic was launched. There is also a seven-seater Compact MPV Grand Scénic, with a longer {{wheelbase}} and <b>rear</b> <b>overhang,</b> which has two small child-sized seats in the enlarged luggage area.|$|E
5000|$|Had the Eagle brand {{not been}} dropped, the 300M would instead be {{sold as a}} {{redesigned}} Vision. Test cars, factory manuals, and design images were prepared for the second-generation Vision featuring a prominent Eagle badge on the grille. The 300M was similar in exterior and almost identical in the interior as the Concorde. The 300M also fit the European [...] "5 metre" [...] (16.4 ft) size class for exports to Europe, unlike the substantially similar, yet larger Chrysler LHS. It had the same wheelbase as the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and pre-2002 Chrysler Concorde, reducing its length by cutting front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Lark was ingeniously {{designed}} {{around the}} core bodyshell of the full-sized 1953-1958 Studebakers. By reducing {{the front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> and shortening the wheelbase ahead of the firewall, the car could still seat six people comfortably and hold a surprising amount of luggage. It was hoped that the new model would save America's oldest vehicle manufacturer when it was launched {{in the fall of}} 1958 as a 1959 model, much like the 1939 Studebaker Champion had saved the company in the years prior to World War II. In fact, it was the Champion which Churchill specifically took as his inspiration for the Lark.|$|R
50|$|The new third {{generation}} Saga continues to utilise {{the second generation}} Saga platform, which underpinned the previous BLM, FL and FLX models between 2008 and 2016. The second generation Saga is in turn based on an extended Proton Savvy platform, dating back to 2005. The model or platform code 'BT', which Proton has assigned to the {{third generation}} Saga is similarly used for all second generation Saga variants, {{in addition to the}} Savvy. Nonetheless, in the latest 2016 platform revision, Proton has extended both front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> and re-engineered the entire body structure to warrant a generational leap. The interior has also been revamped, with a focus on increased refinement as well as tactile or perceived quality.|$|R
50|$|The regular length five-seater {{model with}} a shorter <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> is just called Livina or Livina XR, or in Taiwan as Livina Urban or Livina Sport. While the longer 7-seater is a station wagon-style MPV, the 5-seater may be {{considered}} as a roomy hatchback.|$|E
50|$|The {{wheel base}} was also {{moderately}} lengthened from 2700 mm to 2760 mm. The overall length of this interim 1932 car, which was offered {{only as a}} soft-topped four seater “cabrio-limousine”, increased from 3680 mm to 4000 mm, apparently reflecting an increased <b>rear</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{based on}} the Polo and Ibiza, its {{extended}} <b>rear</b> <b>overhang</b> meant its length was close to a Golf but still smaller than the Jetta. It featured a boot space of 455 L which could be extended up to 762 L by folding rear seats.|$|E
50|$|The {{overall length}} of the LC is 4,750 mm, with a {{wheelbase}} of 2,870 mm. The front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs</b> are noticeably short — the front is 920 mm, and the back is 970 mm. Central to the LC design is the spindle grille, and the hourglass shape {{can be seen in}} the way the front and rear fenders flare out and the door panels are pulled inward. The lines from the front fender build up the A-pillar to form the boundaries of the blacked-out roof — Lexus cites “the traditional Japanese sword” as the inspiration for the sharp edges of the C-pillar molding. Rear design elements are recessed and pushed to the far corners.|$|R
5000|$|At the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show, Mazda {{revealed}} {{the second generation}} CX-9 nine years after the previous version launched. The 2016 Mazda CX-9 is brand new, {{and is based on}} the SkyActiv platform and engines that are shared with new Mazdas introduced after 2011. The second generation Mazda CX-9 uses a turbocharged version of the 2.5-litre four-cylinder SkyActiv-G petrol engine, producing 170 kW (227 hp) and 470 Nm of torque (310 lb-ft). The engine is joined with a six-speed automatic transmission. The new exterior design follows Mazda's Kodo design philosophy. It is shorter than before, but rides on a longer wheelbase, resulting in shorter front and <b>rear</b> <b>overhangs.</b> Weight is also down 90 kilograms (190 lbs) in FWD and 130 kilograms (287 lbs) in AWD versions, ...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} mounted {{vertically}} on the <b>rear</b> left <b>overhang</b> of the chassis similarly to with the B7L, allowing B9Ls to be low-floor {{throughout the whole}} length of the bus {{due to a lack}} of underfloor equipment. The Volvo B9L is available as an integral bus bodied by Volvo (7500/7700/7900) or as a chassis only, with bodies by other manufacturers.|$|R
