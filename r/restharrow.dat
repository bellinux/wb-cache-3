25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny <b>Restharrow</b> (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
6000|$|The house vibrated to {{the trains}} in the {{adjacent}} underground railway. There was a lady next door but one who was very pluckily training a contralto voice {{that most people would}} have gladly thrown away. At the end of <b>Restharrow</b> Street was a garage, and a yard where chauffeurs were accustomed to [...] "tune up" [...] their engines. All these facts were persistently audible to any one sitting down in the little back study to think out this project of [...] "writing something," [...] about a change in the government of the whole world. Petty inconveniences no doubt all these inconveniences were, but they distressed a rather oversensitive mind which was also acutely aware that even upon this scale living would cost certainly two hundred and fifty pounds if not more in excess of the little private income available.|$|E
60|$|Second in age is {{the warm}} western and {{south-western}} type, the type {{represented by the}} Portuguese slug, the arbutus trees and Mediterranean heaths of the Killarney district, the flora of Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, and the peculiar wild flowers of South Wales, Devonshire, and the west country generally. This class belongs by origin to the submerged land of Lyonesse, the warm champaign country that once spread westward over the Bay of Biscay, and derived from the Gulf Stream the genial climate still preserved by its last remnants at Tresco and St. Mary's. The animals belonging to this secondary stratum of our British population are few and rare, but of its plants there are not a few, some of them extending over the whole western shores of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, wherever they are washed by the Gulf Stream, and others now confined to particular spots, often with the oddest apparent capriciousness. Thus, two or three southern types of clover are peculiar to the Lizard Point, in Cornwall; a little Spanish and Italian <b>restharrow</b> has got stranded in the Channel Islands and on the Mull of Galloway; the spotted rock-rose of the Mediterranean grows only in Kerry, Galway, and Anglesea; while other plants of the same warm habit are confined to such spots as Torquay, Babbicombe, Dawlish, Cork, Swansea, Axminster, and the Scilly Isles. Of course, all peninsulas and islands are warmer in temperature than inland places, and so these relics of the lost Lyonesse have survived {{here and there in}} Cornwall, Carnarvonshire, Kerry, and other very projecting headlands long after they have died out altogether from the main central mass of Britain. South-western Ireland in particular is almost Portuguese in the general aspect of its fauna and flora.|$|E
50|$|<b>Restharrows</b> {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Grey Pug and Coleophora ononidella (feeds exclusively on O. arvensis).|$|R
5000|$|They mostly feed on legumes (Coronilla species, Lathyrus species) {{and other}} leguminous plants, such as alfalfa (Medicago sativa), {{birdsfoot}} trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), milkvetch (Astragalus), vetch (Vicia), Sainfoin (Onobrychis), broom (Genista) or <b>restharrows</b> (Ononis).|$|R
50|$|Ononis {{is a large}} genus of {{perennial}} {{herbs and}} shrubs from the legume family Fabaceae. The members of this genus are often called <b>restharrows</b> as some species are arable weeds whose tough stems would stop the harrow. They are natively distributed in Europe.|$|R
6000|$|And she did {{face the}} worldly situation, {{if a little}} sadly, at any rate with the courage of {{practical}} energy. It was she who stood in one ungainly house after another and schemed how to make discomforts tolerable, while Scrope raged unhelpfully at landlordism and {{the responsibility of the}} church for economic disorder. It was she who at last took decisions into her hands when he was too jaded to do anything but generalize weakly, and settled upon the house in Pembury Road which became their London home. She got him to visit Hunstanton again for half a week while she and Miriam, who was the practical genius of the family, moved in and made the new home presentable. At the best it was barely presentable. There were many plain hardships. The girls had to share one of the chief bedrooms in common instead of their jolly little individual dens at Princhester.... One little room was all that could be squeezed out as a study for [...] "father"; it was not really a separate room, it was merely cut off by closed folding doors from the dining-room, folding doors that slowly transmitted the dinner flavours to a sensitive worker, and its window looked out upon a blackened and uneventful yard and the skylights of a populous, conversational, and high-spirited millinery establishment that had been built over the corresponding garden of the house in <b>Restharrow</b> Street. Lady Ella had this room lined with open shelves, and Clementina (in the absence of Eleanor at Newuham) arranged the pick of her father's books. It is to be noted as a fact of psychological interest that this cramped, ill-lit little room distressed Lady Ella more than any other of the discomforts of their new quarters. The bishop's writing-desk filled a whole side of it. Parsimony ruled her mind, but she could not resist the impulse to get him at least a seemly reading-lamp.|$|E
50|$|Ononis spinosa is a plant {{belonging}} to the family Fabaceae, that {{is commonly known as}} spiny <b>restharrow</b> or just <b>restharrow.</b> It is found throughout much of Europe but seldom as far north as Scotland.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} vegetation {{is formed}} mainly by oak trees, alternating with thickets of kermes oaks and black hawthorns. There are also thickets of <b>restharrows</b> and Gypsophila struthium. This primitive vegetation has been substituted {{since there is}} human presence by crops and by the planting of pine-trees. The main crops are wheat and barley. There are also porc and chickenfarms. There is also partridges, wild rabbits and hares hunting.|$|R

50|$|The {{secret of}} bulat {{manufacturing}} was lost {{by the beginning}} of the 19th century. It is known that the process involved dipping the finished weapon into a vat containing a special liquid of which spiny <b>restharrow</b> extract was a part (the plant's name in Russian, stalnik, reflects its historical role), then holding the sword aloft while galloping on a horse, allowing it to dry and harden against the wind.|$|E
50|$|A further {{distinctive}} {{habitat is}} provided by an area of gravel exposed by historic sand extraction, and on which grows wild thyme (Thymus praecox), common stork's-bill (Erodium cicutarium), mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella) and common centaury (Centaurium erythraea) together with common bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common <b>restharrow</b> (Ononis repens), blue fleabane (Erigeron acer), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and fern-grass (Desmazeria rigida). The margin of this area supports viper's-bugloss (Echium vulgare) and bloody crane's-bill.|$|E
50|$|In medieval Russia, {{it used to}} be {{used for}} {{manufacturing}} Bulat steel. Though the original process is now lost, it is known it involved dipping the finished weapon into a vat containing a special liquid of which spiny <b>restharrow</b> extract was a part (the plant's name in Russian, stalnik, reflects its historical role), then holding the sword aloft while galloping on a horse, allowing it to dry and harden against the wind.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} Russian herbal medicine, {{it is used}} as an anodyne, antiphlogistic, aperient, coagulant and diuretic. It {{is considered}} helpful in treating urinary catarrh, kidney inflammation, and rheumatism, as well as aiding those who accumulate uric acid and are susceptible to kidney stones. A decoction of <b>restharrow</b> is used to treat eczema and other skin problems. It is used over an average course of six weeks to treat hemorrhoids, chronic constipation and infections of the anus.|$|E
50|$|The {{guillemot}} colony on {{the cliffs}} below the Southern Fort {{is one of}} the largest on England's south coast and can be closely watched live on CCTV in the Visitor Centre. Berry Head also acts as an important staging post for migrant birds; and is home to a significant number of cirl buntings.The site is one of only two locations in Great Britain at which the white rock-rose, small hare’s ear and small <b>restharrow</b> occurs. Spring gentian, honewort, and goldilocks aster are also dependent upon the thin soils, mild climate and exposed conditions of the headland.|$|E
50|$|Rarer {{sand dune}} {{vegetation}} such as Babington's Orache (Atriplex glabriuscula) and Isle of Man cabbage (Coincya monensis monensis) have been recorded, together with typical sand dune wild flowers, including European marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), lyme grass (Leymus arenarius), kidney vetch, tufted vetch, common <b>restharrow</b> (Ononis repens), European searocket (Cakile maritima), sea campion (Silene maritima), prickly saltwort (Kali turgida), Scottish bluebell (Campanula rotundifolia), bird's-foot trefoil, ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), sea mayweed (Tripleurospermum maritimum) and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). Plants such as lyme grass were {{so important in}} stabilising sand dunes that during the 17th-century reign of William III, the Scottish Parliament passed a law protecting it.|$|E
50|$|The limited {{areas of}} {{maritime}} grassland have {{an abundance of}} red fescue (Festuca rubra), also present within rock crevices and rocky ledges. Other areas of maintained grassland contain flora such as common bent (Agrostis capillaris), common bird'sfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), common cat's-ear (Hypochaeris radicata), common dog-violet (Viola riviniana), common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), common knapweed (Centaurea nigra), common <b>restharrow</b> (Ononis repens), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), sweet vernal-grass, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), woodrush (Luzula campestris), wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus). Also present in the grassland and grassy embankments are the nationally scarce slender bird'sfoot trefoil (Lotus angustissimus) and hairy bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus).|$|E
50|$|Botanically, three {{different}} zones can be distinguished: the shore area, the raised bog and {{the slopes of}} the maar basin. In the shore area, as well as the reeds there are communities of yellow iris, white water-lily, yellow loosestrife, purple loosestrife and club-rush. The slopes of the maar basin are dominated by a mix of dry grassland and woodland edge vegetation. In addition to Breckland thyme and oregano, there is <b>restharrow,</b> hare's-foot clover, hop trefoil, narrow-leaved everlasting pea, musk mallow, clustered bellflower, downy hemp-nettle, fox and cubs, brown knapweed, greater knapweed, small scabious, woodruff and large communities of rosebay willow-herb. Neophytes that may be seen include garden lupins and large-flowered mountain trumpets.|$|E
50|$|Steppe-like {{vegetation}} grows here mostly. The {{place is}} also valued {{for one of}} the richest populations of Greater Anemone (Pulsatilla grandis) in Central Moravia; in the 2004 census 19,699 blooms were counted here. Other notable plants growing here are Snowdrop Anemone (Anemone sylvestris), European Michaelmas Daisy (Aster amellus), Sickle Hare's Ear (Bupleurum falcatum), Blue Sedge (Carex flacca), Downy-fruited Sedge (Carex tomentosa), Carex michelii, European Dwarf Cherry (Prunus fruticosa), Dorycnium herbaceum, Field Cow-wheat (Melampyrum arvense), Spiny <b>Restharrow</b> (Ononis spinosa), Military Orchid (Orchis militaris), Knapweed Broomrape (Orobanche elatior), Pilosella macrantha, Primula veris subsp. canescens, Fragrant Scabious (Scabiosa canescens) and Thesium dollineri. Bigger stones are covered by saxicolous lichens, which are an important indicator of the level of air pollution. The grasslands need to be maintained and shrubs of Black Locust (Robinia pseudacacia), Common Dogwood (Cornus sanguinea) and European Privet (Ligustrum vulgare) have to be regularly removed here.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the last}} in the series, Oddie visited the [...] "last county before Scotland", which held {{memories}} for him as he walks past the house {{that used to be}} Monks House Bird Observatory (you can read about his experiences there in Bill Oddie's gone Birding). It was while staying here that Oddie discovered Hauxley Nature Reserve, where the owner of the Observatory showed him a variety of plantlife. Plants such as viper's bugloss, which has been used to cure snake bites, and <b>restharrow,</b> named because of its habit of seizing up the plough's harrow. Behind a supermarket, in amongst a debris of shopping trolleys and rubbish, Oddie finds a tiny water vole. A trip to the Farne Islands brings Oddie close to an Arctic tern colony as they divebomb him and peck at his baseball cap and camera lens. One even perches on his arm, and it is this footage gets used in the opening credits. Oddie attempts to 'sing' at the seals with a rather sad wailing call, and surprisingly, it works.|$|E
