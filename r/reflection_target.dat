Here we will describe the structuring process for these metal targets. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we show radiographs of test structures corresponding to resolutions below 100 nm.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the purpose}} of both {{luminescence}} dosimetry and dating, a new portable mini auto-mated luminescence-measuring system has been developed. The main parts {{of the new system}} consist of the stimulation unit, an irradiation unit and the photon detector. The size of the main measuring box is approximately 300 × 300 × 300 mm. In particular, to keep the electric power as low as possible, a miniature X-ray (Oxford, Eclipse II <b>reflection</b> <b>target)</b> generator and a metal-packaged photomultiplier tube (PMT) (Hamamatsu photonics, H 7421 - 40) were adopted here. 16 blue LEDs were employed for the stimulation of quartz OSL. The same LED holder can be used for pulsed-OSL (P-OSL) measure-ments. The weight of the main part of this system was about 15 kg. In order to check the usefulness of the new system, red thermoluminescence (RTL) glow curves were measured to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) using a volcanic quartz sample. These re-sults show that the new system improves the S/N ratio in comparison with an existing handmade sys-tem. The estimated RTL equivalent (or paleo) dose using quartz extracted from an archaeological roof tile of Shin-Yakushiji temple by means of the SAR protocol was in good agreement with previous measurements. This proves that the new system is suitable for practical use for RTL-measurements either for dosimetry or for dating with a high S/N ratio...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{introduce}} a cost-effective and environmentally friendly production process of open-cell metal foams with a view to manufacture porous materials exhibiting good morphological and structural homogeneity. The work also focuses on optimizing the production process control to produce higher quality materials and to achieve a better reproducibility and predictability of their properties. A space-holder method using crystalline raw cane sugar, as a novel leachable pattern for manufacturing open-cell metal foams is described. The mechanical behavior of the produced Al-foams as well as the deformation mechanisms developed during mechanical testing are investigated experimentally and analytically through a developed Finite Element Method simulation of compression tests using the real porous geometry, obtained via computed tomography. Additionally, the feasibility for carburized foam production in an one step-process using crystalline raw cane sugar and employing the proposed porous production methodology is investigated, whilst the effect of carburisation on the mechanical and anti-corrosive properties of the produced carburized foams is assessed. A low-vacuum furnace was used for the production process of the porous metals. In order to evaluate the effect of sintering atmosphere on the produced foams and to achieve an effective carburization process a high-vacuum apparatus was constructed. The micro and macro-structure of the produced foams are examined through optical and scanning electron microscopy whereas XRD measurements were used to evaluate the crystal structures and phases produced. Static-compression tests were conducted to assess the influence of morphological and production parameters on the mechanical behaviour of the produced foams. A X-ray tomography apparatus with a 5 μm focal spot <b>reflection</b> <b>target</b> X-ray tube source working in the absorption mode, was used to acquire the 3 D images of the foam samples necessary for the creation of the FEM-based foam model and for the 3 D characterization of the porous products. The thermal analysis via ΤG-DTA measurements was applied on the raw cane sugar to deduce its decomposition temperature. The electrochemical behavior of the Al-foam and carburized Al-foam was monitored by polarization measurements. The proposed method is attractive and environmentally friendly, given that it does not lead to any dangerous by-products or emissions and does not employ any toxic, flammable or explosive material. As an additional benefit, the proposed method is capable of producing low-cost, net-shape metal foams with tailored distribution of pore size or relative density presenting excellent reproducibility and predictability of their properties. The advantages of crystalline raw cane sugar as a novel space-holder are that is chemically stable in contact with the parent metal material and can be easily removed from the green product prior to sintering, Also it is cheap, easy to purchase in the market and does not corrode the foam material. The FEM modeling of the compressive properties of the real foam geometry leads not only to an in-depth understanding of the deformation mechanisms developed but also gives insight to the structure-properties correlation, facilitating thus the final design of the foam material. The feasibility for carburized foam production in an one step-process using crystalline raw cane sugar is among the important advantages of the proposed porous production methodology. The considerable control of carburization process conducted at relatively low temperature (400 oC) leads to an homogeneous distributed carbon layer around each pore enhancing thus the corrosion behaviour of the carburized porous materials. ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to detect the <b>target</b> <b>reflections</b> in ground penetrating radar (GPR) images, so that surface metal targets can be identified successfully. In order to accurately locate buried metal objects, a novel method called the Multiresolution Monogenic Signal Analysis (MMSA) system is applied in ground penetrating radar (GPR) images. This process includes four steps. First the image is decomposed by the MMSA to extract the amplitude component of the B-scan image. The amplitude component enhances the <b>target</b> <b>reflection</b> and suppresses the direct wave and reflective wave to a large extent. Then we use the region of interest extraction method to locate the genuine <b>target</b> <b>reflections</b> from spurious reflections by calculating the normalized variance of the amplitude component. To find the apexes of the targets, a Hough transform {{is used in the}} restricted area. Finally, we estimate the horizontal and vertical position of the target. In terms of buried object detection, the proposed system exhibits promising performance, as shown in the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Android {{developers}} heavily use {{reflection in}} their apps for legitimate reasons, but also significantly for hiding malicious actions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art static analysis tools for Android are {{challenged by the}} presence of reflective calls which they usually ignore. Thus, the results of their security analysis, e. g., for private data leaks, are inconsistent given the measures taken by malware writers to elude static detection. We propose the DroidRA instrumentation-based approach to address this issue in a non-invasive way. With DroidRA, we reduce the resolution of reflective calls to a composite constant propagation problem. We leverage the COAL solver to infer the values of <b>reflection</b> <b>targets</b> and app, and we eventually instrument this app to include the corresponding traditional Java call for each reflective call. Our approach allows to boost an app {{so that it can be}} immediately analyzable, including by such static analyzers that were not reflection-aware. We evaluate DroidRA on benchmark apps as well as on real-world apps, and demonstrate that it can allow state-of-the-art tools to provide more sound and complete analysis results...|$|R

40|$|The range gated {{technique}} is a promising laser ranging method that {{is widely used}} in {{different fields such as}} surveillance, industry, and military. In a range gated system, a reflected laser pulse returned from the target scene contains key information for range reconstruction, which directly affects the system performance. Therefore, it is necessary to study the characteristics and effects of the <b>target</b> <b>reflection</b> factor. In this paper, theoretical and experimental analyses are performed to investigate the influence of <b>target</b> <b>reflection</b> on three-dimensional (3 D) range gated reconstruction. Based on laser detection and ranging (LADAR) and bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) theory, a 3 D range gated reconstruction model is derived and the effect on range accuracy is analyzed from the perspectives of target surface reflectivity and angle of laser incidence. Our theoretical and experimental study shows that the range accuracy is proportional to the target surface reflectivity, but it decreases when the angle of incidence increases to adhere to the BRDF model. The presented findings establish a comprehensive understanding of <b>target</b> <b>reflection</b> in 3 D range gated reconstruction, which is of interest to various applications such as target recognition and object modeling.
