5|$|Since 1934, some {{important}} {{changes have been}} observed in the lake's biota, including a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of Chara species, {{and an increase in}} the area covered by Salvinia since 1937. Analysis of the lake has also revealed the tendency for it to develop monospecific communities of submerged macrophytes such as Ceratophyllum and Myriophyllum.|$|E
5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Veereman-Wauters et al. (2012) in preschool-age children (2.5 to 6 years old) also reported {{the effect of}} MFGM-supplemented formula consumption on health outcomes. Children receiving the MFGM-supplemented formula reported a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of days with fever, and particularly the number of short febrile episodes (<3 days), compared to the control group.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of customers.|$|E
5|$|Defence {{cuts in the}} British {{armed forces}} after the war forced a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of {{parachute}} brigades. By 1948 the 2ndParachute Brigade was the last surviving parachute formation dating from the Second World War, all other parachute divisions and brigades having been disbanded. The last three battalions of the Regular Army comprised in the brigade returned to the United Kingdom; later {{in the same year}} the unit was posted to the British Army of the Rhine and redesignated the 16th Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 José Manuel Barroso became President: the Parliament {{once again}} {{asserted}} itself in objecting {{to the proposed}} membership of the Barroso Commission. Due to the opposition Barroso was forced to reshuffle his team before taking office. The Barroso Commission {{was also the first}} full Commission since the enlargement in 2004 to 25 members and hence the number of Commissioners {{at the end of the}} Prodi Commission had reached 30. As a result of the increase in the number of states, the Amsterdam Treaty triggered a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of Commissioners to one per state, rather than two for the larger states.|$|E

5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{lies on the}} {{confluence}} of three rivers: the Dane, Croco and Wheelock. Three canals also pass through the town, the Shropshire Union, Trent and Mersey, and the Wardle canal, as well as three major roads, the A533, A54 and A530; Middlewich also has good motorway links to the nearby cities of Manchester and Liverpool. The town's population has doubled since 1970 despite a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of manufacturing jobs in salt and textile manufacturing, suggesting {{that many of the}} new residents live in Middlewich for reasons other than local employment.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils {{also play}} a key role in the {{development}} of most forms of acute lung injury. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the liver, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of endotoxins produced by bacteria, sepsis, trauma, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemia, and hypovolemic shock resulting from acute hemorrhage.|$|E

5|$|On July 20, Presidency Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff {{announced}} plans to significantly {{reduce the number of}} flights operating at Congonhas. The plan included banning, within 60 days, all connection, stopover, charter, and international flights and the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of private jets. The airport would only operate direct flights to certain cities in Brazil. The plan also called for a study of the expansion of São Paulo's two current airports and the construction of a third airport in the metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{closed on}} 31 March 2010 {{as part of}} a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of Ministry of Defence {{properties}} in the Greater London area. Many of its remaining military units were relocated to nearby RAF Northolt the following day. Plans for redevelopment, consisting of a mixture of new residential and commercial properties and the retention of all listed buildings, were approved in January 2011. A small part of the station incorporating the Battle of Britain Bunker retains the RAF Uxbridge name and is owned by Hillingdon Council.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E

5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{building}} land at North End to conservationists to form the Hampstead Heath extension in 1904, meant a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of residents who might use the station there. Work continued below ground at a reduced pace, and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated, but North End station was abandoned in 1906 before the lift and stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{courses in}} Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also {{available}} at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of {{a decline in the}} number of students studying the subjects. There has also been a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are willing to pay for.|$|E
5|$|Although {{electoral fraud}} was common, {{it was not}} ignored by the Emperor, {{politicians}} or observers of the time. The problem was considered a major issue and {{attempts were made to}} correct abuses, with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: they eliminated the two-stage electoral system, introduced direct and facultative voting, and allowed the votes of former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, illiterate citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the illiterate does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of voters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of digits have {{occurred}} frequently during tetrapod evolution. Further <b>reductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of limb bones have also occurred, including the complete elimination of limbs in, for example, snakes and caecilians. Strikingly, an evolutionary reversal of limb reduction has never occurred 1, 2. This is puzzling {{when one considers}} that mutations for POLYDACTYLY (see Glossary) are particularly common. In humans, for example, the most common anomaly at birth is the presence of an extra toe or finger 3, 4 (0. 1 – 0. 2 %). The extra digit can be rudimentary, or fully formed and functional. Polydactyly, either as an evolutionary novelty, or as a result of ATAVISM, is a common phenomenon in other tetrapods 1, 5 (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{permanent}} garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as a peacekeeping force from 1969 to 2007 in Operation Banner. Initially, this was (in the wake of unionist attacks on nationalist communities in Derry and Belfast) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there was a gradual <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop levels to those of a peace-time garrison.|$|E
5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this {{was not enough to}} placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E
5|$|Controversy hit the Championship in the 1921–22 season {{which saw}} the major clubs (including Pro Vercelli, Bologna and Juventus) in {{dispute with the}} FIGC. The best 24 teams had asked for a <b>reduction</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of clubs in the top {{division}} in accordance with a plan drawn up by Vittorio Pozzo, the Italian national team coach. Pozzo's plan was dismissed and the CCI (Italian: Confederazione Calcistica Italiana) was founded and organised a 1921–22 CCI league (Prima Divisione) to run concurrently with the 1921–22 season (Prima Categoria) organised by the FIGC. Therefore, that season saw two champions: Novese (FIGC) and Pro Vercelli (CCI). The schism ended when FIGC accepted to reduce the Northern Championship 1922–23 to only 36 clubs ("Compromesso Colombo/Colombo compromise"); from 1923–24 the Northern Championship was reduced to 24 clubs divided into two groups.|$|E
