40|$|AbstractIsolated {{reception}} plates {{provide an}} engineering approach {{to quantify the}} structure-borne sound power input from machinery through the measurement of the spatial-average velocity level and structural reverberation times. For applications in building acoustics there are practical and economic reasons to consider using <b>coupled</b> <b>reception</b> plates formed by solid heavyweight walls or floors that are structurally coupled to other building elements. This paper uses transient and steady-state statistical energy analysis to investigate how the errors depend upon the building structure to which the <b>coupled</b> <b>reception</b> plate is connected. It is shown {{that the problem is}} twofold. Firstly, in the low- and mid-frequency ranges, the steady-state velocity level on the <b>coupled</b> <b>reception</b> plate is increased by energy returning from other coupled plates. Secondly, the structural decays on the <b>coupled</b> <b>reception</b> plate have significant curvature due to returning energy; hence short evaluation ranges are needed to minimise the error when determining the total loss factor. This leads to a problematic situation where the <b>coupled</b> <b>reception</b> plate appears to give the correct answer due to the error in the energy cancelling out the error in the total loss factor. The latter error can be minimised using short evaluation ranges for the structural reverberation time...|$|R

40|$|Fast-food giant McDonald’s {{announced}} in 2010 {{that they would}} start hosting wedding ceremonies and <b>receptions</b> for <b>couples</b> {{who would like to}} get married in their restaurants in Hong Kong. This paper conducts a study comparing the differing representations of McDonald’s wedding services through a narrative analytical approach. Specifically, this paper examines relevant discourses surrounding the launch of the corporation’s wedding services from the British media (e. g. Daily Mail, the Independent) as well as public discourses in Hong Kong (e. g. McDonald’s Hong Kong website, and CNN’s Hong Kong news).   It is found that these narratives have a significant degree of discrepancy in depicting McDonald’s wedding stories. These differences further raise the question of how differing narrative strategies are employed to conceptualise the brand’s emergent wedding narratives in a unique social-cultural environment.   In the discussion of McDonald’s wedding stories, the focus is placed on the cognitive and linguistic aspects of the discourse. An analytical model of “anchoring” will be proposed and applied to investigate the cooperation’s marketing strategies as well as the media’s reaction towards such promotions. It is argued that a narrative can promote or demote a brand’s identity and position through the process of anchoring. It is further argued that anchoring is an important cognitive-psychological strategy in conceptualization and meaning construction.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of stimulus transport in mammalian taste <b>reception</b> emphasizing the <b>coupling</b> between hydrodynamic and diffusive mass transfer. We show that flow-rate dependence in the phasic portions of the gustatory response {{can be explained by}} a flow-velocity dependent diffusion-boundary layer in series with a flow-indifferent path length. Using data from the literature we show that the concentration dependence of the neural latency to NaCl stimulation in the rat and the threshold concentration can be accounted for by the time course of stimulus arrival and need not imp-ly a uniquely slow sensory transduction process. We develop a generalized response function which describes aspects of the early phasic neural response and shows that early events are governed solely by the local concentration of stimulus. This too is confirmed by data in the literature. The surface pressure is characterized {{as an example of a}} nonmonotonic response function which can account for the general properties of the salt, acid and water response.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} different conditions for integration of immigrants in Swedish rural municipalities. The study examine different assessments by members of the Swedish Rural Network’s Working Group on Integration. The overarching question is what opportunities and obstacles they experience in the integration of immigrants in rural municipalities. This is explored through a series of semistructured interviews, based on three themes of integration: job market integration, social integration and housing integration. The study shows that low residential segregation, closer contact between residents and a committed civil society in rural municipalities create opportunities for integration. The need of labor in different sectors of the job market of rural municipalities and the skills of immigrants can also provide opportunities for integration. The investigation shows how the lack of service and infrastructure, limited labor market, lack of housing and xenophobia are obstacles for the integration of immigrants in rural municipalities. The study points at various measures to improve integration. Among them is the need of immigrant <b>reception</b> to be <b>coupled</b> with development in rural municipalities, with improved plans for housing and infrastructure.

40|$|This paper won {{honorable mention}} in the 2009 Friends of Fondren Library Research Award {{competition}} (graduate research category). Little is known of eighteenth-century dramatic performance. What remains are early printings of scripts and performance reviews buried in archives. In {{order to deal with}} a lack of knowledge of performance style and convention, literature scholars specializing in the eighteenth-century have tended to ignore the period's drama as a live and interactive event and treat only the primary dramatic text in their analyses. I offer authorial testimony and theatre reviews to support a reading which relies upon <b>reception</b> theory <b>coupled</b> with a view of performance as cultural barter, a la theatre anthropology. This study identifies a trend in nabob comedy of the mid-late eighteenth century in which the satire is dislocated onto economically enterprising female characters outside the marriage plot. I first investigate the practicality of this dislocation onto the "safe" and less investigated female character through a reading of a successful and often revived play by Samuel Foote [...] The Nabob. I attempt to prove the prudence of this dislocation by providing evidence of severe and physical audience reaction to the play. I then observe another dislocation of nabob satire onto women in the little known play, Elizabeth Griffith's A Wife in the Right. In this reading, I focus on women as a natural site for relocating nabob satire. As established internal Other in the patriarchal British society, it is a lateral shift for them to represent the threat of a cultural Other in British society-a threat realized by increased international travel. The physical theatrical space foregrounds this cosmopolitan shift in society. The staged physical representation of the female body as a canvas for wealth shown through jewels mined in the East also figures into the female characters tendency to subsume nabob satire in the highly visual medium of the theatre. In this play, the female nabobina figure must be expelled from the nation in order to mitigate the threat of the internal Other-Other in both gender and culture. Ultimately, I argue that through the dislocation of nabob satire onto women, the dramatists make progressive and influential statements about the increasingly diverse and cross-culturally inflected state of British society. In Griffith's case, I offer her nabobina character as an exercise in proto-feminism as well. All of this serves to elevate the oft dismissed genre of eighteenth-century drama and performance as a simultaneously catalytic and reflective site of change...|$|R

40|$|Neighbor {{discovery}} is the procedure using which two wireless devices initiate a first contact. In low power ad-hoc networks, radios are duty-cycled and the latency until a packet meets a reception phase of another device {{is determined by}} a random process. Most research considers slotted protocols, in which the points in time for <b>reception</b> are temporally <b>coupled</b> to beacon transmissions. In contrast, many recent protocols, such as ANT/ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) use a slotless, periodic-interval based scheme for neighbor discovery. Here, one device periodically broadcasts packets, whereas the other device periodically listens to the channel. Both periods are independent {{from each other and}} drawn over continuous time. Such protocols provide 3 degrees of freedom (viz., the intervals for advertising and scanning and the duration of each scan phase). Though billions of existing BLE devices rely on these protocols, neither their expected latencies nor beneficial configurations with good latency-duty-cycle relations are known. Parametrizations for the participating devices are usually determined based on a "good guess". In this paper, we for the first time present a mathematical theory which can compute the neighbor discovery latencies for all possible parametrizations. Further, our theory shows that upper bounds on the latency can be guaranteed for all parametrizations, except for a finite number of singularities. Therefore, slotless, periodic interval-based protocols can be used in applications with deterministic latency demands, which have been reserved for slotted protocols until now. Our proposed theory can be used for analyzing the neighbor discovery latencies, for tweaking protocol parameters and for developing new protocols...|$|R
