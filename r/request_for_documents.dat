5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>documents</b> on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E

Polish criminal code allows for the pursuit of foreign nationals suspected of committing crime against the Polish citizens abroad; which could lead to an extradition request. The Prosecution Office forwarded a request for assistance from Canada. The <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>documents</b> from the Canadian investigation was denied with the rationale that forwarding them is not {{in the best interest of}} that country. Under the circumstances, in December 2011 the Polish investigation was terminated.|$|E

2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed {{to me as if}} I was {{learning}} it for the first time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>documents,</b> or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E

Next, we present a descriptive statistical summary of the traces we collected, which identifies a number of trends and reference patterns in WWW use. In particular, we show that many characteristics of WWW use can be modelled using power-law distributions, including the distribution of document sizes, the popularity of documents as a function of size, the distribution of user <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>documents,</b> and the number of references to documents as a function of their overall rank in popularity (Zipf's law).
