40|$|<b>Return</b> <b>flow</b> to {{groundwater}} is {{the quantity}} of water applied {{at or near the}} land surface which infiltrates back (returns) to the groundwater system. Common uses that lead to <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> are irrigation of agricultural fields, golf courses or lawns, domestic wastewater disposal through septic systems, and artificial recharge. Quantifying the amount of this applied water that percolates to the water table is necessary in many water-short western states to prove beneficial use, evaluate <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> credits, demonstrate the portion of a water right which can be transferred to another party, and for water banking computations in aquifer storage and recovery projects. <b>Return</b> <b>flow</b> analysis is also relevant to municipal water reuse projects, where the impacts to groundwater quality from landscape and golf course irrigation or artificial recharge with treated wastewater are a potential concern.

40|$|Experimental flow {{visualization}} {{is conducted}} here {{to investigate the}} buoyancy-induced <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> structure in mixed convection of gas over a heated circular plate mounted {{on the bottom of}} a horizontal flat duct, simulating that in a horizontal longitudinal flow reactor. In particular, how the <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> induced in the upstream portion of the duct is related to the vortex flow in the downstream is delineated. The results show that at a low buoyancy-to-inertia ratio only steady longitudinal vortex rolls (L-rolls) are induced in the exit half of the duct and no <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> appears in the duct. At an intermediate buoyancy-to-inertia ratio a small flow recirculation exists around the duct inlet near the top wall and the L-rolls become unsteady. When the buoyancy-to-inertia ratio is high and the Reynolds number is small with Reo 10; the upstream <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> is strong and occupies a large region.

Flow visualization also reveals that the splitting of the downstream tip of the <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> zone and the rising of the buoyancy-driven spanwisely extended thermal under the tip generate a pair of counter-rotating transverse rolls in the entry portion of the duct.

40|$|The {{quantity}} of water available for irrigation is getting scarce {{in many countries}} and it assumes great importance for assured crop production, especially {{in view of the}} erratic behavior of the monsoon. Thus, there is a pressing need to improve the water efficiency of irrigation systems. One-way of improving the efficiency of the irrigation system is reusing the <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> from the irrigation system. This task requires quantification of <b>return</b> <b>flow,</b> which still remains as a grey area in irrigation water management. The estimation of <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> from the irrigation system is usually obtained using thumb rules depending upon the site-specific conditions like command area conditions and soil properties. In this paper, a hierarchical modeling technique, namely, regression tree is developed for <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> estimation. Regression tree is built through binary recursive partitioning. The effective rainfall, inflow, consumptive water demand, and percolation loss are taken as predictor variables and <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> is treated as the target variable. The applicability of the hierarchical model is demonstrated through a case study of Periyar-Vaigai Irrigation System in Tamil Nadu, India.

The one-dimensional form of the Richards equation was used for the percolation process and the two-dimensional form of the Richards equation was used for the subsurface <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> process. In each case the Richards equation was transformed to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations using the finite element method to transform the space derivatives and the finite difference method to transform the time derivatives. The system of nonlinear algebraic equations were solved using the Gaussian elimination procedure and an under-relaxation procedure. To characterize the percolation and subsurface <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> processes a sensitivity analysis was performed by varying parameters of the soil systems. It was found that the relationships between stored soil moisture and deep percolation and between stored soil moisture and subsurface <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> each form hysteresis loops. The percolation loops were most sensitive to soil texture class, and water application rate. Soil layering, soil evaporation, water table depth, and evapotranspiration did not greatly influence the percolation loop. The subsurface <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> loops were sensitive to soil texture, soil slope angle, length of the soil slope relative to soil depth, and water application rate. The subsurface <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> loops were not greatly influenced by soil layering.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of coastal}} areas is constantly changing {{under the influence}} of sediments being transported to, from and along the coast. Under storm conditions with high waves and flow velocities, bed forms are being washed out and large quantities of sand are transported in a thin, mm to cm thick layer close to the bed called the sheet-flow layer. Since sand transport under storm conditions is primarily controlled by small scale near-bed processes, development of well-founded methods for predicting near-bed sand transport are critical for estimating sand budget in coastal areas. Various transport models have been developed to predict both the quantities and directions of sediment transport under storm conditions. The majority of the existing models are based on data obtained from oscillatory <b>flow</b> <b>tunnel</b> experiments. Even though oscillatory <b>flow</b> <b>tunnels</b> provide a good approximation of the flow experienced at the sea bed, theory and former experiments indicate that flow differences between full scale progressive surface waves and oscillatory <b>flow</b> <b>tunnels</b> may have a substantial effect on the net sand transport. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the influence of surface wave effects on sand transport under sheet-flow conditions. For the first time, detailed measurements of wave boundary layer flow and sheet-flow layer transport processes under full scale surface waves are presented and analysed. These results give new insights and provide quantitative data of wave boundary flow, sheet-flow layer concentrations, sediment fluxes and net transport rates under velocity skewed surface waves for different wave conditions and types of sediment...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Using {{a linear}} quasi-geostrophic model of large scale {{spiraling}} flow and vertical density gradient {{in the eastern}} North Pacific, we evaluate the complex dispersion relationships for quasi-geostrophic waves. Our calculations indicate that the geostrophic circulation of the eastern North Pacific can locally convert potential energy to mesoscale kinetic energy on a scale comparable to the observed space and time scale and should {{be a source of}} eddy energy, distant from the eddies spawned by the Kuroshio and near the topographic features. But the local growth rates by linear stability analysis do not relate to the observed features of eddy kinetic energy in the eastern ocean; eddy kinetic energy increases to the south and has a maximum in the subtropical region. The non-linear baroclinic instability is analyzed using a three-layer quasi-geostrophic numerical model. Three experiments with different idealized initial mean flow are performed. Local energetics are calculated to highlight the difference between the southward <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> and westward <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> regions. It is found that the boundary flux of mean to eddy kinetic energy conversion is the main differences between two regions: it is large in the westward <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> region but is small in the southward <b>return</b> <b>flow</b> region. Two waves with different characteristics are found: the short waves (periods of 120 days), that propagate to the west and form several wave trains parallel to the southern boundary, and the long waves (periods of 200 days), that propagate to the south-west. These two waves are remarkably similar to the measurements of open ocean eddies at 28 °N and 152 °W.

The study area is located in Salt Lake County, Utah. The Jordan River is an important waterway in Utah because of stakeholder’s dependence on the water that flows along its path from Utah Lake to the Great Salt Lake, the most populous area in the state (see Figure 1). Recently, a group of local water suppliers and wastewater agencies (the Recycled Water Coalition) met and discussed their common interests pertaining to <b>return</b> <b>flows</b> to the Jordan River and wastewater recycling. This study allows the Coalition to consider the flow impacts to the lower Jordan River that may result from changes such as increased wastewater recycling and increased imported water from other outside supply sources.
