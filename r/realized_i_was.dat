He has {{described}} how he became aware of his humor early on: [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> funny at an early age, I realized I could make people laugh at a later age, and then by college time, I was trying to make jokes in terms of writing".|$|E
500|$|Clark {{met with}} a group of wealthy New York Democrats {{including}} Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of Al Gore in 2000, {{met with a}}ll the Democratic candidates but supported Clark in 2004. Clark said that he voted for Al Gore and Ronald Reagan, held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman, and was a registered independent voter throughout his military career. Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because [...] "I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education... I'm pro-health care... I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I {{was going to be a}} happy Democrat." [...] Clark said he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for [...] "internationalism", [...] "ordinary men and women", and [...] "fair play." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia. I realized it was a fumble and did the wrong thing. I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Hayley Louise Brown of Clash {{viewed the}} song as an {{important}} part of the album, musing [...] "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad ‘Thinking About You’ and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean’s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial Odd Future synths and clumsy piano chords." [...] Lane Billings of Paste noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R revivalist. Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, [...] "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean’s falsetto bursts into the song’s upper register." [...] She continued, [...] "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there’s a reason Bey shed a tear the first time she heard it. Regardless of how much these lyrics were influenced by lines like, 'By the time I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless,' the ache in Ocean’s voice is universal. MSN Music's Danielle Cheesman felt that Ocean did his followers a service by featuring the song as the album's opener, describing the track as" [...] the year-old spacey serenade to a boy that became a fan favorite." [...] She continued, [...] "despite now being enhanced with a strings intro, his falsetto - more importantly - remains in tact over the well-known warped ebb and flow." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jason Jr. {{would later}} say [...] "One {{of the most}} {{damaging}} things for me, I realize now, was playing a drunk in the play Long Day's Journey Into Night. In the play, the drunk's father is a failed artist {{and his mother was}} a drug addict. It was only after years of analysis I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> acting out events in my own life on stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Michael said he {{had hidden}} the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother.

2500|$|Blake {{admitted}} to feeling {{the advance of}} age as he entered his fifties. A crucial incident took place in 1952 at Makaha Beach on the western shore of Oahu. Knocked off his board, he could not recover properly and came close to passing out. A companion came to his aid and Blake accepted a ride back to shore, without his board, which eventually washed up on shore, badly nicked. Blake later commented, [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting old... That was the beginning of the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another interview, Fisher {{revealed}} {{that she used}} cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. [...] "Slowly, I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter", she noted. In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed {{on a combination of}} prescription medication and sleeping pills. She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, [...] "I've already played Suzanne." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Spitz {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "When I went to the Olympics, I had every {{intention}} of shaving the moustache off, but I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. [...] I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. [...] I said, 'No, {{as a matter of}} fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.' [...] He's translating {{as fast as he can}} for the other coaches, and the following year every Russian male swimmer had a moustache." ...|$|E

In the United States, Baker was often faced with rejection due to her race: [...] "One day I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> living {{in a country where}} I was afraid to be black. It was only a country for white people. Not black. So I left. I had been suffocating in the United States.... A lot of us left, not because we wanted to leave, but because we couldn't stand it anymore.... I felt liberated in Paris." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1967, Coffin {{concentrated}} increasingly on preaching {{civil disobedience}} {{and supported the}} young men who turned in their draft cards. He was, however, uncomfortable with draft-card burning, worried that it looked [...] "unnecessarily hostile." [...] Coffin was one of several persons who signed an open letter entitled [...] "A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority", which was printed in several newspapers in October 1967. In that same month, he also raised the possibility of declaring Battell Chapel at Yale a sanctuary for resisters, or possibly as the site of a large demonstration of civil disobedience. School administration barred the use of the church as a sanctuary. Coffin later wrote, [...] "I accused them of behaving more like 'true Blues than true Christians'. They squirmed but weren't about to change their minds.... I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> licked." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2005 Curry {{was caught}} making {{anonymous}} edits to the Podcast Wikipedia page, deleting several sections concerning contributions made by fellow podcasting pioneers, Kevin Marks and Stephen Downes, while adding material that emphasized his own {{involvement with the}} development of the medium. Curry went on to evoke ignorance as his primary defense stating, [...] "I edited out the Marks part previously because I never saw a full front-to-back solution that he was credited for...Once I saw the video of the session where he does demo it, after saying he had spoken to me and I had 'challenged' him to create it, I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in error."

5000|$|Kari Lizer, one of {{the staff}} writers, who later went on to create The New Adventures of Old Christine, said, [...] "Weird Science {{turned out to be}} the best job because it made me <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more than an actress who could write monologues for herself.

2500|$|After Chris Brown {{winning a}} Grammy for his [...] "F.A.M.E" [...] album, in the {{category}} [...] "Best R Album of the Year", Eric Bellinger, who co-wrote [...] "Say it With Me" [...] for the album, admitted he was like, [...] "Wow, I'm actually doing something here. I was doing something right {{because so many people}} get nominated and that's it; but {{to be a part of}} a project that actually won was the moment I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the right business." [...] Bellinger also told Billboard Magazine that he stayed with Brown in the studio everyday for about two months. Then, RoccStar and PK played the beat and he immediately thought about Michael Jackson. So they said, [...] "Go in the booth and do some Michael-type stuff." [...] In another interview, Bellinger said, [...] "He [...] really, really went back to the days of Sam Cooke, but we were still able to keep it 2013 at the same time." [...] Bellinger also cited Justin Timberlake as another influence for the song and Brown's upcoming album [...] "X".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the song}}'s release, Lorde teased the song on her Twitter account, saying [...] the [...] "Green Light" [...] would be [...] "different, and kinda unexpected. Complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE." [...] Lorde {{announced}} {{the release of}} the single and its music video on Twitter on 2 March 2017. Later that day, in a Beats 1 interview with Zane Lowe, she also said: The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate towards. I say, 'She thinks you love the beach, you're such a liar.' What the fuck, she thinks you like the beach?! You don't like the beach! It's those little stupid things. It sounds so happy and then the lyrics are so intense obviously. And I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like, 'how come this thing is coming out so joyous sounding?' And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That's her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that's the song for me.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I checked my tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} the scene impelled me to sudden laughter, {{and in the}} next instant I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> becoming hysterical myself; for these were women of my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die. And I remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy. These women, capable of the most sublime emotions, of the tenderest sympathies, were open-mouthed and screaming. They wanted to live, they were helpless, like rats in a trap, and they screamed.|$|E
60|$|A {{quick look}} of {{intelligence}} passed between us, after which I kept my eyes {{turned away from}} the warrior and did not look at him again, for fear that I might arouse the suspicion of the Okarians.
