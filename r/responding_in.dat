5|$|After {{their arrival}} in the United Kingdom, the {{battalion}} was transported by rail {{to the south of}} England where it set up a camp at Lopcombe Corner, on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire. Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain, the battalion's personnel used their integral Vickers machine-guns and Bren guns to provide self-defence against air attack and to bolster the anti-aircraft defences of local areas. They also undertook training exercises and formed a mobile striking force tasked with rapidly <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> the event of an invasion. In September, the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 9th Division. On 14 October the battalion moved to Meeanee Barracks in Colchester, Essex, where it took over responsibility for a defence sector from a British officer training battalion. The 2/9th remained in Colchester until 10 November when orders came for the 18th Brigade to hand over to the 25th Brigade, and the 2/9th was relieved by the 2/31st Battalion. With the threat of invasion passing as winter came, {{the decision was made to}} redeploy the Australians to North Africa where they might be actively employed in combat operations. Following this, preparations for embarkation began as orders were received for the battalion to entrain for Glasgow where, on 15 November 1940, it boarded HMT Strathaird.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism was believed to be used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance was believed to be necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be fused using cards from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|E

5|$|Benfica began December {{hoping to}} extend their {{domestic}} winning streak, and the club's first game hosted Vitória de Setúbal on 1 December. Laionel opened the score for Setúbal in the 35th minute, with Benfica only <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> the second half with Kostas Katsouranis. In the 59th minute, David Suazo fired a powerful shot that beat Pedro Alves and put Benfica in the lead. However, in the 91st minute, a bicycle kick by Anderson do Ó cleared Quim and levelled the game. Although Sánchez Flores called the equaliser an accident, he soon dropped Quim in favour of José Moreira. A week later, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros to play Marítimo. They had their best performance of the season, winning 6–0 with Suazo and Nuno Gomes each scoring twice. The win put Benfica {{at the top of}} the table for the first time since May 2005, and was their largest away win since 1974. On 13 December, Benfica played Leixões for a place in the Portuguese Cup quarter-finals. On a rainy night at Estádio do Mar, neither team could find the back of the net in regular and extra time. Reyes missed a penalty, giving Leixões the win. Although Nuno Gomes was frustrated with the elimination, he said it was time to hold their heads high and win the league. On Thursday the 18th, Benfica closed their European campaign by hosting Metalist Kharkiv. To qualify, Benfica had to win 8–0 and Olympiacos not win; in case of a draw, Benfica needed a better goal average. They lost one-nil, finishing last in Group B. Sánchez Flores assumed full responsibility for his team's performance in the competition. Of 40 teams, only Partizan, Heerenveen and Feyenoord played worse than Benfica. The year ended with a home game against Nacional. Benfica never overcame Nacional goalkeeper Rafael Bracalli, wasting an opportunity to open a four-point lead in the league table. The match ended in controversy after Cardozo had a goal disallowed because Miguel Vítor had deflected the ball with his hands. According to Sánchez Flores, the goal was legitimate and Benfica were deprived of three points.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> a desirable way is a response set, which is a situational and temporary response pattern (Pauls & Crost, 2004; Paulhus, 1991). This is contrasted with a response style, which is a more long-term trait-like quality. Considering the contexts some self-report EI inventories are used in (e.g., employment settings), the problems of response sets in high-stakes scenarios become clear (Paulhus & Reid, 2001).|$|E

25|$|When a Polistes instabilis nest is attacked, the wasps {{defend their}} nests by <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> two {{different}} ways: First they perform a threat response by wagging their gaster and vibrating their wings, and second, some wasps may attack by leaving the nest and physically touching the attacker. There {{seems to be}} no relationship between the amount of investment the wasps have put into their nest and the defense response. This suggests that there are a fixed number of wasps that are semi specialized for nest defense, and such defensive tasks may be assigned {{in the same way as}} other tasks such as foraging.|$|E

25|$|Davitt was a {{brave and}} proud man; an ascetic who {{accepted}} no tribute for his work; on occasions impatient {{with those who}} disagreed with him; sometimes expecting too much from the farmers, as in 1885 when he described them <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> 'self-interest' rather than 'self-sacrifice’. He supported himself with writing and lectures and as a journalist defended the underprivileged, in 1903 publishing the book Within the pale: The True Story of Anti-Semitic Persecutions in Russia. This was based on reports made by him to an American newspaper in 1903 on anti-Semitic outrages in Russia and travel to Russia to investigate the incident.

25|$|Knutton made {{a single}} {{first-class}} appearance for Warwickshire against Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston in 1894.

In their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 146 all out, {{during which he}} bowled six overs. Warwickshire reached 97/4 in their second-innings, {{at which point the}} match was declared a draw. It was in this same year that he first played in the Lancashire League for Enfield, making a single appearance for the club.

In their second-innings, the Army were dismissed for 200, leaving Oxford University with a target of 299 for victory. They fell narrowly short of chasing down that target, dismissed instead for 286, with Coldham scoring 26 runs before he was dismissed by Edward Armitage. He continued to play minor counties cricket for Norfolk, making a total of 52 appearances for the county in the Minor Counties Championship, the last of which came against Buckinghamshire in 1932.|$|E
25|$|<b>Responding</b> <b>in</b> July 2014 to the National Statistical Authority, the Minister to the Cabinet Office {{welcomed the}} {{recommendations}} of a predominantly online census for England and Wales supplemented {{by the use of}} governmental and other administrative data. However, it was also made clear that whereas for 2021 a dual-running dicennial national census with administrative data gathering was viewed as an acceptable transitional approach the government did not seen this as the way forward post 2021. It asked the National Statistician to ensure sufficient research is undertaken and the feasibility of alternative methods validated in the run up to 2021 to replace the traditional national census and intermediate surveying approach from after that date. The Government also indicated it recognised the implications of greater data-sharing between government departments on public confidence in the security and privacy of their personal information.|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not {{in a way that would}} jeopardize the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate anything out of the ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{designated}} the 71st Battalion, the unit {{was raised in}} the United Kingdom in June 1940, as part of the 25th Brigade, which was formed from Australian troops that had been sent to the country to help bolster the garrison after the Fall of France. Understrength upon formation, the battalion consisted of only three rifle companies at the outset, rather than the usual four, and drew personnel from infantry reinforcements and surplus support corps troops. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alonzo Sparkes, individual and collective training was completed at Tidworth Barracks and Colchester, and by October 1940, the battalion was redesignated as the 2/32nd Battalion, to bring them into line with the other units of the Second Australian Imperial Force. At the time, along with the troops of the 18th Brigade, they were tasked with <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> the event of a cross-Channel invasion.|$|E
25|$|In July 1883, Macedonski {{undertook}} one of {{his most}} controversial anti-Junimist actions. That month, Literatorul published an epigram signed with the pseudonym Duna, deriding an unnamed author who had lost his mind. Mihai Eminescu—whom many had already come to see as Romania's national poet—had by then developed a mental disorder which had become known to the general public. Ever since that moment, Macedonski has generally been believed to be Duna, and as a result, was faced with much criticism from both readers and commentators. The intense anti-Literatorul press campaign was initiated in August, when writer Grigore Ventura issued an article condemning Macedonski's attitude (published in the Bucharest-based newspaper L'Indépendance Roumaine), with Macedonski <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> the National Liberal organ Românul. During one evening, Macedonski is reported to have been assaulted by anonymous supporters of Eminescu. His previous conflict with Nădejde was also affected by this renewed controversy: while opposed to Junimist policies, the socialists at Contemporanul voiced their admiration for Eminescu's art.|$|E
25|$|The year {{previous}} to that Knutton {{had been}} playing in the Bradford League when he was selected to play a hastily arranged first-class fixture for an England XI (which contained one former Test player in Willie Quaife) against the touring Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford. The fixture had only come about after the Coronation of King Edward VII had been postponed after the King had developed appendicitis, allowing a fixture to be played on the day in which the King would have been crowned. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Australians made 402 all out in their first-innings. Knutton, who was the only fast bowler in the side, finished with figures of 9/100, including taking the first eight Australian wickets to fall: Trumper, Noble, Hill, Darling, Hopkins, Duff, Armstrong, and Carter, before taking the final wicket to fall, that of Saunders. Despite this, the Australians were still able to amass a large total, mostly down to Duff's 182. <b>Responding</b> <b>in</b> their first-innings, the England XI made 240 all out, with Knutton being dismissed by Noble for 8 runs. Forced to follow-on, the England XI were dismissed for 203, with Knutton contributing being dismissed for 5 runs by the same bowler. Requiring 41 for victory, the Australians reached their target with three wickets down, one of which (Darling's) fell to Knutton. He finished with match figures of 10/117. He never appeared in first-class cricket again, but did continue {{to play in the}} Bradford League, where he took thousands of wickets. However, his high-arm brisk bowling action was sometimes regarded as suspect.|$|E
