40|$|This {{document}} {{has been}} reviewed {{in accordance with}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency policy and approved for publication. Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement or recommendation for use. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive inventory and overview of sources and environmental releases of dioxin-like compounds in the United States. The major identified sources of environmental releases of dioxin-like compounds are grouped into six broad categories: combustion sources, metals smelting, refining and process sources, chemical manufacturing sources, natural sources, and environmental reservoirs. Estimates of annual <b>releases</b> <b>to</b> <b>land,</b> air, and water are presented for each source category and summarized for reference years 1987, 1995, and 2000. The quantitative results are {{expressed in terms of}} the toxicity equivalence (TEQ) of the mixture of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (CDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (CDF) compounds present in environmental releases using a procedure sanctioned by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998. This TEQ procedure translates the complex mixture of CDDs and CDFs characteristic of environmental releases int...|$|E
40|$|A {{life-cycle}} inventory (LCI) is {{the identification}} and quantification of the material and resource inputs and emission and product outputs from the unit processes in {{the life cycle of}} a product system (Figure 2 - 1). For the Design for the Environment (DfE) Computer Display Project (CDP), LCI inputs include materials used in the computer display product itself, ancillary materials used in processing and manufacturing of the displays, and energy and other resources consumed in the manufacturing, use, or final disposition of the displays. Outputs include primary products, co-products, air emissions, water effluents, and <b>releases</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> Specific unit processes for CRTs and LCDs are represented by the boxes in Figures 1 - 6 and 1 - 7, and each unit process has inputs and outputs particular to that process. Figures 2 - 2 and 2 - 3 also show each unit process for both the CRT and LCD life cycles, and graphically displays how they are linked to subsequent processes. This figure will be referred to throughout this chapter in the discussion of each life-cycle stage. Figure 2 - 1. Unit process inventory conceptual diagram This chapter describes the methods for collecting LCI data in the DfE CDP, and presents LCI results. Section 2. 1 describes the general methodology for LCI data collection, while Sections 2. 2 through 2. 6 present the specific methodologies, data sources, data quality, limitations and uncertainties for each life-cycle stage. Section 2. 7 then concludes with the combined LCI data for each monitor type. More specifically, Section 2. 2 presents the LCI methodology for the materials extraction and materials processing (i. e., “upstream”) life-cycle stages, including electricity generation. Electricity is used in several processes throughout each monitor’s life-cycle, and the electricity generating process is linked to the processes that use electricity. As a consequence, the inventory results from electricity generation are reported as part of the associated life-cycle stage for the process to which it is linked. For example, electricity used in manufacturing a product component is included in the manufacturing stage inventory, while electricity used during the use stage is included in the use stage inventory...|$|E

3000|$|Coal seam gas (CSG) is the {{extraction}} of methane gas that is desorbed from the coal seam and brought to the surface using a dewatering and depressurisation process within the saturated coalbed.

In this study, co-produced water from the coal seam of the Bowen Basin (QLD, Australia) was characterised by high concentration levels of Na+ (1156  mg/L), low concentrations of Ca 2 + (28.3  mg/L) and Mg 2 + (5.6  mg/L), high levels of salinity, which are expected to cause various environmental problems if <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> or waters.
