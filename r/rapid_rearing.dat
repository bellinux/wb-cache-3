40|$|Much {{research}} {{has been carried out}} and published on dairy replacement management, in order to rear heifers as efficiently as possible, from both a technical and economical point of view. In most cases, the aim is to rear the heifers at the lowest cost possible without any deleterious effects on future performances. However, the importance of dairy heifer husbandry is not sufficiently well recognized and probably mishandled by most farmers. The present review aims to give an actual overview of rearing procedures in dairy heifers and possible ways to achieve optimal goals. For many years, it has been well known that <b>rapid</b> <b>rearing</b> lowers the age of sexual maturity and consequently may be an efficient way to reduce the non-producing period prior to conception. But this may impair mammary development and consequently future milk production, at least during first lactation. In addition, a growth rate that is too low may not only be costly but also result in animals that are too fat at first calving, creating problems such as calving difficulties, dystocia, etc. Genetic considerations must also be factored, i. e. frame, size, body weight, etc. have changed during the last 20 years and there are differences between breeds. As a result, some time-honoured recommendations may not be appropriate. The present paper reviews factors and management practices that may affect rearing and subsequent performance of dairy heifers...|$|E
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{nutritional}} effects from birth until age at first calving on growth, mammary developmental changes, and first-lactation milk yield in heifer calves. The advancement in the genetic potential and the nutritional requirements of the animals has hastened the growth rate. Genetic selection for high milk yield has suggested higher growth capacity and hence increasing nutritional inputs are required. <b>Rapid</b> <b>rearing</b> by feeding high energy or high concentrate diets not only reduces the age of sexual maturity but also lowers the time period of attaining the age of first calving. However, high energy diets may cause undesirable fat deposition thereby affecting future milk yield potential. Discrepancies exist whether overfed or overweight heifers at puberty can influence the mammary development and future milk yield potential and performance. The data on post-pubertal nutritional management suggested that body weight at calving and post-pubertal growth rate is important in first lactation milk yield. There is a continuous research need for strategic feeding that accelerates growth of dairy heifers without reduction in subsequent production. Nutritional management from birth, across puberty and during pregnancy is critical for mammary growth and for producing a successful cow. This review will mostly highlight studies carried out on dairy breeds and possible available opportunities to manipulate nutritional status from birth until age at first calving...|$|E
5000|$|Low {{normal or}} <b>rapid</b> rise <b>rear</b> derailleurs return the chain {{to the largest}} {{sprocket}} on the cassette when no cable tension is applied. While this was once a common design for rear derailleurs, it is relatively uncommon today. [...] In mountain biking and off-road cycling, the most critical gear changes occur on uphill sections, where riders must cope with obstacles and difficult turns while pedalling under heavy load. This derailleur type provides an advantage over high normal derailleurs because gear changes to lower gears occur {{in the direction of}} the loaded spring, making these shifts easier during high load pedalling.|$|R

While moving at a <b>rapid</b> rate the <b>rear</b> man looked back and saw a train approaching on a track next to the wheel and threw himself from the machine. All six riders were thrown to the express track, but succeeded in getting beyond reach of the train. Later they raced with the fast mail and it was reported they had a close race for [...]|$|R

40|$|Rapid Prototyping {{is used in}} {{embedded}} systems design {{as a means to}} reduce development time and costs. At an early stage in the development cycle, the specification is implemented in a working protoype, which can be used to test the specification and, in real-time systems, also the timing constraints. The <b>REAR</b> <b>Rapid</b> Prototyping Environment was built as an adaptable target platform for embedded real-time systems. It supports both the proof that the system meets all its deadlines, and the automated translation of a system specification into an executable prototype.

40|$|Animals should {{naturally}} select diets {{that provide}} the most benefit for the least cost. Many factors, however, can alter diet selection and may impact the ability to choose optimal diets. For example, dietary history may play {{a large role in}} how quickly an animal will switch to a novel and perhaps more optimal diet. The current study first aimed to evaluate diet quality using growth rate as a proxy in Planorbella trivolvis (Planorbidae) fed a range of common laboratory lettuce diets. Next, we sought {{to determine the extent to}} which diet acclimation influenced subsequent diet selection using the same laboratory lettuce diets. Snails fed cooked green romaine grew significantly more than snails fed cooked yellow romaine, uncooked green romaine or cooked kale. In a series of acclimation/selec-tion experiments, snails naı̈ve to all diets showed no selection, suggesting that prior experience with a diet item is necessary for <b>rapid</b> selection. When <b>reared</b> on a particular diet, however, snails showed a significant preference for that diet after a 5 -d starvation period. Unexpectedly, we found that even snails reared on diets that yielded lower growth rates (e. g. uncooked lettuce) selected that same diet when also provided access to diets that were previously shown to yield higher growth rates. Diet accli-mation clearly influenced subsequent dietary selection. The implications of acclimation and prefer-ence for different dietary items by wild snails are unknown, but are likely ecologically important...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of Hungry Horse Dam inundated 125 km of adfluvial trout habitat in the South Fork of the Flathead River and its tributaries, impacting natural fish reproduction and <b>rearing.</b> <b>Rapid</b> {{residential and commercial}} growth in the Flathead Watershed now threaten the best remaining habitats and restrict our opportunities to offset natural resource losses. Hydropower development and other land disturbances caused severe declines in the range and abundance of our focal resident fish species, bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout. Bull trout were listed as threatened in 1998 under the Endangered Species Act and westslope cutthroat were petitioned for listing under ESA. Westslope cutthroat are a species of special concern in Montana and a species of special consideration by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. The Secure & Protect Fisheries Habitat project follows the logical progression towards habitat restoration outlined in the Hungry Horse Dam Fisheries Mitigation Implementation Plan approved by the NWPPC in 1993. This project {{is also consistent with}} the 2000 Fish and Wildlife Program and the Flathead River Subbasin Plan that identifies the protection of habitats for these populations {{as one of the most}} critical needs in the subbasin and directs actions to offset habitat losses. The Flathead basin is one of the fastest growing human population centers in Montana. Riparian habitats are being rapidly developed and subdivided, causing habitat degradation and altering ecosystem functions. Remaining critical habitats in the Flathead Watershed need to be purchased or protected with conservation easements if westslope cutthroat and bull trout are to persist and expand within the subbasin. In addition, habitats degraded by past land uses need to be restored to maximize the value of remaining habitats and offset losses caused by the {{construction of}} Hungry Horse Dam. Securing and restoring remaining riparian habitat will benefit fish by shading and moderating water temperatures, stabilizing banks and protecting the integrity of channel dimension, improving woody debris recruitment for in-channel habitat features, producing terrestrial insects and leaf litter for recruitment to the stream, and helping to accommodate and attenuate flood flows. The purpose of this project is to work with willing landowners to protect the best remaining habitats in the Flathead subbasin as identified in the Flathead River Subbasin Plan. The target areas for land protection activities follow the priorities established in the Flathead subbasin plan and include: (1) Class 1 waters as identified in the Flathead River Subbasin Plan; (2) Class 2 watersheds as identified in the Flathead River Subbasin Plan; and (3) 'Offsite mitigation' defined as those Class 1 and Class 2 watersheds that lack connectivity to the mainstem Flathead River or Flathead Lake. This program focuses on conserving the highest quality or most important riparian or fisheries habitat areas consistent with program criteria. The success of our efforts is subject to a property's actual availability and individual landowner negotiations. The program is guided using biological and project-based criteria that reflect not only the priority needs established in the Flathead subbasin plan, but also such factors as cost, credits, threats, and partners. The implementation of this project requires both an expense and a capital budget to allow work to be completed. This report addresses accomplishments under both budgets during FY 08 as the two budgets are interrelated. The expense budget provided pre-acquisition funding to conduct activities such as surveys, appraisals, staff support, etc. The capital budget was used to purchase the interest in each parcel including closing costs. Both the pre-acquisition contract funds and the capital funds used to purchase fee title or conservation easements were spent in accordance with the terms negotiated within the FY 08 through FY 09 MOA between the Tribes, State, and BPA. In FY 08, the focus of this project was to pursue all possible properties targeted by the Tribes and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Although we were not be able to acquire an interest in all properties targeted this fiscal year due to limited time, BPA staff constraints, and negotiation constraints, we expended approximately $ 4. 2 M providing BPA with 4. 2 km of credit. The Siderius and Gardner parcels were protected with conservation easements. The Siderius conservation easement is held by the Flathead Land Trust and the Gardner conservation easement is held by the Tribes. Fee title was acquired for three parcels with the Tribes holding title to the Cole and Firestone parcels and MFWP holding title to the parcels acquired from Plum Creek Timber Company. All stream kilometers credited to BPA offset construction and inundation impacts (not operations related impacts) associated with Hungry Horse Dam as defined in the 1991 Hungry Horse Loss Assessment...|$|R
