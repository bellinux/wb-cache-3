40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological {{and other}} studies that require {{participants}} to respond by completing a questionnaire face the growing threat of non-response. Response <b>rates</b> to household <b>telephone</b> surveys are diminishing because {{of changes in}} telecommunications, marketing and culture. Accordingly, updated information is required about the <b>rate</b> of <b>telephone</b> listing in directories and optimal strategies to maximise survey participation. Methods A total of 3426 households in Sydney, Australia were approached {{to participate in a}} computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) regarding their domestic (recycled and/or drinking) water usage. Only randomly selected households in the suburb and postcode of interest with a telephone number listed in the Electronic White Pages (EWP) that matched Australian electoral records were approached. Results The CATI response rate for eligible households contacted by telephone was 39 %. The rate of matching of electoral and EWP records, a measure of telephone directory coverage, was 55 %. Conclusion The use of a combination of approaches, such as an advance letter, interviewer training, establishment of researcher credentials, increasing call attempts and targeted call times, remains a good strategy to maximise <b>telephone</b> response <b>rates.</b> However, by way of preparation for future technological changes, <b>reduced</b> <b>telephone</b> number listings and people's increasing resistance to unwanted phone calls, alternatives to telephone surveys, such as internet-based approaches, should be investigated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress {{instructed}} the FCC {{to ensure that}} all Americans have access to affordable telecommunications services. Consistent with that mandate, the FCC implemented a series of public hearings to discuss with tribes the issues they face concerning low <b>telephone</b> penetration <b>rates.</b> The FCC recommended investigation of universal service in unserved and underserved areas because <b>telephone</b> penetration <b>rates</b> among low-income consumers on tribal lands lagged behind rates {{in the rest of the}} country. From these hearings, the FCC proposed a jurisdictional framework to determine which eligible carriers would be under tribal, state, or federal jurisdiction. This Note argues that the FCC’s proposed tribal and state jurisdiction policies deter eligible telecommunications companies from serving tribal and non-tribal lands, because the process of petitioning the state or federal commission to determine jurisdiction is time-consuming and goes against the principles of tribal sovereignty. In addition, this Note proposes that Congress must expressly limit state jurisdiction in order for <b>telephone</b> penetration <b>rates</b> to increase on tribal lands...|$|R

Many public administration scholars share that belief, but convincing empirical evidence is in short supply, partly because {{it is difficult to}} find agencies that make similar policy decisions, but are structured in different ways, creating the conditions for a “quasi-experimental” test. We examine American state public utility commission decisions about local <b>telephone</b> <b>rates</b> during the recent period of deregulation, using a large set of newly-created measures of bureaucratic discretionary authority.
