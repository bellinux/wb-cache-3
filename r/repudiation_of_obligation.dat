40|$|The {{science of}} law,” {{it has been}} said, “must be drawn from man’s inmost nature. ” The science of {{obligation}} – the dimension of jurisprudence that concerns duties – must be founded upon the experiences of humanity. It should draw upon insight into human flourishing, and it should base its conclusion upon the basic goods involved in human life. Similar recommendations might be suggested for the “science,” if it is one, of love. This paper aims to pursue those projects. The story of David, Bathsheba, and Nathan sheds much light on man’s inmost nature, and on obligation, love, and law. Nathan’s comments must have given David much food for thought. Nathan reminded David of his duty. Of course the Torah forbids adultery, and David had committed it. Nathan’s comments surely led David to reflect about obligation and to ponder the Law. Nathan’s comments likely led David also to reflect upon himself: to consider where he stood {{in relation to the}} Law, and to consider where anyone governed by law must stand. Nathan’s observations further invite the hearer to deliberate about himself, and perhaps about people in general. Such is the force of his statement: “That man is you!” Part II of this article considers duty. It proposes that thought, belief, and character develop along certain lines in a person who accepts obligation. It commends what it terms the “juristic person. ” It discusses {{what might be called the}} “anthropology of the juristic person”: the relationship between obligation and character. It describes several goods involved in being a juristic person and in acting upon obligation. It proposes that the juristic person is best suited to governance by the law. David’s situation also involved love. Nathan, describing the poor man and his lamb, referred to Uriah’s love for Bathsheba. David also loved Bathsheba, at least erotically. Torah has much to say about love. When Nathan states, “That man is you!” he may invite consideration of the meaning and value of various kinds of love. Part III of this paper explores love and its relation to obligation. Some kinds of erotic love lead to the <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> Part III observes, but other forms of love support it. Devoted, faithful love displays a strong affinity for obligation, and in many ways even resembles it. This paper proposes that the juristic person is best suited to love, and that the person who loves, in the higher sense of that term, participates especially well in the goods of obligation. It proposes that the obligation-bearing, obligation-accepting man or woman resembles a lover. Part IV of this paper sketches some implications for the law. David’s anger at the rich man, and his hasty demand for capital punishment, display his shortcomings as a judge...|$|E
5000|$|Answering {{the first}} question, {{they note that}} [...] "The Bible does not {{directly}} address masturbation, leaving Christians to articulate a moral stance from various scriptures that in our view cannot support a deontological prohibition of masturbation... Today the general consensus in the Christian community is that Genesis 38:6-10 is irrelevant to masturbation. Modern readers of course understand Onan's act not as masturbation but as coitus interuptus. The technical designation of the act, however, is unimportant compared to the ethical violations manifesting through the act. The interpretive context for Genesis 38:6-10 {{is found in the}} ancient Israelite law (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)... Whatever his reasons for not consummating intercourse, Onan was punished for violating a specific Hebrew law and for failing in his covenantal duty to his deceased brother. Onan was judged for undisclosed but probably exploitative intentions... and certainly for his callous <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> his traditional <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> familial care and responsibility." ...|$|R
40|$|The state's <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> its <b>obligations</b> on August 17, 1998, {{along with}} {{subsequent}} events (the three-week absence of {{leaders of the}} government of the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of Russia [CBR], and the formation of their new leadership {{over the course of the}} month), led to a radical worsening of the economic crisis. >sup> 1 >/sup> It reached its nadir in September, in the first half of which the country's banking system was virtually entirely paralyzed. As a result, settlements among enterprises ceased and payments to the budget were reduced to a minimum. The decline in the GDP in September and October 1998 was 9. 9 percent compared to the analogous period of the preceding year, and will not be less than 5 percent for the year as a whole. The corresponding figures for the drop in industrial production are 14. 5 percent, 11. 1 percent, and 8. 0 percent, and in investments 14. 3 percent, 11. 5 percent, and 7. 0 percent. The sole area where the situation actually improved in October was agriculture; the decline slowed from 15. 0 percent to 6. 7 percent, and the expected annual decline was at the 8 percent level. But the decline in railroad freight traffic in October, on the contrary, accelerated from 15. 2 percent to 16. 3 percent, and a yearly drop of about 10 percent is being predicted. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} {{processes}} at work to deflect the anger and jealousy many grassroots Papua New Guineans felt toward an indigenous urban middle class that had increasingly monopolized positions of influence and affluence. We focus on the activities of Sepik Women in Trade, a private organization begun by middle-class women whose explicit objective was to assist poor women living primarily in Wewak’s squatter settlements to market their handicrafts. Through this organization’s activities, individual accumulation came to appear not only practically feasible but also morally justified. These processes, reflecting middleclass expectations, were based on a modernist claim that almost everyone could gain access to a certain quality of life. Almost everyone had the potential opportunity and capacity—indeed the right and virtual obligation—to work and save to consume self-evidently desirable goods and services. Correspondingly, those unable or unwilling to accumulate and thereby acquire these goods and services would have primarily themselves to blame. Any ensuing—and persisting—inequality would be understood as less the product of unfair exclusion or <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> kin <b>obligations</b> than <b>of</b> personal failure to fulfill reasonable expectations. Such a perspective, focusing on personal responsibility for failure in (what was being defined as) an open and just system, undercut the idea that categorical exclusion was even a systemic possibility. Through virtual sleights of hand, what were the slights of class exclusion were being presented as reflecting less social injustice than individual failure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{that allows the}} delegation of signature power {{to one or more}} entities that jointly play the role of a proxy signer. This work is different from other related proxy signature schemes in that in addition to providing confidentiality protection to the proxy key, the method provides non-repudiation services to all the parties involved. In particular, it protects against <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> signature delegation by the original signer, <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> proxy signature generation by the proxy signer, and <b>repudiation</b> <b>of</b> receipt of the proxy signature by the signature recipient. This feature is attractive for signature delegation in agent-based paradigm in which proxy signers are mobile agents that are executed in remote untrustworthy hosts.
