25|$|The {{radiation}} {{effects from the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster are the observed and predicted effects resulting from the release of radioactive isotopes from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Radioactive isotopes were released from <b>reactor</b> <b>containment</b> vessels {{as a result of}} venting to reduce gaseous pressure, and the discharge of coolant water into the sea. This resulted in Japanese authorities implementing a 20km exclusion zone around the power plant, and the continued displacement of approximately 156,000 people as of early 2013. Trace quantities of radioactive particles from the incident, including iodine-131 and caesium-134/137, have since been detected around the world.|$|E
25|$|Unit 2 was {{operating}} {{at the time}} of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units. As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power. The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the <b>reactor</b> <b>containment</b> vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen. The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March. The pressure reduction of the <b>reactor</b> <b>containment</b> vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant. A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases. The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.|$|E

40|$|The climatic {{conditions}} inside nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>containments</b> are continuously {{monitored by the}} plant owners in order to e. g. maintain a suitable climate for the mechanical and electrical equipment. Due to the high temperatures, during operation, the concrete within the containment may act as a moisture source contributing to the humidity. To evaluate if, and to what extent, the concrete inside the containment influences the {{climatic conditions}}, the moisture distribution has to be determined. In order to do this, a measurement setup has been developed and tested. The {{results showed that the}} measurement setup was suitable for long term measurements of internal relative humidity in concrete. However, measurements close to the concrete surfaces showed tendencies of leakage, increasing the uncertainties of those measurements. The measurement setup was installed at three <b>reactor</b> <b>containments</b> in Sweden during the summer of 2012. Results from the monitoring campaign on one of the three <b>reactor</b> <b>containments</b> are presented in this paper.

25|$|The {{next day}} at 7:55a.m. the steam was gone. Because the {{radiation}} levels were too high all work to remove rubble was done by remote control. Operations stopped after the steam was found. According to TEPCO the rain on 17 and 18 July was to blame. On 18 July the actual dosage measurement was 562 millisieverts per hour, therefore the NRA ordered TEPCO to make further investigations. On 23 July at 9:05 the steam was seen again {{coming out of the}} fifth floor just above the <b>reactor</b> <b>containment.</b> The night before a rain shower did hit the building, and water might have reached the - 38C - reactor container lid, or might have reached hot fuel left behind in the reactor vessel. At that moment the ambient temperature was 20.3 C and the humidity was 91.2 percent. All work removing rubble from the place was halted. During the last event, radiation levels were measured at 24 locations around the fifth floor of the reactor building. The dosage ranged between 137 millisieverts and 2,170 millisieverts per hour.|$|E
25|$|By midnight, {{water levels}} in the reactor were falling and TEPCO gave {{warnings}} {{of the possibility of}} radioactive releases. In the early hours of 12 March, TEPCO reported that radiation levels were rising in the turbine building for Unit 1 and that it was considering venting some of the mounting pressure into the atmosphere, which could result in the release of some radioactivity. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano stated later in the morning the amount of potential radiation would be small and that the prevailing winds were blowing out to sea. At 02:00 JST, the pressure inside the <b>reactor</b> <b>containment</b> was reported to be 600 kPa (6 bar or 87 psi), 200 kPa higher than under normal conditions. At 05:30 JST, the pressure inside Reactor 1 was reported to be 2.1 times normal levels, 820 kPa. Isolation cooling ceased to operate between midnight and 11:00 JST 12 March, at which point TEPCO started relieving pressure and injecting water. One employee working inside Unit 1 at this time received a radiation dose of 106 mSv and was later sent to a hospital to have his condition assessed.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the event}} of a nuclear power plant {{accident}} the pressure within the nuclear <b>reactors</b> <b>containment</b> building can increase. A FCVS allows for the release of the over-pressure through a scrubber normally containing water, stones and chemicals, where most of the fission products are contained. This reduces the radioactive release to the environment with up to 99%.|$|R
50|$|In {{a modern}} reactor, a nuclear meltdown, whether partial or total, should be {{contained}} inside the <b>reactor's</b> <b>containment</b> structure. Thus (assuming {{that no other}} major disasters occur) while the meltdown will severely damage the reactor itself, possibly contaminating the whole structure with highly radioactive material, a meltdown alone should not lead to significant radioactivity release or danger to the public.|$|R
2500|$|On 29 March, Richard Lahey, {{former head}} of safety {{research}} for boiling-water reactors at General Electric, speculated that the reactor core may have melted through the <b>reactor</b> <b>containment</b> vessel onto a concrete floor, raising concerns of a major release of radioactive material, while failing to divulge the report by Dale G.

25|$|On 3 November 2011 TEPCO {{said that}} the tiny amounts of xenon-135 {{detected}} in the <b>reactor's</b> <b>containment</b> vessel atmosphere came from spontaneous nuclear fission with curium-242 and curium-244, substances that {{were present in the}} nuclear fuel. A critical fission would have caused much higher concentrations of xenon isotopes. These reactions would occur constantly, and did not lead to criticality in the melted fuel of reactor 2.

2500|$|On 15 June 2012 TEPCO {{reported}} that a robot that was sent into the No. 2 reactor building on 13 June 2012 to take video images and radiation measurements, detected a reading of 880mSv (millisieverts) per hour of radiation on the fifth floor, which one floor (4.5 meters) directly above the <b>reactor</b> <b>containment</b> vessel. [...] TEPCO suspects that during initial accident in March 2011, that radioactive substances leaked from the No. 2 reactor moved through the building, but after analyzing the images taken by the robot it {{could not find the}} exact route the radioactive substances traveled, and images taken by the robot found no major damage on the fifth floor. During the March 2011 nuclear accident the No. 2 reactor is believed to have released the largest amount of radioactive substances. But the overall route the radioactive material traveled has yet to be determined. TEPCO needs to find and repair the damaged parts of the reactor to recover melted nuclear fuel before TEPCO can begin the process of decommissioning the reactor.

40|$|Among the {{different}} phenomena expected to occur within nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>containments</b> during a postulated loss of coolant accident, condensation on containment walls {{plays a major}} role, since it represents an important heat sink for evacuating the energy released by the discharge of the primary water.

In this scenario, the role of condensation is not obvious, since it can locally aid the hydrogen produced by the oxidation of the core claddings to concentrate and reach flammability limits, providing a dangerous effect instead of a positive one.
