40|$|To {{carry out}} washery {{optimization}} calculations {{in a digital}} computer, both the <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> characteristics and separator efficiency performance must {{be reduced to a}} form that is both accurate and easv to translate into code. A systematic analysis has been made of mathematical representation for partition curves and separation characteristics for froth flotation machines. A number of representations of the partition curves {{have been found to be}} useful. The programs developed accept conventional partition data or modelled partition curve parameters. Flotation performance is specified according to a two-rate constant kinetic model. <b>Feed</b> <b>coal</b> characteristics used are typical for coal preparations plants in China. Optimization of the process is carried out by maximization of yield, and three programs have been developed for the purpose. The programs can deal with any one of seven plant flowsheets commonly used in China. One program can be applied to determine the optimal ash content of clean coal for either each category of separator or each <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> group. The other two programs are very useful to determine the optimal cut points of separators being installed in a plant. The computing techniques applied in both the programs are the Rosenbrock pattern search and the so-called “Replacement Method”. The cubic spline interpolation techniques have been applied in a number of calculations with success. All the programs have been proved to be effective and convenient tools for the design and operation of coal preparation plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{undertaken}} to assess the relationship between raw coal and effluent quality of Zarand coal washery plant, Kerman province in southeast Iran. <b>Coal</b> samples, <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> <b>feed,</b> washed fine clean coal and middling were collected. In washing process, raw water (intake to washery) and effluent samples generated in the washeries, namely, fine coal jig under water and tailing pond water were collected during August-September 2009. In coal samples, trace elements were determined in various fractions of Zarand coal washery. Parameters such as pH, temperature, colour, odour, TSS, oil and grease, COD, and trace and heavy metals were measured in washery processing. TSS, COD and oil and grease were very high in water samples. Trace elements like Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cr, Mn and As {{were found to be}} present in the process water indicating that these elements are not released by coal during washing...|$|R

40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as <b>feed</b> <b>coals</b> to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite maceral group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

40|$|Beneficiation of coal {{refers to}} the {{production}} of wash coal from raw coal with the help of some suitable beneficiation technologies. The processed coal is used by the different steel plants to serve their purpose during the manufacturing process of steel. The present paper deals with the optimal planning for blending raw coal of different grades used for beneficiation with a view to satisfy the requirements of the end users with desired specifications. The input specifications of coal samples are known whereas the output specifications are imprecise in nature. The aim of the work is to fix the level of the raw coal from different coal seams to be fed for beneficiation to meet the desired target of yield and ash percentage to maximum extent. Further, it is also desired by the decision-maker (DM) to restrict the input cost of raw coal to be fed for beneficiation. The problem is modeled as multicriteria decision-making problem with imprecise specifications. Fuzzy set theoretic approach has been used and a corresponding model has been developed. The solution of the problem would enable the DM to optimize the <b>raw</b> <b>coal</b> <b>feed</b> with existing available specifications from different collieries along with the overall degree of satisfaction.

40|$|The {{mineral matter}} in typical <b>feed</b> <b>coals</b> used in South African {{gasification}} processes and the ash derived from gasifying such coals {{have been investigated}} {{using a variety of}} mineralogical, chemical and electron microscope techniques. The mineral matter in the <b>feed</b> <b>coals</b> consists mainly of kaolinite, with minor proportions of quartz, illite, dolomite, calcite and pyrite plus traces of rutile and phosphate minerals. The calcite and dolomite occur in veins within the vitrinite macerals, and are concentrated in the floats fraction after density separation. Some Ca and Ti also appear to be present as inorganic elements associated with the organic matter. Electron microscope studies show that the gasification ash is typically made up of partly altered fragments of non-coal rock, bonded together by a slag-like material containing anorthite and mullite crystals and iron oxide particles, with interstitial vesicular glass of calcic to iron-rich composition. Ash formation and characteristics thus appear to be controlled by reactions at the particle scale, allowing the different types of particles within the <b>feed</b> <b>coal</b> to interact with each other in a manner controlled mainly by the modes of mineral occurrence. Integration of such techniques provides an improved basis for evaluating ash-forming processes, based on quantitative phase identification, bulk and particle chemistry, and the geometric forms in which the different phases occur...|$|R
