40|$|The 'communication through coherence' (CTC) {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} selective communication among neural networks {{is achieved by}} coherence between firing rate oscillation in a sending region and gain modulation in a <b>receiving</b> <b>region.</b> Although this hypothesis has stimulated extensive work, it remains unclear whether the mechanism can in principle allow reliable and selective information transfer. Here we use a simple mathematical model to investigate how accurately coherent gain modulation can filter a population-coded target signal from task-irrelevant distracting inputs. We show that selective communication can indeed be achieved, although the structure of oscillatory activity in the target and distracting networks must satisfy certain previously unrecognized constraints. Firstly, the target input must be differentiated from distractors by the amplitude, phase or frequency of its oscillatory modulation. When distracting inputs oscillate incoherently in the same frequency band as the target, communication accuracy is severely degraded because of varying overlap between the firing rate oscillations of distracting inputs and the gain modulation in the <b>receiving</b> <b>region.</b> Secondly, the oscillatory modulation of the target input must be strong {{in order to achieve}} a high signal-to-noise ratio relative to stochastic spiking of individual neurons. Thus, whilst providing a quantitative demonstration of the power of coherent oscillatory gain modulation to flexibly control information flow, our results identify constraints imposed by the need to avoid interference between signals, and reveal a likely organizing principle for the structure of neural oscillations in the brain...|$|E
30|$|The {{migration}} {{literature has}} focused on determining the decisions of migrants whether to migrate or not {{and the impact of}} related remittances on development. However, {{there are only a few}} studies on the length of migration. Djajic and Milbourne (1988), Galor and Stark (1990), and Dustmann (1995, 2000) analyzed the importance of migration as part of a lifetime utility maximization plan with given budget (and liquidity) constraints. The decision on whether to migrate or not, as well as the optimal point to return, is considered as the decision of the individual with the purpose to achieve a lifetime utility maximization. Dustmann (2003) added different macro factors to this basic framework. He used data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and a simple dynamic model to determine the optimal migration duration. He found that if migration is temporary, the duration of migration decreases when the economic disparity between the sending region and the <b>receiving</b> <b>region</b> increases. A wage increase in the <b>receiving</b> <b>region</b> will increase the marginal value of the stay (relative wage effect). At the same time, it decreases the marginal utility of wealth since the migration costs such as the living costs at the destination increase. Migrants, on the one hand, would like to remain at their destination as a response to increasing wages; on the other hand, the gain from staying decreases and this has a counteracting effect. Therefore, higher wages in destination areas may have a positive or negative effect on the optimal duration of migration.|$|E

40|$|There {{are various}} reasons {{to assume that}} there is a {{relationship}} between migration and health. The direction of this relationship is a complex one though. Young adults tend to be healthier than their non-migrating counterparts, while older migrants are on average less healthy (Bentham, 1988; Findlay, 1988; Norman et al., 2005). A number of factors account for the negative health differential between migrants and non-migrants. First, migration is often from less privileged areas to more wealthy regions. Migrants carry with them their less healthy state as a result of less healthy conditions in the sending region to the receiving area. Second, migrants, after arrival in their new residence, often have less access to health facilities than natives, because of their lower status, differences in languages and knowledge with the <b>receiving</b> <b>region</b> (eg regarding availability and access to health services). These effects diminish as residence duration increases. A counter hypothesis to the hypothesis of deprived health of migrants is that migrants are on average healthier than natives due to the selective nature of migration, whereby only the fittest individuals of a community decide to move.

30|$|As for {{terrestrial}} animals and plants, {{there are some}} general rules that separate non-native aquatic species that successfully pass through the invasion sequence from those that do not. Some of the characteristics that influence invasion success are associated with biological traits whereas others are closely linked to interaction with humans. For example, species introduced intentionally (and hitchhiking species associated with them) because they have desirable attributes {{tend to be more}} successful than undesired species. Prominent examples in marine environments include the introductions of alien shellfish species (e.g. Crassostrea gigas introduced to France from Japan) for mariculture, which have arrived with several associated parasites and algae. Additionally, many of the most widespread non-native aquatic species in Europe are generalists that can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions such as water temperature and salinity. European brackish water systems hold a great diversity of invaders which may be due to their poor native species richness [90] and the great ecological plasticity of the non-native species that have established. In addition to the breadth of ecological niches, similarity of environmental conditions in the donor and the <b>receiving</b> <b>region</b> can also be crucial [28].

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to show the extent to which mechanical movement of the population influences basic regional development processes, and what that relation is in individual historical periods. The effects of migration on indirect or direct definition of regional structures, interrelations and processes are considered. When the influence of migration on regional development is being viewed, its twofold function should be taken into account. The mobile part of the human population (the migrational contingent) changes its geographical position mechanically by leaving the region of origin and thus, proportionally to its demographic volume, »carries off« its human potential (biological, structural, cultural etc.) into the immigrational region, in this way impoverishing the region of its origin to the extent to which it enriches the immigrational region. Each form of migration unavoidably influences the regional starting point and the migrational destination as well. If we regard the region as a separate territorial unit in which no restrictive migrational barriers exist, we may speak of a region that is neutral from an emigrational, immigrational or migrational aspect, depending on the qualifying sign on the migration balance. In the first case, it is a matter of a more intensive mechanical outflow from the region than the simultaneous mechanical inflow to that region. In the second case, more people are moving into the region than are moving out of it, while in the third, the migrationally balanced case, the level of migrational flows is equal or almost equal to immigrational flows. In a separate chapter, there is a discussion on the positive and negative effects of migration on the demographic development of the <b>receiving</b> <b>region</b> and on the region of origin of the migrants...|$|E

It concentrates on the economic aspects of migration and on information that is relevant for the six semi-arid countries that are the focus of the PRISE (Pathways to Resilience in Semi-Arid Economies) project: Burkina Faso, Senegal, Kenya, Tanzania, Pakistan and Tajikistan. Policy intervention is required to reduce potential negative impacts in both the sending and <b>receiving</b> <b>region.</b> Badly managed migration is associated with high economic, social and psychological costs. Key findings: To ensure effective migration choices and a good management of the wider socio-economic effects, policy-makers should: Provide sufficient information about {{the costs and benefits of}} migrating, including psychological and social, along with more clarity about alternative adaptation options. Release credit constraints, present in all PRISE countries and in particular in Senegal and Tajikistan, to offset the up-front costs incurred by potential migrants, particularly high in areas with poor transportation infrastructure. Improve institutional quality to ensure the incentives to migrate are not reduced, in particular in the context of land tenure security when people are not able to sell their land or are not confident of reclaiming it upon return. Define the legal status of environmental migrants, for example, through a process led by the UN or UNHCR, in order to give people certainty about their legal situation. Put in place safeguards against distress migration, for example in the event of conflict, which can force people to choose sub-optimal migration strategies, leading to maladaptation. Support the areas affected by outward migration by promoting links between migrants and their region of origin; “managed retreat” from severely affected regions may be a last resort if they become inhospitable. Support the absorptive capacity of the receiving jurisdictions, in particular urban labour markets and public services, to manage the socio-economic implications of the arrival of migrants in a new destination. Direct migrants away from environmentally vulnerable areas where they move to for different reasons, as is the case in Senegal where more than 40 per cent of new migrant populations are located in high risk flood zones...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{simplified}} NEG model, we investigates {{the relation between}} labor diversity and agglomeration. In the theoretical part, we assume the following two-region model. Homogenous consumption goods are produced using a constant returns technology with homogenous capital and heterogenous workers. The production function exhibits increasing returns to scale in labor diversity. Capital is freely mobile between the regions, while workers are immobile but can commute to the other region by paying the commuting cost. Considering the circular causation in this model, the backward linkage (i. e. agglomeration caused by labor demand) implies the agglomeration of capital leads workers to concentrate. The forward linkage (i. e. agglomeration caused by labor supply) implies {{the increase in the}} number of workers enhances labor diversity and causes agglomeration of capital. The theoretical result is summarized as follows. When interregional commuting cost is sufficiently low, workers tend to choose their jobs in the region with a larger share of capital. Furthermore, the inflow of commuting workers increases the degree of labor diversity in the labor <b>receiving</b> <b>region,</b> and causes agglomeration of capital. In the empirical part, we confirm the theoretical results by covariance structure analysis with Japanese prefectural datas. We construct path diagrams describing the above backward and forward linkages. In order to measure the latent factor of labor diversity, we use following six indices: newspaper subscription, car registration, votes share in national election, foreign travel, white-collar share, and interregional commute. As an empirical result, we reveal the existence of the circular causation in Japan. Concretely, on the backward linkage, capital agglomeration (the number of firms) has a significant and positive indirect effect on labor agglomeration (the number of workers) through the wage income of workers, as well as a direct effect on labor agglomeration. The forward linkage is also positive and significant. Labor agglomeration significantly enhances the labor diversity, and the labor diversity raises capital reward (firms 8 ̆ 1 f profit) and leads capital (firms) to agglomerate. Besides, the labor diversity is strongly and significantly influenced by the indices of the car registration, the foreign travel, and the white-collar share. The empirical analysis in Japan supports the theoretical result that labor diversity causes agglomeration through the circular causation...|$|E
