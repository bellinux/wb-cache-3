Treatments were tested either alone or combined with mechanical root canal treatment and various irrigant solutions against C. albicans in root canals in vitro. Methodology: 240 extracted, human, single-rooted teeth were divided into four groups (n = 60). In Group 1 <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> <b>enlargement</b> up to ISO-size 60 (MAF) was performed, whereas only initial shaping (MAF ISO-size 40) was carried out in Groups 2 to 4. After sterilization all teeth were inoculated with C. albicans (ATCC 90028) and incubated for 14 days, followed by evaluation of CFU (CFU/ml; CFU: colony forming units) in every teeth. Complete <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> <b>enlargement</b> up to ISO-size 60 was performed in Groups 2 to 4 using NaCl solution (0. 9 %) in Group 2, NaOCl (1 %) in Group 3 and CHX (0. 2 %) in Group 4. Finally, each group of 60 teeth was subdivided into four groups (n = 15 each) either using diode laser radiation for 40 seconds, application of gaseous ozone for 120 seconds or applying Ca(OH) 2 or CHX-gel for 7 days, followed by final evaluation of CFU. Results: The reduction of C. albicans after application of Ca(OH) 2 and CHX-gel was in all groups significantly higher than after diode laser treatment or application of gaseous ozone (p < 0, 001; Chi-Quadrat-test). After diode laser irradiation or treatment with gaseous ozone in combination with chemomechanical root treatment in 66, 7 % of the specimen cell concentration lower than 5 × 10 ² CFU/ml were detectable, this is equivalent to a reduction of 7, 99 × 106 CFU/ml. The antifungal efficacy was significantly increased by the additional use of NaOCl or CHX as irrigants (p < 0, 001; Chi-Quadrate-test), but not significantly influenced by mechanical root treatment (α = 0, 0042; Chi-Quadrate-test). CHX-gel was highly effective against C. albicans. Conclusion: Both, laser and ozone, seem to be suitable for disinfection of C. albicans containing root canals in vitro.

In vitro and in vivo research in this field, traditionally microbiological culture methods using paper point sampling and quantitative culture, faces difficulties in completely removing bacteria from the root canal system and analyzing sequential procedures. This study employed genetically engineered bioluminescent bacteria and a light-sensitive imaging system to allow real-time visualization of the infection. Ten extracted teeth incubated with P. aeruginosa were treated by mechanical instrumentation with K-files (# 30 K-file, # 35 K-file and # 40 K-file) and chemical irrigation with sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide. Irrigation alone reduced the contamination in 18 %; the first chemomechanical sequence (instrumentation with a # 30 K-file + irrigation) provided 41 % of reduction; the second sequence (# 35 K-file + irrigation) achieved 62 %; and the complete therapy (# 30 K-file + # 35 K-file + # 40 K-file + irrigation) achieved 93 % of bacterial reduction. These results suggest that the endodontic treatment is dependent on the association of a chemical and mechanical approaches and that <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> <b>enlargement</b> improves bacterial reduction probably because the irrigation has more access to the apical third.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the flow of irrigants inside the root canal during root canal treatment using a Computational Fluid Dynamics model. Clinically realistic data on the pressure and flow rate of the irrigant were acquired through ex vivo measurements. Accurate measurements of the dimensions of the endodontic irrigation needles were conducted by Scanning Electron Microscopy. These data were used to set up a Computational Fluid Dynamics model. The model was validated by comparison with experimental measurements and subsequently used to investigate the effect of needle tip design, needle insertion depth, apical preparations size and root canal taper on the irrigant flow. The flow pattern of the open-ended needles was different from the closed-ended needles resulting in more irrigant replacement in front of the open-ended needles but also higher apical pressure. <b>Root</b> <b>canal</b> <b>enlargement</b> to sizes larger than 25 appeared to improve the performance of syringe irrigation. Adequate space between the needle and the canal wall should be ensured to allow for an effective reverse flow of the irrigant towards the canal orifice. An increase in the root canal taper was found to improve irrigant replacement and wall shear stress while reducing the risk for irrigant extrusion.

40|$|Aim  To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} apical preparation size on irrigant flow inside a root canal during final irrigation with a syringe and two different needles types, using a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Methodology  A validated CFD model was used to simulate the irrigant flow from either a side-vented or a flat 30 G needle positioned inside root canals having sizes of 25, 35, 45 and 55, all with a. 06 taper, at 3 mm short of working length (WL). Velocity, pressure and shear stress in the root canal were evaluated. Results  Different preparation sizes resulted in minor differences in the flow pattern in the apical root canal. Major differences were observed between the two needle types. The side-vented needle could not achieve irrigant replacement to the WL even in a size 55,. 06 taper root canal. Significant irrigant replacement was evident almost to the WL in size 35, 45 and 55,. 06 taper root canals with the flat needle. The maximum shear stress decreased as the preparation size increased. The flat needle developed higher mean pressure at the apical foramen. Both needles led to a similar gradual decrease in apical pressure as the preparation size increased.

This paper presents a rapid method developed to generate a comprehensive tooth FE model using data retrieved from micro-computed tomography (μCT). With this method, the inhomogeneity of material properties of teeth was included into the model without dividing the tooth model into different regions. The material properties of the tooth were assumed {{to be related to}} the mineral density. The fracture risk at different tooth portions was assessed for <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatments. The micro-CT images of a tooth were processed by a Matlab software programme and the CT numbers were retrieved. The tooth contours were obtained with thresholding segmentation using Amira. The inner and outer surfaces of the tooth were imported into Solidworks and a three-dimensional (3 D) tooth model was constructed.

Methods: Pre-operative canal impressions were obtained from 24 extracted single-rooted premolars. Canals were randomly assigned to be firstly, instrumented with stainless steel K-type files or rotary nickel-titanium instruments (Profile), then further apically enlarged with rotary nickel-titanium instruments (Profile or Lightspeed). Post instrumen-tation impressions were taken and digitally photographed in a bucco-lingual and mesio-distal orientation at low-power magnification. Images were evaluated for procedural defects, changes in <b>canal</b> curvature, <b>canal</b> <b>enlargement</b> and <b>canal</b> rounding at 1, 3 and 7 mm from the working length. Results: Silicone impressions could accurately reproduce the detailed <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> morphology of single-canal premolars.

Dentists now must be educated on the current concepts in order to optimally perform a <b>root</b> <b>canal.</b> <b>Root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy has become more automated and can be performed faster thanks, in part, to machine driven rotary technology and more advanced <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> filling methods. Many <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> procedures are done in one dental visit which may last for around 1-2 hours. Newer technologies are available (e.g. cone-beam CT scanning) that allow more efficient, scientific measurements to be taken of {{the dimensions of the}} <b>root</b> <b>canal.</b> Many dentists use dental loupes to perform <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> therapy, and the consensus is that <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> performed using loupes, or other forms of magnification (e.g. a surgical microscope), are more likely to succeed than those performed without them. Although general dentists are becoming versed in these advanced technologies, they are still more likely to be used by <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> specialist (known as endodontists).|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> microbiota of primary teeth with apical periodontitis and the in vivo antimicrobial {{effects of a}} calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste used as <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing. Design. Baseline samples were collected from 30 <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> of primary teeth with apical periodontitis. Then, the <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> were filled with a calcium hydroxide paste containing 1 % chlorhexidine for 14 days and the second bacteriologic samples were taken prior to <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> filling. Samples were submitted to microbiologic culture procedure to detect <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> bacteria and processed for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Results. Baseline microbial culture revealed high prevalence and cfu number of anaerobic, black-pigmented bacteroides, Streptococcus, and aerobic microorganisms. Following <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing, {{the overall number of}} cfu was dramatically diminished compared to initial contamination (P 0. 05). Of 35 probes used for checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, 31 (88. 57 %) were present at baseline, and following <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing, the number of positive probes reduced to 13 (37. 14 %). Similarly, the number of bacterial cells diminished folowing application of calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing (P = 0. 006). Conclusion. Apical periodontitis is caused by a polymicrobial infection, and a calcium hydroxide/chlorhexidine paste is effective in reducing the number of bacteria inside <b>root</b> <b>canals</b> when applied as a <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> dressing.

40|$|BACKGROUND Three {{dimensional}} obturation of the <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> {{is important}} for success of <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment. Microleakage {{is one of the}} reason for <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> failure. Numerous materials have been used for obturation of which Gutta-percha is the most successful with variety of sealers. One of the recent material to further improve <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> treatment success rate is use of Resilon with Epiphany <b>root</b> <b>canal</b> sealer to apply adhesive concepts in to endodontics. An adhesive bond forms between Epiphany sealer, Resilon and dentin, making it monolithic hence less microleakage if any significantly. METHODS 60 single rooted mandibular premolars were dissected at cement enamel junction with diamond disc. <b>Root</b> <b>canals</b> were explored and working length measured using K file. <b>Root</b> <b>canals</b> of all 60 samples were prepared with ProTaper and irrigated with 5...|$|R
