40|$|Designed to {{contribute}} to {{an assessment of the}} effects of the second agreement with general practitioners, the study analyzes the effects produced on the medical practices of general practitioners by pay range of a) the individual income ceiling and b) various types of fee restrictions on <b>supplementary</b> medical <b>procedures</b> provided under the agreement. The methodology used consisted basically in analyzing the variations of selected indicators of professional activity and medical practice among general practitioners by pay range following the implementation of the second agreement. Control groups were used to facilitate the assessment of other factors that may have influenced the variations referred to. The study shows that the income ceiling has resulted in a significant slowdown in the professional activity of general practitioners whose income had been in excess of the income ceiling in the year preceding the agreement. The shorter work period was accompanied by a longer vacation period. From the second part of the study it appears that the implementation of the second agreement has also appreciably reduced differences in medical procedures by pay range.

40|$|AbstractAim {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to analyse the effect of {{supplementary}} endovascular intervention on the outcome of primary endoluminal repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Methods between May 1992 and December 1998, 266 patients underwent endoluminal repair of AAA. Minimum period of follow-up was 6 months. Those patients in whom the endoprosthesis could not be deployed were converted to open repair at the primary operation. Patients developing an early endoleak, within 31 days, were treated by a period of observation and secondary endovascular intervention in persistent cases. Patients developing a late endoleak were treated similarly, without a period of observation. Outcome was analysed by the life-table method. Primary success was defined as exclusion of the aneurysm from the circulation resulting from the original operation. Assisted success occurred when aneurysms with endoleaks became excluded from the circulation as a result of supplementary endovascular intervention. Results endoluminal repair failed in 17 patients requiring conversion to open repair at the original operation. Supplementary endovascular intervention was undertaken in 26 patients, with early endoleaks (n= 6) and late endoleaks (n= 20). Interventions involved deployment of secondary endoluminal grafts within the primary grafts (n= 22), and coil embolisation (n= 4). Successful exclusion of the aneurysm sac was achieved in 22 of 26 (85 %) patients undergoing <b>supplementary</b> endovascular <b>procedures.</b> Conditional cumulative incidence of primary graft failure and secondary graft failure in the presence of all-cause mortality at 6 years was 47 % and 25 % respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{advocate}} simple calcaneal osteotomy as an effective treatment to relieve fatigue, improve shape and prevent abnormal shoe wear in patients with mobile flat foot. It is reserved for those cases in which conservative measures have failed and the symptoms warrant surgical treatment. The concept of calcaneal osteotomy is an old one. The first description was given by Gleich iii 1893 (quoted by Silver, Simon, Spindell, Litchman and Scala 1967). Gleich’s technique involved displacement of the posterior fragment forwards, medially and downwards in an attempt to restore the normal angle between the long axis of the calcaneus and the floor. This was achieved by excision of a medial wedge. In 1923 Lord reported thirteen cases of calcaneal osteotomy for severe flat foot.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Frozen embryo {{transfer}} {{is an important}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>procedure</b> {{in the treatment of}} infertility. While general information concerning the outcome of frozen {{embryo transfer}} has been documented, few studies have addressed the potential of embryo implantation in particular clinical situations. Importantly, the risk of multiple conception following frozen embryo transfer has been poorly documented compared with the information available for fresh embryo transfer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study analysing 3570 frozen embryo transfer cycles (1438 couples) with a view to increasing our understanding of the clinical circumstances that influence the potential for embryo implantation. RESULTS: The overall implantation rate was 9. 1 %. The characteristics associated with a more favourable implantation rate were the success of the previous fresh embryo transfer cycle, age < 40 years and non-tubal factor aetiology of infertility. Such women had an increased risk of multiple conception. CONCLUSION: Female age, the aetiology of infertility and the outcome of fresh embryo transfer are the most important factors influencing the implantation rate following frozen embryo transfer. A prognostic table has been constructed that may assist with the determination of the optimal number of embryos to be replaced in frozen embryo transfer to provide better individualized counselling and to secure an optimal chance of pregnancy while reducing the risk of multiple conception.

40|$|The present paper aims at {{providing}} {{an evaluation of}} the effectiveness of the application of GAEC standard 4. 6 (ex 4. 1 c) of cross compliance in the Italian grazing system, {{in the light of the}} recent bibliography. Given the changes occurred in the last decades and the effects of application of the rule, the latter appears broadly positive but susceptible of adjustments. Nowadays the Italian grazing system is no longer characterized by a problem of overstocking, which led the legislator, in the past, to identify and enforce the limit of 4 LU/Ha as maximum stocking rate. The problem is probably the opposite: the too low rate and the absence of animals on many grazing areas of Italy. These areas, when totally abandoned by pastoral herding, have evolved, or rather convoluted, towards a shrub vegetation of nutritional and landscape low value. Recent bibliography shows, on one side, the value of 3 LU/ha as high rate, while on the other side, it speaks of need or urgency to maintain a minimal stocking rate for the conservation of pastures, otherwise overgrown by bushes and plants not appetite by animals. With these statements, here we propose an update of stocking rate limits, subordinated to individual interventions by Regions for specific situations: minimum 0. 3 LU/ha, maximum 3 LU/ha, and suggest <b>Regional</b> <b>supplementary</b> measures, mostly concerning the study for locating macro-areas (zoning) and specific stocking rates, which ought not be less than 25 % of the potential rate in any case...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of a new decontamination technology, referred to as 'high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental decontamination system' (HINS-light EDS) was evaluated {{by a series of}} three studies carried out in a hospital isolation room used to treat burns patients. The ceiling-mounted HINS-light EDS emits high-intensity 405 nm light which, although bactericidal, is harmless to patients and staff thereby permitting continuous environmental disinfection throughout the day. Performance efficacy was assessed by contact agar plate sampling and enumeration of staphylococcal bacteria on environmental surfaces within the room before, during and after HINS-light EDS treatment. When the room was unoccupied, use of HINS-light EDS resulted in similar to 90 % reduction of surface bacterial levels and when the room was occupied by an MRSA-infected burns patient, reductions between 56 % and 86 % were achieved, with the highest reduction (86 %) measured following an extended period of HINS-light EDS operation. In an on/off intervention study, surface bacterial levels were reduced by 62 % by HINS-light EDS treatment and returned to normal contamination levels two days after the system was switched off. These reductions of staphylococci, including Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus, by HINS-light EDS treatment were greater than the reductions achieved by normal infection control and cleaning activities alone. The findings provide strong evidence that HINS-light EDS, used as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>procedure,</b> can make a significant contribution to bacterial decontamination in clinical environments.

Retrospective cohort study with prospective registration of cancer in general practice. Setting and subjects. One hundred and fi fty-seven Norwegian general practitioners (GPs) reported 261 cancer patients. Method. During 10 consecutive days, GPs registered all patient consultations and recorded any presence of seven focal symptoms and three general symptoms, commonly considered as warning signs of cancer (WSC). Follow-up was done six to 11 months later. For each patient with new or recurrent cancer, the GP completed a questionnaire with medical-record-based information concerning the diagnostic procedure. Results. In 78 % of cancer cases, symptoms, signs, or tests helped diagnose cancer. In 90 cases, there were 131 consultation-recorded WSC that seemed related to the cancer. Further symptoms were reported for another 74 cases. Different clinical signs were noted in 41 patients, 16 of whom had no previous recording of symptoms.
