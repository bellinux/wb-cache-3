40|$|For {{construction}} equipment in general fuel efficiency {{is one of}} the most critical product attributes. Pure fuel economy improvements from the engines are extremely expensive to develop. This creates an incitement for development of hybrid technology. This thesis was done in corporation with CPAC Systems in Gothenburg, Sweden. With regenerative braking, the energy that is normally transferred into heat during braking can be stored in a battery or a super capacitor and the stored energy can later be used for propulsion. However the regenerative braking also affects the vehicle dynamics and the driver’s interpretation of the brake pedal which demands for a physical <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> for <b>testing.</b> In this thesis a <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> for <b>testing</b> of concepts was developed and built and a brake blending system was developed and tested on the <b>test</b> <b>platform.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> was built in small scale compared to a full wheel loader with an articulated rideable lawn mower as base. A small scale <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> has the benefits of fast and easy testing and much lower cost compared to a full scale wheel loader. The <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> is equipped with individual wheel motors and a mechanical brake system based on brakes from a motorcycle. The first step in the development of the control system for the <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> was to make Simulink models for the components in the <b>test</b> <b>platform.</b> Models for the overall vehicle, the brakes and the electrical motors were developed. From the models a control strategy was developed to control the requested torque to the electric motors and the requested brake pressure to the brakes from the driver’s inputs. The control strategy was developed in Simulink and from Simulink C-code was automatically generated by the code generation tool TargetLink. All testing including testing of the brake blending system was performed on the <b>test</b> <b>platform.</b> The result of this thesis is a <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> that is built to emulate a small scale hybrid wheel loader. The <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> is expandable and can be used to test other concepts, for example steer-by-wire. The other result of the thesis is a brake blending system that is combining electrical and mechanical braking with good pedal feeling, no wheel lock and high energy regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design and implement a chassis dynamometer for testing dynamic characteristics of a battery-powered motorcycle (BPM). By using a load simulation system, which is constituted with a DC motor and two rollers, a roller of the <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> is connected to a DC motor through a torque sensor, and a controller is designed to control the DC motor to simulate driving resistance produced when the BPM runs on various roads. The <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> can simulate each drag force when the BPM is in acceleration or in a constant-speed drive, and also can simulate kinetic energy gained by the BPM when braking, deceleration and running downhill. A computer not only controls the <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> but also collects signals from sensors on the <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> and the BPM, and can analyze related data such as driving resistance, driving range, speed, kinetic energy recycle and so on. The <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> has an integral steel structure and a stable center of gravity, and the height and length adjustment of the machine is convenient and as well the test is easy to perform, thus it can provide efficient tests on battery-powered motorcycles (BPMs) which are currently popularized by all circles with great efforts, so as to achieve the {{objective of}} performance measurement, performance analysis and data collection. From experiment results, the BPM performance <b>test</b> <b>platform</b> can simulate various road patterns and complete an automatic testing process...|$|R
