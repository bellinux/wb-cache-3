40|$|Abstract: Palm olein (PO) and <b>red</b> <b>palm</b> olein (RPO) {{are rich}} in {{tocopherols}} and tocotrienols. In addition, RPO also contains a high content of carotene. This {{study was to determine}} the effect of chronic intake of diets containing <b>palm</b> <b>oils,</b> varying in their vitamin E and carotene contents, on lipid profile in rats. Weaning male Wistar rats were fed either 18 % RPO, 18 % PO or 18 % vitamin E-stripped palm olein (SPO) for 12 weeks. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) were measured at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Feeding the different types of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> did not affect TC and HDL from week 4 through week 12, but there were reductions in TG in all dietary groups at week 12 compared to week 4 but differences between groups were not observed. The RPO group had lower LDL at week 12 (vs weeks 4 and 8) but LDL was not reduced in the PO and SPO groups. TC/HDL was reduced in the RPO group at week 12 compared to both weeks 4 and 8, but the PO group only reduced this ratio at week 12 compared to week 4.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} research achievements on the breeding, feed, {{and nutrition}} of Japanese quail {{performed at the}} Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding, Department of Agriculture, Okayama University, between 1973 and 2008. 　The study included analysis of inbreeding depression and heterosis, which are important subjects in breeding. Secondly, the genetic parameters useful for selection were identified and the sexing of newborn chicks utilizing sex-linked inheritance was investigated. As problems related to feed and nutrition, the reduced excretion of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), the utilization of a cochineal residue, {{and the effects of}} <b>red</b> salmon astaxanthin, <b>palm</b> <b>oil,</b> and astaxanthin supplementation on eggs functions were investigated. 　In quail, inbreeding depression was noted in overall productive characters, and the depression was marked in reproductive characters, such as hatchability. The genetic load was calculated using the equation: －logeS＝A＋BF. On crossbreeding between highly inbred lines of Japanese quail, marked heterosis was noted in the hatchability, viability, and egg production rate. 　Analysis of early embryonic development showed that the number of mitotic cells, mitotic index, and 3 H-thymidine and 3 H-uridine uptakes were lower in the inbred embryos compared with those of hybrid embryos, indicating important metabolic differences. 　Basic information for the selective breeding of quail, heritability of characters, such as the body weight, muscle mass, skeleton, and egg characteristics were accumulated; accumulated information suggested the possibility of selective breeding with regard to these characters. 　Sexing of newborn quail chicks utilizing sex-linked inheritance was performed. Mating males of the brown line and females of the normal line, all male chicks had normal plumage colors, whereas all females had brown plumage colors, which allowed simple sexing. The supplementation of low-CP feed with essential amino acids and low-CP, low-P feed with phytase improved the growth of chicks, increased the egg production rate, and reduced N and P excretions. Phytase supplementation enhanced tibial growth in the early growth period, and reduced perosis and the mortality of chicks. When female chicks were fed a cochineal residue at 6 weeks of age, the egg production rate was similar to that of chicks fed fish meal, showing the possibility of substitution with fish meal. 　The yolk color was improved by supplementation with <b>red</b> salmon astaxanthin, <b>palm</b> <b>oil,</b> and astaxanthin. The yolk color improved with increases in the supplemented amounts of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and astaxanthin. Astaxanthin added to feed was transferred to the egg yolk, and the antioxidative capacity improved as the amount added increased. 　To further clarify the characteristics of quail as experimental animals, and to improve their productivity as livestock, a continuation in both basic and applied research is indispensable...|$|R
