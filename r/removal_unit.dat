40|$|AbstractTraffic {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{particulate}} matter (PM) inside urban areas. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the potential to reduce outdoor PM concentrations by local removal inside semi-enclosed parking garages. The assessment is performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the 3 D steady RANS equations and an Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. First, an extensive CFD validation study is performed with gas dispersion wind-tunnel measurements. Next, the case study for Eindhoven city center is conducted on a high-resolution grid including 16 semi-enclosed garages. Traffic intensities on the streets and in the garages are converted to PM 10 source terms. The garages are ventilated with outdoor air. Simulations are performed with and without <b>removal</b> <b>units</b> in the garages. The case study is not intended to reproduce a particular pollution episode but to provide a preliminary indication of the potential reduction in PM 10 for representative meteorological and traffic conditions. The results show that 594 <b>removal</b> <b>units</b> allow reductions in local outdoor PM 10 by up to 50 % close to the garages while reductions up to 10 % are achieved further downstream. It is concluded that local removal in semi-enclosed parking garages can be an effective strategy towards improved outdoor air quality...|$|R

40|$|LectureAcid {{gas removal}} (AGR) using a high {{pressure}} amine solvent in a contactor tower {{is widely used}} to sweeten sour gas and render it suitable for commercial distribution. Acid gas removal is also common in other applications such as ammonia production. Single-stage hydraulic turbochargers can reduce energy use in AGR processes. In the revised process, the hydraulic turbocharger essentially replaces the pressure letdown, or level control valve at the contactor exit and the high pressure pump used to bring the solvent to contactor pressure. This significantly reduces operating costs for the acid gas <b>removal</b> <b>unit.</b> This paper will present a turbocharger based system that optimizes energy use while simultaneously fulfilling the required controls functionality of the LCV. Two turbocharger application configurations that provide the pumping redundancy that is usually required in an acid gas <b>removal</b> <b>unit</b> (AGRU) are evaluated. A complete description of the turbocharger solution for acid gas removal is presented including control system response analysis to different signals from the plant.

40|$|Preparative liquid {{chromatography}} {{is one of}} the most selective separation techniques in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. Several process concepts have been developed and applied for improving the performance of classical batch chromatography. The most powerful approaches include various single-column recycling schemes, counter-current and cross-current multi-column setups, and hybrid processes where chromatography is coupled with other unit operations such as crystallization, chemical reactor, and/or solvent <b>removal</b> <b>unit.</b> To fully utilize the potential of stand-alone and integrated chromatographic processes, efficient methods for selecting the best process alternative as well as optimal operating conditions are needed. In this thesis, a unified method is developed for analysis and design of the following singlecolumn fixed bed processes and corresponding cross-current schemes: (1) batch chromatography, (2) batch chromatography with an integrated solvent <b>removal</b> <b>unit,</b> (3) mixed-recycle steady state recycling chromatography (SSR), and (4) mixed-recycle steady state recycling chromatography with solvent removal from fresh feed, recycle fraction, or column feed (SSR–SR). The method is based on the equilibrium theory of chromatography with an assumption of negligible mass transfer resistance and axial dispersion. The design criteria are given in general, dimensionless form that is formally analogous to that applied widely in the so called triangle theory of counter-current multi-column chromatography. Analytical design equations are derived for binary systems that follow competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. For this purpose, the existing analytic solution of the ideal model of chromatography for binary Langmuir mixtures is completed by deriving missing explicit equations for the height and location of the pure first component shock in the case of a small feed pulse. It is thus shown that the entire chromatographic cycle at the column outlet can be expressed in closed-form. The developed design method allows predicting the feasible range of operating parameters that lead to desired product purities. It can be applied for the calculation of first estimates of optimal operating conditions, the analysis of process robustness, and the early-stage evaluation of different process alternatives. The design method is utilized to analyse the possibility to enhance the performance of conventional SSR chromatography by integrating it with a solvent <b>removal</b> <b>unit.</b> It is shown that the amount of fresh feed processed during a chromatographic cycle and thus the productivity of SSR process can be improved by removing solvent. The maximum solvent removal capacity depends on the location of the solvent <b>removal</b> <b>unit</b> and the physical solvent removal constraints, such as solubility, viscosity, and/or osmotic pressure limits. Usually, the most flexible option is to remove solvent from the column feed. Applicability of the equilibrium design for real, non-ideal separation problems is evaluated by means of numerical simulations. Due to assumption of infinite column efficiency, the developed design method is most applicable for high performance systems where thermodynamic effects are predominant, while significant deviations are observed under highly non-ideal conditions. The findings based on the equilibrium theory are applied to develop a shortcut approach for the design of chromatographic separation processes under strongly non-ideal conditions with significant dispersive effects. The method is based on a simple procedure applied to a single conventional chromatogram. Applicability of the approach for the design of batch and counter-current simulated moving bed processes is evaluated with case studies. It is shown that the shortcut approach works the better the higher the column efficiency and the lower the purity constraints are...|$|E
