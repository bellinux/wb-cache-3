5000|$|In Spanish Air Force use, the F-4Cs were {{designated}} [...] "C.12" [...] (C stood for [...] "Caza" [...] and 12 stood for [...] "12th fighter type in service since {{the creation of}} the Ejército del Aire"). The F-4Cs were assigned to Escuadrones 121 and 122, Ala 12 (Wing). To support them a fleet of three KC-97Ls was acquired in 1972, equipping Escuadrón 123, being replaced by KC-130Hs (which equipped Escuadrón 301) from January 1976. While the KC-97s were fitted with a flying <b>boom</b> <b>refuelling</b> system, the Hercules that replaced them were fitted with the probe and drogue system and so could not refuel the F-4s.|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of UAV {{applications}} has been identified in the last decade, both for civil and military use. An autonomous AAR capability is perceived as an advantage to future support and deployment of mid-large scale UAV to meet operational requirements. Despite drawing {{a lot of attention}} and research, bow wave effects in an AAR scenario has not received enough attention. Some existing works have discussed and attempted to model the effect of the bow wave from a comparatively large receiver (B- 2, C- 17) onto the tanker (KC- 135) during <b>boom</b> <b>refuelling.</b> However the effects of bow wave from the receiver aircraft onto the drogue in a probe and drogue refuelling system has received very little attention. This paper analyses the effects of the bow wave and results suggest that a solution to the bow wave effect is not only desirable but essential for a successful AAAR refuelling. This paper considers the use of an offset which is used by human pilots to compensate for the drogue movement resulting from the receiver's bow wave. This simple yet effective solution was found to restore the loss in performance in the AAAR simulation which results from the bow wave interaction. This work forms part of the ASTRAEA programme in the UK...|$|R

50|$|Saudi Arabia {{finalised}} {{an agreement}} to purchase three A330 MRTT equipped with both an Aerial <b>Refuelling</b> <b>Boom</b> System (ARBS) and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods, on 3 January 2008. In July 2009 {{it was announced that}} Saudi Arabia ordered three additional A330 MRTT tankers. RSAF chose the General Electric CF6-80 to power its A330 MRTTs.|$|E

50|$|Designated as KC-30A, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) A330 MRTTs are {{equipped}} with both an Aerial <b>Refuelling</b> <b>Boom</b> System (ARBS) and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods. The aircraft are powered by two General Electric CF6-80E engines. Australia initially arranged to procure four aircraft with an option to obtain a fifth; this option for a fifth aircraft was exercised to allow for two simultaneous deployments of two aircraft, the fifth being for contingency coverage. Australian KC-30A are operated by No. 33 Squadron RAAF based at RAAF Base Amberley. Australia's aircraft are configured for 270 passengers plus cargo.|$|E
50|$|On 27 March 2008 the UK Ministry of Defence {{signed a}} deal to lease 14 {{aircraft}} under a private finance initiative arrangement from EADS-led consortium AirTanker, with the first aircraft to enter service in 2011. There are two versions, designated Voyager KC2 and Voyager KC3; the former will be fitted with two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods, the latter with a Cobham 805E Fuselage Refuelling Unit (FRU) {{in addition to the}} under-wing pods. None of the RAF aircraft are fitted with the Aerial <b>Refuelling</b> <b>Boom</b> System (ARBS). Both versions of Voyager are powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent 772B-60 engines.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 September 2012 at {{approximately}} 19:30 (CEST), an A330 MRTT's <b>refuelling</b> <b>boom</b> became detached in flight {{at an altitude}} of [...] in Spanish airspace. The boom separated cleanly at a mechanical joint and fell to the ground, while the aircraft landed safely in Getafe. There were no injuries caused by the malfunction. The incident {{was the result of a}} conflict between the backup boom hoist (fitted to the UAE-destined A330 MRTTs) and the primary boom retraction mechanism, and was attributable to the testing being conducted. Airbus later explained that the malfunction was not possible under ordinary operating conditions, and that procedures had been designed to avoid similar incidents in the future. Following the incident, INTA, the Spanish regulatory authority, issued precautionary restrictions to other users of boom-equipped A330s.|$|E
