2500|$|According to Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., {{the artist}} used a fox's pelt draped over a barrel {{in the snow}} to {{accurately}} record color harmonies. Homer's biographer Philip C. Beam wrote that prior to the painting Homer was supplied a dead fox by one hunter, and several crows by another named Roswell Googins. Homer placed the crows in the snow outside his studio, and {{with the aid of}} string and sticks posed the fox in a <b>running</b> <b>position.</b> Homer experienced some difficulty, as the painting was begun late in winter, and warming temperatures caused the stiffened crows to thaw and grow limp. Homer asked Elbridge Oliver, the Scarborough, Maine stationmaster for his opinion of the painting, and he responded [...] "Hell, Win, them ain't crows". After painting the birds out, Homer joined Oliver at the station, where they spent three days scattering corn on the ground to attract crows, Homer sketching the birds on telegraph blanks. Using the sketches as reference he repainted the crows, then summoned Oliver for his opinion and approval.|$|E

50|$|On July 29, 1983, an {{accident}} occurred {{in which one}} park employee was killed and several injured during a test run of the coaster. A new train was being added to increase ride capacity due to the large crowds. This process involves moving a section of track (transfer track) and manually moving a train from a storage / work area up into the station. The transfer track is {{moved back to the}} <b>running</b> <b>position</b> and the roller coaster capacity is doubled by running 2 trains. In this accident the manager who took charge of the procedure forgot to move the track back into the <b>running</b> <b>position.</b> The train was loaded with employees and dispatched - The train went back through the storage shed, where it careened off the end of the work track killing an employee and injuring 14 others on the train.

5000|$|After {{the start}} the drivers {{fight to get}} a good <b>running</b> <b>position.</b> How well this succeeds depends on the horse, the {{starting}} position and how the opponents drive their horses. Due to the sulky width and the oval race track overtaking is a far more difficult manoeuver to achieve, in comparison with gallop racing. The [...] "running position fight" [...] during start {{and the beginning of the}} race usually ends in the first turn. After the initial fight for good <b>running</b> <b>position,</b> the horses usually form two rows or tracks. Good running positions are the leading position of the inner track or the second (or third) place in the outer track. This is explained with the fact that the outer track is close to 15 meter longer per lap, front running is always heavier compared with just follow behind (just like in cycling). Positions in the inner track behind the leader may appear the best. But as described before, overtaking is not an easy manoeuver. And horses in the inner track may very well be trapped all the way to the finish, due to the horses and sulkies in the outer track. On the other hand, if an opening in the outer track appears close to the finish line, such a horse have had [...] "an easy ride" [...] with much strength left to give.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes an {{intermediate}} siding is provided on the single line section, and the token itself, or a key {{fixed to the}} end of it, unlocks the points for shunting there. The token is locked in the apparatus there, and the driver cannot retrieve the token until the points have been set to the through <b>running</b> <b>position</b> and locked again. In special situations where the sidings at the intermediate location are extensive, the equipment is arranged for the shunting train to be put wholly inside the sidings, clear of the main line; in this situation {{an intermediate}} token instrument can be provided, enabling the driver to surrender the token so that normal through working can take place on the single line while his train is at the sidings.|$|E

Additionally, NASCAR CEO Brian France announced that Gordon would be added to the Chase field, expanding the field to 13 drivers. France explained in a press conference that his decision to add Gordon to the Chase was [...] "based on the totality of events that were outside" [...] Gordon's control, and how MWR's and Penske's manipulation attempts gave Gordon an [...] "unfair disadvantage", and the fact that if Bowyer hadn't spun and the caution hadn't come out at any point between lap 393 and the white flag, Gordon would have qualified for the Chase on points based on his <b>running</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

Pearl River Junior High was opened in 1963, but the building was made into a police training academy in 2005.

50|$|However, {{the cutting}} action, {{which is the}} basis for running agility, {{is not a matter of}} fast feet, it is a matter of fast legs. One must be able to move the legs from the hips in order to move quickly or to execute quick cutting actions. In addition, the feet must remain close to the ground {{regardless}} of whether the step being taking is short or long. In other words, as the cut is being executed, the body is lowered and as the athlete pushes off, he steps out with the leg closest to the direction in which he wishes to move. He then takes a step out with the leg and turns the body so he can quickly assume the <b>running</b> <b>position.</b> At times, it is necessary that the athlete have the ability to rotate the hips and/or shoulders a full 90° in order to be more evasive in the cutting action. This allows him to maintain eye contact with his opponent and maintain his shoulders in a front-facing position. In so doing, the opponent does not get any hints that a change in direction is about to take place.Hurdle drills are essentially the same as ladder drills since their execution is basically the same. In these drills, you move in a linear or sideward manner. Cone drills however, are used mainly for side movements. In the drills, you leap sideways over a cone in one direction and then back in the opposite direction. The key to successful execution is for an athlete to bring their knees to their chest to successfully clear the top of the cone. This does not duplicate the cutting action.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is to build a}} model for predicting resistance and running attitude of high-speed craft equipped with interceptors. The thesis examines the profits gained in terms of economic, comfort and environmental investment. The current study aims to illustrate the impact of interceptors in planing ships, by simulating a steady state model of the dynamic <b>running</b> <b>position.</b> Thus, data regarding trim and drag will be generated. The model is based on previously made studies by Savitsky, Dawson and Blount, Brown and Steen. Extrapolation of the results is realized with the Swedish Coast Guard boat KBV 315 to validate interceptor benefits with the Coast Guard patrol craft. Two different models are presented and the results show a fuel consumption reduction of 8 - 13 %, for the speed range of 15 - 24 knots, and maximum trim decrease of 1. 7 ˚ for KBV 315. It is concluded that interceptors have a great potential of increasing both comfort (in terms of trim) and efficiency of high-speeds crafts. The provided models can be used as an estimation tool of the outcome before issuing an installing project...|$|E
