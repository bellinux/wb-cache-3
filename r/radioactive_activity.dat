30|$|Parts of the Fukushima Daiichi {{nuclear power}} plant were damaged by a tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011. Artificial radionuclides, for example 131 I and 137 Cs, spread into the environment, and much {{radiation}} was detected from plants and mushrooms in fields by the fallout. Three years have now passed since the accident. Detectable radionuclides are almost entirely 134 Cs and 137 Cs, because radionuclides with short half-lives such as 131 I have been lost, and the object of concern has changed from fallout to absorption through the food chain. To suppress the additional internal exposure of 1  year within 1  mSv from food and so on, the maximum <b>radioactive</b> cesium <b>activities</b> in general foods were set at 100  Bq/kg by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan [1]. The ratios of farm products to soil radioactivities have been reported as about tenth to hundredth [2].

Indeed, increased <b>radioactive</b> cesium <b>activities</b> in wild mushrooms in Europe have been seen since the Chernobyl {{nuclear power plant}} accident in 1986 [5].

Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of testosterone, tibolone, and black cohosh on purified mammary and placental 17 βHSD 1. Materials and methods: 17 βHSD 1 was purified from human mammary gland and placenta by column chromatography, its activity was monitored by a <b>radioactive</b> <b>activity</b> assay, and the degree of purification was determined by gel electrophoresis. Photometric cofactor transformation analysis was performed to assess 17 βHSD 1 activity without or in presence of testosterone, tibolone and black cohosh. Results: 17 βHSD 1 from both sources displayed a comparable basal activity. Testosterone and tibolone metabolites inhibited purified mammary and placental 17 βHSD 1 activity to a different extent, whereas black cohosh had no impact. Discussion: Studies on purified enzymes reveal the individual action of drugs on local regulatory mechanisms thus helping to develop more targeted therapeutic intervention.
