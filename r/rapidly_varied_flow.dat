The dam-break flow (water column collapse) problem on a horizontal and frictionless bottom was investigated as a test case. The mechanics of dam-break flow for wet and dry bed conditions was analyzed {{on the basis of}} numerical simulations.

In addition to rapid changes in the water level and velocity across the compound channel that have a great influence on the boundary shear stress distribution, the embankment, through two recirculation zones developing upstream and downstream, is also responsible for strong lateral mass exchange between the main channel and the floodplains (channel sub-sections).

40|$|Abstract: In an open channel, the {{transformation}} from a supercritical flow into a subcritical flow is a <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> with large turbulent fluctuations, intense air entrainment and substantial energy dissipation: i. e., a hydraulic jump. New experiments were conducted {{for a wide}} range of Froude numbers (3. 8 < Fr 1 < 8. 5) at relatively large Reynolds numbers (2. 1 × 104 < Re < 1. 6 × 105) to quantify the turbulent fluctuations. The time-averaged free-surface profile presented some self-similar profile. The longitudinal movements of the jump were observed and both fast and very slow fluctuations were documented for all Froude numbers. The air-water flow measurements quantified the intense aeration of the roller. Overall the present findings demonstrated the close interactions between the roller turbulence and free-surface fluctuations.

40|$|Examines the <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> {{phenomenon}} in a two layer density stratified system. Only one layer flows, the other being stationary. The flow regime changes from supercritical to subcritical {{across the region}} of <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow.</b> The analogous {{phenomenon in}} open channel hydraulics is the hydraulic jump. In stratified flows it will {{be referred to as}} a density jump because it is generally accompanied by a change in the density of the flowing layer. It is shown there is a fundamental difference between the hydraulic and the density jump in that the conjugate conditions on either side of a density jump are not uniquely related as they are with the hydraulic jump. There are a range of possible states which may be attained downstream of a density jump for a given upstream state. It is shown that the rate of entrainment of ambient fluid into a density jump and therefore the conditions downstream of the jump are a function of the downstream control. The limiting cases of maximum and minimum entrainment and control mechanisms within the jump are examined. Several forms of control are investigated among these being the broad crested weir, a free overfall and channel friction. An entrainment function is derived, relating a local entrainment parameter to a local Froude number within the entraining zone of a density jump. Some features of unsteady density flows are examined and it is shown that all the properties of strarting flow or nose are controlled by the following layer, which in turn is generally controlled by boundary friction. An approximate expression is derived for the fall in momentum flux across a density jump and this is compared with experimental data. Finally, experimental velocity and density distributions downstream of density jumps are presented, and are shown to be functions of the Froude number of the flow upstream of the density jump, and the rate of entrainment within the jump. The significant result arising from this work is that conditions downstream of density jump which will occur, for example, at power station cooling pond outfalls and some ocean sewage outfalls, can be predicted. A design example, showing how station cooling pond efficiencies can be optimised by the control of mixing at the outfall, is included in the appendices...|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} {{across the}} critical depth in free-surface flows in- volves large streamline curvature, which increases as the flow depth deviates from the asymptotic normal depth. Consideration of the asymptotic {{behavior of a}} free-surface flow to the normal depth re- quires inclusion of turbulent friction. Potential flow methods {{for the analysis of}} near-critical flow are limited to short channel reaches (Fawer 1937; Castro-Orgaz 2010) for the energy grade line to be horizontal, yet in cases including the undular hydraulic jump, a potential flow solution does not exist (Mandrup Andersen 1978; Mandrup Anderson 1980; Montes 1979). The backwater ap- proach of gradually varied flows is known to break down at the critical depth (Montes 1998). Thus, a <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> model allowing for turbulent friction is required to simultaneously treat the transition across the critical section and the asymptotic condi- tions at uniform flow. The original model developed by Serre (1953) following Boussinesq (1877) satisfies these requirements, but regretfully, his original work is almost unknown, except in cross-reference to other works (Hager and Hutter 1984 a, b; Montes and Chanson 1998).

This problem is related to environmental hydraulic problems such as the undular hydraulic jump and flow over round-crested weirs, for which streamline curvature effects are significant. The inclusion of the curvilinear streamline effect in an extended energy equation was firstly by Fawer.

The aim {{of the present study}} is to highlight and remind engineers of the outstanding theory presented by Fawer. Herein, his approach for steady open channel flow with curved streamlines is revised and compared with experimental observations.

Hydraulic jump is a <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow,</b> in which the flow conditions change from supercritical to sub-critical with {{a large amount of}} energy loss. In this research, a combination of two water jets in the form of overflow dam and underflow through a slot on the body of an ogee dam with the USBR standard was established in order to decrease the length and sequent depth in a hydraulic jump. In these experiments, the underflow from the slot was designed with three out passages of 0, 45, and 90 degrees in respect horizontal line. Six different discharge ratios were used for each slot and the effect of each experiment conditions on decreasing of the length and sequent depth of hydraulic jump was investigated. The results showed that the confluence of two jets with 45 degrees from the slot had the maximum effect on the reducing of the length of hydraulic jump and sequent depth, and when 26 percent of the total discharge passed through the slot as underflow, it caused the length of hydraulic jump to be reduced by 50 percent in comparison with the classic jump. This slot not only decreases the length and sequent depth of hydraulic jump but also the sediment behind the dam can be evacuated through it. Moreover, it increases the discharge coefficient...|$|E
40|$|In-channel {{structures}} are often installed in alluvial rivers during restoration to steer currents, {{but they also}} modify the streambed morphology and water surface proﬁle, and alter hydraulic gradients driving ecologically important hyporheic exchange. Although river features before and after restoration need to be compared, few studies have collected detailed observations to facilitate this comparison. We created a laboratory mobile-bed alluvial meandering river and collected detailed measurements in the highly sinuous meander before and after installation of in-channel structures, which included one cross vane and six J-hooks situated along 1 bar unit. Measurements of streambed and water surface elevation with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution were obtained using close-range photogrammetry. Compared to the smooth gradually varied water surface proﬁle for control runs without structures, the structures created <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>ﬂow</b> with subcritical to supercritical ﬂow transitions, as well as backwater and forced-morphology pools, which increased volumetric storage by 74 % in the entire stream reach. The J-hooks, located along the outer bank of the meander bend and downstream of the cross vane, created stepwise patterns in the streambed and water surface longitudinal proﬁles. The pooling of water behind the cross vane increased the hydraulic gradient across the meander neck by 1 % and increased local groundwater gradients by 4 %, with smaller increases across other transects through the intrameander zone. Scour pools developed downstream of the cross vane and around the J-hooks situated near the meander apex. In-channel structures signiﬁcantly changed meander bend hydraulic gradients, and the detailed streambed and water surface 3 -D maps provide valuable data for computational modeling of changes to hyporheic exchange...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been taken to {{investigate}} the channel development especially fluvial river with meandering thalweg. The study included the physical model with steady inflow and unsteady inflow in the lab, and numerical model to simulate the development process, considering the bank erosion and secondary flow. In the study of channel development with physical model, {{a series of tests}} have been carried out to model the fluvial river with different flume slope, flow rate and channel section size. The meandering thawleg channel development process was carefully observed and from results in the lab, channels only had curved boundaries with meandering thalweg, not the real meandering river. Many characteristics of fluvial river in the nature like ripple- pool unit, point bar have been modelled successfully. Then different parameters like slope, flow rate and channel size were tested independently to see their effect on channel morphology. From experiments, it is confirmed that slope is key factor to distinguish straight, meandering and braided channels. Flow rate and section size were also discussed. From the discussion of different controlling parameters, it is found that the essential control factor is Froude number. Tests with unsteady inflow were then carried out to model the real hydrology process as that in nature. Gradually varied unsteady inflow and rapidly varied unsteady inflow were achieved by controlling the frequency of pump. Bed profile of channel after operation was recorded by Bed Profiler. Developments tell that steady inflow could deep channel and unsteady inflow has more effect on bank erosion and makes channel wider. It is concluded from bed profiles, steady inflow produces stable ripples, smooth point bars, curved channel banks. <b>Rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> got straight channel, wider upstream. Gradually varied flow got unstable ripple in the main channel and deepest pools. Finally numerical modelling considering bank erosion and secondary flow was developed to simulate the tests. Bank erosion model comes from previous research and secondary flow was considered based on the balance of force in the transverse direction on Cartesian coordinate system without the constraint of constant radius of curvature. The modelling results have a good agreement with physical model for steady inflow and unsteady inflow with different channel size and slope.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} a particular phenomenon in open channel flows {{for which the}} basic assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution is essentially invalid, and expands previous suggestions to flows where streamline curvature is significant. The proposed model incorporates {{the effects of the}} vertical curvature of the streamline and steep slope, in making the pressure distribution non-hydrostatic, and overcomes the accuracy problem of the Saint-Venant equations when simulating curvilinear free surface flow problems. Furthermore, the model is demonstrated to be a higher-order one-dimensional model that includes terms accounting for wave-like variations of the free surface on a constant slope channel. Test results of predicted flow surface and pressure profiles for flow in a channel transition from mild to steep slopes, transcritical flow over a short-crested weir and flow with dual free surfaces are compared with experimental data and previous numerical results. A good agreement is attained between the experimental and computed results.

40|$|Data {{assimilation}} {{techniques have}} received growing attention {{due to their}} capability to improve prediction. Among various data assimilation techniques, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, known as "particle filters", are a Bayesian learning process that has the capability to handle non-linear and non-Gaussian state-space models. In this paper, we propose an improved particle filtering approach to consider different response times of internal state variables in a hydrologic model. The proposed method adopts a lagged filtering approach to aggregate model response until the uncertainty of each hydrologic process is propagated. The regularization with an additional move step based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is also implemented to preserve sample diversity under the lagged filtering approach. A distributed hydrologic model, water and energy transfer processes (WEP), is implemented for the sequential data assimilation through the updating of state variables. The lagged regularized particle filter (LRPF) and the sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filter are implemented for hindcasting of streamflow at the Katsura catchment, Japan. Control state variables for filtering are soil moisture content and overland flow. Streamflow measurements are used for data assimilation. LRPF shows consistent forecasts regardless of the process noise assumption, while SIR has different values of optimal process noise and shows sensitive variation of confidential intervals, depending on the process noise. Improvement of LRPF forecasts compared to SIR is particularly found for <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> high <b>flows</b> due to preservation of sample diversity from the kernel, even if particle impoverishment takes place...|$|R

40|$|Highland Creek can {{be defined}} as a flashy stream {{on the basis of the}} basin and channel {{hydrology}} and hydraulics. The extremes between the low and high-flow stage are dependent on the hydro-geomorphological features of the urban environment. The peculiarities of the urban landscape, serve to differentiate Highland Creek from naturally flashy channels. The sedimentary structures were grouped into coarse and fine facies. The deposition of material apparently occurs under progressively decreasing energy levels, during falling flow stage. Bedform and sedimentary structure associations, and their evolution are dependent on the dynamics of the flashy channel. That is, the development of bedforms and associated features should be examined in view of the magntidue or intensity of interaction between the bed material and the flow. Small-scale bedforms may not fully develop, if the bed configuration does not achieve a balanced state with the flow conditions, especially under <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. The evolution of bedform associations, and the recognition of such phenomena are readily identified with falling-flow stage. The small-scale bedforms are not preserved in the alluvium, with the exception of bed armour. Parting lineations on ripples, ripples on channel bars, and channel bars on the channel form are recognized at low flow, although they are not preserved during subsequent events. On the macroforms, as for example, point bars and riffle bars, are likely to be preserved because of their low sensitivity to short-term flow dynamics. The analysis of paleocurrent directions suggested that the small-scale bed features and sedimentary structures were largely inefficient for modelling general flow directions. Sample vector resultants deviate significantly from the trends displayed by the channel and the valley. The hierarchical ranking of the paleocurrent indicators was subdivided into two distinct groupings: a) a ranking of grand vector resultants with respect to the valley direction; and b) statistical ranking as derived from the comparison of concentration parameters (K) about the grant vector resultants of the sample groupings. The channel orientation is the best general paleocurrent indicator, since the vector resultant parallels the trend of the valley. Gravel fabrics and imbricates were combined to form the second order paleocurrent indicators. The grand resultants of the fabrics and the imbricates deviate by 17 ° from the parallel-to-flow direction of the valley and the channel. The small-scale sedimentary structures and bedforms are relatively inefficient paleocurrent indicators, since grand vector resultants deviate by 40 ° from the direction of the channel and the valley, as demonstrated by cross-strata and ripple orientations...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic jump is a <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> {{phenomenon}} that the flow changes suddenly from supercritical to subcritical. Hydraulic jumps are frequently observed {{to exist in}} natural river channels, streams, coastal water, and man-made water conveyance systems. Because of a sudden transition of flow regime, hydraulic jumps result in complex flow structures, strong turbulence, and air entrainment. Accordingly, they are two-phase flow, with air being the gas phase and water being the liquid phase. Consequences of the occurrence of hydraulic jumps include: unwanted fluctuations in the water surface with unstable waves and rollers, undesirable erosion of channel sidewalls and channel bottom, and reduced efficiency for water conveyance systems. Thus, {{it is important to}} study various aspects of the phenomenon. So far, knowledge of the phenomenon is incomplete. The main objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the complex flow structures and distributions of air entrainment in a hydraulic jump. Previously, both experimental and computational studies of the phenomenon have typically suffered a scale problem. The dimensions of the setup being used were unrealistically too small. In this research, we took the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach, and simulated hydraulic jumps at relatively large and practical dimensions. This would help reduce artificial scale effects on the results. On the basis of Reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations, CFD simulations of hydraulic jumps were performed for four different cases in terms of the approach flow Froude number Fr 1, ranging from 3. 1 to 5. 1. The Reynolds number is high (between 577662 and 950347), which ensures turbulent flow conditions. The CFD model channel is discretized into 2, 131, 200 cells. The mesh has nearly uniform structures, with fine spatial resolutions of 2. 5 mm. The volume of fluid method provides tracking of the free surface. The standard k-ε turbulence model provides turbulence closure. For each of the simulation cases, we carried out analyses of time-averaged air volume fraction, time-averaged velocity, time- and depth-averaged (or double averaged) air volume fraction at a series of locations {{along the length of the}} model channel (Note that the terms air volume fraction and void fraction are used interchangeably in this thesis). We compared the CFD predictions of air volume fraction with available laboratory measurements. It is important to note that these measurements were made from laboratory experiments that corresponded to essentially the same values of Fr as this CFD study, but used a channel of smaller dimensions, in comparison to the CFD model channel. The CFD results of time-averaged air volume fraction are reasonable, when compared to the experimental data, except for the simulation case with Fr 1 = 3. 8. For all the four simulation cases, the predicted variations in air volume fraction show a trend in consistency with the experimental results. For the three simulation cases (with Fr 1 = 3. 1, 3. 8 and 4. 4), the time-averaged air volume fraction in the hydraulic jumps is larger at higher Reynolds number. However, for the simulation case with Fr 1 = 5. 1, it is smaller at higher Reynolds number. This implies that the amount of air being entrained into a hydraulic jump depends on not only Fr 1 but also the depth of the approach flow. In future studies of the hydraulic jump phenomenon, one should consider using approach flow of realistically large dimensions at various values of Fr 1, for realistic predictions of air entrainment in hydraulic jump rollers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a case study}} on {{the application of a}} dynamic framework for the intelligent control of flooding in the Boise River system in Idaho. This framework couples a robust and numerically efficient hydraulic routing approach with the popular multi-objective, non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The novelty of this framework is that it allows for controlled flooding when the conveyance capacity of the river system is exceeded or is about to exceed. Controlled flooding is based on weight factors assigned to each reach of the system depending on the amount of damage that would occur should a flood occur. For example, an urban setting would receive a higher weight factor than a rural or agricultural area. The weight factor for a reach doesn’t need to be constant as it can be made a function of the flooding volume (or water stage) in the reach. The optimization algorithm minimizes flood damage by favoring low weighted floodplain areas (e. g., rural areas) rather than high weighted areas (e. g., urban areas) for the overbank flows. The proposed framework has the potential to improve water management and use of flood-prone areas in river systems, especially of those systems subjected to frequent flooding. The Hydraulic Performance Graph (HPG) of a channel reach graphically summarizes the dynamic relation between the flow through and the stages at the ends of the reach under gradually varied flow (GVF) conditions, while the Volume Performance Graph (VPG) summarizes the corresponding storage. The Rating Performance Graph (RPG) summarizes the dynamic relation between the flow through and the stages at the ends of the in-line structure under gradually varied flow or <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. The use of HPGs, VPGs, and RPGs in the proposed approach results in a robust and numerically efficient model because the hydraulics for all river reaches are pre-computed (i. e., any error attained during the computation of the water profiles for each reach-e. g., due to instability-can be detected and therefore corrected before the river system routing) and most of the computations for the system routing involve only interpolation steps. The latter makes this approach highly numerically efficient. The proposed framework is the first model of its kind that uses the HPG/VPG/RPG approach for intelligent control of river flooding and has been applied to the Boise River system of Idaho. In order to test the hydraulic routing approach, a model for unsteady flow routing through dendritic and looped river networks based on performance graphs is presented in this thesis. The application presented in this thesis is limited to subcritical flows; however, it can be extended to supercritical flows. The model builds upon the application of Hydraulic Performance Graph (HPG) to unsteady flow routing introduced by [12] and adopts the Volume Performance Graph (VPG) introduced by [16]. The HPG of a channel reach graphically summarizes the dynamic relation between the flow through and the stages at the ends of the reach under gradually varied flow (GVF) conditions, while the VPG summarizes the corresponding storage. Both, the HPG and VPG are unique to a channel reach with a given geometry and roughness, and can be computed decoupled from unsteady boundary conditions by solving the GVF equation for all feasible conditions in the reach. Hence, in the proposed approach, the performance graphs can be used for different boundary conditions without the need to recompute them. Previous models based on the performance graph concept were formulated for routing through single channels or channels in series. The new approach expands on the use of HPG/VPGs and adds the use of rating performance graphs for unsteady flow routing in dentritic and looped networks. We exemplify the applicability of the proposed model to a looped network and contrast its simulation results with those from the well-known unsteady HEC-RAS model. Our results show that the present extension of application of the HPG/VPGs appears to inherit the robustness of the HPG routing approach in [12]...|$|E
40|$|Implementation of the National Water Act in South Africa {{requires}} that an ecological Reserve be determined for all significant resources. The ecological Reserve determination is {{the estimation of}} the amount of water required to maintain the system in a particular ecological condition. Because aquatic habitats are defined in terms of local hydraulic variables rather than amounts of water, hydraulic analysis provides a crucial link in relating hydrological conditions and river ecosystem integrity. Over the last decade, considerable effort has been devoted to developing hydraulics for the Reserve determination. The hydraulics needs for Reserve determination are primarily for low flow analysis, and appropriate methods still need to be developed. This thesis deals with hydraulics under low flow conditions. Its emphasis is on developing appropriate methods for describing the hydraulic characteristics of South African rivers under conditions of low discharge, and the influence of vegetation and large bed roughness. The following methods have been developed: · A new equation for prediction of overall flow resistance under large-scale roughness, and a new approach for estimation of intermediate-scale roughness resistance that distinguishes the influences of large and intermediate scale roughness components. · Prediction methods for velocity distributions with large roughness elements. Under low flows, rocks and boulders may control the local velocity and depth distributions. Distributions of velocities and depth are related to <b>rapidly</b> spatially <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> caused by the boundary geometry rather than flow resistance phenomena. With increasing discharge, the multiple local controls become submerged and the flow tends towards a resistance controlled condition. Available information addressing the distinction between resistance controlled and multiple local controls conditions is limited. This thesis contributes to understanding the transformation between multiple local controls and the resistance controlled conditions. · Practical conveyance prediction methods for three situations pertaining to the occurrence of vegetation in rivers and wetlands. In-channel and riparian vegetation makes an important contribution to the creation of physical habitats for aquatic animals, but also has significant effects on flow resistances that need to be predicted...|$|R

40|$|Dam failure {{mechanism}} produces the <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> unsteady <b>flow</b> {{situation and the}} appropriate analysis to determine the flow condition is necessary. Over the world, more than 80, 000 dams were constructed. There {{have been more than}} 200 distinguished dam failures occurred within the twentieth century. The history of dam construction exists together with the probability of dam failure causing casualties and catastrophic situations. As climate change effect has caused the change in flow situations, the safety concern in the dam is also necessary. Casualties and damages due to dam break events depend upon the depth, flow velocity, population distribution as per geography and warning time related to the time to reach the peak flow to the downstream areas. Prediction of actual breaching scenario is not certain and is related to the geographical and geological features of the site, embankment type, type of breach, reservoir storage and flow conditions. Estimating the accurate breaching scenarios and modeling of the dam break situation to characterize the hydrodynamic risk is necessary. Among the numerous techniques of modeling dam break situation, this study focused on the use of HEC-RAS for analyzing the dam break situation. Most of the simulation of a dam break situation used one-dimensional analysis to solve flow conditions after the break of the dam. The Latest development of HEC-RAS 2 D capabilities is also used in conjunction with 1 D HEC-RAS dam break analysis to compare and explore both analysis capabilities of HEC-RAS. The effect of HEC-RAS simulation altering the breaching conditions is analyzed for the dam failure case of Big Bay dam located in Lamar County, Mississippi. The study area is chosen to obtain the simulation of piping dam failure, which was the real cause of the dam failure event. In addition, the overtopping failure parameters established by the different breaching regression equations were analyzed. Results obtained with both one- dimensional and two- dimensional analysis is compared along with the modeling procedure and concept of analysis. From the analysis, it is found that the time of peak water surface elevation and its magnitude is responsible in determining the extent of vulnerable areas to the dam break scenarios. The present study showed the variation in peak flow condition between different breach parameters. Breach bottom width found to be more sensitive parameters in dam failure events. HEC-RAS analysis is found to be suitable to predict the uncertain hydraulic behavior of dam break situation...|$|R

The work {{was focused on the}} study of gradually <b>varied</b> open channel <b>flows</b> (Bélanger 1828). The originality of Bélanger's (1828) essay was the successful development of the backwater equation for steady, one-dimensional gradually <b>varied</b> <b>flows</b> in an open channel, together with the introduction of the step method, distance calculated from depth, and the concept of critical flow conditions. In 1828, Jean-Baptiste Bélanger understood the <b>rapidly</b> <b>varied</b> nature of the jump flow, but he applied incorrectly the Bernoulli principle to the hydraulic jump.The correct application of momentum considerations to the hydraulic jump flow was derived 10 years later and first published by Bélanger (1841) as part of a series of lecture notes for the École nationale des ponts et chaussées. His notes formed a comprehensive treatise in hydraulic engineering (Chanson 2008). They were re-edited several times and used at the École des Ponts et Chaussées and École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, and available at the École Polytechnique et École des Mines de ParisAltogether Jean-Baptiste Bélanger's (1828,1841) contributions to modern open channel hydraulics were remarkable and influenced the works by Jacques Antoine Charles Bresse, Henry Darcy, Henry Émile Bazin, Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant, and Joseph Valentin Boussinesq, as well as Philipp Forchheimer and Boris Bakhmeteff.|$|R
