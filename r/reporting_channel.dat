While it is generally accepted that the availability of such a <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> may reduce the reporting cost of the observer of a questionable act, there is concern that the addition of such a channel may decrease the overall effectiveness compared to a system employing only non-anonymous reporting options. The rationale underlying this concern involves the would-be reporter’s likelihood of reporting, the seriousness with which the organization treats an anonymous report, and the organization’s ability to thoroughly follow-up the report. Thus, we explore {{the extent to which}} the availability of an anonymous <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> influences intended use of non-anonymous reporting channels. Further, in response to Sarbanes–Oxley and the environment of financial scandals that led to its passage, many firms are strengthening their internal audit departments, and providing them with greater independence from upper management’s direct control. Accordingly, our examination tests whether the intended use of the internal audit department as an internal <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> is greater when the internal audit department is of â€œhighâ€ 9 D versus â€œlowâ€ 9 D quality. Finally, the study investigates intended reporting behavior across three different cases (e. g., settings). Results show that the existence of an anonymous channel does reduce the likelihood of reporting to non-anonymous channels, that generally the internal audit department quality does not affect reporting to non-anonymous channels, and that case-setting affects the type of channel to be used.

40|$|Abstract — Cooperative {{spectrum}} sensing (CSS) scheme is employed {{to detect the}} primary user (PU) more quickly and accurately in cognitive radio (CR) systems. The performance of CSS scheme is usually significantly degraded when the inter-user and <b>reporting</b> <b>channels</b> experience path loss or deep fading. Meanwhile, the <b>reporting</b> <b>channels</b> are usually bandwidth limited. When {{the number of the}} secondary users (SUs) is very large, the sensing results need enormous bandwidth in the transmission. To solve this problem, a dynamical clustering CSS scheme with bandwidth constraints is proposed, where the SUs with better <b>reporting</b> <b>channels</b> are chosen as the cluster heads and the other SUs are dynamically grouped according to the inter-user channel conditions. In each cluster, the proposed scheme adopts the double thresholds scheme to make sure that only the SUs with high quality can send their sensing results. Simulation results demonstrate that the average number of sensing bits of the proposed scheme decreases greatly with a little loss in the sensing performance. This advantage is more obvious compared with the STBC based cooperative {{spectrum sensing}} scheme...|$|R
40|$|Inefficient use {{of radio}} {{spectrum}} {{is becoming a}} serious problem {{as more and more}} wireless systems are being developed to operate in crowded spectrum bands. Cognitive radio offers a novel solution to overcome the underutilization problem by allowing secondary usage of the spectrum resources along with high reliable communication. Spectrum sensing is a key enabler for cognitive radios. It identifies idle spectrum and provides awareness regarding the radio environment which are essential for the efficient secondary use of the spectrum and coexistence of different wireless systems. The focus of this thesis is on the local and cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms. Local sensing algorithms are proposed for detecting orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based primary user (PU) transmissions using their autocorrelation property. The proposed autocorrelation detectors are simple and computationally efficient. Later, the algorithms are extended to the case of cooperative sensing where multiple secondary users (SUs) collaborate to detect a PU transmission. For cooperation, each SU sends a local decision statistic such as log-likelihood ratio (LLR) to the fusion center (FC) which makes a final decision. Cooperative sensing algorithms are also proposed using sequential and censoring methods. Sequential detection minimizes the average detection time while censoring scheme improves the energy efficiency. The performances of the proposed algorithms are studied through rigorous theoretical analyses and extensive simulations. The distributions of the decision statistics at the SU and the test statistic at the FC are established conditioned on either hypothesis. Later, the effects of quantization and <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> errors are considered. Main aim in studying the effects of quantization and channel errors on the cooperative sensing is to provide a framework for the designers to choose the operating values of the number of quantization bits and the target bit error probability (BEP) for the <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> such that the performance loss caused by these non-idealities is negligible. Later a performance limitation in the form of BEP wall is established for the cooperative sensing schemes in the presence of <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> errors. The BEP wall phenomenon is important as it provides the feasible values for the <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> BEP used for designing communication schemes between the SUs and the FC...|$|E

30|$|Spectrum sensing is a {{powerful}} tool of the cognitive cycle to help circumvent the apparent spectrum scarcity faced by wireless transmission systems. To overcome the challenging issues faced by the localized sensing, multiple cognitive radios can cooperate to explore the multiuser diversity and generate a more reliable decision {{on the presence of}} a signal in the frequencies of interest. In such a cooperative sensing scenario, a common <b>reporting</b> <b>channel</b> is needed for the transmission of the information of each element. As the number of elements that participate in the sensing operation increases, so does the bandwidth demanded for the <b>reporting</b> <b>channel,</b> quickly becoming the limiting factor in this scenario. To tackle the issue of reducing the sensing report overhead, this paper introduces a new cooperative sensing scheme that introduces silence periods in the reporting and, relying on information theory principles, explores the information present in these periods to reduce by 50 % the sensing reporting overhead while maintaining the same performance of standard reporting schemes. Numerical and experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis and show the predicted reduction in reporting overhead and performance preservation.|$|E

Two step optimization is performed where cooperative probability of detection is maximized as a function of threshold difference in double threshold and then highest value of maximized cooperative probability of detection is found as a function of power operation p, average signal-to-noise ratio at SUs, number of cooperating SUs and cooperative probability of false alarm.
