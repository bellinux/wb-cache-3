40|$|Transhumance is a {{practice}} of nomadic pastoralism that was once common in Mediterranean Europe. This livestock-rearing system {{is associated with the}} maintenance of cultural landscapes and the delivery {{of a wide range of}} ecosystem services. Although transhumance is still practised in Spain on a small scale, its future is highly uncertain because of socioeconomic constraints and other drivers of change. A participatory scenario-planning exercise with 68 participants, including shepherds, decision-makers, veterinarians, environmental experts, intermediaries from the wool and meat markets, and researchers, was used to envision plausible futures for transhumance and to enlighten policy-making for the maintenance of this practice along the Conquense Drove Road, one of the largest foot-based transhumant social-ecological networks still in use in Spain. Specifically, the aims were to: (1) analyse the drivers influencing the future <b>of</b> <b>transhumance,</b> (2) depict the current situation <b>of</b> <b>transhumance,</b> (3) envision future scenarios for this activity, (4) analyse ecosystem services’ trade-offs between different scenarios and their effect on human wellbeing, and (5) provide some insights for policy-making related to the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>transhumance.</b> Four plausible future scenarios were built, each showing clear trade-offs in the delivery of 19 ecosystem services, such as food, fibre, ecological connectivity, soil fertility, air quality, fire prevention, cultural identity, local ecological knowledge and cultural exchanges, as well as the different dimensions of human wellbeing. As a result of the participatory process, nine management strategies were identified for the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>transhumance.</b> Priority was given to the implementation of payment schemes for ecosystem services, the enhancement of social capital among transhumants and institutional coordination, the improvement of product marketing, and the restoration and conservation of drove roads. Finally, the implications of the current reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union for the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>transhumance</b> are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Batsbi {{tradition}} as recorded by Desheriev (1953, 1963) preserves {{memory of a}} two-stage descent: first, abandonment of the original highland area in northern Tusheti, settling of villages lower in the mountains, and a period <b>of</b> <b>transhumance</b> plus permanent descents of a few families; then, complete abandonment of the highlands and year-round settlement in the lowlands after a flood destroyed one of the secondary mountain villages {{in the early nineteenth}} century. That is, Batsbi lowland outposts were established by a combination <b>of</b> <b>transhumance</b> and individual resettlements, and some time later there was a sizable migration into an established outpost.|$|R

In the complex landscape <b>of</b> farmer-herder conflicts, <b>transhumance</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the root causes of}} insecurity.

40|$|Transhumance, the {{seasonal}} movement of herds between highlands and lowlands following precise, repeated routes, {{is a common}} practice in many Mediterranean regions. This livestock movement exploits natural vegetation in both winter and summer pastures. In Greece transhumant herders, drawn by relatively abundant vegetation, usually relocate to mountainous areas between April and October. Mount Vermio was an ideal summer pasture for the nomadic, ethnic group Sarakatsanoi of Thessaly, who used to own big herds. Socio-economic conditions of the 20 th century led to the gradual decline <b>of</b> <b>transhumance,</b> resulting in reduction in grazing pressure and changes in vegetation dynamics. The {{purpose of this study}} was to monitor changes in landscape patterns in response to transhumance abandonment. Landscape metrics were employed to estimate land use/cover in two altitudinal zones. Results reveal that due to the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>transhumance</b> in the highlands landscape fragmentation increased. Meanwhile, in the lowlands, due to the uninterrupted presence of animals, landscape structure is more stable and diversified. Grasslands and agroforestry systems became smaller and more isolated. In conclusion, the abandonment <b>of</b> <b>transhumance</b> led to the overall deterioration of the rural landscape in the highlands...|$|R
