5000|$|In August 2009 ZFA and the Shomron Liaisons Office cooperated {{to create}} a {{volunteer}} program for American students in the hilltop communities of the Samaria region. The controversial Jewish communities had been the central focus of American pressure on Israel's government and students looking to defy Washington and strengthen Israel's hold on the region spent a week working, building and farming in Yitzhar, Shalhevet Yam, Har Brakha, Kfar Tapuach, and Havat Gilad. The Jerusalem Post reported ZFA leader Yehuda HaKohen working with a dozen program participants planting a vineyard on a hilltop near the Har Brakha community, just outside Shechem and saying: [...] "For us the main issue is justice. When we come here to build and plant and support local residents, we are not simply taking a political stance on Israeli policy. We are resisting an historic crime from being perpetrated against our nation." [...] Binyamin Rubin, a ZFA leader from the University of Pennsylvania who had moved to Israel a month prior to the program, told the Post that: [...] "We're here to strengthen the connection to this land specifically, because it is under so much pressure <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> foreign powers that {{want to take it}} away from us. It's a statement that says, we're building something, we're planting something, that we will be here in the future to enjoy." [...] Rubin, who served as the trip councilor for the program was quoted by Israel National News as saying: “We are working to strengthen the Jewish people's hold on Samaria which foreign powers are trying to take from us. For the students, the main issue is not politics but justice. The Jewish people have every legal and historic right to this land, and the program affords an outlet to express our resistance.” David Ha'ivri, {{the executive director of the}} Shomron Liaisons Office, emphasized to Israel National News that the program had been a pilot run for what he hopes will become a mainstream experiential program for Diaspora Jewish students. [...] "Through this one week program, these kids get a unique hands-on opportunity to meet the pioneers settling the barren hilltops of Samaria and take part in reviving Jewish culture and agriculture in our ancient homeland. We are grateful for the cooperation of the ZFA and plan on jointly promoting additional such programs throughout campuses in America. This partnership between youth volunteers and Jewish farmers in Samaria is a blessing for both sides: the farmers need working hands, and the youth get an unforgettable experience that connects them to the Land of Israel."In October 2009 the week long volunteer program was repeated at the village of El Matan.|$|E

Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't wants to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.|$|E

Target population: people suffering from FM. Vegetarian diets could have some beneficial effects probably due to the increase in antioxidant intake. There is a high prevalence of obesity and overweight in patients, and weight control seems to be an effective tool to improve the symptoms. Some nutritional deficiencies have been described, it is not clear whether they are directly related to this disease or not. About the usefulness of some food supplements we found very little data, and it seems that more studies are needed to prove which ones could be of help. Dietary advice is necessary to these patients to improve their diets and maintain normal weight. It would be interesting to investigate more in the field of nutrition and FM to reveal any possible relationships...|$|E

40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. Applause is passe; the {{reaction}} most eagerly sought by pop culture <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>from</b> music to television to movies, is a high-pitched squeal from {{a mob of}} young girls. When it's directed at males, that squeal signifies romantic fantasy while it tests out some newly active hormonal responses. Directed at females, it's a squeal of sisterly solidarity and fashion approval. And {{for the last few}} years, its volume has been steadily rising until it threatens to drown out anything with more mature audiences in mind. Kiddie-pop has always been available to those who wanted it, but in the late 1990 s it's turning into the only game in town. 1 In July 1999, the New York Times published Jon Pareles' article, "When Pop Becomes The Toy of Teenyboppers," in response to the escalating presence of teenageoriented music, films, and television shows in America {{at the turn of the}} twenty-first century. Pareles attributed the rise of teen-pop music to a reaction against grunge and "gangsta" music of the 1980 s and early 1990 s, to rock musicians facing a "creative slump," and most interestingly, to the rise of the Latin pop stars, namely Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez, for the growing population of Spanish-speaking audiences. 2 However complex the reasons for the rise of teenage pop music at the millennium were, this new wave of "bubblegum" music swelled into a significant cultural force that shaped the lives of the millennial generation, because millennials joined in the singing and dancing or purposefully distanced themselves from the music. The millennial generation, also interchangeably termed the "millennials," echo boomers, generation Y, and generation me (or the me generation), is the largest demographic group to emerge in the United States since the postwar baby boomers born between 1946 and 1964. A consensus for the exact date range has yet to be reached for the birth years of the millennials. Jean M. Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University, established the range from the 1970 s through the 1990 s in Generation Me, while Neil Howe and William Strauss, authors of Millennials Rising, recognized the years 1982 and 2002 as the first and last years of birth for this generation. 3 Whatever the temporal boundaries, millennials have grown up in an era vastly different from those of previous generations, and its members have come of age in a technological world where information and fads are exchanged easily and with alacrity, greatly influencing teenage popular culture. Generation Y has been bombarded with information and images quite divergent from materials available to the same age cohort in prior generation. These images helped to shape millennial culture, and these shaping sources were often exhibited on television...|$|E
40|$|Adding {{trees to}} {{a mixed farm}} Cue: The {{benefits}} of mixed crop and livestock farming are well known. Livestock produce manure which can boost soil fertility and crop production. Those crops produce by-products, such as maize stover, {{which can be used}} to feed the livestock. Planting trees on a mixed farm can increase whole farm productivity even further, particularly if farmers are careful in their choice of species. Eric Kadenge recently visited a farmer in Kikuyu division, not far from Nairobi, who has introduced a wide variety of tree species to her farm. Having discussed her use of agroforestry, Eric also spoke to the extension officer responsible for Kikuyu division, and sent us this report. IN:		?I am standing on a two acre. ? OUT:		?. even the watering and caring for them. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 34 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: John Kibuika ending that report from Kikuyu division near Nairobi in Kenya. The farmer Eric spoke to was Virginia Wangui Njunge. Transcript Kadenge 	I am standing on a two acre farm in a place known as Muguga that is about 20 km west of Nairobi. And <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> where I am standing, there are some nice and healthy-looking cattle on my left, there is also some cabbages, some sugar cane, some arrow roots and a number of fruit trees and many other trees on this farm. And today I will be talking to a lady who practises mixed farming, and she will be telling us more about her farming and the trees especially and of what benefit they are to her. Wangui 	My names are Virginia Wangui Njunge. I am a retired teacher, I do farming - mixed farming - I keep cattle, I also grow fruits like avocado, guavas, I also grow apples on my two-acre land. I also grow beans, tomatoes cabbages and sukuma wiki. [Kale] Kadenge 	Well that sounds like quite a large variety of crops. Now next to us is a tree that has got some bright and broad looking leaves. Let's start with this one. What tree is this? Wangui	This one is an avocado tree. I have two trees and they give me fruit, which I sell and get some money. Kadenge 	Okay let's move on now to these other smaller looking trees. What trees are these? Wangui	This one is the apple tree. It has been grafted and it gives me fruit as you can see them and I sell them. Now they have been flowering. You can see some have got fruits also they have got flowers. You can see that there are no weeds. So I always pull the weeds so that they can do the flowering nearly all the year round. Kadenge 	And what fruit is this that we have here right now? Could you just pluck one? Wangui	Guavas. They are fruits, I also sell some and children use the others. Kadenge 	Okay. And this certainly looks like a mango tree is it? Wangui	Yes it is a mango tree. It has now taken two years, but it has not started giving fruit because it was not grafted this one. It failed the first time but I am planning to do it again. If I graft it, it will give me fruits soon. Kadenge 	Now are all your fruit trees grafted or some of them are not? Wangui	No they are all grafted - all of them. Kadenge 	And what was the reason for grafting them? Wangui	To make them start flowering soon instead of taking long time so they flower quickly when they are grafted than when they are not grafted. Kadenge 	Now earlier on we saw some cows just as I was entering your farm and you have talked about manure. Do you get your manure from the cows? Wangui	Yes. I get a lot of manure from those cows because I have zero grazing so I get a lot of manure from there. Kadenge 	And do you mix the manure from with cow with any other manure - maybe from the vegetation on the farm? Wangui	Yes I do because I have got a compost pit so I get the manure from there. Afterwards I put some weeds and all the leaves, the dry leaves, and so I mix them and then spread them on my farm. Kadenge 	Okay let?s walk {{over to the other side}} of the farm. Now we are walking down to an area where there are eucalyptus trees being grown, but just before we get there, we have some grass here. What grass is this? Wangui	This is Napier grass which I use to feed my cows. Kadenge 	I notice that in between the Napier grass there are some small seedlings. What trees are these? Wangui	Grevillea. Kadenge 	And what is the benefit - why are you planting this tree on your farm? Wangui	They give food to the cows and also it helps my farm - I have planted it where it is not very fertile. Kadenge 	So it also is able to enrich the soil fertility? Wangui 	Yes it is. Kadenge 	Okay let?s move nearer to the eucalyptus trees. Wangui	Yes these are the ones which I have planted on half an acre. Kadenge 	And the benefits of the eucalyptus to you? Wangui	They grow very fast and also they will give timber and also firewood and that is why I have planted them. Kibuika	My names are John Kibuika. I am an extension officer in Kikuyu division. So my work is to co-ordinate extension activities in the division whereby there are livestock, there are crops, that are grown and all rely on extension. Of course when I mean crop/livestock farming it also encompasses agroforestry. Kadenge 	Yes, in fact I was going to mention right now I can see something that looks like a seed bed. Could you just explain to us what little trees I am seeing here are and some of their benefits? Kibuika	We have a number of different type of trees. Like we have the Grevillea robusta. They are fast growing, they are also very good for wood. They also provide the foliage part of it. The leafy part of it are fed to the animals during the dry period whereby we have nothing to give to our animals. They are also very good in soil fertility because of their leaves fall quite frequently and they decompose very fast. So they also improve soil fertility. We also have another tree called the neem tree, which are good for medicinal value. They prevent and also heal malaria and other diseases. We have the Eucalyptus, the blue gums, which are very fast growing especially this variety from South Africa which grow within five years, they mature within five years. And we get poles from them, also they are very good for charcoal and they are also very important in preventing soil erosion. Kadenge 	And so are you involved in making sure that such nursery beds are taken well care of and made in the right way? Kibuika	That is actually our work. We had a demonstration sometime back whereby we showed them the way to go about making a nursery just from the beginning. The way to lay a nursery bed, filling the poly tubes and of course even transferring the small seedlings to the poly tubes and of course even the watering and caring for them. End of track.

In 1993 the band signed to Interscope Records, who bought the <b>rights</b> to Circa: <b>Now!</b> <b>from</b> Cargo/Headhunter and re-released it on a larger scale. Rocket from the Crypt would remain with Interscope until 1999, after which singer/guitarist John Reis started his own record label, Swami Records. Swami released a remastered version of the album in 2004 as Circa: Now! +4, including 4 additional songs recorded in 1993 which had originally been intended for inclusion on the Interscope re-release.|$|R

He has insisted that [...] "anyone who is not as concerned with the immortal soul of the dispossessor as he is with the suffering of the dispossessed is being something less than Christian" [...] and that [...] "Mr. Jesus died for the bigots as well". These convictions sometimes caused friction between Campbell and other civil rights figures, for example, when Campbell ministered to members of the Ku Klux Klan and visited James Earl Ray in prison.
