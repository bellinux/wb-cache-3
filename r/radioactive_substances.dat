5|$|In 1897, her {{daughter}} Irène was born. To support her family, Curie began {{teaching at the}} École Normale Supérieure. The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances.</b> The School did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances</b> on laboratory test animals.|$|E

5|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>substances</b> can harm {{human health}} via (i) local skin contamination, (ii) {{internal}} exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes, and (iii) external overexposure by β-activity and γ-radiation. Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became a}} subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances</b> without permission and was fined 15,000 baht (approx $450). Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants (EnLAW), a non-governmental advocacy group, later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE {{on behalf of the}} victims, and also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (approx $155,000) as restitution. KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640,246 baht (approx $19,000).|$|E
5|$|Levi {{worked as}} Franck's assistant, {{publishing}} two papers {{with him on}} the fluorescence of chlorophyll, until he left Denmark for the United States in 1935. She then became assistant to the Hungarian physical chemist George de Hevesy. The recent discovery of induced radioactivity and the consequent creation of short-lived radioactive isotopes opened up a number of new uses for <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances</b> in biology which she explored with de Hevesy, publishing a number of papers with him. The University of Berlin cancelled Levi's doctorate in 1938. In April 1940, the Germans occupied Denmark. When the Nazis began rounding up Danish Jews in September 1943, Levi was one of the thousands of Jews who fled to Sweden. For the rest of the war she worked for the biologist John Runnström at the Wenner-Gren Institute for Experimental Biology in Stockholm.|$|E

5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible <b>radioactive</b> <b>substances.</b>|$|E
