2500|$|The wire antennas {{used with}} crystal {{receivers}} are monopole antennas which develop their output voltage {{with respect to}} ground.

[...] In early days if an adequate ground connection could not be made a counterpoise was sometimes used. [...] A good ground is more important for crystal sets {{than it is for}} powered receivers, as crystal sets are designed to have a low input impedance needed to transfer power efficiently from the antenna. A low resistance ground connection (preferably below 25 Ω) is necessary because any resistance in the ground reduces available power from the antenna. In contrast, modern receivers are voltage-driven devices, with high input impedance, hence little current flows in the antenna/ground circuit. Also, mains powered receivers are grounded adequately through their power cords, which are in turn attached to the earth by way of a well established ground.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla went on {{to develop}} a {{wireless}} power distribution system that he hoped {{would be capable of}} transmit power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above [...] in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to conclude incorrectly that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would [...] "break the air stratum down", eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric <b>return</b> <b>circuit.</b> Tesla would go on the next year to propose a [...] "World Wireless System" [...] that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.|$|E

In essence, the output of a liquid cooled rack should not be routed to a cooling installation, but to a different type of liquid cooling environment. By chaining the segmented liquid circuits in larger environments, very high return temperatures can be achieved, which enables the practical and effective reusability of thermal energy and decreases investments needed to make large scale heat reuse a viable option.|$|E

50|$|Later vacuum-chamber {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the unwinding of the reel uncovered pinholes in the insulation. That in itself would not have caused a major problem, because the ionosphere around the tether, under normal circumstance, was too rarefied to divert much of the current. However, the air trapped in the insulation changed that. As it bubbled out of the pinholes, the high voltage of the nearby tether, about 3500 volts, converted it into a plasma (in a way similar to the ignition of a fluorescent tube), a relatively dense one and therefore a much better conductor of electricity. This plasma diverted to the metal of the shuttle {{and from there to}} the ionospheric <b>return</b> <b>circuit.</b> That current was enough to melt the cable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason the}} two signals, the RF and AF currents, can pass {{simultaneously}} through the amplifier without interfering {{is due to}} the superposition principle because the amplifier is linear. Since the two signals have different frequencies, they can be separated at the output with frequency selective filters. Therefore the proper functioning of the circuit depends on the amplifier operating in the linear region of its transfer curve. If the amplifier is significantly nonlinear, intermodulation distortion will occur and the audio signal will modulate the RF signal, resulting in audio feedback which can cause a shrieking in the earphone. The presence of the audio <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> from the amplifier output to input made the reflex circuit vulnerable to such parasitic oscillation problems.|$|E

50|$|Telegraph {{lines in}} rural areas {{typically}} used one wire earth <b>return</b> <b>circuits,</b> this is a system whereby one conductor is installed on insulators mounted on telegraph poles. The <b>circuit</b> <b>return</b> current travels back via the earth to the origin battery. One wire on a pole was very economical to build and one wire circuits expanded rapidly to remote rural communities. Telephone circuits as distinct from telegraph circuits ideally use two wires to provide a noise free line. Once telephone communications became more commonplace in big cities there became more interest in voice telephone lines for long distance communications to smaller centers remote from the cities. Voice messages improved the correctness of the information and could allow more messages to be sent including direct person to person communications. Telegraphs typically operated between two telegraph offices and the messages written on a telegraph note and hand delivered to the recipient.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the {{laboratory}} goes back to 1922 when, on farmland purchased by the Belgian Government, the first building was erected to house the STAé (Service Technique de lAéronautique), i.e. the technical services of the Civil Aviation Authority then under the Ministry of Defence. The building was designed to accommodate a large low speed wind tunnel of the Eiffel type with an open <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> and open-jet test section of 2 m diameter, as well as offices and shops. It still exists and has been refurbished internally after removal of the low speed tunnel {{to make room for}} modern turbomachinery and high speed facilities. A second building was added in 1935 to house offices and laboratories. It is now the Institutes administrative building. The last addition was made after the war, in 1949, with the construction of a large building specially designed to house a supersonic tunnel and a multi-configuration low speed facility.|$|E
50|$|This {{observation}} {{has been}} rediscovered several times, and described, for instance, in a 1993 patent. Single-wire transmission {{in this sense}} is not possible using direct current and totally impractical for low frequency alternating currents such as the standard 50-60 Hz power line frequencies. At much higher frequencies, however, {{it is possible for}} the <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> (which would normally be connected through a second wire) to utilize the self- and parasitic capacitance of a large conductive object, perhaps the housing of the load itself. Although the self-capacitance of even large objects is rather small in ordinary terms, as Tesla himself appreciated it is possible to resonate that capacitance using a sufficiently large inductor (depending on the frequency used), in which case the large reactance of that capacitance is cancelled out. This allows a large current to flow (and a large power to be supplied to the load) without requiring an extremely high voltage source. Although this method of power transmission has long been understood, {{it is not clear whether}} there has been any commercial application of this principle for power transmission.|$|E

50|$|There is one {{particular}} hazard associated with trams powered from a trolley off an overhead line. Since the tram relies on {{contact with the}} rails for the current return path, a problem arises if the tram is derailed or (more usually) if it halts on a section of track that has been particularly heavily sanded by a previous tram, and the tram loses electrical contact with the rails. In this event, the underframe of the tram, by virtue of a circuit path through ancillary loads (such as saloon lighting), is live at the full supply voltage, typically 600 volts. In British terminology such a tram {{was said to be}} ‘grounded’—not {{to be confused with the}} US English use of the term, which means the exact opposite. Any person stepping off the tram completed the earth <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> and could receive a nasty electric shock. In such an event the driver was required to jump off the tram (avoiding simultaneous contact with the tram and the ground) and pull down the trolley before allowing passengers off the tram. Unless derailed, the tram could usually be recovered by running water down the running rails from a point higher than the tram. The water providing a conducting bridge between the tram and the rails.|$|E

50|$|Telephone trunk lines, and {{especially}} frequency division multiplexing carrier systems, are usually 4-wire circuits rather than 2-wire circuits (or {{at least they}} were before fibre-optic became widespread) and require a different kind of cable. This format requires the conductors to be arranged in two pairs, one pair for the sending (go) signal and the other for the return signal. The greatest source of interference on this kind of transmission is usually the crosstalk between the go and <b>return</b> <b>circuits</b> themselves. The most common cable format is star quad, where the diagonally opposite conductors form the pairs. This geometry gives maximum common mode rejection between the two pairs. An alternative format is DM quad which consists of two twisted pairs with the twisting at different pitches.|$|R
