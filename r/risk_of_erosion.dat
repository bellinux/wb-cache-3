5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, {{they were at the}} mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>erosion</b> when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the topsoil away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>erosion.</b> This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms out of sync with their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E

40|$|Background: Increasing age at onset {{has been}} {{associated}} with worse outcome in rheumatoid arthritis, although there are few data from unselected inception cohorts. Hypothesis: Increasing age is associated with a higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>erosions</b> at presentation, and this increase is not explained by age-related disease confounders. Subjects and methods: 222 subjects (median onset age 59 years) were studied from a primary-care-based register of new-onset inflammatory polyarthritis. Patients had hand and feet radiographs taken within 12 months from symptom onset. Films were scored by two readers using the Larsen score. The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>erosions</b> in those aged 50 - 69 and >= 70 years at onset was compared with the risk in those aged, 50 years both before and after adjustment for possible age-related disease confounders. Result: The prevalences <b>of</b> <b>erosions</b> were 22 %, 52 % and 71 % in those aged, 50, 50 - 69 and >= 70 years at onset equivalent to odds ratios (ORs) (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)) of 3. 5 (2. 2 to 5. 7) and 7. 4 (4. 5 to 12. 1), respectively, in the two older age groups. Excluding those with proximal interphalangeal (PIP) erosions alone (due to possible osteoarthritis) did not alter these findings. Adjustments for disease characteristics using logistic regression did not attenuate these findings: adjusted ORs (95 % CIs) 3. 6 (2. 1 to 6. 1) and 6. 9 (3. 8 to 12. 2) for age groups 50 - 69 and >= 70 years, respectively. The influence of age was stronger than most of the disease-related variables in predicting erosions in this cohort.

The measure <b>of</b> preference <b>erosion</b> <b>risk</b> is the difference in preference margins enjoyed by individual suppliers to the QUAD (Canada, EU, Japan, United States) markets before and after a MFN tariff reduction, multiplied by the associated trade flow. The paper does not attempt to determine how losses in preference margins translate into trade outcomes, but it does highlight which products and which non-reciprocal preference beneficiaries are the most vulnerable to erosion effects in the major developed country markets. Overall, the paper finds that the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> preference <b>erosion</b> is small, but some countries are strongly affected in particular product lines (notably sugar and bananas) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{other aspects}} {{included}} in the BVT are all relevant for landslides. In a short-term perspective, landslide risk reduction measures may result in increased suspension and sedimentation {{in the system and}} changes in water quality (surface and groundwater) as well as soil quality.

But under some conditions, for example, due to excavation of contaminated sites, the risks during the construction phase may increase. The aspects are therefore relevant to and applicable to landslides. In the same way, aspects related to fauna, flora, and landscape are also applicable to landslides. The impact depends on the method, design, and scale of the intervention and where the intervention is done. The social aspect “perception” was interpreted as concern or anxiety <b>of</b> flood <b>risk.</b> All technical and social aspects are also relevant and applicable to landslides.|$|R
40|$|Background: Eating {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} the highest rates of morbidity and mortality of any mental disorders among adolescents. The failure to recognize their early signs can compromise a patient’s recovery and long-term prognosis. Tooth erosion has been reported as an oral manifestation that might help in the early detection of eating disorders. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to search for scientific evidence regarding the following clinical question: Do eating disorders increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> tooth <b>erosion?</b> Methods: An electronic search addressing eating disorders and tooth erosion was conducted in eight databases. Two independent reviewers selected studies, abstracted information and assessed its quality. Data were abstracted for meta-analysis comparing tooth erosion in control patients (without eating disorders) vs. patients with eating disorders; and patients with eating disorder risk behavior vs. patients without such risk behavior. Combined odds ratios (ORs) and a 95 % confidence interval (CI) were obtained. Results: Twenty-three papers were included in the qualitative synthesis and assessed by {{a modified version of the}} Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Fourteen papers were included in the meta-analysis. Patients with eating disorders had more <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> tooth <b>erosion</b> (OR = 12. 4, 95 %CI = 4. 1 – 37. 5).

40|$|The entire land of Southern Iran faces {{problems}} {{arising out}} of various types of land degradation <b>of</b> which water <b>erosion</b> forms a major type. A new model has been developed for assessing the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> water <b>erosion.</b> Taking into consideration nine indicators <b>of</b> water <b>erosion</b> the model identifies areas with ‘Potential Risk’ (risky zones) and areas of ‘Actual Risk’ as well as projects the probability of the worse degradation in future. The Mond river basin, located centrally to this zone, has been selected as a test area to assess the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> water <b>erosion</b> and to suggest appropriate remedial measures. For this purpose two sub basins of the Payab and Qareh Aghaj have been chosen for detailed study as these two provide enough variation in climatic conditions like rainfall and topography. The preparation <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> maps based on the GIS analysis of these indicators will be helpful for prioritizing the areas to initiate remedial measures. The different kinds of data for indicators <b>of</b> water <b>erosion</b> were gathered from the records and published reports of the governmental offices of Iran. By fixing the thresholds of severity classes of the nine indicators a hazard map for each indicator was first prepared in GIS. The risk classes were defined on the basis <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> scores arrived at by assigning the appropriate attributes to the indicators and the risk map was prepared by overlaying nine hazard maps in the GIS. Areas under potential risk {{have been found to}} be more widespread (63 %) in the Qareh Aghaj basin while actual risk areas are more extensive (78 %) in the Payab.
