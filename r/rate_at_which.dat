All other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; the wings can beat faster than the <b>rate</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the muscles receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E

40|$|The <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> {{classical}} and quantum {{information can be}} simultaneously transmitted from two spatially separated senders to a single receiver over an arbitrary quantum channel are characterized. Two main results are proved in detail. The first describes the region of <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> one sender can send classical information while the other sends quantum information. The second describes those <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> both senders can send quantum information.

These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by the <b>rate</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their criticality assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E

Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E

Mesophilic and thermophilic digestion of anaerobic sludges destroyed all three indicator bacteria more rapidly than such digestion destroyed the viruses. The relative rates {{for the destruction of}} viruses, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci in the digested sludges were consistent over the 17 -month study. Fecal coliforms were 7 to 8 times more sensitive than the viruses to mesophilic digestion and 9 to 10 times more sensitive to thermophilic digestion. Total coliforms were even more sensitive. The <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> fecal streptococci were destroyed by mesophilic and thermophilic digestion of anaerobic sludges approached those <b>at</b> <b>which</b> the viruses were destroyed by those processes; this suggested that the <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> fecal streptococci in sludges are destroyed by those processes may serve as useful indicators for the <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> viruses in sludges are destroyed by those processes...|$|R
