Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
50|$|Wolffia arrhiza is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant known by the common names spotless watermeal and <b>rootless</b> <b>duckweed,</b> belonging to the Araceae, a family rich in water-loving species, such as Arum and Pistia. It is the smallest vascular plant on Earth. It is native to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is present {{in other parts of}} the world as a naturalized species. It is an aquatic plant which grows in quiet water bodies such as ponds. The green part of the plant, the frond, is a sphere measuring about 1 mm wide, but with a flat top that floats at the water's surface. It has a few parallel rows of stomata. There is no root. The plant produces a minute flower fully equipped with one stamen and one pistil. It often multiplies by vegetative reproduction, however, with the rounded part budding off into a new individual. In cooler conditions the plant becomes dormant and sinks to the bed of the water body to overwinter as a turion. The plant is a mixotroph which can produce its own energy by photosynthesis or absorb it from the environment in the form of dissolved carbon.|$|E
40|$|The <b>rootless</b> <b>duckweed</b> Wolffia globosa can {{accumulate}} and tolerate {{relatively large}} amounts of arsenic (As); however, the underlying mechanisms were unknown. W. globosa was exposed to different concentrations of arsenate with or without L-buthionine sulphoximine (BSO), a specific inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Free thiol compounds and As(III) -thiol complexes were identified and quantified using HPLC - high resolution ICP-MS accurate mass ESI-MS. Without BSO, 74 % of the As accumulated in the duckweed was complexed with phytochelatins (PCs), with As(III) -PC 4 and As(III) -PC 3 being the main species. BSO was {{taken up by the}} duckweed and partly deaminated. The BSO treatment completely suppressed the synthesis of PCs and the formation of As(III) -PC complexes, and also inhibited the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. BSO markedly decreased both As accumulation and As tolerance in W. globosa. The results demonstrate an important role of PCs in detoxifying As and enabling As accumulation in W. globosa.

40|$|Duckweeds are {{a common}} {{macrophyte}} in paddy and aquatic environments. Here, we investigated arsenic (As) accumulation, speciation and tolerance of the <b>rootless</b> <b>duckweed</b> Wolffia globosa and its potential for As phytofiltration. When grown with 1 microm arsenate, W. globosa accumulated two to 10 times more As than four other duckweed or Azolla species tested. W. globosa was able to accumulate > 1000 mg As kg(- 1) in frond dry weight (DW), and tolerate up to 400 mg As kg(- 1) DW. At the low concentration range, uptake rate was similar for arsenate and arsenite, but at the high concentration range, arsenite was taken up at a faster rate. Arsenite was the predominant As species (c. 90 % of the total extractable As) in both arsenate- and arsenite-exposed duckweed. W. globosa was more resistant to external arsenate than arsenite, but showed a similar degree of tolerance internally. W. globosa decreased arsenate in solution rapidly, but also effluxed arsenite. Wolffia globosa is a strong As accumulator and an interesting model plant to study As uptake and metabolism {{because of the lack}} of a root-to-frond translocation barrier...|$|E
