40|$|The {{identification}} of four doping control substances in an artificial mixture, using short column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CC-MS) analysis was examined. Two chromatographic peaks were <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>chromatogram,</b> using a short capillary column (1. 8 m) at an oven temperature of 180 degrees C. The first peak {{was associated with}} a mixture of a solvent derivative and an artifact. The second one corresponded to the mixture of four control substances. Principal component analysis was applied on a selected CC-Ms data set of the latter peak to determine clear full spectra of pure substances from mixture spectra. The time of GC-MS analysis was significantly reduced to less than 1 min from 30 min which is a typical GC-MS analysis time, using standard methods of doping control analysis.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{developed}} a novel online hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) -RPLC separation system for simultaneous separation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic solutes in a complex sample with one injection. A HILIC Si column and a C 18 column were hyphenated with an interface including two electronic 2 -position valves, a solvent pump, and a solute transfer column. By using column-switching technique, the nonretained hydrophobic solutes were eluted out of the HILIC column and transferred into the C 18 column to perform further separation. The hydrophilic solutes were separated on the HILIC column at the same time. One detector was equipped for each column to <b>record</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>chromatograms.</b> By separating a standard mixture and a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) extract, the developed HILIC-RPLC system demonstrates its potential for "entire-components" separation of complex samples with improved peak capacity and throughput compared with the common single-column LC...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that the {{composition}} of fingerprint residue varies significantly from the same donor as well as between donors. This variability is a major drawback in latent print dating issues. This study aimed, therefore, at the definition of a parameter that is less variable from print to print, using a ratio of peak area of a target compound degrading over time divided by the summed area of peaks of more stable compounds also found in latent print residues. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the initial lipid composition of latent prints identifies four main classes of compounds {{that can be used in}} the definition of an aging parameter: fatty acids, sterols, sterol precursors, and wax esters (WEs). Although the entities composing the first three groups are quite well known, those composing WEs are poorly reported. Therefore, the first step of the present work was to identify WE compounds present in latent print residues deposited by different donors. Of 29 WEs <b>recorded</b> in <b>the</b> <b>chromatograms,</b> seven were observed in the majority of samples. The identified WE compounds were subsequently used in the definition of ratios in combination with squalene and cholesterol to reduce the variability of the initial composition between latent print residues from different persons and more particularly from the same person. Finally, the influence of a latent print enhancement process on the initial composition was studied by analyzing traces after treatment with magnetic powder, 1, 2 -indanedione, and cyanoacrylate...|$|R

By comparing <b>the</b> <b>chromatograms</b> of <b>the</b> cell-free fermentation broth, the ultrafiltration filtrate, and the ultrafiltration filtrate of methanol-surfactant mixture, the peaks corresponding to biosurfactants can be identified without any prior structural information of the biosurfactants.

This HPLC methods thus developed can also be adapted for the preparation of homogeneous biosuirfactant samples useful for chemical analysis for the elucidation of chemical structure of biosurfactants and for the determination of the physical properties of biosurfactants. 本論文探討建立以高效液相層析技術（HPLC）進行生物界面活性劑純化與分析的策略。在無生物界面活性劑化學結構或物理性質之相關資訊的情況下，藉由比較發酵液、超過瀘濾液、甲醇-界面活性劑混合溶液的超過濾濾液之HPLC層析圖，即可辨識出生物界面活性劑之波峰。我們可假設不存在於發酵液瀘液層析圖中但在甲醇-界面活性劑混合溶液瀘液之層析圖可見之波峰即是生物界面活性劑之波峰。只要發酵液中之生物界面活性劑濃度高於臨界微胞濃度（CMC），這個方法可應用在任何生物界面活性劑之HPLC分析法的發展上。另外，由此而發展出之HPLC方法也可用於高純度生物界面活性劑樣本的備製上，而此高純度生物界面活性劑之備製對於進行化學分析以決定化學結構及物性是相當重要的...|$|R
