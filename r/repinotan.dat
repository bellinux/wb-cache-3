50|$|In October 2010, further {{investigation}} showed <b>repinotan</b> able to counteract respiratory depression caused by morphine. <b>Repinotan</b> {{continues to be}} examined, but {{has not yet been}} commercially released.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the protein}} Bcl-2, the serotonergic {{glial growth factor}} S-100beta, and Nerve Growth Factor are {{affected}} by <b>repinotan.</b> <b>Repinotan</b> is able to suppress caspase-3 through MAPK and PKCalpha.

50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> HCI (BAYx3702) acts as {{a highly}} {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor full agonist. It is blocked by the specific 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100135 and its primary metabolizer is CYP2D6. Ethnic differences {{are known to have}} an effect on CYP2D6. <b>Repinotan</b> is believed to operate through neuronal hyperpolarization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> has {{presently}} {{been found}} to be effective at stopping respiratory depression caused by morphine. In addition, it represses nociception at high doses, but enhances nociception at small doses (0.2 micrograms/kg). <b>Repinotan</b> may be applicable to Parkinson’s, as it is able to reduce glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and thereby some cell death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> (BAYx3702), an aminomethylchroman derivative, is a {{selective}} 5-HT1A receptor full agonist with high potency and efficacy. It has neuroprotective effects in animal studies, and was trialed in humans for reducing brain injury following head trauma. It was subsequently trialed up to phase II {{for treatment of}} stroke, but while side effects were mild and consisted mainly of nausea, <b>repinotan</b> failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy to justify further clinical trials. However, <b>repinotan</b> continues to be investigated for other applications, and {{was found to be}} effective at counteracting the respiratory depression produced by morphine, though with slight reduction in analgesic effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> is an enantiomerically pure aminomethyl chromane {{derivative}} with a saccharinylbutyl substituent. It {{is classified}} as a synthetic organic and possesses five hydrogen bond acceptors and one hydrogen bond donor. Its topological polar surface area is 84.09 and it has seven rotatable bonds. In addition, its molecular weight is 400.15 g/mole. <b>Repinotan</b> has a formal charge of zero and a covalently-bonded unit count of one. It is similar in chemical and physical properties to the ligands quetiapine, PAT5A, and pioglitazone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> was {{originally}} developed by Bayer Healthcare AG (Wuppertal, Germany) as an oral treatment for depression. However, it was instead trialed {{as a candidate}} for reducing brain injury following head trauma. The drug was then examined as a preventative of secondary brain damage for ischemic stroke victims. Early trials showed repinotan’s ability to reduce hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neuronal loss. Cortical tissue damage was also reduced. In addition, <b>repinotan</b> was shown to mitigate spatial learning deficits. However, trials were discontinued due to repinotan’s efficacy being insufficient.|$|E
50|$|Bayer Healthcare AG {{synthesized}} <b>Repinotan</b> {{in three}} main reaction sequences. A form with a metabolically stable 14carbon-label {{was necessary for}} pharmacokinetic studies. The hydrochloride was hydroxylated in the 6-position of the chromane moiety.|$|E
50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> {{acts as a}} {{selective}} high-affinity full receptor agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype. It increases the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area as well as DA release in the medial prefrontal cortex.|$|E
50|$|Its current {{investigation}} as an antagonist for respiratory depression caused by morphine has shown {{there to be}} no serious cardiovascular side effects. However, a slight decrease in blood pressure was a more minor effect. <b>Repinotan</b> has been linked with pupil diameter reduction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Repinotan</b> {{has been}} found to bind with high to {{moderate}} affinity to the receptors alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic, 5-HT7- and 5-HT1D, dopamine D2 and D4, sigma sites, and 5-HT2C. It is able to increase activity of VTA dopaminergic neurons and medial prefrontal cortex dopamine release.|$|E
50|$|The {{half-life}} of <b>repinotan</b> {{is approximately}} 1 hour. Elimination ensues in parallel from plasma and brain. In addition, repinotan’s volume of distribution at steady-state and plasma clearance {{are independent of}} dose. This is indicative of linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 0.1-3.0 micrograms repinotan/kg/h.|$|E
50|$|When <b>repinotan</b> first binds to both pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, G protein-coupled {{inwardly}} rectifying K+ {{channels are}} activated. This causes hyperpolarization. Because hyperpolarization causes inhibition of neuron firing and less glutamate release, neurons are protected against overexcitation. This could explain repinotan’s neuroprotective properties.|$|E
50|$|Another stroke {{medication}} trialed at {{the same}} time, picozotan, is similar to <b>repinotan</b> {{in that it is}} also a serotonin agonist. Other drugs included zonampanel, which acts as an AMPA receptor antagonist instead of a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and DP-b99. DP-b99 is a metal iron chelator.|$|E
50|$|Repinotan’s {{side effects}} during trials as a {{treatment}} for ischemic stroke consisted mainly of serotonergic side effects including nausea and vomiting. The most common side effect was headache. Neurological worsening, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain edema were the most common severe effects. However, <b>repinotan</b> was generally shown to be safe.|$|E
50|$|Bayer Healthcare AG (Wuppertal, Germany) first {{synthesized}} <b>repinotan</b> {{during early}} 2000s. As of 2004, {{it was expected}} to be filed by the NDA. Phase III trials for both ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury were run in March 2002. However, these trials found the drug ineffective as a treatment (November, 2009).|$|E
50|$|Currently, <b>repinotan</b> is not commercially {{available}} in the United States. Sales of $1000 million in the U.S. and a launch date of 2006 were originally anticipated by Lehman Brothers. Bank Vontobel and Bayer both estimated sales of 450 million Euros. However, the drug continues to be under investigation for different treatments than its original intent.|$|E

50|$|Repinotan’s {{primary route}} of {{administration}} is by intravenous injection, which indicates that it goes directly into the bloodstream. It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier- a highly selective barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain’s extracellular fluid.

In addition, the drug is uncharged, {{which is consistent with}} {{the fact that it is}} able to pass the lipophilic and non-polar blood-brain barrier.|$|E
40|$|<b>Repinotan</b> HCl (<b>repinotan,</b> BAY x 3702), {{a highly}} {{selective}} 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist {{with a good}} record of safety {{was found to have}} pronounced neuroprotective effects in experimental models that mimic various aspects of brain injury. <b>Repinotan</b> caused strong, dose-dependent infarct reductions in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, and traumatic brain injury paradigms. The specific 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 blocked these effects, indicating that the neuroprotective properties of <b>repinotan</b> are mediated through the 5 -HT 1 A receptor. The proposed neuroprotective mechanisms of <b>repinotan</b> are thought {{to be the result of}} neuronal hyperpolarization via the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels upon binding to both pre- and post-synaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Hyperpolarization results in inhibition of neuron firing and reduction of glutamate release. These mechanisms, leading to protection of neurons against overexcitation, could explain the neuroprotective efficacy of <b>repinotan</b> per se, but not necessarily the efficacy by delayed administration. The therapeutic time window of <b>repinotan</b> appeared to be at least 5 h in in vivo animal models, but may be even longer at higher doses of the drug. Experimental studies indicate that <b>repinotan</b> affects various mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of brain injury. In addition to the direct effect of <b>repinotan</b> on neuronal hyperpolarization and suppression of glutamate release this compound affects the death,inhibiting protein Bcl- 2, serotonergic glial growth factor S- 100 beta and Nerve Growth Factor. It also suppresses the activity of caspase- 3 through MAPK and PKC alpha; this effect may contribute to its neuroprotective efficacy. The dose- and time-dependent neuroprotective efficacy of <b>repinotan</b> indicates that the drug is a promising candidate for prevention of secondary brain damage in brain-injured patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, however, the first, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial did not demonstrate the efficacy of <b>repinotan</b> in acute ischemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that stimulation of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors abates excitotoxic neuronal death. Here we investigated whether oral post-lesion administration of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist (-) -(R) - 2 -[4 -[[(3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 2 -yl) methyl]amino]butyl]- 1, 2 -benzisothiazol- 3 (2 H) -one 1, 1 -dioxide monohydrochloride (<b>Repinotan</b> HCl) attenuates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity (60 nmol/mul) in the rat magnocellular nucleus basalis. <b>Repinotan</b> HCl (1 mg/kg) was administered from day 1, 2, 3, or 6 post-surgery twice daily for five consecutive days. This delayed drug administration protocol was employed to investigate the initiation period during which 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists may significantly influence ongoing neurodegeneration processes. 8 -Hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg) served as reference compound. Twenty-four hours after drug delivery a small open-field test, while on day 14 post-surgery a passive avoidance test was performed. Effects of <b>Repinotan</b> HCl treatment on the survival of cholinergic magnocellular nucleus basalis neurons and their cortical projections were determined by quantitative acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) histochemistry. Moreover, AChE and ChAT activities were biochemically measured both in the cerebral cortex and in the magnocellular nucleus basalis. <b>Repinotan</b> HCl treatment markedly increased spontaneous activities in the small open-field at any time-point investigated. Improved memory performance was only demonstrated when <b>Repinotan</b> HCl was administered from day I post-lesion on wards. <b>Repinotan</b> HCl treatment from day 2 and 3 post-lesion on markedly attenuated both histochemical and neurochemical characteristics of NMDA excitotoxicity on cholinergic magnocellular nucleus basalis neurons and on their cortical projections. Whereas the neuroprotective profile of <b>Repinotan</b> HCl was superior to that of 8 -OH-DPAT, oral administration of both 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists yielded largely equivalent behavioral recovery after NMDA infusion in the magnocellular nucleus basalis. In conclusion, the present data indicate the potent neuroprotective action of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist <b>Repinotan</b> HCl with a peak efficacy of delayed (2 - 3 day) post-lesion drug treatment in vivo. Post-lesion treatment with 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists may therefore be of significance in the intervention of neuronal damage associated with acute excitotoxic conditions. (C) 2001 IBRO.

40|$|Excitotoxicity-mediated {{cell death}} is {{involved}} in Parkinson's disease (PD). 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists can protect from such mechanisms. The current study demonstrates that the 5 -HT 1 A agonists BAY 639044 and <b>repinotan</b> have neuroprotective effects in a subacute 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. In addition, we also show that both compounds delay the appearance of parkinsonian motor abnormalities in a MPTP monkey model that recapitulates the progressive nature of PD. Thus, BAY 639044 or <b>repinotan</b> treatment was initiated when there was 30 % neuronal death in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and nerve terminal loss in the striatum was 40 %, i. e., compatible with the clinical situation where early symptomatic patients would receive such a treatment. The delay in appearance of parkinsonian motor abnormalities {{is a consequence of}} partial neuroprotection of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, both at neuronal and terminal levels as shown for BAY 639044. These results suggest that 5 -HT 1 A agonists, such as BAY 639044, may protect from neurodegeneration and delay the worsening of motor symptoms in Parkinson patients. © 2006. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 (di-n-propylamino) {{tetralin}} (8 -OH-DPAT) causes {{inhibition of}} caspase- 3 and apoptosis via the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1 / 2) in hippocampal HN 2 – 5 cells. Two 5 -HT 1 A agonists, <b>Repinotan</b> hydrochloride (BAY x 3702) and 8 -OH-DPAT, block caspase- 3 activation and apoptosis caused by anoxia/reoxygenation and H 2 O 2 treatment. This is reversed upon transient expression of dominant negative Ras (N 17 Ras) and Raf- 1 (Raf 301), confirming {{the involvement of}} Ras and Raf- 1 in this 5 -HT 1 A-R→ERK 1 / 2 →caspase- 3 pathway. A selective inhibitor of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (U 73122) but not a general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GFX) reversed the 5 -HT 1 A-R-mediated ERK 1 / 2 stimulation. However, both GFX and the PKCα and PKCβ 1 inhibitor Gö 6976 reversed the ERK 1 / 2 -mediated inhibition of caspase- 3. ERK-dependent activation of only PKCα was observed in immunoprecipitates obtained from 5 -HT 1 A agonist-treated HN 2 – 5 cells. Finally, transient expression of kinase-negative PKCα eliminated the 8 -OH-DPAT-evoked block on the H 2 O 2 -triggered caspase- 3 stimulation, establishing PKCα as a link between ERK and caspase- 3 (5 -HT 1 A-R→PLC→ERK 1 / 2 →PKCα→caspase- 3). Our results elucidate a novel yet general, neuroprotective pathway through which G protein-coupled receptors could cause inhibition of effector caspases, such as caspase- 3...|$|E
40|$|More {{than any}} other brain {{neurotransmitter}} system, the indolamine serotonin (5 -HT) {{has been linked to}} aggression in a wide and diverse range of species, including humans. The nature of this linkage, however, is not simple and it has proven difficult to unravel the precise role of this amine in the predisposition for and execution of aggressive behavior. The dogmatic view that 5 -HT inhibits aggression has dominated both pharmacological research strategies to develop specific and effective novel drug treatments that reduce aggressive behavior and the pharmacological mechanistic interpretation of putative serenic drug effects. Our studies on brain serotonin and aggression in feral wild-type rats using the resident- intruder paradigm have challenged this so-called serotonin deficiency hypothesis of aggressive behavior. The well-known fact that certain 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonists potently and specifically reduce aggressive behavior without motor slowing and sedative effects is only consistent with this hypothesis under the assumption that the agonist mainly acts on the postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor sites. However, systemic injections of anti-aggressive doses of 5 -HT 1 A and 1 B agonists robustly decrease brain 5 -HT release due to their inhibitory actions at somatodendritic and terminal autoreceptors, respectively. The availability of the novel benzodioxopiperazine compound S- 15535, which acts in vivo as a preferential agonist of the somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A auto-receptor and as an antagonist (weak partial agonist) at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, allows for a pharmacological analysis of the exact site of action of this anti-aggressive effect. It was found that, similar to other prototypical full and partial 5 -HT 1 A and/or 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists like <b>repinotan,</b> 8 -OHDPAT, ipsapirone, buspirone, alnespirone, eltoprazine, CGS- 12066 B and CP- 93129, also S- 15535 very effectively reduced offensive aggressive behavior. Unlike the other ligands, however, a remarkable degree of behavioral specificity was observed after treatment with S- 15535, in that the anti-aggressive effects were not accompanied by inhibiting (like other 5 -HTIA receptor agonist with moderate to high efficacy at postsynaptic 5 -HTIA receptors) or enhancing (like agonists with activity at 5 -HT 1 B receptors and alnespirone) non-aggressive motor behaviors (e. g., social exploration, ambulation, rearing, and grooming) beyond the range of undrugged animals with corresponding levels of aggression. The involvement of 5 -HTIA and/or 5 -HT 1 B receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was convincingly confirmed by showing that the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 and/or the 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist GR- 127935, while inactive when given alone, effectively attenuated/prevented these actions. Furthermore, combined administration of S- 15535 with either alnespirone or CGS- 42066 B elicited a clear additive effect, indicated by a left-ward shift in their dose-effect curves, providing further support for presynaptic sites of action (i. e., inhibitory somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A and terminal 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptors). These findings strongly suggest that the specific anti-aggressive effects of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists are predominantly based on reduction rather than enhancement of 5 -HT neurotransmission during the combative social interaction. Apparently, normal display of offensive aggressive behavior is positively related to rief spikes in serotonergic activity, whereas an inverse relationship probably exists between tonic 5 -HT activity and abnormal forms of aggression only.
