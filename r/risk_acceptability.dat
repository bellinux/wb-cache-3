50|$|Acceptable {{risk level}} {{is not the}} same as {{personal}} acceptance of risk, but it refers to <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> by stakeholders’ community or by society in a broad sense. Acceptable risk levels vary from system to system, and evolve with time due to socio-economic changes and technological advancement. Implementing proven best-practices at status-of-art is a prerequisite for achieving an acceptable risk level, or in other words to make a system safe. Best-practices are traditionally established by government regulations and norms, and/or by industrial standards. Without such reference the term safety, or acceptable risk, becomes meaningless. In other words compliance with regulations, norms and standards represents the safety yardstick of a system.|$|E

For this purpose, we decide to examine {{the influence of the}} parental risk beliefs on the development of adolescents risk’s beliefs. In particular, the present study that has involved 41 families with an adolescent 14 - 17 years old has the aim to analyze the intergenerational continuity of risk’s beliefs between parents and their children. In this study, we explored the construct of <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability.</b> We investigated the presence of a relation between parental risk’s beliefs and adolescent risk’s beliefs and the influence on this relationship of parental dynamics. Results showed that the parental <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> predict the children <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> but not children risk behavior. Again, we found that when children perceive low maternal warmth and high antagonism, the link between parental and adolescents <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> increase in size. On the contrary, paternal high warmth and low antagonism influences the relationship between two beliefs. So, results support the current literature in emphasize parental framework as highly influencing the adjusted or misadjusted outcomes...|$|E

Although surgical prevention may be considered in carri-ers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutation, this option cannot be advocated for the major-ity of women whose risk is only moderately increased. In these women, chemoprevention with tamoxifen may reduce the incidence of estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast carcinoma by 30 – 50 %.

It is better for a measurement of risk {{to take into account}} the historical development of the cash flows or of the market value of the final wealth. Traditional risk measures of the final worth of a position, including TailVar, fail to do this. Using the idea behind the scenarios method, a backward recurrence scheme is used to define risk adjusted values of a future terminal position, at dates closer and closer to the one where risk capital has to be defined; the latter will be the negative of the adjusted value at this initiation date. A specific method, which relates to the idea of price of risk, is presented and applied to several examples: time evolution of risk, comparison of various measures, discrepancy between regulatory and managerial approaches, funding liquidity.

40|$|Background. Experts are {{perceived}} to be veridical and to focus only on objective data when evaluating risk. Only a few research studies have attempted to characterize the subjectivity in risk evaluation among experts. Objective. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} expert evaluation of a pharmaceutical drug can be partly explained by dimensions that describe the drug and by individual characteristics. Design. Seventy-five medical assessors in 9 EU countries evaluated a list of 28 pharmaceutical drugs using 4 scales: risk, benefit, seriousness of harm, and patients' knowledge of the risk. They were also given a mock "clinical dossier'' and asked to rate it on 8 dimensions: risk, benefit, worry, magnitude of the exposure, scientific knowledge of the risk, familiarity of the risk, ethical concerns, and <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Results. Female assessors perceived significantly higher benefits than men for a large number of the 28 drugs. Principal component analysis of the ratings for the clinical dossiers revealed 2 underlying components: seriousness of harm and scientific evidence. A regression model predicting the risk perception of the drug showed that the variables seriousness of harm (benefit, worry, magnitude of exposure, ethical concerns, and <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability),</b> years of regulatory experience, gender, and type of drug explained 54 % of the variability among assessors. Conclusion. Assessors' view of the risks associated with pharmaceutical drugs is influenced by worry for patient safety, magnitude of patient exposure, and ethical concerns. These dimensions may influence their perceptions of benefit and <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Senior assessors are more risk averse than junior assessors, and female assessors seem to be sensitive to the promise of benefit from medicines and consequently may be less risk averse than male assessors...|$|E

Recognition that introduced marine species are an issue at state, national and international levels exists; yet often marine protected area management plans do not reflect this recognition. Therefore, we hypothesise {{that there is a}} lack of translation of concern regarding introduced marine species as a risk into tactical objectives within marine protected area management plans. This may be due to low stakeholder perceptions of the risk posed by introduced marine species. Survey respondents had a high level (89 %) of self-rated awareness ofintroduced marine species and they also indicated (93 %) a willingness to support management interventions to prevent, or control the spread of introduced marine species in Western Australia. Our results also indicate that gender (males) and age (18 – 45 age group) influenced respondents’ {{perception of}} risk (impact) of IMS, yet no examined demographic variables influenced respondents <b>acceptability</b> of <b>risk.</b> Furthermore, knowledge of introduced marine species, education level, and income variables did not influence respondents’ perception of <b>risk</b> (impact or <b>acceptability).</b> Understanding demographic characteristics that influence participants perceptions related to introduced marine species can be useful for targeted, educational initiatives to reduce the likelihood of IMS incursions.

Research on second trimester abortion worldwide {{has focused on}} a range of associated factors including <b>risks</b> and <b>acceptability</b> of abortion methods, and characteristics and decision-making of women seeking the procedure. Scholarship to date has not adequately addressed the embodied physicality of second trimester abortion, from the perspective of women’s lived experiences, nor how these experiences might inform future framings of abortion. To progress understandings of women’s embodied experiences of second trimester abortion, we draw on the accounts of 18 women who had recently sought second trimester abortion in Scotland. We address four aspects of their experiences: later recognition of pregnancy; experiences of a second trimester pregnancy which ended in abortion; the “labour” of second trimester abortion; and the subsequent bodily transition. The paper has two key aims: Firstly, to make visible these experiences, and to consider how they relate to dominant sociocultural narratives of pregnancy; and secondly, to explore the concept of “liminality” as one means for interpreting them.

Law invariance is a useful property since in this case the risk functional does not explicitly depend on the event space Ω, and it suffices to know the distribution of the profit variable.

40|$|AbstractRisks are {{associated}} to dangerous {{events that have}} an estimable probability of occurring and some potentially severe consequences. A risk is the potential to cause crisis, an emergency, a disaster and/or a catastrophe. The definition of <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> is not technical but value driven. This definition is determined at two levels: {{at the individual level}} and at the state level. Every citizen decides what kind of risk he is willing to take in his daily life (his choice of transportation, his choice to smoke or to drink alcohol, etc.). The government, on the other side, is setting <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> limits on a societal level (example: speed limits, laws regulating construction areas and density, etc.). The historical experience of a society will affect the way that it view risks and crisis. This article deals with seismic risk perception and communication in Portugal. A survey carried out resourcing to a questionnaire was developed to assess the knowledge on seismic risk perception and awareness in the Algarve region.

METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional study in the red light district of Lausanne for five nights in September of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Clients of FSW were invited to complete a questionnaire in the street assessing demographic characteristics, attitudes to HIV risk and HIV testing history. All clients interviewed were then offered anonymous finger stick rapid HIV testing in a van parked on-site. RESULTS: The authors interviewed 112, 127 and 79 clients in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. All were men, average age 32 - 37 years old; 40 - 60 % were in a stable relationship. History of unprotected sex was higher with non-commercial partners (33 - 50 %) than with FSW (6 - 11 %); 29 - 46 % of clients had never undergone an HIV test.

40|$|The risk {{acceptance}} is a problematic issue associated with risk assessment in occupational environments. It {{is essential that}} the organizations define how the occupational risk can be minimized {{in order to obtain}} an acceptable level, being the definition of the acceptance criteria fundamental. Considering the scarcity of previous work concerning the current criteria used by the organizations, this paper aims to discuss the occupational <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> problematic through a literature review. This work shows that the <b>risk</b> <b>acceptability</b> can be defined as the accepted risk level for a specific dangerous situation. Considering that the risk decision is influenced by several variables and that companies define their own acceptance criteria, these can vary considerably between companies. Previous studies shown that, the application of different criteria to the same risk situation can lead to different decisions about risk. Therefore, some authors have advocated for the government intervention in the criteria formulation, through the publication of specific legislation. Currently, different sciences have defined distinct criteria. According to Health and Safety Executive, the criteria used by the regulators in the health, safety and environment areas can be classified in three “pure” criteria: equity-based, utility-based and technology-based. Among the presented criteria, the first two have been often considered. These criteria are frequently presented in terms of limits and, typically, they express the probability and the consequences of a dangerous event. The acceptance criteria shall be based on a measure of the risk of occupational accidents. Currently, there are several risk measures available, so, it is important to choose the most appropriate. This paper tries to address the importance of the definition of acceptance criteria, considering that, its inadequate definition and use, may promote an incorrect decision about occupational risk. Therefore, it seems to be important to study which criteria the organizations consider the most appropriate according to their specific needs...|$|E

The study contends that control effectiveness is more useful and beneficial than L x C alone in determining ‘acceptable’ risk. This hypothesis is substantiated by the development of an alternative model, Major Accident Control Analysis (MACA), based around the prevention of fatalities by exploring and quantifying the following control parameters: 1) controls pre and/or post event, 2) the control type, and 3) the effectiveness of the specific control. By assigning these control parameters, discrete values, comparisons between individual ‘risk’ scenarios and established numerical <b>acceptability</b> <b>risk</b> criteria are possible. The theoretical proposition of this research was tested using detailed case studies to highlight the flaws of conventional risk analysis and, instead, accentuate control effectiveness as a superior method for prioritising <b>risk</b> and determine <b>acceptability.</b> The results of the research demonstrate that control effectiveness, utilised by the MACA method, is particularly valuable when limited data is available to permit quantification, data is too generalised for the operating conditions and where qualitative risk estimates are insufficient and inappropriate to prevent fatalities. MACA employs mathematically valid algorithms previously not envisaged nor developed by earlier methodologies. Importantly, these algorithms enable an interchangeable conversion of control effectiveness ‘values’ to risk ‘values’. Beyond the immediate findings of the research, the additional benefits of control effectiveness are multiple. The principles are suitable to the dynamic nature of the minerals industry, yet are highly adaptable and can be readily applied beyond the field of mining. The methodology could be applied to any circumstance where traditional risk analysis is typically undertaken, thus demonstrating broader application and significance. Furthermore, the methodology is compatible with, and complementary to, existing risk approaches. The intrinsic flexibility offered by this alternative method makes provision for international variations of risk criteria used to determine ‘acceptability’. It is thus determined that the application of control effectiveness estimation offers benefits over and beyond those currently employed...|$|R
