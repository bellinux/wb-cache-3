5|$|The first {{road that}} entered Wheeling was a post <b>road</b> <b>completed</b> in 1794 that {{connected}} Wheeling to Morgantown. The National Road {{was the first}} interstate <b>road,</b> <b>completed</b> in 1818, that connected Wheeling to Cumberland, Maryland. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created in 1926, the National Road was designated U.S. Route40. The I-70 designation {{was brought to the}} Northern Panhandle {{with the passage of the}} Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, and it was built as a controlled-access highway, bypassing portions of the old National Road. The first portions of I-70 in West Virginia were opened in 1963, and construction was completed in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Construction on I-225 {{began in}} May 1964 at Interstate 70. A section from Colfax Avenue to Sixth Avenue was opened in 1966. Five years later, a segment between Mississippi Avenue and Parker Road was opened, and {{construction}} began on another segment south of Parker <b>Road,</b> <b>completed</b> in May 1975. The {{rest of the}} route between Yosemite Street and Interstate 25 was completed in May 1976.|$|E
5|$|Vukassovich was {{instrumental}} in development of transport infrastructure in the present-day Croatian Littoral at {{the shores of the}} Adriatic Sea. His most significant contributions in the field were construction of roads after his designs. The first one was GospićKarlobag road, also known as Theresiana <b>road,</b> <b>completed</b> between 1784 and 1786which replaced an earlier route which comprised very steep grades limiting its capacity. The new road permitted setting up of a free port in Karlobag and significantly improved connection to the seaward slopes of Velebit. Currently, the route largely corresponds to the western section of the D25 road. The other major route Vukassovich designed was the Louisiana road between Karlovac and Rijeka with a branch serving Bakar. The road was built between 1803 and 1811, and the route is now used by the D3 road. Vukassovich also designed a coastal road between Senj and Sveti Juraj, port structures in Senj, and directed reconstruction of the Josephina road leading from Senj to Karlovac.|$|E

5|$|The {{first part}} of the Baltimore Beltway to be {{completed}} was in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore Beltway would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 finished in 1962. At this time, the original length of the Baltimore Beltway, from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first beltway in the United States built under the Interstate Highway System. A segment of the <b>road</b> <b>completed</b> in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, heading toward the Outer Harbor Crossing.|$|E

The Brunswick Community Health Centre, on Glenlyon <b>Road,</b> <b>completed</b> in the late 1980s, presents a collection of eclectic, differently coloured forms juxtaposed on a small site. It was designed by Melbourne architecture firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall, who have since become internationally prominent.|$|E

25|$|The Santa Fe Railway {{still wanted}} to reach California on its own rails (it leased the SP line from Needles to Barstow), {{and the state of}} California eagerly courted the {{railroad}} to break SP's monopoly. In 1897 the railroad traded the Sonora Railway of Mexico to SP for their line between Needles and Barstow, giving AT its own line from Chicago to the Pacific coast. It was unique in that regard until the Milwaukee <b>Road</b> <b>completed</b> its extension to Puget Sound in 1909.|$|E
25|$|Traffic jams {{are common}} in the city due to daily {{commuter}} traffic volumes, intercity traffic and excessive winter snow. The construction of freeways such as the Saint Petersburg Ring <b>Road,</b> <b>completed</b> in 2011, and the Western High-Speed Diameter, completed in 2017, helped partially reduce the traffic in the city. The controversial M11, {{also known as the}} Moscow-Saint Petersburg Motorway, would connect Saint Petersburg and Moscow by a freeway and is expected to be completed before the Russia FIFA World Cup 2018. Construction has started in 2010 and the first sections of the freeway was finished in 2014 and 2015.|$|E

25|$|The Dinaric {{mountain}} ranges of Lika and Gorski Kotar in the region's western reaches represent a natural barrier between the Adriatic Sea to its {{west and the}} Pannonian Basin and to its east, traversed by few high-performance transport routes until recently. The region was first spanned by a trading route between Senj and Pannonia in classical antiquity and later in Middle Ages, but the first modern road in the area was the Caroline <b>road,</b> <b>completed</b> in 1732 connecting Rijeka and Karlovac via Fužine, Mrkopalj, Ravna Gora and Vrbovsko, and named after Charles VI who ordered its construction. The same emperor commissioned construction of a narrow road between Karlobag and Gospićthe first to span Velebit. Those first roads were replaced by the more modern Josephina connecting Karlovac to Senj, largely tracing the Roman trading route across the Vratnik pass, and the Theresiana following a different route between Karlobag and Gospić, completed in 1779 and 1784 respectively. In 1789, a road to Dalmatia, branching from the Josephine road at Žuta Lokva towards Gračac via Gospić. Louisiana road was completed in 1809, also running between Rijeka and Karlovac, although via Delnice. The first railway built in the region was the Zagreb Rijeka railway, completed in 1875. Since the 2000s, the region is spanned by modern motorways.|$|E
25|$|Reconstruction of {{the main}} lanes and {{frontage}} roads to handle increased traffic began in 1982 just north of downtown. No lanes were added south of I-610, but the eight-lane cross section, with room for a transitway, was continued north as construction progressed. Work was completed south of Airline Drive (exit 53) in about 1985, to Shepherd Drive (exit 56B) in 1987, and to Farm to Market Road 525 (exit 60A) in 1990; this last opening allowed the transitway to extend to just south of FM 525. The Hardy Toll <b>Road,</b> <b>completed</b> on June 28, 1988 between I-610 and I-45 near The Woodlands, added capacity {{to that part of}} the corridor, and in 1990 reconstruction was completed on a short piece of I-45 from the toll road into The Woodlands. Reconstruction continued from FM 525, reaching Airtex Boulevard (exit 63) in 1997, including part of the Sam Houston Tollway interchange (completed in 2003) and a transitway extension, Cypresswood Drive (exit 68) in 1998, extending the transit way to its present terminus, and the Hardy Toll Road (exit 72) in 2003. Work on the section through The Woodlands to Research Forest Drive (exit 77) was completed in 2001, including a direct connection to Woodlands Parkway, and in 2003 work was completed to Farm to Market Road 1488 (exit 81). Construction is now complete between FM 1488 (Exit 81) to the Walker County line near milepost 100 just south of the northbound truck weigh station and New Waverly, near State Highway 75 (exit 98).|$|E
500|$|After {{the park}} was well {{established}} and visitors began to rely more on automobiles, work was begun on the [...] long Going-to-the-Sun <b>Road,</b> <b>completed</b> in 1932. Also known simply as the Sun Road, the road bisects the park {{and is the only}} route that ventures deep into the park, going over the Continental Divide at Logan Pass, [...] at the midway point. The Sun Road is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places and in 1985 was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Another route, along the southern boundary between the park and National Forests, is US Route 2, which crosses the Continental Divide at Marias Pass and connects the towns of West Glacier and East Glacier.|$|E

500|$|On June 5, 1799, Asa Danforth Jr. began {{construction}} eastward from Toronto {{on a road}} {{which was}} to extend the Governor's Road through Port Hope and to the Trent River. That <b>road,</b> <b>completed</b> in 1801, would be described by acting surveyor general William Chewett to be [...] "good" [...] {{for use in the}} dead of winter but [...] "impassible" [...] during the wet summers, when the path turned to a bottomless mud pit. It would be extended in 1802 to reach the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (now Glenora) and a ferry crossing established to Adolphustown. The Bath extension of the Danforth Road (1802) provided access to a key early colonial road, the Bath Road, which had long joined Bath to Kingston.|$|E

500|$|Unrelated to the BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard, the {{commission}} constructed a [...] wide macadam road from Glen Burnie to Brooklyn, {{which was then}} in Anne Arundel County, in 1915. In Brooklyn, the new highway connected with {{the south end of}} the Light Street Bridge that crossed the Patapsco River into Baltimore. With a <b>road</b> <b>completed</b> from Annapolis to Baltimore, the roads commission suggested that it should not be required to complete a road between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The commission asked the Maryland General Assembly to pass a bill releasing {{the commission}} from the responsibility of completing the highway from Glen Burnie to South Baltimore. However, the Maryland General Assembly disagreed with the Maryland State Roads Commission and passed a bill in 1914 requiring the commission to finish the boulevard between Glen Burnie and South Baltimore. The BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard north from Glen Burnie to Baltimore was finished in 1916. The final gap in the BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard was filled when the first modern Severn River Bridge was completed in 1924. This [...] concrete bridge, which had a roadway width of [...] and a steel bascule draw with a horizontal clearance of , replaced a narrow one-lane bridge.
