For high-level synthesis to be efficient it has to estimate the effect that a given algorithmic decision (e. g., scheduling, allocation) {{will have on the}} final hardware implementation (after logic <b>synthesis).</b> Currently, <b>this</b> effect cannot be measured accurately because the CD-FGs are very distinct from the RTL/gate-level models used by logic synthesis, precluding interaction between high-level <b>and</b> logic <b>synthesis.</b> <b>This</b> paper presents a solution to this problem consisting of a novel internal model for synthesis which spans the domains of high-level <b>and</b> logic <b>synthesis.</b> <b>This</b> model is an RTL/gate-level network capable of representing all possible schedules that a given behavior may assume.

40|$|Abstract — A general {{framework}} is proposed for behavior modeling, analysis <b>and</b> <b>synthesis.</b> <b>This</b> allows {{a better understanding}} and evaluation {{of the nature and}} role of behavior models in the following disciplines: ethology, robot behavior specification, animated character behavior specification, and automatic behavior analysis. In addition, it is argued that the following aspects of a system’s behavior usefully characterize behavior models: (1) physical, (2) physiological, (3) contextual, and (4) conceptual. We demonstrate how basic behavior units can be extracted from time sequence data of a synthetic two-state problem. This is done by detecting Basic Behavior Units using the affinity graph method, and then determining higher level behavior model parameters based on these. I...|$|R
