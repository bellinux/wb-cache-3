5|$|Blamey {{joined the}} Australian Army as a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> in 1906, and {{attended}} the Staff College at Quetta. During the First World War {{he participated in}} the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, {{and served as a}} staff officer in the Gallipoli Campaign, where he was mentioned in despatches for a daring raid behind enemy lines. He later served on the Western Front, where he distinguished himself in the planning for the Battle of Pozières. He rose to the rank of brigadier general, and served as {{chief of staff of the}} Australian Corps under Lieutenant General Sir John Monash, who credited him as a factor in the Corps' success in the Battle of Hamel, the Battle of Amiens and the Battle of the Hindenburg Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{army was}} {{supported}} by the Territorial Force, and by reservists. In August 1914, there were three forms of reserves. The Army Reserve of retired soldiers was 145,350 strong. They were paid 3Shillings and 6pence a week (17.5pence) worth about £70 per week in 2013 terms, and had to attend 12 training days per year. The Special Reserve had another 64,000 men and was a form of part-time soldiering, similar to the Territorial Force. A Special Reservist had an initial six months full-time training and was paid the same as a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> during this period; they had three or four weeks training per year thereafter. The National Reserve had some 215,000 men, who were on a register that was maintained by Territorial Force County Associations; these men had military experience, but no other reserve obligation.|$|E

25|$|It {{was found}} that {{grappling}} hooks were needed to climb the fort's walls, but despite this and stubborn resistance by the pirates, who defended themselves with rifles, grenades, spears and stones, the Spaniards managed to scale the walls and enter the fort. Some 25 pirates were killed inside, while another 30 or 40 dove {{into the water and}} were drowned or killed by the fire from the Spanish feluccas and armed boats. 14 artillery pieces were taken. The Spanish losses amounted to 5 <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> and two auxiliaries killed and about 50 wounded, including two colonels, José María Pañarada and Cayetano Figuera.|$|E
25|$|While Presley {{was serving}} in Germany, Parker was {{hard at work}} keeping his name known to the public. He {{realized}} that by keeping RCA, and more importantly the public, hungry for more Presley material, {{he would be able}} to negotiate a better contract for him when he returned from active service. He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction, guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period. RCA was eager for Presley to record in Germany, but Parker insisted that it would ruin his reputation as a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> if he was able to go into a recording studio and sing. Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country. All of these stories were fabrications, but it kept his name in view of the public.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier.</b> Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E

500|$|John Profumo {{was born}} in 1915, of Italian descent. He first entered Parliament in 1940 as the Conservative member for Kettering, while serving with the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, and {{combined}} his political and military duties through the Second World War. He lost his seat in the 1945 general election, but was elected in 1950 for Stratford-on-Avon. From 1951 he held junior ministerial office in successive Conservative administrations. In 1960, Macmillan promoted him to Secretary of State for War, a senior post outside the cabinet. [...] After his marriage in 1954 to Valerie Hobson, one of Britain's leading film actresses, he may have conducted casual affairs, using late-night parliamentary sittings as his cover. Profumo's tenure as war minister coincided with a period of transition in the armed forces, involving the end of conscription {{and the development of}} a wholly professional army. His performance was watched with a critical eye by his opposition counterpart George Wigg, a former <b>regular</b> <b>soldier.</b>|$|E
500|$|Within the 6th Division, {{there were}} recriminations over what {{was seen as}} Berryman showing {{favouritism}} towards Robertson, a fellow <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> and Royal Military College, Duntroon graduate, {{in an effort to}} prove that regular officers could command troops. Savige felt that some of the difficulties of the 17th Infantry Brigade were caused by Berryman, through an over-prescriptive and complicated battle plan. The 6th Division was fortunate to have drawn a [...] "set piece" [...] type of battle, the type that most suited its Great War-based doctrine and training. Confidence and experience was generated and leaders and staffs took away important tactical lessons from the battle. The Australian official historian, Gavin Long considered Bardia [...] "a victory for bold reconnaissance, for audacious yet careful planning, for an artillery scheme which subdued the enemy's fire at the vital time, and a rapid and continuing infantry assault which broke a gap in the enemy's line." [...] To attribute success to the tanks or artillery was [...] "to present Hamlet without the prince." ...|$|E
500|$|While in Friedberg, Presley met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu. They would {{eventually}} marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla says that despite his worries {{that it would}} ruin his career, Parker convinced Presley that to gain popular respect, he should serve his country as a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> rather than in Special Services, where {{he would have been}} able to give some musical performances and remain in touch with the public. Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared for his two-year hiatus. Armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases. Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top 40 hits, including [...] "Wear My Ring Around Your Neck", the best-selling [...] "Hard Headed Woman", and [...] "One Night" [...] in 1958, and [...] "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" [...] and the number one [...] "A Big Hunk o' Love" [...] in 1959. RCA also generated four albums compiling old material during this period, most successfully Elvis' Golden Records (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer {{wrote that}} the plot was much more {{grounded}} and realistic than other recent titles in the series and echoed Push Squares review by commenting on the gameplay, writing [...] "You're not a super soldier {{stuck in the middle}} of out-of-this-world set piece, but rather a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> working with a squad to complete objectives." [...] However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from the original was both refreshing and a hindrance; he highlighted examples from the campaign, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, and similarly condemned infamous perks and a lack of killstreak-countering in the multiplayer that had not been removed or fixed, finding it [...] "extremely outdated". Despite this, he complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying [...] "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's nice {{to get back to the}} basics". He heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster. [...] It's a stunning overhaul." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "What Raven has accomplished is impressive, but it has its limits. A few tweaks would have gone a long way to fixing some balancing issues, but for those looking for a blast from the past, this works just fine".|$|E
2500|$|Schroeter's fifth {{enlistment}} as a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> {{started on}} November 24, 1886, at Denver, Colorado, as written by Lieutenant Borden.

He served with the 9th Infantry Regiment, in C Company. The record shows this as his sixth enlistment, if his service in the Missouri volunteers during the Civil War is included. For many [...] "Post Returns" [...] or monthly roster reports, Schroeter was listed as a clerk serving with the headquarters company.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the storm}} had abated, the men built a raft from planks and barrels and sent two men to shore. The raft broke up in the waves, and both men drowned. After making a second, more solid, raft, the others {{were able to make}} it safely to shore. Over the next few days they {{returned}} to the ship daily to retrieve cargo, managing to salvage some of La Salle's papers and clothes, barrels of flour, casks of wine, glass beads, and other trade items. Before long, however, a strong southerly wind drove the hull into the muddy bottom, and soon only the rear deck remained above water. Of the 27people originally assigned to the ship, the only survivors were Tessier, a priest, a military officer, a <b>regular</b> <b>soldier,</b> a servant girl, and a small boy. They remained on the peninsula for three months, as the only way to the fort was to walk through Karankawa territory. [...] After a small Indian canoe washed ashore one day, the survivors were able to paddle across the bay and return to the fort. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of any assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

2500|$|The denseness of {{the jungle}} {{and the fact that}} they used {{absolutely}} smokeless powder, made it exceedingly difficult to place exactly where they were, and almost immediately Young, who always liked to get as close as possible to his enemy, began to push his troops forward. They were deployed on both sides of the road in such thick jungle that it was only here and there that they could possibly see ahead, and some confusion, of course, ensued, the support gradually getting mixed with the advance. Captain Beck took A Troop of the Tenth in on the left, next to Captain Galbraith's (K) troop of the First; two other troops of the Tenth were on the extreme right. Through the jungle ran wire fences here and there, and as the troops got to the ridge they encountered precipitous heights. They were led most gallantly, as American regular officers always lead their men; and the men followed their leaders with the splendid courage always shown by the American <b>regular</b> <b>soldier.</b> There was not a single straggler among them, and in not one instance was an attempt made by any trooper to fall out in order to assist the wounded or carry back the dead, while so cool were they and so perfect their fire discipline, that in the entire engagement the expenditure of ammunition was not over ten rounds per man. Major Bell, who commanded the squadron, had his leg broken by a shot as he was leading his men. Captain Wainwright succeeded to the command of the squadron. Captain Knox was shot in the abdomen. He continued for some time giving orders to his troops, and refused to allow a man in the firing-line to assist him to the rear. His First Lieutenant, Byram, was himself shot, but continued to lead his men until the wound and the heat overcame him and he fell in a faint. The advance was pushed forward under General Young's eye with the utmost energy, until the enemy's voices could be heard in the entrenchments. The Spaniards kept up a very heavy firing, but the regulars would not be denied, and as they climbed the ridges (on the right side of the Camino Real road going into the village of Las Guasimas from the southeast) the Spaniards broke and fled." ...|$|E
60|$|Next day news reached us by scouts {{from all}} the other laagers.

On their own ground, and among their native scrub, those rude strategists are formidable. They know the country, and how to fight in it. We had nothing to oppose to them but a handful of the new Matabeleland police, an old <b>regular</b> <b>soldier</b> or two, and a raw crowd of volunteers, most of whom, like myself, had never before really handled a rifle.|$|E
