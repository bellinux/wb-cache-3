A method is proposed that allows for a measurement and comparison of fund managers' performance across time and asset portfolios. The measure, the 'Excess Sharpe Ratio' (ESR) involves {{the construction of an}} appropriate benchmark for each fund manager, and then computing the difference between the Sharpe ratio of the manager and that of the benchmark.

Using this measure, it is possible to detect significant persistence of managerial skills of up to 11 years. Also, new light is shed on the relationship of expenses to gross returns-even though firms with higher expenses have higher average gross returns, they in fact achieve this through higher risk-taking. Therefore, their ESR scores and Sharpe ratios are lower than firms with lower expenses. ...|$|E

Also, government policy {{in this area is}} often predicated on simplistic assumptions and methodologies, with little or no empirical evidence of the impacts of superannuation taxation arrangements on retirement wealth and the adequacy of default superannuation plans. This “baseline” study fills this gap in the literature by providing evidence about the prospect of a representative member of a complying superannuation fund in Australia, on retirement, having sufficient accumulated superannuation to adequately fund their retirement under current taxation arrangements. We assume the fund utilises a typical default asset allocation, and we use a bootstrap simulation approach to generate <b>relevant</b> <b>asset</b> returns. We compare a representative retiree’s terminal wealth at vesting age with a nominal retirement wealth target.

40|$|Sustainability can be {{understood}} as the concept of being in business permanently. This interpretation leads to an 'attitude' based on long-term thinking and value-driven activities to realise organisational benefits. The key basis for sustainable management processes in our knowledge-driven economy is formed by organisational knowledge and learning processes. But how can a manager with such an attitude concretely implement sustainability in his strategic work? What are the main assets in his specific organisation? How does the roadmap for the sustainability strategy - optimised for his organisation - look like? This paper provides answers and offers with the Kiel maturity model an innovative approach for practitioners with a scientific underpinning. It aims to facilitate the implementation of an individualised knowledge management as the main asset that focuses on organisational learning. In our knowledge-based society, the importance of organisational knowledge and learning strongly increases.

40|$|Adaptive {{security}} systems aim to protect valuable {{assets in the}} face of changes in their operational environment. They do so by monitoring and analysing this environment, and deploying security functions that satisfy some protection (security, privacy, or forensic) requirements. In this paper, we suggest that a key characteristic for engineering adaptive security is the topology of the operational environment, which represents a physical and/or a digital space - including its structural relationships, such as containment, proximity, and reachability. For adaptive security, topology expresses a rich representation of context that can provide a system with both structural and semantic awareness of important contextual characteristics. These include the location of assets being protected or the proximity of potentially threatening agents that might harm them. Security-related actions, such as the physical movement of an actor from a room to another in a building, may be viewed as topological changes. The detection of a possible undesired topological change (such as an actor possessing a safe’s key entering the room where the safe is located) may lead to the decision to deploy a particular security control to protect the <b>relevant</b> <b>asset.</b> This position paper advocates topology awareness for more effective engineering of adaptive security. By monitoring changes in topology at runtime one can identify new or changing threats and attacks, and deploy adequate security controls accordingly.

40|$|Although the 2 ̆ 2 {{technological}} {{arms race}} 2 ̆ 2 has recently {{emerged as a}} vogue-ish piece of legal terminology, scholarship has quite conspicuously failed to explore the phenomenon systematically. What are 2 ̆ 2 technological 2 ̆ 2 arms races? Why do they happen? Does the recent spike in scholarly attention actually reflect their novelty? Are they always inefficient? How do they differ from military ones? What role can legal institutions play in slowing them down? In this Article I seek to answer these questions. I argue that copyright enforcement and self-help represent substitutable tactics for regulating access to expressive assets, and that the efficacy of each tactic depends on the particular audience profile consuming the <b>relevant</b> <b>asset.</b> Authors can most cost-effectively manage access through a mixture of these two tactics.

The research work within this Thesis aims to contribute to improve employees' selfawareness and auto-regulation; two predominant research areas are also studied and analyzed: Visual Analytics and Gamification. The Visual Analytics enables the specification of personalized dashboard interfaces with alerts and indicators to keep employees aware of their skills and to continuously monitor how to improve their expertise, promoting simultaneously behavioral change and adoption of good-practices. The study of Gamification techniques with Talent Management features enabled the design of new processes to engage, motivate, and retain highly productive employees, and to foster a competitive working environment, where employees are encouraged to be involved in new and rewarding activities, where knowledge and experience are recognized as a <b>relevant</b> <b>asset.</b> The Design Science Research was selected as the research methodology; the creation of new knowledge is therefore based on an iterative cycle addressing concepts such as design, analysis, reflection, and abstraction.

40|$|The model {{developed}} here {{provides an}} enhancement {{of the traditional}} DCF asset acquisition valuation template, in Excel. It provides a relatively transparent and user-friendly yet flexible risk-adjusted valuation of a subject individual acquisition, structured to consider the asset either as a core asset or a value-add asset. This study applies a basic stock flow model of space market dynamics {{to address the question}} of covariance among input variables. The model is designed with optional probabilistic inputs and historical data for the local space market (employment, rents, net rentable area, occupied space, new completions, vacancy and absorption) and the asset market (cap rates history) to produce a 15 -year forecast for the relevant space and asset market for the subject property. An optional optimal rent module in the model uses the forecasted cap rates and consequent opportunity cost of capital to arrive at optimal asking rents for the subject property. The existing rent roll is combined with the future rents and vacancies along with asset level projections of operating costs and capital expenditures to arrive at the cash flow projections. Renewal probability and probability to lease up are major differentiating factors between the core and value add asset. The model also enables the user to optionally consider how flexibility in resale timing can improve the overall return performance from a probabilistic perspective. The output of the model includes an apprehension of the entire going-in risk return relationship, depicted relative to a relevant security market line generated by the input risk free interest rate and the opportunity cost of capital in the <b>relevant</b> <b>asset</b> market.

40|$|The {{extractive}} industry {{is characterized by}} high levels of risk and uncertainty. These attributes create challenges when applying traditional accounting concepts (such as the revenue recognition and matching concepts) to the preparation of financial statements in the industry. The International Accounting Standards Board (2010) states that the objective of general purpose financial statements is to provide useful financial information to assist the capital allocation decisions of existing and potential providers of capital. The usefulness of information is defined as being relevant and faithfully represented so as to best aid in the investment decisions of capital providers. Value relevance research utilizes adaptations of the Ohlson (1995) to assess the attribute of value relevance which is {{one part of the}} attributes resulting in useful information. This study firstly examines the value relevance of the financial information disclosed in the financial reports of extractive firms. The findings reveal that the value relevance of information disclosed in the financial reports depends on the circumstances of the firm including sector, size and profitability. Traditional accounting concepts such as the matching concept can be ineffective when applied to small firms who are primarily engaged in nonproduction activities that involve significant levels of uncertainty such as exploration activities or the development of sites. Standard setting bodies such as the International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board have addressed the financial reporting challenges in the {{extractive industry}} by allowing a significant amount of accounting flexibility in industryspecific accounting standards, particularly in relation to the accounting treatment of exploration and evaluation expenditure. Therefore, secondly this study examines whether the choice of exploration accounting policy has an effect on the value relevance of information disclosed in the financial reports. The findings show that, in general, the Successful Efforts method produces value relevant information in the financial reports of profitable extractive firms. However, specifically in the oil & gas sector, the Full Cost method produces value <b>relevant</b> <b>asset</b> disclosures if the firm is lossmaking. This indicates that investors in production and non-production orientated firms have different information needs and these needs cannot be simultaneously fulfilled by a single accounting policy. In the mining sector, a preference by large profitable mining companies towards a more conservative policy than either the Full Cost or Successful Efforts methods does not result in more value relevant information being disclosed in the financial reports. This finding supports the fact that the qualitative characteristic of prudence is a form of bias which has a downward effect on asset values. The third aspect of this study is an examination of the effect of corporate governance on the value relevance of disclosures made in the financial reports of extractive firms. The findings show that the key factor influencing the value relevance of financial information is the ability of the directors to select accounting policies which reflect the economic substance of the particular circumstances facing the firms in an effective way. Corporate governance is found to have an effect on value relevance, particularly in the oil & gas sector. However, there is {{no significant difference between the}} exploration accounting policy choices made by directors of firms with good systems of corporate governance and those with weak systems of corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} seigniorage in a deregulated {{economy of}} currency and deposits, where {{competition in the}} banking sector is imperfect. Much {{of the literature on}} seigniorage analysis central bank revenue due to its power to create money, thus neglecting the existence of a banking sector. These studies consider only the inflation tax on currency (fiat or base money), ignoring demand for deposits. However in a world with a banking system, a substantial part of money balances takes the form of deposits held at commercial banks. The presence of a banking industry thus potentially changes the government revenues due to the desire of the private sector to hold real balances. This realization is the main topic of this paper. One key element that many studies on the macroeconomic foundations of bank behaviour and money supply process share in common is the assumption that the extent of rivalry in banking markets is a fixed parameter; i. e. the number and relative size of bank rivals in <b>relevant</b> <b>asset</b> markets has been taken exogenously determined. This assumption of a fixed level of market rivalry has been a reasonable one to make on empirical grounds. However, the recent trends toward deregulation of the banking industry are producing an environment in which the extent of rivalry among banks is likely to adjust freely to prevailing market conditions. Hence {{there is a need to}} rethink the behaviour of banks. This paper recognized this by assuming an imperfect competition in the banking sector and used model patterned closely upon the work of Vanhoose (1988), Barltensperger and Jordan (1997), Dasupta and Stiglitz (1981), and Saving (1977, 1979) to anlalyze the division of seigniorage between the central bank and the banking industry. In such deregulated market, banks behave oilgopolistically in an environment, where entry and exit are freely permitted. The fundamental proposition of our model is that with competition being imperfect, banks are able to set interest rates on deposits below their zero profit competitive levels. The central bank then has to share seigniorage, at least to some extent, with the issuers of deposits. The model is also used to analyze the comparative static effects of changes in inflation (interest) rate, reserve requirements, competition and technology on the division of seigniorage and some other qualitative issues raised by the presence of banking sector. Seigniorage also induces welfare loss, so the paper also looks at the possibility for the central bank to increase its revenues without increasing the existing welfare loss. The main conclusions of the study are that total seigniorage decreases with the degree of competition in the banking industry and financial innovation and increases with the interest rate and reserve ratio. The lower the level of competition and reserve ratio and the more advanced the payment transaction technology, the greater the share of seigniorage going to the banking sector. In addition, from the public finance point of view, it is optimal for the central bank to reduce bank seigniorage as far as possible, because bank seigniorage has no direct utility for the public. Therefore to enhance welfare, bank seigniorage should be eliminated completely Finally, a given amount of seigniorage revenue can be collected at either a high or a low rate of inflation. Therefore as a background to the main subject of the paper, we first demonstrate the existence of the double equilibria in a simple model in which money is the only source of deficit financing. We show that under rational expectations the high inflation equilibrium is stable and low inflation equilibrium unstable; under adaptive expectations it may be the low inflation equilibrium that is stable.

Governments {{have long}} been engaged in providing goods or services to their citizens that could, in some form, be provided by the private sector.
