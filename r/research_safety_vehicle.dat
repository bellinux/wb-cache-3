40|$|Abstract. For {{improve the}} driving {{safety and the}} {{technology}} development of inter-vehicle communication, the communication system of supply two vehicles based on GPS, wireless LAN and embedded technology was researched and designed. The system could send/receive driving data information between two vehicles, and display the necessary information on LCD for drivers. In the paper, {{the process of the}} system been researched and designed was described. Two applications based on the system were proposed. The system was not only to achieve the desired functionality, but also made foundation for later research. It had great practical value, and very important for technologies <b>research</b> of <b>vehicle</b> <b>safety</b> and intelligent transportation systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of the model year on crashes and injuries, where the latter were of the mild to moderate variety, independent of other driver or vehicle factors and travel exposure. Previous <b>research</b> on <b>vehicle</b> <b>safety</b> design has focused on fatal or serious injuries but, for traffic safety evaluations in smaller jurisdictions and over limited time frames, a more numerous-outcome variable must be used. The study was conducted with over 32 000 driver–vehicle combinations. Binary logistic regression was employed to estimate the effects of the model year ranges on injuries and driving exposure, while controlling the other factors. A salutory effect of increasing the model year on the injury risk was found but this was countered by the increased travel associated with the newer vehicles...|$|R

40|$|CHDS State/LocalThe {{threat of}} public <b>safety</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{being used by}} criminals or terrorists to commit violent acts is real. The problem is public <b>safety</b> <b>vehicles</b> are {{vulnerable}} to criminal activity and terrorist use {{because they do not}} routinely utilize security technology measures involving three core aspects: theft prevention, authentication to specific operators (authorized use), and ability to track and recover public <b>safety</b> <b>vehicles</b> that get into the wrong hands. Consequences from such acts create great risk for the publics safety, including significant injury and loss of human life, as well as exposure to financial liabilities in the form of lost equipment, damage to property, and lawsuit settlements. This thesis provides a model solution to agencies for securing emergency response vehicles with engineering (SERVE). The SERVE model was developed by the author and provides a framework for implementing public <b>safety</b> <b>vehicle</b> security enhancements taking the complex interaction between technological fusion, vehicle system integration and end user interface design into account. Tier ITheft Prevention, Tier IIAuthorized Use, Tier IIITracking and Recovery can be implemented in stages, allowing agencies to utilize the technologies based on budgetary restraints and allocation of resources. Lastly, Tier IVHuman Machine Interface emphasizes the importance of the human machine interface by taking into account how technologies and operators communicate to ensure critical task proficiency is not disrupted.
