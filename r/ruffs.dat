5|$|<b>Ruffs</b> were {{formerly}} trapped {{for food}} in England in large numbers; on one occasion, 2,400 were served at Archbishop Neville's enthronement banquet in 1465. The birds were netted while lekking, sometimes being fattened with bread, milk and seed in holding pens before {{preparation for the}} table.|$|E
5|$|The male, {{which plays}} {{no part in}} nesting or chick care, leaves the {{breeding}} grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering <b>ruffs</b> in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since it reduces feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. Male <b>ruffs</b> may {{also be able to}} tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common redshank and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, <b>ruffs</b> and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, and a pair of little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010–2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{black-and-white}} <b>ruffed</b> lemur {{is one of}} {{two species}} in the genus Varecia, the other being the red <b>ruffed</b> lemur (V. rubra). Three subspecies are recognized: the white-belted black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemur (V. v. subcincta), the southern black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemur (V. v. editorum), and the black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemur (V. v. variegata, the nominate subspecies).|$|R

5|$|The <b>ruffed</b> lemur genus, Varecia, is {{a member}} of the family Lemuridae. The extinct genus, Pachylemur most closely resembled the <b>ruffed</b> lemurs but died out after the arrival of humans. The genus Varecia {{contains}} two species, red <b>ruffed</b> lemurs and black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemurs, the latter having three subspecies.|$|R
5|$|Satellite males, about 16% of {{the total}} number, have white or mottled <b>ruffs</b> and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with the females visiting the territories {{occupied}} by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|The face appears wide due to <b>ruffs</b> of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. The {{nose of the}} bobcat is pinkish-red, {{and it has a}} base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} <b>ruffs</b> start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E
50|$|The {{black-and-white}} <b>ruffed</b> lemur (Varecia variegata) is a Critically Endangered {{species of}} <b>ruffed</b> lemur, the more endangered {{one of two}} which are endemic to the island of Madagascar. Despite having a larger range than the red <b>ruffed</b> lemur, it has a much smaller population that is spread out, living in lower population densities and reproductively isolated. It also has less coverage and protection in large national parks than the red <b>ruffed</b> lemur. Three subspecies of black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemur have been recognized since the red <b>ruffed</b> lemur was elevated to species status in 2001.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ruff</b> died on November 19, 2000, at the District of Columbia General Hospital, {{at the age}} of 61, {{following}} a heart attack suffered at his home. At the time of his death, <b>Ruff</b> was part of Vice President Al Gore's legal team in the Florida recount case. <b>Ruff</b> was survived by his wife of 38 years, Susan (Sue) Willis <b>Ruff,</b> as well as his mother, two daughters, two granddaughters, and a half-sister, Carla <b>Ruff.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two other waders can be {{confused}} with the <b>ruff.</b> The juvenile sharp-tailed sandpiper is a little smaller than a juvenile female <b>ruff</b> and has a similar rich orange-buff breast, but the <b>ruff</b> is slimmer with a longer neck and legs, a rounder head, and a much plainer face. The buff-breasted sandpiper also resembles a small juvenile <b>ruff,</b> but even the female <b>ruff</b> is noticeably larger than the sandpiper, with a longer bill, more rotund body and scaly-patterned upperparts.|$|R
5|$|Birds {{returning}} {{north in}} spring across the central Mediterranean appear {{to follow a}} well-defined route. Large concentrations of <b>ruffs</b> form every year at particular stopover sites to feed, and individuals marked with rings or dye reappear in subsequent years. The refuelling sites are closer together than the theoretical maximum travel distance calculated from the mean body mass, and provide evidence of a migration strategy using favoured intermediate sites. The ruff stores fat as a fuel, but unlike mammals, uses lipids as {{the main energy source}} for exercise (including migration) and, when necessary, keeps warm by shivering; however, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms by which they oxidise lipids.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ruffs</b> of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} {{polyandry}} in the ruff {{is the highest}} known for any avian lekking species and for any shorebird. More than half of female <b>ruffs</b> mate with, and have clutches fertilised by, more than one male, and individual females mate with males of both main behavioural morphs more often than expected by chance. In lekking species, females can choose mates without risking the loss of support from males in nesting and rearing chicks, since the males take no part in raising the brood anyway. In the absence of this cost, if polyandry is advantageous, it {{would be expected to}} occur at a higher rate in lekking than among pair-bonded species.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ruff</b> {{grew up in}} New York City. From {{third to}} eighth grade, <b>Ruff</b> {{attended}} a parochial school. He attended Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan; one of his teachers there was the memoirist Frank McCourt. He graduated from Cornell University in 1987. Alison Lurie was one of <b>Ruff's</b> English professors, and she helped <b>Ruff</b> find an agent.|$|R
5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating <b>ruffs</b> intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E
5|$|The heavy toll on {{breeding}} birds, {{together with}} loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, {{meant that the}} species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963. The draining of wetlands from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden {{has resulted in the}} ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country. The use of insecticides and draining of wetlands has led to a {{decrease in the number of}} ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s. There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food. A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including <b>ruffs)</b> in a single year from Lake Chilwa in Malawi.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. <b>Ruffs</b> were {{discarded}} {{in favor}} of wired collars which were called rebatos in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalent}} {{trend of}} Romanticism from the 1820s through the mid-1840s, {{with its emphasis}} on strong emotion as a source of aesthetic experience and its recognition of the picturesque, was reflected in fashion as in other arts. Items of historical dress including neck <b>ruffs,</b> ferronnières (jeweled headbands worn across the forehead), and sleeves based on styles of earlier periods were popular.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the new century, fashionable bodices had high necklines or {{extremely}} low, rounded necklines, and short wings at the shoulders. Separate closed cartwheel <b>ruffs</b> were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or supportasse used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.|$|E

Wolverine hair {{is ideal}} for parka hood <b>ruffs</b> {{because it does not}} collect the frost {{produced}} by breathing, and its long hairs block the wind to prevent frostbite. Wolverine cuffs (on parka) help to warm the wrists. The front and back or side panels of Yup'ik boots are decorated with otter tassels, wolverine yassels, red yarn, and sometimes a string of beads.|$|E
25|$|During the mid 17th century, {{the older}} doublets, <b>ruffs,</b> paned hose, and jerkins were {{replaced}} by the precursor to the three piece suit comprising waistcoat, tight breeches, powdered wig, tricorne hat, and a long coat called a justacorps. This coat, popularised by Louis XIII of France and Charles II of England, was knee length and looser fitting than the later frock coat, with turn-back cuffs and two rows of buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive brocade coats decorated with velvet, gold braid, embroidery, and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.|$|E
25|$|Jewelry {{was also}} popular {{among those that}} could afford it. Necklaces were beaded gold or silver chains and worn in {{concentric}} circles reaching as far down as the waist. <b>Ruffs</b> also had a jewelry attachment such as glass beads, embroidery, gems, brooches or flowers. Belts were a surprising necessity: used either for fashion or more practical purposes. Lower classes wore them almost as tool belts with the upper classes using them as another place to add jewels and gems alike. Scarves, although not often mentioned, {{had a significant impact}} on the Elizabethan style by being a multipurpose piece of clothing. They could be worn on the head to protect desirable pale skin from the sun, warm the neck on a colder day, and accentuate the colour scheme of a gown or whole outfit. The upper class had silken scarves of every color to brighten up an outfit with the gold thread and tassels hanging off of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} <b>ruffed</b> lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red <b>ruffed</b> lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red <b>ruffed</b> lemurs than in black-and-white <b>ruffed</b> lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ruff</b> left Covington & Burling in August 1995 {{to accept}} an {{appointment}} by Mayor Marion Barry to the post of Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia, overseeing 200 city lawyers. <b>Ruff</b> was credited with restoring {{the reputation of the}} office, which had faced criticism after having been beset with a series of problems. <b>Ruff's</b> decision to leave private practice to lead the Corporation Counsel's Office meant an 80% pay cut; <b>Ruff's</b> colleague Lanny A.
