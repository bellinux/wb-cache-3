Clockwise spindle rotation with 20 seconds dwell time allows sufficient plasticity and improved material flow which assisted in achieving welds with prior 30 percent weld gap of the plate thickness. Final welds were made using three rotational speeds and feed rates with sufficient plunging to prevent root defects. Analysis of the results were detailed which include vickers microhardness test, tensile test and metallographic observation to access the suitability of the weld structure. From the set of tool-pins designed, the flare tool-pin gave a well-defined weld nugget with improved stirring at the weld root.

In that case, only one thread can be in the critical section at a time. Therefore, the synchronization itself has ensured that the successful lock acquisition at P1 occurs after lock release by P0. Besides, the S2 -> S3 ordering has to be ensured, since the P0 must propagate the new value of ‘a’ to P1. For the same reason, S5 must occur after S4.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{is part of}} the University of Miami Law Review’s Leading from Below Symposium.

S. district courts to remain a forum for the vindication of the constitutional rights of {{at least some of the}} nation’s millions of prisoners. After Part I’s introduction, Part II summarizes in several charts the PLRA’s sharp impact on the prevalence and outcomes of prison litigation, but demonstrates that there are still many cases and situations in which courts continue to play a role. Part III looks at three methods by which plaintiffs and defendants can jointly obtain injunctive- type relief in prison cases—by crafting stipulations that comply with the PLRA’s constraints, by structuring the relief as a conditional dismissal, or by setting up the possibility of state-court enforcement. Part IV examines plaintiffs’ coping methods for the PLRA’s provisions that ease the path to termination of decrees, whether litigated or by consent. Two types of preparation for a termination motion have emerged: First, the parties sometimes agree to stretch out the remediation period more than the PLRA’s default two years. Second, plaintiffs have worked to ensure that they are collecting sufficient information to inform their potentially hurried response to a termination motion. It is my hope that the examples presented below can help counsel and judges in prisoners’ <b>rights</b> cases <b>thread</b> the needle that the PLRA presents. More theoretically, the examples demonstrate that litigation tactics and procedures are dynamic—that rule changes affect the parties’ bargaining positions but rarely eliminate bargaining altogether...|$|R

It is thus inevitable to investigate the behaviour of parallel programs and develop methods that help improving their performance. The software developer should {{not have to worry about}} how to map parallelism to the underlying architecture, but should instead concentrate on exposing the parallelism and leave the mapping task to the runtime system. In this project, the behaviour of parallel programs in the presence of workload is investigated. It is shown that choosing the <b>right</b> number of <b>threads</b> for an application is crucial to achieve the best performance possible when there is other workload running on the system.

40|$|The {{concept of}} task already exists in many {{parallel}} programming models.

However, in many task-based parallel programming models, choosing the <b>right</b> number of <b>threads</b> is still key to performance. Hence, the onus {{is on the}} programmer to decide {{not only about the}} number of tasks, but also about the optimal number of threads in order to get good performance. In this paper, we aim to show that desirable performance can be achieved by only focusing on tasks. For this purpose, we compare a purely task-centric parallel programming model called GPRM with three popular approaches (OpenMP, Intel Cilk Plus, and TBB) on two modern many core systems, the Tilera TILEPro 64 and Intel Xeon Phi, which have respectively 64 and 60 physical cores integrated into a single chip. We have chosen three benchmarks with different characteristics to show that a task-centric approach such as GPRM can facilitate parallel programming while it outperforms other models in most cases. It does so by controlling only the number of tasks, rather than having to tune the number of threads...|$|R
5000|$|Inkpot (sumitsubo 墨壺), The sumitsubo is {{used for}} marking long {{straight}} lines onto various surfaces. A thread (tsuboito) is tied to a rounded piece of wood with a needle fixed at the end (karuko). The {{other end of the}} thread is passed through the small opening {{at the end of the}} sumitsubo (itoguchi), through the depression containing ink (ike) and wound around a spool (itomaki-guruma). The ink is stored in the ike soaked in silk wadding. Silk threads are used as tsuboito. To draw a line, the sumitsubo is held in the left hand and the karuko's needle is fixed onto the surface determining the position of one end of the thread. The sumitsubo is gradually moved away from the karuko until the required length of the thread is unreeled at which point the rotation of the spool is stopped using the thumb. With the index finger the thread is pressed down at the required end point of the line. Using the <b>right</b> hand, the <b>thread</b> is pulled upwards into tension and then suddenly released, consequently hitting the surface and leaving a straight line of ink onto any surface, regardless of any surface irregularities.|$|R
40|$|Extracting {{performance}} from modern parallel architectures requires that applications {{be divided into}} many different threads of execution. Unfortunately selecting the appropriate number of threads for an application is a daunting task. Having too many threads can quickly saturate shared resources, such as cache capacity or memory bandwidth, thus degrading performance. On the other hand, having too few threads makes inefficient use of the resources available. Beyond static resource assignment, the program inputs and dynamic system state (e. g., what other applications are executing in the system) can {{have a significant impact}} on the <b>right</b> number of <b>threads</b> to use for a particular application. To address this problem we present the Thread Tailor, a dynamic system that automatically adjusts the number of threads in an application to optimize system efficiency. The Thread Tailor leverages offline analysis to estimate what type of threads will exist at runtime and the communication patterns between them. Using this information Thread Tailor dynamically combines threads to better suit the needs of the target system. Thread Tailor adjusts not only to the architecture, but also other applications in the system, and this paper demonstrates that this type of adjustment can lead to significantly better use of thread-level parallelism in real-world architectures...|$|R
