50|$|A <b>table</b> (called the <b>referencing</b> <b>table)</b> {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) in another <b>table</b> (the <b>{{referenced}}</b> <b>table)</b> by using a foreign key. The referenced column(s) in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table</b> must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are possible (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into the <b>referencing</b> <b>table,</b> the relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table.</b> If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table</b> to the <b>referencing</b> <b>tables),</b> NO ACTION (if the specific row is referenced, changing the key is not allowed) or SET NULL / SET DEFAULT (a changed/deleted key in the <b>referenced</b> <b>table</b> results in setting the referencing values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).|$|R
