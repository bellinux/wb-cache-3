40|$|This paper {{studies the}} thermal {{influence}} of a light-emitting diode (LED) driver on a <b>retrofit</b> <b>LED</b> <b>lamp,</b> also reporting on a procedure for its thermal characterization and multiscale modeling. In this analysis, temperature is measured by infrared thermography and monitoring specific locations with thermocouples. Experimental results point out that temperature increases considerably in all lamp parts when the driver is installed in the lamp (up to 15 % for LED board). The multiscale simulation approach is set with thermal parameters (thermal conductivity, emissivity, and LED board thermal resistance) measured from several parts of the lamp, reaching an agreement between experiment and simulation smaller than 10 %. With this model, the driver temperature is investigated under operational conditions accounting for two alternative thermal designs. First, the driver is completely surrounded with a filling material (air completely removed, Case A), and, second, only the thermal contact between the board and the lamp is improved (air is kept, Case B). In both cases, the heat removal from the driver to the ambient by conduction is enhanced, observing that temperature decreases in its most heated components up to 10 °C in Case A, and up to 7 °C in Case B. cop. 1986 - 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} the present paper is the {{derivation}} of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED spot lights. The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of spot lights through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in spot lights. A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order {{was derived from the}} subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of <b>LED</b> <b>retrofit</b> spot <b>lamps.</b> The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of spot lights without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The results of experimental studies of a number of modern <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> have been described. Investigation has been made for a number of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> produced by Philips, Xavax and Melitec. The experimental data have been obtained with the complex of devices: the dual-channel oscilloscope (GDS- 71042), the power quality analyzer (Fluke- 434) and the multi-function device EcoLight- 01 (light-, pulse- and luminance meter). It has been shown that operation of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> is characterized by emission of higher current harmonics and reactive power consumption, which depends on the type and design of the lamp driver. It has been found that the value of luminance created by <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> in case of acceptable (for ships) prolonged deviation of voltage (– 10 %) is reduced by 3 %; in case of permissible short-term voltage deviation (– 20 %) luminance is reduced by 7 %.

Despite the low sensitivity to voltage changes (in comparison with other types of lamps), the operation of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> is also associated with the appearance of flicker.
