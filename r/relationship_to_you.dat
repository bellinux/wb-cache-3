Farias tells also that in June 1933, Karl Jaspers criticized The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a {{propaganda}} book supporting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and Jaspers recalled much later that Heidegger had responded: [...] "But there is a dangerous international alliance of Jews." [...] However, Jaspers testified in his report (December 1945): [...] "In the twenties, Heidegger was no anti-Semite. With respect to this question he did not always exercise discretion. This doesn't {{rule out the possibility}} that, as I must assume, in other cases anti-Semitism went against his conscience and his taste." [...] There were [...] "rumors" [...] that Heidegger was anti-Semitic already in 1932, and he was aware of them, and vehemently denied them, calling them [...] "slander" [...] in a letter to Hannah Arendt. In response to her concern about these rumors that he was becoming anti-Semitic, Heidegger wrote ironically:This man who comes anyway and urgently wants to write a dissertation is a Jew. The man who comes to see me every month to report on a large work in progress is also a Jew. The man who sent me a substantial text for an urgent reading a few weeks ago is a Jew. The two fellows whom I helped get accepted in the last three semesters are Jews. The man who, with my help, got a stipend to go to Rome is a Jew. Whoever wants to call this 'raging anti-Semitism' is welcome to do so. Beyond that, I am now just as much an anti-Semite in University issues as I was ten years ago in Marburg. To say absolutely nothing about my personal relationships with Jews Husserl, Misch, Cassirer, and others. And above all it cannot touch my <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

Some students also find business cards helpful for networking purposes. A. LIST OF REFERENCES Your references should never be listed on your resume. Instead, you should create a list of references that can be provided to an employer. The format of a reference list is simple. Start with your name and contact information at the top (typically the same letterhead format as on your resume), followed by the names and contact information (name, work address, telephone number, e-mail and <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>you)</b> of three to four people. Your references should be diverse, preferably a combination of professors and former employers. They should also be people who know you well enough to recommend you to other professionals. Always obtain permission from your references prior to submitting your list to employers. The following is a sample reference list...|$|E

We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut. When this became public knowledge during the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal, Affleck said he had been [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the information.|$|R

Most of them mine. In a way writing the songs helps me to get a lot of the nasty feelings off my chest and put them in a box, and therefore have a bit more of an objective discourse with those emotions because you've done something positive with them, you've rid yourself of them.|$|R
