50|$|In 1820, Jeremiah {{joined his}} brother Charles in {{starting}} their own lock company, Chubb. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design didn't require a special <b>regulator</b> <b>key</b> to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc {{that allowed the}} key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock. The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting safe and began production in 1835.|$|E
50|$|A Chubb {{detector}} lock {{is a type}} of lever {{tumbler lock}} with an integral security feature, a form of relocker, which frustrates unauthorised access attempts and indicates to the lock's owner that it has been interfered with. When someone tries to pick the lock or to open it using the wrong key, the lock is designed to jam in a locked state until (depending on the lock) either a special <b>regulator</b> <b>key</b> or the original key is inserted and turned in a different direction. This alerts the owner {{to the fact that the}} lock has been tampered with.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{were made to}} the original design over the years but the basic principle behind its construction remained unchanged. In 1824, Charles patented an improved design that no longer required a special <b>regulator</b> <b>key</b> to reset the lock. The original lock used four levers, but by 1847 work by Jeremiah, Charles, his son John and others resulted in a six-lever version. A later innovation was the [...] "curtain", a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock. Eventually, Chubb began to manufacture brass padlocks incorporating the [...] "detector" [...] mechanism.|$|E

50|$|The first tableau - {{the house}} of Van Tricasse, in Quiquendonne, FlandersThe {{overture}} quotes the « Marche Bohémienne ». Monsieur van Tricasse is the mayor of Quiquendone, a peaceful town where things take ten times longer to happen than normal. Dr Ox has noted {{that a lack of}} oxygen is causing this languor and denying the citizens of many other powerful virtues. He is now housed in a tower inventing a new gas which the Quiquendonniens believe will bring fame to their town but which he hopes will enliven and invigorate the people via a vast lighting system. The servant Lotché, from the Midi, is unaffected by the general languor, and teases Frantz, in love with the Tricasses’s daughter Suzel, who has been pledged to the Dr Ox for a wedding three years hence. Van Tricasse, Niklausse and Josse reflect on town business and the oxy-hydrique gas, which will be introduced by Ox to illuminate the town. Today they will visit his laboratory, along with a visiting dignitary from the next town, Virgamen. A waltz leads to the arrival of Prascovia, a princess and Schahoura, dressed as gypsies, who want permits to stay in Quiquendone for the festival. As they all leave to go to the mayor’s office, Docteur Ox and his assistant Ygène enter to collect the <b>regulator</b> <b>key,</b> which will allow them to start production at the factory in Quiquendone. Ox is horrified when he sees Prascovia: they were engaged, but on the wedding day he ran off.|$|E
40|$|Tomato seeds were inoculated {{with the}} plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria Azospirillum brasilense FT 326, {{and changes in}} {{parameters}} associated with plant growth were evaluated 15 days after inoculation. Azospirilla were localized on roots and within xylematic tissue. An increase in shoot and root fresh weight, main root hair length, and root surface indicated that inoculation with A. brasilense FT 326 resulted in plant growth improvement. The levels of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and ethylene, two of the phytohormones related to plant growth, were higher in inoculated plants. Exogenously supplied ethylene mimicked the effect of inoculation, {{and the addition of}} an inhibitor of its synthesis or of its physiological activity completely blocked A. brasilense growth promotion. Based on our results, we propose that the process of growth promotion triggered by A. brasilense inoculation involves a signaling pathway that has ethylene as a central, positive <b>regulator.</b> <b>Key</b> words: ACS; auxins; Azospirillum sp.; ethylene; IAA; Lycopersicon esculentum; plant growth promotion...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of in vitro culture techniques for plant tissues provides new alternatives for ex situ conservation of sugarcane germplasm. The {{aim of this}} paper was to determine the conditions for in vitro conservation of sugar cane plants; culture temperature, saline and manitol concentration in the culture medium were evaluated. In vitro plants of 2 cm height form cultivar C 87 - 51 in multiplication were incubated at 12, 15 and 18 2. 0 ºC. The MS formulation (25, 50, 75 and 100 % of its original concentration) was complemented with different concentrations of manitol (0, 10, 20, 30 g. l- 1). After two months of conservation initial 12 months the percentage of plants survival, the height and the number of shoots per plant were evaluated. It was possible to conservate in vitro plants of sugarcane for 12 months at 15 °C. The percentage of plants survival rated between 53. 3 and 86. 6 %. The plants height decreased with the increment of the manitol concentration; nevertheless the number of shoots per plant was higher in treatments including this osmotic <b>regulator.</b> <b>Key</b> words: culture temperature, manitol, minimal growth, surviva...|$|E
40|$|The robust self-tuning {{regulator}} of a {{class of}} linear systems, which can be described by the input-output Auto-Regressive Moving Average with exogenous (ARMAX) mathematical model with unknown and time-varying parameters, at bounded external disturbances is developed. A scheme of polynomial approximation {{has been applied to}} approximate the unknown and time-varying parameters of systems. The modified recursive extended least squares RELS estimation algorithm with a relative dead zone is proposed and applied to estimate the unknown and time-varying parameters intervening in the ARMAX mathematical model. The formulation of the explicit schemes of self-tuning regulation problem is resolved by using the minimum variance output or the generalized minimum variance output. The obtained control law, which is an optimal solution of minimizing a correspondent criterion, permit to reduce the effect of noise upon the output of system. An example of numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the explicit schemes of self-tuning regulator and presents the performances by using the modified recursive extended least squares estimation algorithm with a relative dead zone in a step of the parametric estimation of a linear time-varying systems.

40|$|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is {{a complex}} disease. Genetic, epigenetic, and {{environmental}} factors are known to contribute to COPD risk and disease progression. Therefore we developed a systematic approach to identify <b>key</b> <b>regulators</b> of COPD that integrates genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotype data in lung tissue from COPD and control samples. Our integrative analysis identified 126 <b>key</b> <b>regulators</b> of COPD. We identified EPAS 1 as the only <b>key</b> <b>regulator</b> whose downstream genes significantly overlapped with multiple genes sets associated with COPD disease severity. EPAS 1 is distinct in comparison with other <b>key</b> <b>regulators</b> in terms of methylation profile and downstream target genes. Genes predicted to be regulated by EPAS 1 were enriched for biological processes including signaling, cell communications, and system development. We confirmed that EPAS 1 protein levels are lower in human COPD lung tissue compared to non-disease controls and that Epas 1 gene expression is reduced in mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. As EPAS 1 downstream genes were significantly enriched for hypoxia responsive genes in endothelial cells, we tested EPAS 1 function in human endothelial cells.

40|$|Abstract: Renal lipid {{metabolism}} may play {{important roles in}} renal inflammation, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury in diabetic nephropathy. These alterations in lipids are associated with (1) decreased expression of PPAR-γ mRNA and protein, (2) increased abundance of the sterol regulatory element binding protein- 1 (SREBP- 1), <b>key</b> <b>regulator</b> of fatty acid synthesis, (3) decreased abundance of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a negative regulator of fatty acid synthesis and promoter of fatty acid oxidation, (4) downregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-γ), <b>key</b> <b>regulator</b> of fatty acid oxidation, (5) increased abundance of the sterol regulatory element binding protein- 2 (SREBP- 2), <b>key</b> <b>regulator</b> of cholesterol synthesis, and (6) downregulation of ATP binding cassette A 1 (ABCA 1), <b>key</b> <b>regulator</b> of cholesterol efflux. These lipid alterations are also associated with marked downregulation of the podocyte markers podocin and zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) and proteinuria. Treatment of ZDF rats with the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone results in normalization of the renal {{lipid metabolism}} pathways and prevention of lipid and adipophilin accumulation, restoration of podocin and ZO- 1 expression, and prevention of proteinuria. Thus, our results indicate that renal lipid accumulation significantly contributes to renal cell injury and treatment with PPAR agonist significantly ameliorates podocyte injury, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and proteinuria.
