40|$|Excerpt] This Beyond the Numbers article compares <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> {{based on}} data {{collected}} during three periods that can be characterized roughly as boom, recession, and recovery. The “recovery” era {{is represented by the}} current CPI <b>relative</b> <b>importances,</b> which are based on surveys conducted in 2011 – 2012. These <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> replaced figures that were {{based on data}} collected during 2009 – 2010, and represent the “recession” period. (While the economy was recovering at least during the latter part of this period, it seems reasonable to expect consumer behavior to reflect recession conditions.) Because the 2007 – 2008 period was one of transition from boom to recession, we will examine the weights based on 2005 – 2006 data, as representing spending during a booming economy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To explore {{factors related}} to {{emergency}} department (ED) attendances in Hong Kong, the authors piloted the application of conjoint analysis in eliciting patient preferences regarding ED visits. Methods: The study recruited 390 semi-urgent or non-urgent patients from a targeted convenience sample of three large EDs. Respondents were asked to rank eight scenarios structured to explore the <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> of three key attributes - self-perceived illness severity, waiting time, and consultation fee - that may result in an ED visit. Results: Seventy-eight {{percent of the respondents}} would consider visiting a parallel clinic instead of the ED for semi-urgent and non-urgent conditions. The <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> attached to illness severity, waiting time, and consultation fee were 47. 8 %, 33. 6 %, and 18. 7 %, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Hong Kong patients are receptive to the concept of parallel clinics, and illustrated that conjoint analysis is a rigorous survey technique for eliciting the views of patients on health care services in the ED setting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> {{of the various}} actinide, fission-product, and light-element {{isotopes}} associated with LWR spent fuel with respect to five analysis areas: criticality safety (absorption fractions), shielding (dose rate fractions), curies (fractional curies levels), decay heat (fraction of total watts), and radiological toxicity (fraction of potential committed effective dose equivalent). These rankings are presented {{for up to six}} different burnup/enrichment scenarios and at decay times from 2 to 100, 000 years. Ranking plots for each of these analysis areas are given in an Appendix for completeness, as well as summary tables in {{the main body of the}} report. Summary rankings are presented in terms of high (greater than 10 % contribution to the total), medium (between 1 % and 10 % contribution), and low (less than 1 % contribution) for both short- and long-term cooling. When compared with the expected measurement accuracies, these rankings show that most of the important isotopes can be characterized sufficiently for the purpose of radionuclide generation/depletion code validation in each of the analysis areas. Because the main focus of this work is on the <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> of isotopes associated with L@ spent fuel, some conclusions may not be applicable to similar areas such as high-level waste (HLW) and nonfuel-bearing components (NFBC) ...|$|R

5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|Much {{is written}} about the {{different}} factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of <b>relative</b> <b>importance.</b> A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E

Smoking rates and differences in the beliefs and background of smokers and non-smokers are described. The <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> of different beliefs as predictors of future smoking intentions also were ascertained. For both boys and girls the most important predictors of intentions were perceived peer smoking and evaluation of negative consequences of smoking. Parental smoking also was important for boys and parental disapproval and perceived likelihood of negative consequences were important for girls. The implications for smoking interventions among young people are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> and {{interactions}} between these different antioxidants {{is a very}} complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town.

While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E

The techniques are specifically adapted to the scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMRR) launched on the Seasat and Nimbus 7 satellites to determine ocean surface temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric water content. The retrievals are studied primarily from a theoretical viewpoint, to illustrate the retrieval error structure, the <b>relative</b> <b>importances</b> of different radiometer channels, and the tradeoffs between spatial resolution and retrieval accuracy.

5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over the <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> of natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> {{of the role of}} the United Fruit Company and the worries about {{communist}} influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to {{at least some of}} the decline in numbers, but the <b>relative</b> <b>importance</b> of the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an attempt to reduce negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.|$|E

In this paper the relative effects of trees, cars, wires, and building facades on preferences for residential blocks are discussed. Clean estimates of these effects were obtained by combining contemporary digital technology with a formal experimental design. It was found that trees had a moderate positive effect on preferences for streetscapes, wires had a small negative effect, and cars had a trivial effect. It was also found that the effect of building facade ranged from trivial to moderate. ...|$|R

30|$|The EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) {{has been}} used to obtain ion {{velocities}} in the lower thermosphere. By using beam swinging and assuming homogeneity and stationarity of the plasma, first approximations to the electric field have been deduced, and thus the thermospheric neutral wind has been estimated. From these derived parameters, we have estimated the gradient Richardson Number. Although many assumptions must be made, there is an indication that electrodynamics is able to contribute to enhancement or even production of neutral-air turbulence in the lower thermosphere. Finally, we outline a proposal for an analogy to the Reynolds Number, but reflecting the <b>relative</b> <b>importance’s</b> of the contribution of ion-drag to the neutral dynamics and the kinematic viscosity.|$|R
