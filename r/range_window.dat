Stretch Processing is a technique for matched filtering of wideband chirping waveform and is suitable for applications seeking very fine range resolution over relatively short range intervals.Picture above shows the scenario for analyzing stretch processing.

40|$|A report {{describes}} {{the development of}} software for a digital processor that operates {{in conjunction with a}} finite-impulse-response (FIR) chip in a spaceborne lidar altimeter. Processing is started by a laser-fire interrupt signal that is repeated at intervals of 25 ms. For the purpose of discriminating between returns from the ground and returns from such things as trees, buildings, and clouds, the software is required to scan digitized lidar-return data in reverse of the acquisition sequence in order to distinguish the last return pulse from within a commanded ground-return <b>range</b> <b>window.</b> The digitized waveform information within this <b>range</b> <b>window</b> is filtered through 6 matched filters, in the hardware electronics, in order to maximize the probability of finding echoes from sloped or rough terrain and minimize the probability of selecting cloud returns. From the data falling past the end of the <b>range</b> <b>window,</b> there is obtained a noise baseline that is used to calculate a threshold value for each filter. The data from each filter is analyzed by a complex weighting scheme and the filter with the greatest weight is selected. A region around the peak of the ground return pulse associated with the selected filter is placed in telemetry, as well as information on its location, height, and other characteristics. The software requires many uplinked parameters as input. Included in the report is a discussion of major software-development problems posed by the design of the FIR chip and the need for the software to complete its process within 20 ms to fit within the overall 25 -ms cycle...|$|E
30|$|The {{reason why}} we build {{different}} algorithms for ROW and RANGE is that the adaptability of them is different in sampling environment. As is shown in Fig.  4, suppose the current tuple is 7 (i.e., the red number), there are two windows which are defined in the same form (i.e., BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING), but they are in different modes. The green bracket represents the window in ROW mode, while the blue one represents the window in RANGE mode. Therefore, when the windows are used on original data, there are 5 tuples in ROW window (i.e., 6, 6.5, 7, 7.8, 8) and 7 tuples in <b>RANGE</b> <b>window</b> (i.e., 5.6, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.8, 8, 8.5). However, when we apply the same windows on the subset which is generated from original data by using random sampling, there are still 5 tuples in ROW window (i.e., 4, 6, 7, 7.8, 8.5) and only 4 tuples in <b>RANGE</b> <b>window</b> (i.e., 6, 7, 7.8, 8.5). And we find ROW window on subset contains 2 dirty tuples that don’t belong to original ROW window (i.e., the yellow tuples 4 and 8.5), but it doesn’t happen in RANGE mode.|$|E

TNO has developed a method to determine the probit for glazing failure and hazard for any predefined <b>range</b> of <b>windows.</b> This method is based on strength and hazard models for glazing. A Bayesian Belief Network approach is used to introduce the uncertainties and the scatter regarding the range of glazing dimensions.
