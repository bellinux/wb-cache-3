The perturbation of the corroding system is minimized as the potentiostatic polarizing pulse is applied for only 60 msec. The double layer charging of the electrode is moni-tored on an oscilloscope and the faradaic urrent measurements made by the normal Y recorder output of the polarograph. The iR correction facility on the polarograph is {{used to determine the}} Tafel parameters and can also be used if <b>resistance</b> <b>overvoltage</b> is a problem during the polarization resistance mea-surements. Four different solutions are examined where the cathodic processes are either separately or jointly oxygen reduction or hydrogen evolution.

Where two cathodic processes occur, errors of up to 15 % are encountered...|$|E

Even though GCI is small compared to Rtot, ignoring the GCI will result in higher Simulation Errors at j> 0. 5 Acm- 2.

40|$|High {{temperature}} solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) stacks are highly efficient and environmentally friendly electrochemical systems, which convert the chemical energy of fuel gases with oxygen from air directly into electrical energy. During operation of SOFC stacks under system operating conditions pronounced temperature and fuel gas composition gradients along the cell area {{and along the}} height of the stack occur. Therefore, in contrast to SOFC cells, the electrochemical behavior of SOFC stacks is much more complex and has not sufficiently been studied. Specially, a shortcoming exists in terms of understanding the homogeneity, performance loss mechanisms, and various <b>resistances</b> and <b>overvoltages</b> within the stack repeat components. Therefore, this paper focuses on the improvement of the understanding and of the interpretation of different current-voltage curves of solid oxide fuel cell stack repeat units. Three different cases are discussed: repeat units with high power performance, with high cell contact resistance and with high fuel utilization. The stacks were investigated by current-voltage curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and gas analysis. In order to understand the electrochemical behavior of these three cases both experimental and modeling results are presented, compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Potentials of SAE 1020 steel were {{measured}} in 1. 0 N HeS 04 and tap water, each with added amines. The steady state potential {{was found to}} be a function of the nature and concentration f the amine additives. The effect could not be completely reversed in all cases when the metal was placed in amine-free solutions. Anodic and cathodic polariza-tion measurements {{in the presence of the}} amines howed that both anodic and cathodic areas were affected by the inhibitor. Decomposition potential curves for those systems pointed to the same conclusion. The data are discussed in terms of a generalized theory of corrosion inhibition. It is postulated that the measured changes arc due to adsorption of the polar compounds on the metal surface. The lack of complete reversibility is attributed to the heterogeneity of the surface giving rise to a variety of adsorption energies. Inhibition at the anodic areas is considered tobe due to an actual reduction i tendency for the iron ions to go into solution due to a displacement of electrons from the metal toward the positively charged particle rather than toward the cathodic areas within the metal. The amines may act as inhibitors at the cathodic areas by virtue of diffusion effects, increased <b>resistance,</b> and <b>overvoltage...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ever since inception, the {{electric}} power and communication systems {{are exposed to}} dangerous overvoltage surges starting from lightning to service frequency temporary overvoltage waves with disastrous consequences. The operation of electronic devices in this environment had led to a situation wherein they are severely affected. All sorts of electronic equipment are at risk: this calls for an effective protection against transient overvoltages. It includes adequate equipment protection, inherent capability of the equipment to withstand overvolage surges, good installation and a sound earthing arrangement. This paper describes an incident involving the exposure of wireless equipment and the operating personnel to frequent lightning activities in a hilly place and the need of a good installation practice, better earthing and adequate protection against direct lightning strokes.

40|$|The {{electrode}} resistance (Re 1) at low over-voltages {{has been determined}} for Bi 2 O 3 free and Bi 2 O 3 doped yttria-stabilized zirconia with sputtered platinum electrodes. The anode and cathode resistances are measured separately and are equal. Bi 2 O 3 causes a decrease of the electrode <b>resistance</b> at small <b>overvoltage</b> and with 5 × 10 − 4 < PO 2 less-than-or-equals, slant 1 atm. The rate determining step for the electrode reaction under the measuring conditions probably is a charge-transfer process in which oxygen adsorbs dissociatively on the bismuth free and associatively on the bismuth doped samples. The complex impedance behaviour of the electrode reaction can be interpreted in terms of R-C circuits in the PO 2 range of 10 − 2 − 1 atm...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{deposition}} on Ni-based anode {{is well-known}} {{as a major}} barrier for the practical use and commercialization of hydrocarbon-fuelled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this work, Co alloying in Ni-YSZ was studied as an alternative anode material for using CH 4 as a fuel. The Ni-YSZ and Ni-Co alloyed-YSZ were prepared by the traditional impregnation method without further mixing processes. After sintering and reduction in H 2 atmosphere, the introduced Co can completely dissolved into the Ni lattice and changed the morphology {{with an increase in}} the Ni-YSZ grain size and showed a better uniform microstructure. The Co alloying also enhanced the electrochemical performance under CH 4 fuel by reducing the <b>resistance</b> and anodic <b>overvoltage.</b> Moreover, the Co addition enhanced the stability of the cell with CH 4 a constant load current of 80 mA for 60 h. This performance related to the carbon deposition on the anode surface. The Co alloying showed a high efficiency to suppress the carbon deposition and improved the electrochemical performance of an SOFC cell operating under CH 4 fuel...|$|R
40|$|In {{our work}} we {{investigate}} {{the development of}} a novel electrochemical biosensor that integrates a graphene layer as the transducer element for the analysis of electroactive membrane proteins. Graphene is used as transducer because of its unique properties (high surface area, electrical conductivity, ultra-high electron mobility, wide electrochemical potential window, low charge-transfer <b>resistance,</b> reduction of <b>overvoltage),</b> all of which are responsible for the enhancement of the direct electron transfer between graphene and the membrane proteins. However, in biosensors for membrane proteins a major problem is the denaturation of such proteins when they are in contact with the electrode solid surface. To avoid this, membrane proteins are normally embedded in a biological system mimicking their native environment, the supported lipid bilayer (SLB). This study is focused on the synthesis of the graphene interface through chemical vapour deposition, on its surface treatments through a mild oxidation to improve its biocompatibility, and on the investigation of the graphene interface with SLBs. The obtained films of graphene are characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and measuring the water contact angles before and after surface treatments. The interaction of the graphene surface with liposomes and the formation of the graphene-supported lipid bilayer are investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|High {{temperature}} solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFC) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) {{have a high}} potential as future power generation systems with high efficiency, low noise and low emissions. This covers the wide field of, e. g. stationary SOFC μ-CHP (combined heat and power), mobile SOFC APU (auxiliary power unit), SOEC power-to-gas and combined SOFC/SOEC power-to-gas-to-power systems. However, the successful development of the solid oxide cell (SOC) stacks requires high quality reliable and reproducible test results, which enables the proper understanding of the corresponding electrochemical processes. Especially the different <b>resistances,</b> the <b>overvoltages</b> under electrical current and the degradation mechanisms in the stacks are not well understood. In this context, temperature and fuel gas composition gradients along the cell area and along {{the height of the}} stack play an important role under operation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a very useful tool in order to close this knowledge gap [1, 2]. The presentation focuses on the improvement of the understanding and of the electrochemical behavior of SOC stack repeat units both in fuel cell (SOFC) and electrolysis (SOEC) mode. The stacks have been investigated in different projects by electrochemical impedance spectra, current voltage curves (jV-curves) and gas analysis. In the first part the quality of the results is presented in terms of reproducibility and repeatability among different testing partners and among different test methods. The corresponding results have been obtained within the European funded project “SOCTESQA” (Solid oxide cell and stack testing and quality assurance) [3]. Moreover, the most relevant parameters influencing the reliability of the EIS spectra and jV-curves are outlined. In the next part the electrochemical results of the SOC stacks operated at different characteristic conditions are presented and discussed. This includes stacks operated at high current density and at high fuel utilization and stacks with high contact resistance [4]. In order to understand the electrochemical behavior of these three cases the different resistances of the repeat units have been determined with an equivalent circuit. Both experimental and modeling results are presented and discussed. The results were obtained in the German funded project “ZeuS 3 ”. In {{the last part of the}} presentation degradation issues of the SOC stacks are addressed. Aspects for determining reliable and reproducible degradation rates are discussed. Moreover, results of stacks with and without Cr-evaporation protection layer from the German funded project “Smart” are presented. The stacks have been operated in SOFC mode galvanostatically at 300 mA/cm 2 for 10. 000 h. The increases of the different resistances in the stack repeat units which have been determined by EIS spectra during operation are outlined. Additionally, the most relevant degradation mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
