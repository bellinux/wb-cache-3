40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} US {{signalling}} and the US–CS interval in backward conditioning was assessed in mice. For {{one group of}} mice the presentation of food was signalled by a tone and for another group, food was unsignalled. For half of the mice, within each group, the presentation of food preceded a visual cue by 10 s. For the other half, food {{was presented at the}} start of the visual cue (0 -s US–CS interval), resulting in simultaneous pairings of these events. A summation test and a subsequent <b>retardation</b> <b>test</b> were used to assess the inhibitory effects of backward conditioning in comparison to training with a non-reinforced visual cue that controlled for the possible effects of latent inhibition and conditioned inhibition caused as a consequence of differential conditioning. In the summation test unsignalled presentations of the US resulted in inhibition when the US–CS interval was 10 s, but not 0 s. Signalled presentations of the US resulted in inhibition, independent of the US–CS interval. In the <b>retardation</b> <b>test,</b> independent of US signalling, a US–CS interval of 10 s failed to result in inhibition, but an interval of 0 s resulted in greater conditioned responding to the backward CS than the control CS. A generalisation decrement account of the effect of signalling the US with a 0 -s US–CS interval, which resulted in reduced responding in the summation test and faster acquisition in the <b>retardation</b> <b>test,</b> is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Traditionally, dynamic {{parameters}} of induction motors can be roughly estimated through conventional tests (no load test, block rotor test and <b>retardation</b> <b>test)</b> and core loss is neglected in the dynamic behaviours analysis. Due to the complication of dynamic behaviours of induction motors, inaccuracy of transient characteristics may obtain when using these dynamic parameters. In order to improving accuracy of dynamic behaviour analysis, however, {{the inclusion of}} core loss in the machine model needs to be re-addressed and an intelligent approach to estimated dynamic parameters needs to be adopted. In this paper, three of intelligent search techniques, which are i) Tabu Search (TS), ii) Adaptive Tabu Search (ATS) and iii) Genetic Algorithm (GA), are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of intelligent identification compared with the conventional model with and without core loss parameter(RC). The simulation results from dynamic parameters including RC obtained by the GA {{in comparison with the}} experimental results are convinced the effectiveness for this aim...|$|E

40|$|The present {{experiments}} examined whether external contextual stimuli {{can acquire}} inhibitory properties through a simple differential context-reinforcement procedure.

In Experiment 2, a summation and <b>retardation</b> <b>test</b> were performed using a contextual stimulus that was unique to the non-reinforced context. Weak but significant contextual inhibition was found. It was suggested that contextual stimuli that are unique to the non-reinforced context did acquire inhibitory strength in each experiment, but that in Experiments 1 A and 1 B, expression of this inhibition during testing had been masked by the concurrent presence of excitation from elements that the non-reinforced context had in common with the reinforced context...|$|E
40|$|A {{conditioned}} inhibitor {{is usually}} conceptualized as a conditioned stimulus (CS) that signals {{the omission of}} an unconditioned stimulus (US) at a time at which the US would otherwise be expected (e. g., because of the pres-ence of an excitatory CS). One common procedure used to produce conditioned inhibition is the treatment devel-oped by Pavlov (1927), in which pairings of an excitatory CS (A, the inhibition training excitor) and the US are in-terspersed with nonreinforced compound presentations of CS X (the putative inhibitor) and CS A (i. e., A®US/ XA®noUS). Typically, in such a procedure, CS X sup-ports behavior indicative of conditioned inhibition, as ev-idenced through summation and <b>retardation</b> <b>tests.</b> Although conditioned inhibition is a well-documented behavioral phenomenon, {{the nature of the}} processes that underlie it is not yet clear. That is, neither the information encoded nor the mechanism used by animals to attenuate (i. e., inhibit) a response is fully understood.

On the other hand, doughs from near-isogenic wheat lines differing in their high molecular weight glutenin subunits compositions, grown in three locations, were compared at the same water content (46. 1 %). Both factors affected dough viscoelasticity in a similar and remarkable way. In particular, the same inverse relationship between steady-state viscosity and compliance, and the same power law relationship between steady-state and plateau compliances, were found to hold wether variability was of endogenous origin or was due to dough water content.

40|$|An {{existing}} attentional-associative {{model of}} classical conditioning [Schmajuk N, Lam Y, Gray JA. Latent inhibition: a neural network approach. J Exp Psychol: Anim Behav Process 1996; 22 : 321 – 49] {{is applied to}} the description of reinstatement in animals and humans. According to the model, inhibitory associations between the context (CX) and unconditioned stimulus (US) are formed during extinction, which help preserve the association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the US. However, summation and <b>retardation</b> <b>tests</b> fail to reveal these associations because (a) the CX is not attended or (b) a CX–CS configural stimulus formed during extinction is both poorly attended and weakly active during testing. When US presentations and testing occur in the same context, reinstatement is the consequence of a decreased CX inhibition and the increased attention to the CS, which activates the remaining CS–US association. When US presentations occur in the context of extinction but the CS is tested in a different context, reinstatement results from an increased attention to the CS and the combination of CS–CX and CX–US excitatory associations. The assumption that associations between CSs are impaired following neurotoxic hippocampal lesions or in amnesia, is sufficient to describe absence of reinstatement in those cases. However, additional assumptions might be needed to describe the effect of hippocampal lesions on other postextinction manipulations. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{were exposed}} to two {{compound}} solutions, saline-lemon and sucrose-lemon. In Group ALT, trials with one solution alternated with trials with the other. Group BLK received all trials with one solution before any trials with the other. Previous retardation tests had implied that only alternating exposure would establish sucrose as an inhibitor of saline. To provide a complementary summation test for this inhibition, in Experiment 1, all the animals received pairings of peppermint and saline and were tested for consumption of peppermint-sucrose under sodium depletion. Consumption was increased by sodium depletion only in Group BLK. In Experiment 2, a <b>retardation</b> <b>test</b> was used to show that presentation of saline-lemon before sucrose-lemon on each exposure day would establish sucrose as an inhibitor of saline. Neither exposure to sucrose-lemon before saline-lemon nor alternating exposure to sucrose and saline alone had the same effect.

Upon completion of the discrimination in Experiment 2 a, the platforms were placed near identical landmarks in the correct corners of the rectangle. The landmarks were those used for discrimination training for a superconditioning group (AX+ trials), but for a control group they were novel (AY+ trials). During a final test in the pool without the landmarks and the platforms, the superconditioning group spent more time than the control group searching in the correct corners. This finding, which was replicated in a kite-shaped pool in Experiment 2 b, demonstrates successful superconditioning by landmark X of the cues created by the shapes of the pools.

40|$|The {{effects of}} chronically ablating the serotoninergic inputs to various {{regions of the}} rat brain {{on the ability to}} solve a feature-negative {{discrimination}} was measured. After intracerebroventricular administration of the specific neurotoxin 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine, the rats exhibited an impaired capacity to solve such a discrimination, irrespective of whether auditory or visual stimuli were used. Further behavioural analysis revealed that this effect was not due to a reduced capacity to form excitatory associations, since both groups responded equally to reinforced stimuli. By contrast, the lesion more likely resulted in a failure to endow the non-reinforced stimuli with inhibitory properties. This suggestion was supported by the observation that, in a <b>retardation</b> <b>test,</b> the conditioned inhibitor aroused less inhibition in the lesioned group than in vehicle-injected controls. Furthermore, the conditioned inhibitor failed to pass a summation test in lesioned animals, again indicating that their hampered ability to master the discrimination was the result of an impairment in the formation of inhibitory associations. It is concluded that destruction of central 5 -hydroxytryptamine-containing pathways impairs the functioning of brain areas underlying inhibitory associative learning...|$|E
40|$|The noncoding {{region of}} the highly oncogenic, epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated human {{papillomavirus}} type 8 contains a negative regulatory element (NRE). Quantitative RNase protection analysis confirmed that the NRE sequence acts as a silencer of transcription. A 38 -bp sequence upstream of late promoter P 7535 down-regulated expression from the homologous P 7535 promoter, {{as well as the}} heterologous tk gene promoter, independently of its orientation relative to the test promoters. It also reduced gene expression when cloned downstream of the transcription units. Transient expression assays with keratinocytes and fibroblasts of epidermodysplasia verruciformis patients and controls demonstrated that the NRE activity is not cell specific. Gel <b>retardation</b> <b>tests</b> suggested that NRE specifically interacts with only one nuclear factor. Mutational analysis identified three NRE mutants which no longer formed a detectable DNA-protein complex but still repressed transcription, indicating that protein-DNA interaction is not relevant for the silencer function. The NRE contains a binding site of viral trans activator protein E 2. It was shown that expression of E 2 overrides the inhibitory effect of the NRE sequences. Binding of E 2 and that of the cellular factor were mutually exclusive. The bifunctional nature of NRE acting as a silencer and a target site for viral trans activator E 2 offers an interesting opportunity to regulate the switch from early to late transcription in the human papillomavirus life cycle...|$|R

In jointless asphalt pavements, at low temperatures, so-called cryogenic tensile stresses due to cooling occur. Not taking account of these leads to fundamental errors in the prediction of the conjectured service life. The estimation of the cryogenic tensile stresses in asphalts by mathematical methods presupposes knowledge of the temperature, the modulus of elasticity, the one-dimensional {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and also the tensile viscosity. Within the framework of the research project under discussion, which was assisted by the Federal Ministry of Transport and performed at the Institute of Highway Engineering of the Technical University Braunschweig, it was proved that, using process-controlled testing machines, it is possible to examine the thermo-rheological behaviour of different asphalts by means of tensile retardation and tensile relaxation tests. It was shown that the tensile viscosities and the moduli of elasticity of asphaltic concretes, mastic asphalts and stone mastic asphalts are influenced to a high degree by the temperature and the tensile stress.

Sodium depletion increased consumption of sucrose more in group BLK than in group ALT. In groups given no saline-sucrose pairing, sodium depletion had only a small effect on sucrose consumption, which was the same in both groups. After multiple pairings of saline and sucrose, sodium depletion had an equally large effect on sucrose consumption in both ALT and BLK groups.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the predictions of an attentional-associative model (Schmajuk, Lam, & Gray Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes, 22, 321 - 349, 1996) regarding the effect of attentional manipulations on both discrete and contextual conditioned inhibitors. The SLG model assumes that non-reinforced presentations of an inhibitory conditioned stimulus (CS) do not decrease its inhibitory associations. However, the model predicts that extended presentations will decrease attention to the inhibitor, thereby, decreasing both the expression of its inhibitory power in a summation test {{and the rate of}} acquisition in a <b>retardation</b> <b>test.</b> The model also predicts that subsequent presentations of the inhibitory CS with a novel CS will increase both its inhibitory power in a summation test and the rate of acquisition in a <b>retardation</b> <b>test.</b> Using a predictive learning design in humans, Experiment 1 examined the predictions involving the summation tests, whereas Experiments 2 and 3 examined the predictions involving the retardation tests. Experimental results were in agreement with the predictions of the model. The SLG model also predicts that a salient extinction context (CX) becomes inhibitory and prevents extinction of the excitatory CS-unconditioned stimulus (US) association. Although some data seem to contradict that prediction (e. g., Bouton and King, 1983, Bouton and Swartzentruber, 1986, 1989), Larrauri and Schmajuk (2008) indicated that the CX might not appear inhibitory in a summation test because attention to the CX decreases with many but not few extinction trials. In a human predictive learning experiment, we confirmed the model's predictions that the inhibitory power of the extinction CX can be detected after a few extinction trials when attention to the CX is still high, but not after many extinction trials once attention to the CX has decreased (Experiment 4), and even after many extinction trials by presenting novel CSs to increase attention to the unattended CX (Experiment 5). Furthermore, using an eye-tracker, we confirmed the model's explanation of Experiment 4 results by showing decreased overt attention to the CX after many but not after few extinction trials (Experiment 6). Importantly, the view that the extinction CX becomes inhibitory allows the model to explain spontaneous recovery (because attention to the excitatory CS increases before attention to the inhibitory CX), renewal (because the inhibition provided by the extinction CX disappears), and reinstatement (the inhibitory CX becomes neutral or excitatory), as well as {{a very large number of}} other experimental results related to extinction. Based on the prediction of the SLG, model the implications of our results for the treatments of anxiety disorders were discussed. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|What is inhibition? The “problem of inhibition” is {{one that}} has puzzled {{learning}} theorists for many decades. Once it had been demonstrated that pairing a CS (s uch as a tone or a light) with a US (such as food or shock) produced excitatory conditioning (Pavlov 1927, and see Chapter 2 of Mackintosh 1974), it was natural to consider if a signal could “undo” the effect of an excitatory CS. We now call such a signal a Conditioned Inhibitor. A viable recipe for producing conditioned in hibition is to use a design such as A+ AB -, which simply denotes trials where A and the US are paired, interspersed with trials where A and B occur in compound but without the US. The result is that B acquires the properties of being hard to condition to that US (i. e., it passes the <b>retardation</b> <b>test</b> for a conditioned inhibitor), and of suppressing excitatory responding when presented in compound with A or with another excitatory CS that has been conditioned with the same US (i. e., it passes the summation te st for conditioned inhibition). In this chapter, we will ask what it is about B that enables it to pass these tests, and what it is about the A+ AB - design that confers these properties. But first we must consider another use of the term “inhibition”, one that is just as prevalent amongst cognitive psychologists, but gives a somewhat different meaning to the concept...|$|E

Psychomotor retardation could constitute a marker of this negative burden of past depressive episodes, with conflicting findings according to the use of clinical versus cognitive assessments. We assessed the role of the Retardation Depressive Scale (filled in by the clinician) and the time required to perform the neurocognitive d 2 attention test and the Trail Making Test (performed by patients) in a sample of 2048 depressed outpatients, before and after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with agomelatine. From this sample, 1140 patients performed the TMT-A and -B, and 508 performed the d 2 test, at baseline and after treatment. At baseline, we found that with more past depressive episodes patients had more severe clinical level of psychomotor retardation, and that they needed more time to perform both d 2 and TMT. When the analyses were performed again after treatment, and especially when the analyses were restricted to patients with clinical remission, the cognitive tests were the only ones correlated with past depressive episodes. Psychomotor <b>retardation</b> <b>tested</b> at a cognitive level was therefore systematically revealing the burden of past depressive episodes, with an increased weight for patients with less remaining symptoms.

Measures of learning included response topography, effects of selective satiation, and summation and <b>retardation</b> <b>tests</b> of conditioned inhibition. One cue (A) was first paired with either a single unconditioned stimulus event, US 1, or a sequence of two events, US 1 —»US 2. US 2 was either qualitatively similar to (US 2 -Same) or different from (US 2 -Diff) US 1. Then, a compound of A and a novel cue (X) was reinforced with US 1 or US 1 ^> US 2. Conditioning to X was blocked if either the single US 1 or the US 1 ->US 2 sequence was used in both phases. If X accompanied an upshift in the reinforcer, from US 1 to US 1 —*US 2, it acquired conditioned responding, especially when US 2 -Diff was used. Responding {{in the latter case}} was the consequence of both X-US 1 and X-US 2 associations. In Experiments 1 - 3, if X accompanied a downshift from US 1 —*US 2 -Same to US 1, it acquired conditioned responding that was based on X-US 1 associations, but if it accompanied a downshift from US 1 —»US 2 -Diff to US 1, it acquired conditioned inhibition based on X-US 2 associations. In Experiment 4, X acquired net inhibition at short US 1 -US 2 intervals and net excitation at longer intervals, with downshifts from either US 1 —»US 2 -Same or US 1 —»US 2 -DifT to US 1.

The procedure in use was adapted to confirm the demonstration of conditioned inhibition using two key transfer <b>tests,</b> <b>retardation</b> and summation. Experiment 1 showed the development of the predicted discrimination learning for negative outcomes but not for positive outcomes. Experiment 2 found evidence for retardation. Furthermore, this reduced learning was clearly related to the conditioned emotional response to the US images; individuals rated transfer images as positive if they had previously signalled the absence of a negative outcome. Experiment 3 showed that the conditioned inhibition was confirmed by summation test. Thus, inhibitory learning was confirmed by both <b>retardation</b> and summation <b>tests,</b> which between them control for alternative explanations of apparent conditioned inhibition, conducted on different participants but using the same discrimination learning procedure.

Despite these benefits, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms by which DCS promotes the loss of fear. The present study examined whether DCS augments extinction retention (1) through reductions in conditioned stimulus (CS) processing or (2) by promoting the development of conditioned inhibition to contextual cues. Rats administered DCS prior to extinction showed enhanced long-term extinction retention (Experiments 3 and 4). The same nonreinforced CS procedure used in extinction also reduced freezing at test when presented as pre-exposure before conditioning, demonstrating latent inhibition (Experiment 1). DCS administered shortly prior to pre-exposure had no effect on latent inhibition using parameters which produced weak (Experiment 2) or strong (Experiment 3) expression of latent inhibition. Therefore, DCS facilitated learning involving CS-alone exposures, but only when these exposures occurred after (extinction) and not before (latent inhibition) conditioning. We also used a <b>retardation</b> <b>test</b> procedure to examine whether the extinction context gained inhibitory properties for rats given DCS prior to extinction. With three different footshock intensities, there was no evidence that DCS promoted accrual of associative inhibition to the extinction context (Experiment 4). The present findings demonstrate that DCS does not facilitate extinction by reducing CS processing or causing the extinction context to become a conditioned inhibitor. Investigations into the mechanisms underlying the augmentation of extinction by DCS are valuable for understanding how fear can be inhibited...|$|E
40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is {{more prevalent in}} women than men. PTSD is characterized by overgeneralization of fear to innocuous stimuli and involves impaired inhibition of learned fear by cues that predict safety. While evidence indicates that learned fear inhibition through extinction differs in males and females, less is known about sex differences in fear discrimination and safety learning. Here we examined auditory fear discrimination in male and female rats. In Experiment 1 A, rats underwent 1 - 3 days of discrimination training consisting of one tone predicting threat (CS+; presented with footshock) and another tone predicting safety (CS-; presented alone). Females, but not males, discriminated between the CS+ and CS- after one day of training. After 2 - 3 days of training, however, males discriminated whereas females generalized between the CS+ and CS-. In Experiment 1 B, females showed enhanced anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity in the open field, although these results were unlikely to explain the sex differences in fear discrimination. In Experiment 2, we found no differences in shock sensitivity between males and females. In Experiment 3, males and females again discriminated and generalized, respectively, {{after three days of}} training. Moreover, fear generalization in females resulted from impaired safety learning, as shown by a <b>retardation</b> <b>test.</b> Whereas subsequent fear conditioning to the previous CS- retarded learning in males, females showed no such retardation.

Whether withholding of responding to the conditional stimulus (CS) reflects nicotine functioning as a conditioned inhibitor is unknown. Accordingly, the present research sought to determine whether nicotine trained as a negative feature passed the retardation-of-acquisition and summation tests, thus characterizing it as a pharmacological (interoceptive) conditioned inhibitor. In the <b>retardation</b> <b>test,</b> rats received either nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) negative feature training in which the drug state signaled when a 15 -sec light CS would not be paired with sucrose; light was paired with sucrose on intermixed saline sessions. Following acquisition of the discrimination, both groups received nicotine CS training in which sucrose was intermittently available on nicotine but not intermixed saline sessions. Acquisition of conditioned responding to the nicotine CS was slower in the nicotine negative feature group than in the chlordiazepoxide negative feature group. In the summation test, rats were assigned to either the nicotine negative feature group or a pseudoconditioning control. In this control, the light CS was paired with sucrose on half the nicotine and half the saline sessions. Both groups also received excitatory training in which a white noise CS was paired with sucrose. The summation test consisted of presenting the white noise in conjunction with nicotine. Conditioned responding evoked by the white noise was decreased in the negative feature but not the pseudoconditioning group. Combined, the results provide the first evidence that an interoceptive stimulus (nicotine) can become a conditioned inhibitor...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} the preoperative demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological variables that could predict postoperative seizure outcome {{in a group}} of pediatric epileptic patients. We studied 40 consecutive pediatric patients, ages ranging from 6 to 16 years, that underwent resective surgery for the treatment of medically intractable epilepsy at the Clinical Hospital of RibeirA o pound Preto School of Medicine. We performed ictal electroencephalography (EEG), interictal EEG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a preoperative neuropsychological assessment in the presurgical workup. The following factors were correlated with seizure outcome: (1) duration of epilepsy, (2) surgery localization, (3) localized Neuropsychological (NPS) Evaluation, (4) ictal EEG, (5) interictal EEG, and (6) MRI. Mental <b>retardation,</b> NPS <b>tests,</b> and the other demographic variables failed to correlate with seizure reduction. The identification of predictor variables of epilepsy surgery outcome could improve the epileptic prognosis and guarantee the children`s full potential development.

40|$|A {{sample of}} 140 {{children}} exhibiting neurologic disturbances (93 suffering from epilepsy and 47 with delayed psychomotor development or mental <b>retardation)</b> was <b>tested</b> for {{the activity of}} some lysosomal enzymes. A partial deficiency of arylsulfatase A (ASA) in leucocytes (activities lower than 60 % of the control average) was detected in 36 patients (25. 7 %), whereas few ASA-deficient individuals (1. 4 %) {{were found in the}} control sample of 71 healthy children. Therefore, the frequency of ASA deficiency is abnormally high in our sample of pediatric patients. ASA activity levels were also assayed on fibroblasts from 12 of the 36 ASA-deficient patients; the mean activity in these cells was 20 % of the control average. Excretion of urinary sulfatides was not increased in the tested ASA-deficient patients (10 / 36). Clinical symptoms of these ASA-deficient patients bore no resemblance to classical metachromatic leucodystrophy (MLD), but resemble literature cases labeled as atypical MLD or diagnostic puzzles. This result suggests that reduced ASA activity might be associated with an increased risk of developing neurologic or neuropsychiatric disturbances in children...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPost-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is {{more prevalent in}} women than men. PTSD is characterized by overgeneralization of fear to innocuous stimuli and involves impaired inhibition of learned fear by cues that predict safety. While evidence indicates that learned fear inhibition through extinction differs in males and females, less is known about sex differences in fear discrimination and safety learning. Here we examined auditory fear discrimination in male and female rats. In Experiment 1 A, rats underwent 1 – 3 days of discrimination training consisting of one tone predicting threat (CS+; presented with footshock) and another tone predicting safety (CS−; presented alone). Females, but not males, discriminated between the CS+ and CS− after one day of training. After 2 – 3 days of training, however, males discriminated whereas females generalized between the CS+ and CS−. In Experiment 1 B, females showed enhanced anxiety-like behaviour and locomotor activity in the open field, although these results were unlikely to explain the sex differences in fear discrimination. In Experiment 2, we found no differences in shock sensitivity between males and females. In Experiment 3, males and females again discriminated and generalized, respectively, {{after three days of}} training. Moreover, fear generalization in females resulted from impaired safety learning, as shown by a <b>retardation</b> <b>test.</b> Whereas subsequent fear conditioning to the previous CS− retarded learning in males, females showed no such retardation. These results suggest that, while females show fear discrimination with limited training, they show fear generalization with extended training due to impaired safety learning...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{structural}} {{similarity between}} {{low molecular weight}} protamine (LMWP), prepared by enzymatic digestion of protamine, and HIV-TAT protein transduction peptide suggested the feasibility of LMWP as an efficient carrier for delivering therapeutic genes while alleviating the cytotoxicity of currently employed gene carriers. Methods LMWP was prepared by enzymatic digestion of protamine with thermolysine. The prepared LMWP peptide and TAT peptide, {{as well as their}} complexes with plasmid DNA (pDNA), were examined for cellular uptake behaviors by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The complexation of pDNA and LMWP was monitored by gel <b>retardation</b> <b>test</b> as well as size and zeta potential measurements, and was then further assessed by DNase I protection assay. The transfection efficiency of pDNA/LMWP was examined by varying the pDNA content and charge ratio in the complex, and then compared with that of pDNA/PEI. Cytotoxicity induced by pDNA/LMWP and pDNA/PEI was also examined. Results Prepared LMWP showed similar transcellular localization behavior and kinetics to those of TAT, and efficiently transferred the pDNA into nucleus and cytoplasm in a short time period. The size and zeta potential of the pDNA/LMWP complex were 120 nm and 30 mV, respectively, which were adequately suitable for cellular uptake. After forming the complex, LMWP appeared to effectively protect pDNA against DNase I attack. The pDNA/LMWP complex showed significantly enhanced gene transfer than both naked pDNA and the pDNA/PEI complex, while exhibiting a markedly reduced cytotoxicity than that of the pDNA/PEI complex. Conclusions The present study suggested that LMWP could be a useful and safe tool for enhancing delivery of bioactive molecules and therapeutic DNA products into cells when applied in gene therapy.

40|$|When an {{individual}} perceives a situation or stimulus as anxiety-provoking they may react behaviourally; often actions {{are carried out}} that {{make it possible for}} the individual to cope with the anxiety. Thus, the individual comes to associate the elicited behaviour with a decrease in anxiety. Potentially, when such behaviours are carried out, conditioned inhibitors, or safety signals, are generated. On theoretical grounds, these are expected to help maintain and secondarily reinforce the behaviour. The current thesis examined both conditioned inhibition and the learning of stimulus–response associations in both a healthy sample and a clinical sample of participants with anxiety disorder and/or problems with substance abuse. Two novel tasks were developed and one previously used task was used to examine conditioned inhibition, Negative Images CI Task: <b>Retardation</b> <b>Test,</b> Negative Images CI Task: Summation Test and ‘Mission to Mars’ CI Task: Summation test respectively. Four response inhibition tasks were developed to examine any accuracy or reaction time differences to neutral and emotional stimuli: Emotional Stroop Task, Go/No-Go Words Task, Go/No-Go OCD Colour Images Task, Go/No-Go Black and White Images Task. Performance on all of the tasks was correlated with individual differences in anxiety as measured by questionnaires: HADS, MOCI, BIS/BAS and the EPQR-S. The results from the healthy sample tested showed clear evidence of discrimination learning, as well as conditioned inhibition as measured by both retardation and summation tests. There were also response inhibition differences on the Emotional Stroop, a classic Stroop effect, less accurate and slower for colour incongruent words compared to other word-types, and more accurate and quicker responses to negative and OCD related words. There were no response inhibition differences on any of the Go/No-Go tasks. Further to this, in general, individual differences in anxiety as measured by the HADS, MOCI, BIS/BAS and EPQR-S were related to performance on the tasks. The hypothesis was that individuals formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder would show better conditioned inhibition and response inhibition deficits. Recruitment for the clinical sample was unexpectedly difficult and therefore the sample size provides only preliminary data. The results from the clinical sample tested showed no difference in performance on any of the tasks; thus a formal clinical diagnosis of either an anxiety disorder or substance abuse disorder did not measurably impact on performance. However, overall the clinical group did not show discrimination learning or conditioned inhibition. On the Emotional Stroop Task the clinical sample showed a classic Stroop effect for accuracy and was also more accurate for negative words but {{there was no difference in}} latencies. There were no differences in performance on any of the Go/No-Go tasks. Across all of the tasks the clinical sample demonstrated a relationship between task stimuli and individual differences as measured by the HADS, MOCI, BIS/BAS and EPQR-S related to performance. The results from the current tasks demonstrated that inhibitory processes are influenced or affected by individual differences in anxiety in a healthy sample; in particular certain measures either positively or negatively influence performance. In order for this to be fully conclusive all of the tasks carried out need to be tested in a larger clinical sample. The results have implications for psychological treatments, for example, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is based on associative learning principles, if safety signals were identified in the maintenance of the anxiety these could be incorporated into therapy and aid the breakdown of negative associations formed.

40|$|Genome-wide {{analysis}} of DNA copy-number changes using microarray-based technologies has enabled {{the detection of}} de novo cryptic chromosome imbalances in approximately 10 % of individuals with mental retardation. So far, {{the majority of these}} submicroscopic microdeletions/duplications appear to be unique, hampering clinical interpretation and genetic counselling. We hypothesised that the genomic regions involved in these de novo submicroscopic aberrations would be candidates for recurrent copy-number changes in individuals with mental <b>retardation.</b> To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for copy number changes at eight genomic candidate regions in a European cohort of 710 individuals with idiopathic mental retardation. By doing so, we failed to detect additional submicroscopic rearrangements, indicating that the anomalies tested are non-recurrent in this cohort of patients. The break points flanking the candidate regions did not contain low copy repeats and/or sequence similarities, thus providing an explanation for its non-recurrent nature. On the basis of these data, we propose that the use of genome-wide microarrays is indicated when testing for copy-number changes in individuals with idiopathic mental retardation...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{is clear}} that the speci c {{antigenic}} reactivityof antiphospholipid(aPL) antibodies is critical to their effect, the pathogenicmechanisms that result in injury in vivo are incompletelyunderstood. We hyphothesized that aPL antibodies targeted to the placenta activate complement locally, generating split products that mediate placental injury and lead to foetal loss and growth <b>retardation.</b> To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, we used a murine model of APS in which pregnant mice are injected with human IgG containing aPL antibodies. Mice treated with inhibitors of complement activation and mice de cient in complement components were protected from aPL antibody-inducedfoetal damage. Although the cause of tissue injury in this disease is probably multifactoral, we have shown that complement activation is an absolute requirement for foetal loss and growth restriction and, therefore, that this pathway acts upstream of other important effector mechanisms. Identi cation of complement activation as a mechanism that is necessary for aPL-induced tissue damage and de nition of the complement components necessary to trigger such injury is likely to lead to a better understandingof the pathogenesis of vascular and tissue injury in SLE and to new and improved treatments.
