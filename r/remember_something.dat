Kilala and Rei go {{to the world of}} The Little Mermaid. Unlike their trip to Snow White's world, however, they retain their true clothes, but are able to breathe underwater. Ariel, Flounder, Spot, Sebastian and Scuttle help Kilala find a sick Rei. While Kilala and Ariel set off to find white crown seaweed to cure Rei, he is later {{captured}} by Ursula who intends to marry him and become a Queen. Kilala sets off to find Ursula's lair. Ursula tells her that Rei is really a Prince and should marry a suitable bride. An injured Flounder tells Ariel of Kilala and Rei's situation; Ariel then attempts to make her way to Kilala, but Flounder collapses out of exhaustion. Ariel then remembers what she'd learned about love, and sang to encourage Kilala to fight further. with encouragement from Ariel's song, Kilala defeats Ursula with the Tiara- She questions Rei about his identity as a prince and he confirms that he is a Prince of somewhere he can't remember, but he is still himself. Ariel gives Kilala an aquamarine gemstone as token to their friendship, which turns {{out to be one of}} the magic gems to be acquired by the Tiara. Kilala's parents come home from Paradiso after their long absence, only to tell Kilala that the kingdom is under attack and they barely got out. This makes Rei remember that he is actually the Prince of Paradiso and questions why he couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>something</b> so important before. He gives Kilala the Tiara and promises to return for it soon. He leaves on a ship back to Paradiso.|$|E
500|$|The Sesame Street episode (#1839) {{in which}} the death of Mr. Hooper was {{discussed}} was structured as all episodes were structured at the time, with individual segments that {{took place on the}} main brownstone set (called [...] "street scenes") and interrupted by inserts, or puppet skits, short films, and animations. The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful <b>remember</b> <b>something</b> that had made him happy; as Davis states, [...] "Later, Big Bird forgets something that makes him sad". After several inserts, Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, he answers, [...] "Just because". Later, Big Bird listens to the adults conversing about a new baby who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to <b>remember</b> <b>something</b> important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter, {{who tries}} to shave Quagmire's cat in the episode, ends up killing it and cutting it six times because of the legend of cats having nine lives. As he is arresting Brian, one of the police {{officers}} states {{that he will not}} release him since he is a [...] "family guy". In their campaign, Brian and Stewie perform their musical number, '"A Bag o' Weed", to the tune of [...] "Me Ol' Bamboo" [...] as featured in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. During the song, a picture of Woody Harrelson is shown. Harrelson also wanted marijuana legalized. Towards the end of the musical number Shaggy from the television show Scooby Doo can be seen among the crowd, referencing a number of jokes about his stoned-like demeanor. After cannabis is legalized, its effects include phenomenal ratings for Doctor Who. Peter then tries to <b>remember</b> <b>something</b> but ends up remembering the names of celebrities whom he does not like. While helping out with Carter's smear campaign, Peter comes up with an advertisement that involves Adolf Hitler claiming that the Holocaust was started by smoking cannabis. The campaign is then dropped after Carter informs Peter that Fox News holds Hitler's image rights and they cannot smear it. He later tries to film a new advertisement which informs that unlike the events of the film Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, he made it there earlier since he was not stoned. He then says Neil Patrick Harris was cast on How I Met Your Mother based on his work in that film, and brings up a point that confuses him: since Josh Radnor is already an adult, why is the narrator of the show voiced by Bob Saget? Carter later tells Brian that he will release his novel with an Oprah's Book Club induction.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on {{the goal}} at the time, Manchester United's manager Alex Ferguson stated, [...] "I've {{never seen it}} done, Everyone is {{scratching}} their heads {{in the dressing room}} to try and <b>remember</b> <b>something</b> similar. Pelé in 1970 is the only one." [...] Coincidentally, the goal was also Manchester United's 300th Premier League goal.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a trip to}} the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1975, Merritt {{conceived}} the idea of wrapping the Pentagon with a mile of ribbon to recall (in Merritt's words) [...] "that we love the earth and its people," [...] which is analogous with tying a string around one's finger to <b>remember</b> <b>something.</b> The event took place on August 4, 1985, the 40th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
