25|$|The English squadrons {{rallied to}} the main fleet. By the end of August the Allies had 90 vessels {{cruising}} the Channel – temporary French control {{had come to an}} end. Torrington had been sent to the Tower of London to await a court martial at Chatham. The substance of the charge was that he had withdrawn and kept back, had not done his utmost to damage the enemy and to assist his own and the Dutch ships. Torrington blamed the defeat on the lack of naval preparations and intelligence – he had not been informed that the Brest fleet had been reinforced with the Toulon squadron. He also contended that the Dutch had engaged too early, before they had reached the head of the French line. To the outrage and astonishment of William and his ministers – and the delight of the English seamen who, <b>rightly</b> <b>or</b> wrongly, regarded him as a political sacrifice to the Dutch – the court acquitted him. Torrington took up his seat in the House of Lords but William refused to see him and dismissed him from the service on 12 December (O.S). Torrington was temporarily replaced by a triumvirate of Sir Henry Killigrew, John Ashby and Sir Richard Haddock; these were in turn replaced by Admiral Russell as sole commander of the English fleet.|$|E

500|$|In February 1940 Welles {{supplied}} Mankiewicz with 300 {{pages of}} notes {{and put him}} under contract to write the first draft screenplay {{under the supervision of}} John Houseman, Welles's former partner in the Mercury Theatre. Welles later explained, [...] "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine." [...] Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, [...] "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions.

500|$|Until {{the early}} 14th century, the {{interior}} of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire, which caused the piers that supported it to show signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by inverted arches of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a choir screen. The bracing arches are known as [...] "St Andrew's Cross arches", in a reference to the patron saint of the cathedral. They have been described by Wim Swaan – <b>rightly</b> <b>or</b> wrongly – as [...] "brutally massive" [...] and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} plates {{of the war}} grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images {{typically}} show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, {{the distinction between the}} Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell to which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, Con razon ó sin ella can mean with or without reason, <b>rightly</b> <b>or</b> wrongly, or for something or for nothing. Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the [...] "heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime". There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost.|$|E

2500|$|South Carolinian George McDuffie popularized the [...] "Forty Bale theory" [...] {{to explain}} South Carolina's {{economic}} woes.

The tariffs applied to imports of goods such as iron, wool and finished cotton products. The Forty Bale theory was based on faulty math, as Britain could sell finished cotton goods made from Southern raw cotton around the world, {{not just to the}} United States. Still, the theory was a popular explanation for economic problems that were caused in large part by overproduction of cotton in the Deep South competing with South Carolina's declining crops because of its depleted soil. South Carolinians, <b>rightly</b> <b>or</b> wrongly, blamed the tariff for the fact that cotton prices fell from 18 cents a pound to 9 cents a pound during the 1820s.|$|E
2500|$|During the 15 years {{following}} the war, Beckett produced four major full-length stage plays: En attendant Godot (written 1948–1949; Waiting for Godot), Fin de partie (1955–1957; Endgame), Krapp's Last Tape (1958), and Happy Days (1961). These plays—which are often considered, <b>rightly</b> <b>or</b> wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called [...] "Theatre of the Absurd"—deal in a very blackly humorous way with themes {{similar to those of}} the roughly contemporary existentialist thinkers. The term [...] "Theatre of the Absurd" [...] was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and Godot were centerpieces of the book. Esslin claimed these plays were the fulfilment of Albert Camus's concept of [...] "the absurd"; this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labeled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded his own philosophy). Though many of the themes are similar, Beckett had little affinity for existentialism as a whole.|$|E
