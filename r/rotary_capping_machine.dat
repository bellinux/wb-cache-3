40|$|There is a {{requirement}} (within the food packaging industry) for a greater analytical knowledge and more scientific understanding of the ROPP capping process and of the interaction of caps (closures) with the threaded part of the glass container (finish). Threads used within the industry have largely developed empirically from metal thread profiles. An improved understanding is needed so that problems associated with that process can be better understood and solved. Such problems can be manifest in damaged closures, ‘spinners’ and closures that are just too difficult to open. The term ‘spinners’ is used for closures that do not break the pilfer band (a tamper evident safety feature) when twisted. The same term {{is also used to}} describe closures that have been turned the wrong way (i. e. clockwise) on opening, stripping the thread whilst not breaking the pilfer band. To combat this problem it is desirable to produce a closure system that has a high torque when twisted in the wrong direction (known as the over torque) whilst maintaining good seal integrity and a low torque for correct opening procedure. A successful feasibility study was carried out to investigate the appropriateness of using finite element techniques to investigate closure systems and gain the required understanding to improve these systems. The follow on project utilised these finite element techniques and experimental testing using a single-head <b>capping</b> <b>machine.</b> The Project focuses on the industry standard glass thread finish called the GF 305 that utilises an extra deep, aluminium ROPP closure.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the <b>cap.</b> This <b>machine</b> is hand doffed.|$|R

Modelguns are available in display-only (or dummy version) and cap-firing versions. The cap-firing modelguns do not and cannot use conventional blank cartridges due to their construction different from the blank firers. Modelguns use small flexible plastic caps (usually from 5 to 7mm in diameter), that have a phosphorus composition filler.

30|$|I {{would never}} have {{expected}} to almost lose all my crystals brought to Brookhaven that day. I thought I was well prepared for the data collection because I had already carried out all the experimental procedures at home in Boston. The well-developed crystals were safely harvested from the tiny droplet into a large well with so-called cryo-protectant solution. These incubated crystals could then be fished up using a small nylon loop supported on a metal cap, and quickly flash frozen by mounting the cap on the diffractometer equipped with cold stream from liquid nitrogen, ready to shoot with X-rays. The problem arose when the cap was mounted on the machine by the magnetic force. On Bob’s machine, the magnet {{was so strong that}} the moment a crystal was put on, the force that attracted the <b>cap</b> on the <b>machine</b> shook the crystal off from the nylon loop, no matter how careful I was. We only had three crystals had left. The atmosphere, not the crystals, seemed frozen. Ellis suggested that everyone leave the room. He then turned to me and said: “Jia-huai, I am going to buy lunch for you. Just relaxed”. That did help reduce the tension! I used my right hand to fish crystal, at the same time I used my left hand to help hold the cap more smoothly and set the crystal on. A beautiful diffraction pattern showed up. This was our first 2.8 Å data set of TCR crystal! That would lead to our 1998 published study (Wang et al., 1998).|$|R
40|$|Assessment {{of liver}} {{fibrosis}} and steatosis {{is crucial in}} chronic liver diseases {{in order to determine}} the prognosis, the need of treatment, as well as monitor disease progression and response to treatment. Liver biopsy is limited by its invasiveness and patient acceptability. Transient elastography (TE, Fibroscan®) is a non-invasive tool with satisfactory accuracy and reproducibility to estimate liver fibrosis and steatosis. TE has been well validated in major liver diseases including chronic hepatitis B and C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. As alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is one of the major confounding factors of liver stiffness in chronic hepatitis B, an ALT-based algorithm has been developed and higher liver stiffness measurements (LSM) cutoff values for different stages of liver fibrosis should be used in patients with elevated ALT levels up to 5 times of the upper limit of normal. Otherwise falsely-high LSM results up to cirrhotic range may occur during ALT flare. TE is also useful in predicting patient prognosis such as development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), portal hypertension, post-operative complications in HCC patients, and also survival. Unfortunately, failed acquisition of TE is common in obese patients. Furthermore, obese patients may have higher LSM results even in the same stage of liver fibrosis. The new XL probe, a larger probe with lower ultrasound frequency and deeper penetration, increases the success rate of TE in obese patients. The median LSM value with XL probe was found to be lower than that by the conventional M probe, hence cutoff values approximately 1. 2 to 1. 3 kPa lower than those of M probe should be adopted. Recent studies revealed a novel ultrasonic controlled attenuation parameter (<b>CAP)</b> of the <b>machine</b> is a useful parameter to detect even low-grade steatosis noninvasively. CAP may also be used to quantify liver steatosis by applying different cutoff values. As both LSM and CAP results are instantly available at same measurement, this makes TE a very convenient tool to assess any patients who are suspected or confirmed to suffer from chronic liver diseases...|$|R
40|$|Making {{the most}} from your fruits Cue: We all have our {{favourite}} wild fruit fresh from the tree. The seasons may not last long, {{but there are plenty}} of ways that farmers can preserve and add value to their indigenous tree crops by making delicious jams, jellies and juices for sale. Ismaila Senghore was lucky enough to follow the wild fruits of the Gambia to the factory just outside Banjul, the capital, where they are processed into a range of tasty juices. Gamjuice is the business. Isaac Thomas is the owner. He has been juicing fruits for more than 10 years. Having seen the squeezing, mixing and brightly-labelled bottles - and of course, enjoying a taste or two! Ismaila learns that that juices are not just good to drink. They are also good for the local economy. Can you talk with a processor or trader to find out what they do, and how they keep the fruits in good condition. IN:	?Yes, we have about ten people? OUT:	?not me alone but any juice maker. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: So when it comes to juices, the message seems to be ?Drink local!? for your own health and that of the local economy. Gambian juicer Isaac Thomas was talking with Ismaila Senghore. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Thomas	We have about ten people on our staff and we have ladies because you know ladies too they are good at mixing and preparing the juice and this juice is like home made, it is not all the chemicals been added to it so they are good in preparing. Although they are trained, but they have their female touches and the like. Senghore	You are not only producing for the local market but also for the international consumer market. Thomas	Yes that is what we are doing. We are exporting, although a bit small, but we are exporting to our neighbour countries. Senghore	Can you estimate the number of bottles that you export or consume locally here? Thomas	I can say it is a small production factory and it is home made so we take our time. Senghore	In other words they would be happy just to have a taster of what Gambian juice is like? These are the people you target? Thomas	Those people that would admire our juice: hotels and restaurants. Senghore	We see that you have a variety of juices that you make. Now can you itemise them? Thomas	Yes we do all the local juices in the Gambia like Baobab juice, we do ginger, we do tamarind, and we do mango. So all our juices are foods that are available in the Gambia. And available in large quantities ? you just go to the market. And that will help the farmers. We are showing Gambians or showing the world that we can too, we can aim to do our own bottling, everything that has been produced and preserving it. Senghore	Now as your name implies GAMJUICE, you are into the promotion of locally produced juices, as you just mentioned, by processing the raw materials to add value to them. How do you collect the baobab fruit? Thomas	The baobab fruit, we just go to the market, and sometimes the villages will bring and sell it to us so we just buy it from them. Senghore	Let us now come to the production of baobab juice. If you really want to go into baobab juice as you do it here, how do you start and how do you end. What do you do step by step to get the product that you require? Thomas	Although there are some secrets in it but you have to extract the juice and you have to soak it, leave it for a while so that the fruit will be separated from the seed. And then you have to process it, heat it, so that the germs are eradicated and the like. Senghore	To pasteurise it. When you get the pasteurised juice what do you add to it? Do you add anything to flavour it, sugar? Thomas	No we just add sugar only because these are natural juice, they all have the flavours and the colour. It is more healthy than adding all these flavours and the like. Senghore	You may also want to have labels on it for marketing purpose and so forth. Make it attractive for the market. Thomas	Yes we do have that, we do have expiry dates which you can see on the labels. Senghore	To start such a business, expense, that go into it, would it be very capital intensive? Thomas	Yes it is a bit capital intensive. I started long years ago. I started as a small scale and now I am not in the large scale but in the medium scale. Bottles, the <b>capping</b> <b>machine,</b> they are expensive, labels are. So you need small capital. Senghore	What about individuals who may want to go into such a venture. Would it be easy for them and what kind of capital would you for-see? Thomas	The individual can go in for it. The only thing is that you know then you have to buy a lot of other machineries to enable you to do that. People should keep drinking local, healthy juices. They prevent you from a lot of diseases. It is natural, so it prevents you, it is a fact. So when you drink it you are healthier. Senghore	Well I have just tasted your juice, the carbonated one and it tasted really, really nice, maybe you would want to tell people to also consume our local made products because it is a way of getting our independence from the multi-laterals that dominate the market ? isn?t it? Thomas	Yes definitely I think that people should consume our local products. Because number one, it will help farmers over there so they are able to sell their products. And that will add to their health also. It is not like buying it but it is adding to your health. So that is what I would encourage the Gambians to go in and definitely patronise us the juice makers ? not me alone but any juice maker. End of track. Adding value to indigenous fruits and how to make a profit...|$|R

Mr. Mind forms an alliance with Lex Luthor who was actually transported to Earth-S while using a magic accumulator he had planned to use to destroy Superman. They manage to use the accumulator to turn Captain Marvel into Billy Batson by 'stealing' part of the lightning, and leave him inside a shark tank he had got into to capture Lex. However he is able to make the hammerhead shark break the tank using his sweater, allowing him to summon Captain Marvel. Mr. Mind is betrayed by Lex, who throws him to Captain Marvel, then escapes to Earth-1, but is then captured by Superman. Almost thirty years later, the Monster Society Of Evil was briefly reformed in Shazam! #14 (September-October 1974). An escaped Mr. Mind, hungry for revenge, assembled a new, smaller group. Although armed with a new and improved death ray that drew on their combined evil thoughts, they were no match for Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr., who used good thoughts to overcome them, and mashed the machine. They were all captured, except for Sivana who kidnapped Uncle Marvel. Sivana used another version of Mr. Mind's ray and Uncle Marvel's imagination to create combinations of imaginary beasts and himself, including a griffin, a winged elephant, and giant birds all with his head, after accidentally discovering its properties when he kicked it onto the sleeping Uncle's head. They could not be hurt by the Marvels as they were partly not real. However, when Uncle Marvel dreamt about the Marvel Family due to Jr. giving him a similar book about the Marvels that had pages soaked with sleeping potion, the dream versions defeated the monsters, and Sivana was sent to jail, while <b>Cap</b> destroyed the <b>machine,</b> making the dream Marvels fade away.
