This was Bartholomew's first major non-residential commission. The {{third and fourth}} floors consisted of rooms that could be rented, and {{that part of the}} building became a <b>residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>elderly</b> men of limited means. The second floor had meeting rooms, and the main floor had a lobby, gym, and residents' lounge. The basement had a swimming pool, weight room, and locker rooms.

In 2000, the percentage of three- or-four-generation co-habitation dropped below 50  % {{for the first time}} and further decreased to 40  % in 2010. At the same time, the percentage of elderly living independently experienced sustained growth, exceeding 40  % in 2010. There was a 72.3  % increase of the proportion of elderly couple households from 1990 to 2010, making it the fastest-growing type of <b>residence</b> model <b>for</b> the <b>elderly.</b> More elderly people prefer to live independently, and additionally, the migration of their children contributes to the decrease of the percentage of co-habitation with their parents.

Adopting structuration theories in the analysis of the case study, and taking inspiration from the philosophical tradition, especially in epistemology and in the analytic philosophy of law, an innovative perspective is adopted, which specifically acknowledges the role played by the communication processes in shaping both the attitudes of the involved actors and the social reality in which they are immersed. According to this perspective, three types of communication processes are presented, namely the normative, descriptive and constructive approach.

40|$|Environmental {{certification}} {{systems are}} tools {{for the evaluation}} of the sustainability of the buildings that are independent one from each other, different for contents, and for the applied methodology. International investors have asked for standardized certification systems to operate in the market with regard to both the phases of investment and management of the real estate. This created the need to compare the different environmental certification systems. The existence of different tools confuses the planner, whom wonders which environmental certification system is the most suitable for constructing new buildings or for the recovery of an existing building. The tendency is that of preferring a system to another based on its level of national adoption or based on individual competences and preferences. If a professional has already applied a system once, he is more driven to apply the same system for his future projects, as he is familiar with the themes and the evaluating methodology. Different researchers have compared these systems and in front of the different applied methodologies, it has emerged the need to use a certification system costumed for every plan proposal. The strong relationship between the environmental certification system {{and the development of a}} sustainable recovery project, led to the necessity to perform a preliminary analysis of the planning activity in order to pin-point the best fitting tool. This paper applies and compares three different environmental certification systems such as LEED, BREEAM and Protocol ITACA, to the project of recovery of the Sanitary <b>Residence</b> <b>for</b> <b>Elderly</b> (RSA) - Institute Configliachi (Padua). The historic building of the Configliachi Institute for blind people, find itself in a state of extreme decay and abandonment. It is located in the Arcella district, in the north of Padua, a strategic position with respect to the services in the area, to the main public transport networks (tram, railway, bus and motorway) and to the principal road knots of access to the city. This fact, with regard to the current strategy for the recovery and valorisation of the existing building capital, increases the interest for its reuse. The analysis carried out in this paper, focuses on the influences in choosing the project’s certification system, it highlights the relationship between the existing building, the certification system and the project and it outlines new specific professional skills. ...|$|E
