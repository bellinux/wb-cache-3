50|$|There is a smaller, {{semi-circular}} rim of a concentric, flooded crater {{within the}} main <b>rim,</b> <b>offset</b> towards the eastern edge. There is no central peak, but {{the floor is}} hilly and laced with a rille system named the Rimae Posidonius. The floor is also slightly bulged due to the past lava uplift, which also likely produced the complex of rilles. The northeast rim is interrupted by the smaller crater Posidonius B. Within the crater <b>rim,</b> <b>offset</b> just {{to the west of}} center is another smaller crater Posidonius A.|$|E
50|$|BMW offered both {{steel and}} light metal alloy wheels for the E28. The {{standard}} rim size is 6 J × 14 H2. Rims {{with an increased}} or reduced rim width of a half inch (12.7 mm) also fit. All rims have 22 mm positive <b>rim</b> <b>offset.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{formation}} {{has become}} eroded by many tiny impacts, leaving the features rounded and worn. Little {{of the original}} rim still stands above the surrounding terrain, leaving only a depression in the surface. The interior is relatively flat, with a rougher surface in the eastern half. There are several tiny craterlets on the crater interior, including a pair near the southwest inner wall and a small, bowl-shaped crater close to the eastern <b>rim.</b> <b>Offset</b> slightly to the northeast of {{the midpoint of the}} floor is a low central peak, now little more than a rounded hill.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is one of}} {{the least}} common types of brakes. They are mounted either on the same pivot points used for {{cantilever}} and linear-pull brakes or they can be mounted on four-bolt brake mounts found on many trials frames. [...] They were available on some high-end mountain bikes in the early 1990s, but declined in popularity with the rise of disc brakes. [...] The moderate performance advantage (greater power and control) they offer over cable actuated <b>rim</b> brakes is <b>offset</b> by their greater weight and complexity.|$|R
50|$|The study {{indicates}} that the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone is a left-slip transtensional system {{similar to that of}} the Dead Sea fault zone on Earth. The magnitude of displacement across the fault zone is estimated to be 150-160 km, as indicated by the <b>offset</b> <b>rim</b> of an old impact basin. If normalizing the magnitude of the slip to the surface area of the planet, the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone has a displacement value significantly larger than that of the Dead Sea fault, and slightly larger than that of the San Andreas fault. The lack of significant deformation on both sides of the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone over a distance of 500 km suggests that the regions bounded by the fault behave as rigid blocks. This evidence essentially points to a large strike-slip system at a plate boundary, in terrestrial terms known as a transform fault.|$|R
