50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (<b>ram</b> <b>guide</b> chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a screw jack. Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such screw jack type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|E

The football program offers a residency program and year-round camps ranging from three days to five weeks in length and was formerly led by former NFL quarterback Chris Weinke. [...] The academy fielded a {{high school football team}} {{for the first time in}} 2013. In 2013, MaxPreps called IMG Academy the [...] "nation's top high school football facility." [...] The varsity team is now led by head coach Kevin Wright, who was named head coach in spring 2015 after Weinke accepted a position as quarterbacks coach with the Los Angeles <b>Rams.</b> Wright <b>guided</b> the program to its first undefeated regular season (9-0) in 2015.|$|R
5|$|Horvath {{was born}} to Croatian {{immigrants}} in South Bend, Indiana in 1921; his family soon moved to Parma, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Parma Senior High School starting in 1936 and played on the track, basketball and football teams until the 11th grade. He decided to switch schools because he felt his basketball teammates were not taking the sport seriously. Horvath's family relocated, and in 1938 he enrolled at James Ford Rhodes High School in Cleveland, one of Parma's rivals. Playing as a quarterback for the Rhodes <b>Rams,</b> Horvath <b>guided</b> the team to seven straight wins in 1938, but the team lost to West Technical High School {{for a chance to}} be the Cleveland Senate League's nomination to play in the city championship. He graduated in 1939.|$|R
40|$|DE 19840780 A UPAB: 20000502 NOVELTY - The sheets (1, 2) are {{positioned}} partially overlapping over a die (3) and pressed into a die aperture (5) by a press ram (4). A longitudinal axis (7) of the <b>ram</b> is <b>guided</b> {{about the axis}} of advance within a conical jacket, while the ram presses the overlapping sheet sections into the aperture. The ram is additionally rotated about its longitudinal axis. The die aperture has rigid or radially flexible wall sections. The ram has a flat or conical end face (8). USE - For connecting e. g. metal sheets, robot tools, hand tools. ADVANTAGE - Simpler process, requiring less power, especially suitable for use with robot tools, tools with wide working range (not less than 100 to 1000 mm), hand tools...|$|R
40|$|At the {{exploitation}} of dies the defections that occur, due mainly to non operating rules of exploration, the improperly conditions of the machine (press) in terms of cinematic precision and the wearing elements in relative motion (<b>ram</b> displacement, wearing <b>guides,</b> etc) as the incorrect mounting of dies on the press. When installing dies must consider several aspects. Among the techniques used, especially for restoring the active elements in the work area are rectified frontal surfaces, hard chromating, hardening with electric sparks and charging welding. Were restored active profile {{and size of the}} work active elements so after reconditioning they corresponded in terms of dimensional precision and resistance to wear, like initial element...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVenous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{the most}} preventable cause of in-hospital death. Hospital-related VTE is associated with over 50 % of VTE episodes occurring either during or after hospitalization. Selective thromboprophylaxis is the recommended approach for inpatients. Patient selection for thromboprophylaxis requires VTE risk stratification, including either the baseline disease plus additional risk factors or risk assessment standardized models (<b>RAM).</b> Risk categories <b>guide</b> the thromboprophylaxis selection to include general, mechanical, pharmacological, or combination measures. Although thromboprophylactic protocols have been available for decades, many patients at risk (20 % to 75 %) still do not receive the recommended thromboprophylaxis. This study purpose is to alert to the relevance of thromboprophylaxis and to guide the strategies to arrange hospital thromboprophylaxis programs in Brazilian settings...|$|R
50|$|The Rolling Airframe Missiles, {{together}} with the Mk 49 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) and support equipment, make up the <b>RAM</b> Mk 31 <b>Guided</b> Missile Weapon System (GMWS). The Mk-144 Guided Missile Launcher (GML) unit weighs 5777 kg and stores 21 missiles. The original weapon cannot employ its own sensors prior to firing {{so it must be}} integrated with a ship's combat system, which directs the launcher at targets. On American ships it is integrated with the AN/SWY-2 Ship Defense Surface Missile System (SDSMS) and Ship Self Defense System (SSDS) Mk 1 or Mk 2 based combat systems. SeaRAM, a RAM launcher variant equipped with independent sensors derived from the Vulcan Phalanx CIWS, is being installed on Littoral Combat Ships and certain Arleigh Burke-class destroyers.|$|R
60|$|The two first royal Georges, {{and their}} father, Ernest Augustus, had quite royal notions {{regarding}} marriage; and Louis XIV and Charles II scarce distinguished themselves more at Versailles or St. James’s, than these German sultans {{in their little}} city {{on the banks of}} the Leine. You may see at Herrenhausen the very rustic theatre in which the Platens danced and performed masques, and sang before the Elector and his sons. There are the very fauns and dryads of stone still glimmering through the branches, still grinning and piping their ditties of no tone, as in the days when painted nymphs hung garlands round them; appeared under their leafy arcades with gilt crooks, <b>guiding</b> <b>rams</b> with gilt horns; descended from “machines” in the guise of Diana or Minerva; and delivered immense allegorical compliments to the princes returned home from the campaign.|$|R

Gradually, {{he made his}} {{identity}} as a composer than a singer. He <b>guided</b> <b>Ram</b> Krishna Dhakal since his early age, in fact, Ram Krishna's first recorded song, [...] "Hamro Sundar Sansar" [...] ("हाम्रो सुन्दर संसार"), was composed by him. Another popular singer, Yam Baral, made his mark by Dinesh Subba's very popular composition [...] "Badalu ko Ghumto le" [...] ("बादलुको घुम्टोले"). He made numerous songs with other well known singers like Deep Shrestha, Arun Thapa, Prakash Shrestha, Sunita Subba, Sukmit Gurung, Pabitra Subba,Ushakiran Adhikari, Lochan Bhattarai, Kuber Rai, Uday Sotang, Rajesh Payal, Banika Pradhan,and Satya/Swarup Acharya.|$|R
