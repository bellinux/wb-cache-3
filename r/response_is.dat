5|$|The SOS <b>response</b> <b>is</b> {{the changes}} in gene {{expression}} in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS <b>response</b> <b>is</b> known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This <b>response</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell <b>response</b> <b>is</b> thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|In C. elegans this {{initiation}} <b>response</b> <b>is</b> amplified {{through the}} synthesis of a population of 'secondary' siRNAs during which the dicer-produced initiating or 'primary' siRNAs are used as templates. These 'secondary' siRNAs are structurally distinct from dicer-produced siRNAs and appear to be produced by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} tested the {{potential}} of teaching multiple response alternatives to mitigate resurgence of a target response. Two experimental arrangements were alternated. In one component a target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> reinforced, then an alternative <b>response</b> <b>was</b> reinforced while the target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> placed on extinction. In the final phase, both <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> placed on extinction. In the second component, a target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> reinforced, then four alternative <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> reinforced while the target <b>response</b> <b>was</b> placed on extinction. In the final phase, all <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> placed on extinction. Six of nine participants demonstrated lower resurgence of the target response following reinforcement of multiple response alternatives. The {{results of this study}} suggest teaching multiple <b>response</b> alternatives <b>is</b> a possible treatment strategy to mitigate response resurgence...|$|R

5|$|In humans, this <b>response</b> <b>is</b> {{activated}} by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the <b>response</b> <b>is</b> a result of signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results {{in the production of}} peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
5|$|Polyclonal B cell <b>{{response}}</b> <b>is</b> {{a natural}} mode of immune response {{exhibited by the}} adaptive immune system of mammals. It ensures that a single antigen is recognized and attacked through its overlapping parts, called epitopes, by multiple clones of B cell.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{even when}} blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long, but not when the days are short. This <b>response</b> <b>is</b> stronger when the feathers {{on top of the}} head are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin {{at the top of the}} head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A joint model fo r multivariate mixed ordinal and {{continuous}} <b>responses</b> <b>is</b> presented. In this model the ordinal <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> intercorrelated and also {{are dependent on}} the continuous <b>responses.</b> The likelihood <b>is</b> found and modified Pearson residuals, where the correlation between multivariate <b>responses</b> can <b>be</b> taken into account, are presented to find abnormal observations. The model is applied to a medical data, obtained from an observational study on women, where the correlated <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> the ordinal <b>response</b> of osteoporosis of the spine {{and continuous}} <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> body mass index and waist. The effect of some covariates on all <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> investigated simultaneously.

5|$|The NS-10 {{does not}} have a {{perfectly}} flat frequency response. The sound of the NS-10 is slightly heavy in the midrange, and like other sealed-box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a +5dB boost in the midrange at around 2kHz, and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200Hz. The midrange <b>response</b> <b>is</b> so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst-sounding to the human ear.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical <b>response</b> <b>is</b> an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a <b>response</b> <b>is</b> crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E

30|$|For both {{encoding}} {{items and}} problem-solving items, participants’ <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> coded for whether they correctly represented both slope and intercept. For items that required students to generate equations, slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the value provided as the slope {{in the equation}} was exactly correct, and intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the value provided as the intercept in the equation was exactly correct. For items that required students to generate graphs, intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if the graph intersected the correct point on the y-axis. Slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if a straight line calculated with the intercept and the last point of the graph had the correct gradient. For the item in which {{students were asked to}} identify the slope and intercept terms in an equation, <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they correctly identified the appropriate terms. For the item in which students were asked to write a sentence explaining how the terms in the equation related to the graph, slope <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they conveyed how the slope term in the equation related to the slope of the graph, and intercept <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> considered correct if they conveyed how the intercept term in the equation related to the intercept of the graph.|$|R
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired <b>response</b> <b>is</b> achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the <b>response</b> <b>is</b> received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{timing offset}} (BTO) — The time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent {{from the ground}} station and when the <b>response</b> <b>is</b> received. This measure is twice {{the distance from the}} ground station to satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station (the latter two times are constant and can be calculated and removed). This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft and results in a ring on the Earth's surface that is equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance.|$|E

5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their <b>response</b> <b>is</b> to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock <b>response</b> <b>is</b> the {{physiological}} response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, or groups {{of one or more}} sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress <b>response</b> <b>is</b> significantly lowered {{in the presence of a}} bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E

In {{the present}} study, memory CD 4 T cell <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> analyzed in different models of Ag-specific immune responses differing on Ag exposure and/or persistence. Ag-specific CD 4 T cell responses for tetanus toxoid, HSV, EBV, CMV, and HIV- 1 were compared. Three distinct patterns of T cell <b>response</b> <b>were</b> observed.

5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional <b>response</b> <b>is</b> very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E
5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This <b>response</b> <b>is</b> mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this <b>response</b> <b>is</b> the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity.
