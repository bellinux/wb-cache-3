40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis was {{isolated}} from dried tobacco residues and dead tobacco beetles (Lasioderma serricorne (F.); Coleoptera: Anobiidae) {{collected in a}} large number of locations worldwide. Eighty-eight samples of stored tobacco were analyzed and yielded 78 B. thuringiensis strains which were characterized on the basis of parasporal crystal morphology, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles, and the results of an immunoblot analysis of the insecticidal crystal proteins. Flagellar antigen identification was used to differentiate selected isolates. Strains that produced <b>rhomboidal</b> <b>crystals</b> associated with the Coleoptera-specific pathotype (Cry III group) were the most abundant strains (59 % of the isolates). Preliminary toxicity assays were performed with L. serricorne larvae, and the results suggested that activity is not restricted to isolates related to the Coleoptera-specific group. The results of our survey indicate that B. thuringiensis is part of the natural microflora in the stored-tobacco environment and that this special habitat represents a source of B. thuringiensis isolates that may be used to control stored-product pests...|$|R

Los caracteres comúnes encontrados para la familia son: laticíferos o células secretoras, abundancia de células pétreas en el líber duro, radios finos, súber con paredes en forma de "U" y drusas o cristales solitarios romboides. Dado el orígen polifilético de la familia Euphorbiaceae, los caracteres comunes encontrados pueden ser atribuidos al hábito arbóreo de las especies estudiadas. This study {{analyzes}} the anatomical {{structure of the}} barks of 16 species of forestal trees of the Euphorbiaceace family from the rain forest of the Venezuelan Guayana. The shared characters found were: laticiferous or secretory cells, profusion of stone cells in hard bast, thin rays, suber with "U" shaped wall thickenings and druses or solitary <b>rhomboidal</b> <b>crystals.</b> Due to the polyphyletic origin of the Euphorbiaceae family, the shared characters found {{may be attributed to}} the arboreal habit of the studied species...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The present {{work was}} carried out to perform the morphoanatomical and {{physicochemical}} evaluation of Casuarina equisetifolia L. stem bark. Method: The pharmacognostic {{studies were carried out}} in terms of organoleptic, macroscopic, microscopic, fluorescence analysis and physicochemical parameters. Results: The bark consists of channelled, curved, slightly quilled, usually 0. 2 – 0. 8  cm thick, lenticellate pieces with outer surface ash-grey to greyish-brown and internal surface light yellow to deep dirty brown coloured having no odour and astringent taste. The main microscopic characteristics of the bark include phellem (2 – 5 or more layers of cork), phellogen (3 – 5 layered) followed by 12 – 18 layered phelloderm. Other important microscopic components observed include phloem parenchyma, phloem fibre and stone cells. Stem bark powder showed thick walled oval to polygonal cork cells, hexagonal phelloderm cells, rectangular thin walled cortex cells, thick walled elongated phloem fibres, lignified stone cells and <b>rhomboidal</b> <b>crystals</b> of calcium oxalate. Further, physicochemical analysis of the bark power showed loss on drying, total ash, water soluble ash, acid insoluble ash and sulphated ash as 2. 3, 5. 0, 1. 6, 0. 7 and 5. 7 % w/w respectively. The alcohol and water soluble extractives values of the stem bark were 17. 10 and 11. 0 % w/w respectively. Conclusion: Various pharmacognostic characters observed in this study helps in botanical identification and standardization of C. equisetifolia L. in crude form...|$|R
40|$|The morphologies of U metal {{samples from}} {{deposits}} produced by electrorefining of Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) spent fuel were examined using scanning electron microscopy, energy- and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and metallography. The morphologies were analyzed to find correlations with {{the chemistry of}} the samples, the ER run conditions, and the deposit performance. A rough correlation was observed between morphology and Zr concentration; samples with Zr contents greater than approximately 200 ppm showed fine-grained, polycrystalline dendritic morphologies, while samples with Zr contents less than approximately 100 ppm were comprised of agglomerations or linked chains of <b>rhomboidal</b> single <b>crystals.</b> There were few correlations found between morphology, run conditions, and deposit performance...|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} 3, 237 plant samples, mainly {{leaves of}} various trees, from many provinces in Korea {{and a total}} of 1, 925 Bacillus thuringiensis isolates were obtained and characterized. The isolates were characterized in terms of crystal morphology, PAGE pattern of the toxin proteins, plasmids pattern, biochemical characteristics, and bioassay. The microscopic observation showed that 49. 1 % of the isolates have bipyramidal shape crystals, 7. 1 % of spherical shape crystals, 1. 4 % of <b>rhomboidal</b> shape <b>crystals,</b> and others have small or amorphous inclusions. The insecticidal activities of the spore-crystal mixtures of isolates were tested against Plutella xylostella, Bombyx mori, Culex pipiens, and Agelastica coerulea. Bioassay showed that 51. 3 % of the isolates were shown to be activelepidopteran-specific (44. 8 %), dipteran-specific(4. 9 %) and coleopteran-specific (1. 6 %). The remainder(48. 8 %) did not show any activity against the insects we tested. Interestingly though, some of these non-active isolates were shown to have bipyramidal crystals. By serotyping 22 isolates of our collection, we found that there are various kind of subspecies such as aizawai, amagiens, canadensis, darmstadiensis, galleriae, finitimus, kurstaki, morrisoni and neoleonensis, and three isolates have been classified into a new serotype, H 49, and one of them, the type strain, named subsp. muju. From this study it was found that phylloplane is a good source for the isolation of Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus thuringiensis is distributed widely in Korea. ope...|$|R
40|$|Cobalt ferrite (CoFe₂O₄, CFO) nanoplatelets with a rhomboidal shape were {{synthesized}} {{through a}} facile hydrothermal route using {{a very low}} concentration precursor at low temperatures. The effects of reaction temperature and time on the morphologies {{as well as the}} sizes of the products were systemically investigated. The as-synthesized CFO nanocrystals showed a special <b>rhomboidal</b> shape with <b>crystal</b> growth along the (111) direction. The very low concentration precursor {{plays an important role in}} forming CFO nanocrystals with such special shape and ultrafine size. The single-phase CFO nanoplatelets synthesized at 180 [*]°C with size of 17 [*]nm present high saturation magnetization (79. 7 [*]emu/g) and high coercivity (3100 [*]Oe). The preparation conditions have significant effects on the crystal size and shape, magnetization and relaxation activation of the CFO nanoplatelets.

40|$|Marine {{concrete}} {{structures are}} exposed {{to one of the}} most hostile of natural environments. Many physical and chemical phenomena are usually interdependent and mutually reinforcing in the deterioration of marine exposed concrete: expansion and microcracking due to physical effects increases concrete permeability paving the way for harmful chemical interactions between seawater, concrete and embedded steel reinforcement. Early research in self-healing concrete has focused on the autogenous ability of hydrates to heal cracks over time, this form of healing is however restricted to early and small cross sectional crack width reductions, while limited research is available on the autogenous healing of concrete incorporating GBFS (Ground blast furnace slag). A novel approach to self-heal concrete is a bioinspired technique, where bacteria immobilized in the concrete are activated through crack induced water ingress, forming a mineral healing precipitate [1]. The current study characterises the autogenous healing of blast furnace slag cement (CEM III/B 42. 5 N) mortar cubes submerged in both fresh- and synthetic sea- water, as the first step towards developing a bacteria-based self-healing concrete for application in the marine environment. Compression tests of the mortar cubes showed their strength to be in good agreement with the Norm EN 196 - 1 [2]. ESEM analysis of the specimens after 54 days submersion revealed two distinctive surface crystal morphologies. Specimens submerged in fresh water displayed <b>rhomboidal</b> surface <b>crystals</b> 10 ?m thick, while those specimens submerged in synthetic seawater were covered in a 50 ?m carpet of spicules. EDS analysis showed the mineral to be calcium based, suggests the presence of two calcium carbonate polymorphs. FT-IR analysis of the surface precipitates supported observations made by ESEM, as those specimens submerged in fresh- and synthetic sea- water displayed spectra indicative of two calcium carbonate polymorphs, calcite and aragonite respectively. This research provides a valuable reference from where an improved bacteria-based system can later be developed for combating crack-induced deterioration of concrete in the marine environment...|$|R
