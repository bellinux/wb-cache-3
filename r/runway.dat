5|$|<b>Runway</b> 8/26 on Blue Grass Airport {{was closed}} on March 2009, {{and the new}} 4000 foot <b>runway,</b> <b>runway</b> 9/27, opened on August 4, 2010. This <b>runway</b> has been built on a {{separate}} location not connected to the <b>runway</b> 22.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's <b>runway</b> 22 for the takeoff, but used <b>runway</b> 26 instead. <b>Runway</b> 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} <b>runway</b> before it could become airborne. It crashed just past the end of the <b>runway,</b> killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
40|$|Male rats were {{observed}} {{on a clean}} table with extending <b>runways.</b> Paired comparisons were made with clean <b>runways,</b> those on which conspecifics had been stressed, and previously present but not stressed. The subjects stopped more frequently and for a longer duration on <b>runways</b> with predecessors than on clean ones. Stopping was more frequent on <b>runways</b> with stressed predecessors than with nonstressed predecessors. When <b>runways</b> from stressed predecessors were present, there was more frequent urination on the table than when those <b>runways</b> were not used, despite that in the former conditions the subjects spent considerably less time on the table than on the <b>runways...</b>|$|R
25|$|The redevelopment, when completed, {{will remove}} the two northwest–southeast <b>runways</b> (former 14/32 L/R), {{construct}} four additional east–west <b>runways</b> (10C/28C, 10R/28L, 9L/27R, and 9C/27C), {{and extend the}} existing east–west <b>runways</b> (9R/27L and 10L/28R). The two existing northeast–southwest (4/22 L/R) <b>runways</b> will be retained. Currently, {{three of the four}} new <b>runways</b> have been constructed (9L/27R, 10C/28C, and 10R/28L), and one of the two extensions (10L/28R) is complete.|$|R

5|$|ATC also {{advised that}} I-29 ran North and South just East {{of the airport}} they could land on if they didn't think they could make the <b>runway.</b> The pilot opted to try for the <b>runway</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|Airport runways {{are also}} de-iced by {{sprayers}} fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are {{wide enough to}} cross the entire <b>runway,</b> and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the <b>runway</b> is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|All runways {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a more durable {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last <b>runway</b> to be resurfaced. This <b>runway</b> is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is <b>runway</b> 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are runways 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short <b>runway</b> suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between the two sets of parallel runways was <b>runway</b> 14/32, which has been decommissioned. Runways 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The runways were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical shift in the planet's magnetic poles by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E
25|$|ILS is {{available}} for <b>runways</b> 4R, 15R, 22L, 27, and 33L, with <b>runways</b> 4R and 33L are certified for CAT III Instrument Landing operations. The other <b>runways</b> with ILS are certified for CAT I Instrument Landing operations. EMAS pads are located at the starting thresholds of <b>runways</b> 22R and 33L.|$|R

The layout of the parallel <b>runways</b> (01L/01R and 28R/28L) {{was established in the}} 1950s, and have a separation (centerline to centerline) of only [...]|$|R
50|$|There are ten {{airports}} in Sierra Leone, of which one has paved <b>runways</b> (the length of which exceeds 3047 m). Of the remaining airports, {{all of which}} having unpaved <b>runways,</b> seven have <b>runways</b> of lengths between 914 and 1523 m; the remaining two having <b>runways</b> of shorter length. There are two heliports in the country.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The <b>runway</b> is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. The hangar is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The <b>runway</b> was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the <b>runway.</b> In 1989, parts of the <b>runway</b> were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the <b>runway.</b> An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, a {{commercial}} jet at Blue Grass Airport was {{cleared for takeoff}} on <b>Runway</b> 22 but mistakenly took <b>Runway</b> 26 instead. Tower personnel noticed the mistake and canceled the aircraft's takeoff clearance just as the crew realized their error. The aircraft subsequently made a safe departure from <b>Runway</b> 22.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, a Learjet {{was cleared}} {{to take off}} at Blue Grass Airport on <b>runway</b> 22, but mistakenly turned onto <b>runway</b> 26. Takeoff {{clearance}} was canceled by the local controller {{prior to the start}} of the takeoff roll.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 long jump/triple jump <b>runways</b> and 2 {{pole vault}} <b>runways.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1999 estimates, {{there are}} 6 {{airports}} in Tonga. Of these, one has paved <b>runways,</b> the Fuaamotu International Airport on Tongatapu. Of the remaining airports, one has <b>runways</b> exceeding length 1,524 m, two have <b>runways</b> longer than 914 m, {{with the remaining}} two having <b>runways</b> shorter than 914 m. The airline of Tonga was Peau Vava'u.|$|R

5|$|Note: Prior to 1941, {{the runways}} {{did not have}} {{numerical}} designations. The <b>runway</b> now designated 13C/31C was designated 13R/31L from 1941 until 1989, when a new <b>Runway</b> 13R/31L was built. Runways 27L, 27R, 36L and 36R were closed by 1973.|$|E
5|$|<b>Runway</b> 09R/27L, the {{original}} and primary <b>runway,</b> is {{long enough to be}} able to receive the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a taxiway, <b>runway</b> 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its shorter length and width allow it to handle smaller aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when <b>runway</b> 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises it will be used more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO aprons. The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{immediate}} construction involved <b>runways</b> and airplane hangars, {{with concrete}} <b>runways,</b> several taxiways {{and a large}} parking apron and a control tower. The airfield had three asphalt <b>runways</b> {{laid out in a}} triangle pattern, 6000x150(N/S), 4574x150(E/W), 5001x150(NW/SE) ...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are five}} <b>runways</b> at ATL. All five <b>runways</b> are parallel, aligned east-west. 26R/08L and 26L/08R are {{north of the}} airport terminals, and 27R/09L, 27L/09R, and 28/10 are south of the airport terminals. From north to south, the <b>runways</b> are designated: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{expansion}} also {{resulted in}} the creation of a tunnel beneath <b>Runway</b> 06/24 along Virginia State Route 118. Completed between 1983 and 1985, it is maintained by the Roanoke Regional Airport Commission. The most recent <b>runway</b> refurbishment was completed in 2002, in addition to the relocating one of the taxiways to prevent <b>runway</b> incursions.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} set up {{a second}} committee in 1968 who suggested that the old eastwest <b>runway</b> be closed and the airport's area reduced, allowing for development {{to the east of}} the airport. They suggested that this is replaced by a new <b>runway</b> in the sea, adjacent to the beach. The <b>runway</b> was closed, and a high density upper-middle income neighborhood was built to the east of the airport, although the new <b>runway</b> was never constructed due to the high cost involved.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the second}} phase of expansion, the <b>runway</b> would be {{lengthened}} to , allowing jet aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 to land at Mysore Airport. The <b>runway</b> cannot be extended to the west {{because of the presence of}} a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided to hold off on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting the <b>runway</b> was justified.|$|E

5|$|All {{terminals}} and hangars were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west <b>runway</b> pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short <b>runway</b> (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.|$|E
