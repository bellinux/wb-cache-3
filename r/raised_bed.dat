25|$|The puna zone is {{composed}} of high, cold grasslands, suitable largely for pasture by camelids, the domesticated llama and alpaca, {{as well as the}} wild vicuña and guanaco. The former were used as not only as pack animals, but also for their meat and wool. Vicuñas and guanacos, though undomesticated, were used for their fine and much-prized wool. Little agriculture is performed in the puna, though in the Bolivian altiplano intensive agriculture was possible through the use of waru waru <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> agriculture, which used specialized irrigation techniques to prevent frost from destroying crops.|$|E
25|$|The {{heyday of}} {{parchment}} use {{was during the}} medieval period, {{but there has been}} a growing revival of its use among artists since the late 20th century. Although parchment never stopped being used (primarily for governmental documents and diplomas) it had ceased to be a primary choice for artist's supports by the end of 15th century Renaissance. This was partly due to its expense and partly due to its unusual working properties. Parchment consists mostly of collagen. When the water in paint media touches parchment's surface, the collagen melts slightly, forming a <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> for the paint, a quality highly prized by some artists.|$|E
25|$|Before the Bottom {{became a}} park, the <b>raised</b> <b>bed</b> {{of the rail}} line had largely {{separated}} the wetlands from the river. The south part of the wetlands had been altered by a sanitary landfill that the city acquired in 1969 to prevent its development as industrial land. The city later filled {{the north end of}} the park with debris from construction of Interstate 405 through downtown Portland. The plan in the early 1970s was to fill the rest of the wetlands and to use the space for museums, perhaps a motocross course, and a gondola lift to transport visitors from the top of the bluff to the park. Public pressure from the Audubon Society of Portland, the Sellwood-Moreland Improvement League, and The Nature Conservancy helped persuade the city to stop filling the wetlands. In 1988, after many years of debate, officials designated Oaks Bottom as the first urban wildlife refuge in Portland. Since then, Friends of Oaks Bottom, a volunteer group, has helped the city's parks department with trail maintenance, habitat restoration, and information services.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} compared two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping systems: paddy or <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> with continuous furrow irrigation; and trialled four cultivars: Starbonnet, Lemont, Amaroo and Ceysvoni, and one test line YRL 39; that may vary in adaptation to growth on <b>raised</b> <b>beds.</b> The grain yield of rice ranged from 740 to 1250 g/m(2) and was slightly greater in paddy than on <b>raised</b> <b>beds.</b> Although there were early growth responses to fertilizer nitrogen on <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> the crop nitrogen content at maturity mostly exceeded 20 g/m(2) in both systems, so nitrogen {{was unlikely to}} have limited yield. Ceysvoni yielded best in both systems, a result of good post-anthesis growth and larger grain size, although its whole-grain mill-out percentage was poor relative to the other cultivars. Starbonnet and Lemont yielded poorly on <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> associated with too few tillers and too much leaf area. When grown on <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> all cultivars experienced a delay in anthesis resulting in more tillers, leaf area and dry weight at anthesis, and probably a greater yield potential. The growth of rice after anthesis, however, was similar on <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> and in paddy, so reductions in harvest index and grain size on <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> were recorded. The data indicated that water supply was not a major limitation to rice growth on <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> but slower crop development was an issue that would affect the use of <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> in a cropping system, especially in rice-growing areas where temperatures are too cool for optimal crop development.

40|$|Quantifying {{the process}} and the amount of acid-contaminant {{released}} to the surroundings is important in assessing the environmental hazards associated with reclaiming acid sulphate soils (ASS). The roles of surface runoff and bypass flow (i. e. the rapid downward flow of free water along macropores through an unsaturated soil matrix) in transporting aluminum from three types of <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> (soil ridges formed by piling up soil materials excavated from adjacent ditches) were studied in a Typic Sulfaquept in Can Tho, Vietnam. During the month of April, 1 h cumulative infiltration of the low <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> (made only of the topsoil materials) and high <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> (made of topsoil and jarositic layers) was significantly higher than that of the traditional <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> (made of topsoil, jarositic and pyritic materials). As the rainfall season progressed, infiltration in July decreased four to seven-fold from the initial values in April, resulting in an increase in runoff. Due to surface crusting, the traditional <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> yielded the highest runoff (110 versus 50 – 60 mm in the other types in July). Aluminum concentrations in the bypass flow (6 – 22 mmol l- 1) associated with each of the three bed types were higher than in the runoff (3 – 14 mmol l- 1). In low and high <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> the amounts of aluminum transported by bypass flow (15 – 16 kmol ha- 1) was higher than in the runoff (4 – 6. 5 kmol ha- 1), while in the traditional type, the two components were similar (11 – 12 kmol ha- 1). The total amount of aluminum released from the low <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> was lowest. Low <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> thus pose less environmental hazards to the surroundings compared to the other two types. Interventions that affect the amount of aluminum transport in runoff and in bypass flow are important in balancing agricultural production and environmental protection in ASS area...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of leaching processes in <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> is useful in assessing management options for acid sulphate soils. Field and laboratory {{studies were carried out}} to quantify the effects of soil physical properties and bypass flow on leaching processes of new, 1 -year-old and 2 -year-old <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> for yam and pineapple cultivation in a Typic Sulfaquept in Tien Giang, Vietnam. The methylene blue staining technique was used to characterize the water-conducting pores in terms of number, stained area, and total pore perimeter at 10 cm depth intervals of six 1 x 1 m subplots. Undisturbed 20 cm x 25 cm soil cores taken from the <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> were subjected to three 30 mm h- 1 rains. Volume, aluminum and sulphate concentration of the outflows were monitored. Consolidation with time decreased the area and perimeter of water-conducting pores in 2 -year-old pineapple beds to about a third, and bypass flow rate to about 80 % of those in newly constructed beds. Consolidation did not affect macropore network geometry in yam beds because they were subjected to annual tillage and yam tubers were uprooted regularly.

50|$|Raised-bed {{gardening}} {{is a form}} {{of gardening}} in which the soil is formed in three-to-four-foot-wide (1.0-1.2m) beds, which can be of any length or shape. The soil is raised above the surrounding soil (approximately six inches to waist-high), is sometimes enclosed by a frame generally made of wood, rock, or concrete blocks, and may be enriched with compost. The vegetable plants are spaced in geometric patterns, much closer together than in conventional row gardening. The spacing is such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a microclimate in which weed growth is suppressed and moisture is conserved. <b>Raised</b> <b>beds</b> produce a variety of benefits: they extend the planting season, they can reduce weeds if designed and planted properly, and they reduce the need to use poor native soil. Since the gardener does not walk on the <b>raised</b> <b>beds,</b> the soil is not compacted and the roots have an easier time growing. The close plant spacing and the use of compost generally result in higher yields with <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> in comparison to conventional row gardening. Waist-high <b>raised</b> <b>beds</b> enable the elderly and physically disabled to grow vegetables without having to bend over to tend them.|$|R
