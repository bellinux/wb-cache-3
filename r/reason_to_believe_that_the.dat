5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There is <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli {{to that of the}} Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) there was no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but {{if this was the}} norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E

25|$|The {{court found}} no {{evidence}} of error by the Swedish crew, although it noted that the erroneous QFF may have caused the altimeter to be wrong by one millibar.

25|$|Ultimately, China's {{progress}} in the control of tuberculosis and public-health reform {{will depend on the}} degree of political commitment to address these challenges. In this regard, the indication by Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking at the National People's Congress in March 2006, that public health is a key component of the country's 11th 5-year development plan is very encouraging. He highlighted the need to improve rural and urban health services, making them affordable for all, and specifically mentioned the need to control HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. With increased governmental commitment and funding to improve public health, China has <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of tuberculosis and deaths caused by the disease can be halved within the next decade.|$|E

25|$|The second limb {{of section}} 6(2) was {{examined}} by District Judge Neighbour in Ong Kian Cheong.

The first accused claimed he did not read the tracts and thus {{did not know that}} they had seditious tendencies. He alleged that all he did was to post the tracts after the second accused had prepared them. The second accused claimed that she had purchased and distributed the tracts without reading them and had no reason to believe the publications were seditious or objectionable because they were freely available on sale in local bookstores.|$|E
25|$|The Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) enzyme {{structure}} in Escherichia coli {{was the first}} structure to be elucidated and understood. Since then, the Escherichia coli IDH structure {{has been used by}} most researchers to make comparisons to other isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes. There is much detailed knowledge about this bacterial enzyme, and it has been found that most isocitrate dehydrogenases are similar in structure and therefore also in function. This similarity of structure and function gives a <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> structures are conserved as well as the amino acids. Therefore, the active sites amongst most prokaryotic isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes should be conserved as well, which is observed throughout many studies done on prokaryotic enzymes. Eukaryotic isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes on the other hand, have not been fully discovered yet.|$|E

After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden feeling that she has missed something to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1903‚Äì1905 that the Barringer Crater was {{correctly}} identified as an impact crater, and it {{was not until}} as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and there was no <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.|$|E
25|$|The radio {{emission}} from radio-loud active galaxies is synchrotron emission, as inferred from its very smooth, broad-band nature and strong polarization. This {{implies that the}} radio-emitting plasma contains, at least, electrons with relativistic speeds (Lorentz factors of ~104) and magnetic fields. Since the plasma must be neutral, it must also contain either protons or positrons. There {{is no way of}} determining the particle content directly from observations of synchrotron radiation. Moreover, {{there is no way to}} determine the energy densities in particles and magnetic fields from observation: the same synchrotron emissivity may be a result of a few electrons and a strong field, or a weak field and many electrons, or something in between. It is possible to determine a minimum energy condition which is the minimum energy density that a region with a given emissivity can have, but for many years there was no particular <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> true energies were anywhere near the minimum energies.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive neuropsychology is a {{relatively}} new development and has emerged as a distillation of the complementary approaches of both experimental and clinical neuropsychology. It seeks to understand the mind and brain by studying people who have suffered brain injury or neurological illness. One model of neuropsychological functioning is known as functional localization. This is based on the principle that if a specific cognitive problem can be found after an injury to a specific area of the brain, it is possible that this part of the brain is in some way involved. However, there may be <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> link between mental functions and neural regions is not so simple. An alternative model of the link between mind and brain, such as parallel processing, may have more explanatory power for the workings and dysfunction of the human brain. Yet another approach investigates how the pattern of errors produced by brain-damaged individuals can constrain our understanding of mental representations and processes without reference to the underlying neural structure. A more recent but related approach is cognitive neuropsychiatry which seeks to understand the normal function of mind and brain by studying psychiatric or mental illness.|$|E
