5|$|Guepinia helvelloides has {{a rather}} unusual appearance, {{and is not}} likely to be mistaken for other fungi. However, the red {{chanterelle}} species Cantharellus cinnabarinus is superficially similar; unlike G.helvelloides, however, it does not have a <b>rubbery</b> and gelatinous texture, and its undersurface is wrinkled, not smooth.|$|E
5|$|Spongiforma is a genus of sponge-like {{fungi in}} the Boletaceae family. Newly {{described}} in 2009, the genus contains two species: S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii. The type species S.thailandica is known only from Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests dominated by dipterocarp trees. The <b>rubbery</b> fruit bodies, {{which has a}} strong odour of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. S.squarepantsii, described as new to science in 2011, is found in Malaysia. It produces sponge-like, <b>rubbery</b> orange fruit bodies with a fruity or musky odour. These fruit bodies will—like a sponge—resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The origin of the specific name derives from its perceived resemblance to the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. Apart from differences in distribution, S.squarepantsii differs from S.thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure.|$|E
5|$|In the North Island, Māori {{cultivated}} selected {{forms of}} C.australis for food. One of these, called tī para or tī tāwhiti, was grown because it suckers readily and forms multiple ﬂeshy rhizomes. A dwarf non-flowering selection of C.australis, {{it has a}} <b>rubbery,</b> pulpy stem, and thick green leaves. Although it was recorded by the early naturalists, botanists only rediscovered it in the 1990s, being grown by gardeners as the cultivar Cordyline 'Thomas Kirk'. Recent and unpublished DNA work suggests it derives from C.australis of the central North Island.|$|E
5|$|Spongiforma thailandica is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family, genus Spongiforma. The {{stemless}} sponge-like species, first described in 2009, was found in Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand, where it grows in soil in old-growth forests. The <b>rubbery</b> fruit body, which has a strong odor of coal-tar similar to Tricholoma sulphureum, consists of numerous internal cavities lined with spore-producing tissue. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the species {{is closely related to}} the Boletaceae genera Porphyrellus and Strobilomyces.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, <b>rubbery</b> material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or <b>rubbery</b> at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their <b>rubbery</b> caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Suillus intermedius, {{found in}} northeastern and {{northern}} North America, {{is similar in}} appearance to S.salmonicolor. It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as S.salmonicolor. It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although {{it has not been}} definitively established whether S.cothurnatus is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from S.salmonicolor: a thinner, less <b>rubbery</b> veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of multiseptate hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other Suillus species with which S.salmonicolor might be confused include S.acidus and S.subalutaceus. Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.|$|E
25|$|When the methyl {{groups in}} a {{polypropylene}} chain exhibit no preferred orientation, the polymers are called atactic. Atactic polypropylene is an amorphous <b>rubbery</b> material. It can be produced commercially either with a special type of supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst or with some metallocene catalysts.|$|E
25|$|A <b>rubbery</b> polymer {{sometimes}} called Slime, Flubber, 'gluep' or 'glurch' (or erroneously called Silly Putty, {{which is based}} on silicone polymers), can be made by cross-linking polyvinyl alcohol with borax. Making flubber from polyvinyl acetate-based glues, such as Elmer's Glue, and borax is a common elementary-science demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Fresh roe that {{is cooked}} will burst and make light popping sounds when eaten, but roe from the fish {{preserved}} in salt or miso turn <b>rubbery</b> {{and hard to}} chew, resulting in a more blunt sound that sounds like buri buri which resulted in its name.|$|E
25|$|The polymer of methyl acrylate, PMA or poly(methyl acrylate), {{is similar}} to poly(methyl methacrylate), except {{for the lack of}} methyl groups on the {{backbone}} carbon chain. PMA is a soft white <b>rubbery</b> material that is softer than PMMA because its long polymer chains are thinner and smoother and can more easily slide past each other.|$|E
25|$|It is dark gray-blackish {{in color}} and of a <b>rubbery</b> consistency, {{suggesting}} its role as shock absorber and grip tool on hard, smooth ground. The frog also acts like a pump to move the blood back to the heart, a great distance from the relatively thin leg to the main organ of the circulatory system.|$|E
25|$|A new {{addition}} is a portable touch tank which allows visitors {{to feel a}} shark's scales and the <b>rubbery</b> skin of a stingray. During warmer months, little penguins can be found outside near {{the entrance of the}} aquarium. The only freshwater display is of the Amazon rainforest that includes fish, invertebrates, turtles, and mammals (including common squirrel monkeys).|$|E
25|$|A {{parameter}} {{of particular}} interest in synthetic polymer manufacturing is the glass transition temperature (Tg), at which amorphous polymers undergo a transition from a <b>rubbery,</b> viscous liquid, to a brittle, glassy amorphous solid on cooling. The glass transition temperature may be engineered by altering the degree of branching or crosslinking in the polymer or {{by the addition of}} plasticizer.|$|E
25|$|Silicone: Silicone {{bakeware}} is light, {{flexible and}} able to withstand sustained temperatures of 360°C (675°F). It melts around 500°C (930°F), depending upon the fillers used. Its flexibility is advantageous in removing baked goods from the pan. This <b>rubbery</b> material should {{not to be confused}} with the silicone resin used to make hard, shatterproof children's dishware, which is not suitable for baking.|$|E
25|$|Just {{below the}} coronet, {{the walls are}} covered for about an inch by a cornified, opaque 'periople' material. In the palmar/plantar part of the hoof, the periople is thicker and more <b>rubbery</b> over the heels, and it merges with frog material. Not all horses have {{the same amount of}} periople. Dry feet tend to lack this substance, which can be {{substituted}} with a hoof dressing.|$|E
25|$|Melissococcus plutonius is a {{bacterium}} that infects the midgut of bee larvae. European foulbrood (EFB, Putrificatio polybacterica larvae apium, Pestis europea larvae apium) is considered less serious than American foulbrood. M. plutonius {{is not a}} spore-forming bacterium, but bacterial cells can survive for several months on wax foundation. Symptoms include dead and dying larvae which can appear curled upwards, brown or yellow, melted or deflated with tracheal tubes more apparent, or dried out and <b>rubbery.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{recently}} created robot called CB² or Child-robot with Biomimetic Body {{may follow}} moving objects with its eyes. CB² may recognize the human touch, which is possible {{thanks to the}} 197 film-like pressure sensors that are placed under its <b>rubbery</b> skin. Asada, the team of engineers and brain specialists together with psychologists and many other specialists in the related domain created a CB² that may record emotional expressions, memorize them and then match them with physical sensations.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, <b>rubbery</b> chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the weather resistance. Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.|$|E
25|$|In Mexico, {{particularly}} in the towns and cities, corn tortillas are often made nowadays by machine and are very thin and uniform, but in many places in the country, they are still made by hand, even when the nixtamal is ground into masa by machine. In Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, they are still often made by hand and are thicker. Corn tortillas are customarily served and eaten warm; when cool, they often become <b>rubbery</b> or grainy as the cooked starches stale. The largest tortilla producer {{in the world is}} the Mexican company Gruma, headquartered in Monterrey.|$|E
25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): weather resistance, adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) <b>rubbery</b> thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
25|$|In Dungeons & Dragons, the Trolls are {{depicted}} as tall skinny humanoids with long noses, <b>rubbery</b> skin, a regenerating ability, and a weakness to fire. Other types of Trolls include the Black Trolls, Blood Trolls, Cave Trolls, Crystalline Trolls, Desert Trolls, Fell Trolls, Fire Trolls, Forest Trolls, Giant Troll (which is a crossbreed between a troll and a Hill Giant), Giant Two-Headed Trolls (which is a crossbreed between a troll and an Ettin), Gray Trolls, Ice Trolls, Mountain Trolls, Rock Trolls, Scrags, Slime Trolls, Spirit Trolls, Stone Trolls, Tree Trolls, War Trolls, and Wasteland Trolls. In addition, {{they keep the}} canine-like Trollhounds as pets in their tribes.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural process}} of healing a {{fracture}} starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture hematoma. The blood coagulates {{to form a}} blood clot situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days, blood vessels grow into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring phagocytes to the area, which gradually remove the non-viable material. The blood vessels also bring fibroblasts in {{the walls of the}} vessels and these multiply and produce collagen fibres. In this way the blood clot is replaced by a matrix of collagen. Collagen's <b>rubbery</b> consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent force is applied.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} same time that {{catchers}} began fielding their position closer to home plate, baseball teams began using a less <b>rubbery</b> ball which led to a {{decline in the number of}} runs scored. In the 1860s it was common for teams to score fifty or sixty runs in a game. The combination of the new, harder ball and the continuation of the rise in pitcher's release points helped usher in what became known as the Dead-ball era. The decrease in run production placed greater significance on stolen bases and bunts, which in turn emphasized the crucial defensive role played by catchers. Together, the rules changes and the new protective equipment transformed the catcher's defensive role to the way that it is presently played.|$|E
25|$|His first {{impression}} {{was that it}} was the remains of an animal, very mutilated, and in an advanced state of decomposition. The carcass was very pale pink, almost white, in colour, with a silver reflection in the sunlight. It was composed of a <b>rubbery</b> substance of a very hard consistency, such that it could only be cut with great difficulty. The part of the carcass that was visible measured 18 feet (approx. 6 meters) in length and 7 feet (approx. 2½ meters) in width. Webb estimated its weight at nearly 5 tons, if not more. He believed it was the remains of a giant octopus, as it appeared to have the stumps of four arms, with another arm buried nearby.|$|E
25|$|The {{megamouth shark}} (Megachasma pelagios) is {{a species of}} {{deepwater}} shark. It is rarely seen by humans and is {{the smallest of the}} three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the whale shark and basking shark. Since its discovery in 1976, few megamouth sharks have been seen, with 63 specimens known to have been caught or sighted as of May 2017, including four recordings on film. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its enormous mouth wide open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish. It is distinctive for its large head with <b>rubbery</b> lips. It is so unlike any other type of shark that it is usually considered to be the sole extant species in the distinct family Megachasmidae, though suggestion has been made that it may belong in the family Cetorhinidae, of which the basking shark is currently the sole extant member. In addition to the living M.pelagios, however, two extinct megamouth species – the Priabonian M.alisonae and the Oligocene–Miocene M.applegatei – have also recently been proposed on the basis of fossilized tooth remains. However, the Cretaceous-aged M. comanchensis has been recently reclassified as an odontaspid shark in the genus Pseudomegachasma, and is in fact unrelated to the megamouth shark despite similar teeth morphology.|$|E
25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the <b>rubbery</b> (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}}, Gnathanodon speciosus (also {{known as}} the golden kingfish, banded trevally and king trevally), is a species of large marine fish classified in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, and {{the only member of}} the genus Gnathanodon. The golden trevally is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa in the west to Central America in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. The golden trevally is easily distinguished from its relatives by its fleshy, <b>rubbery</b> lips and unique colouration, which ranges from bright yellow with black bars as a juvenile to a golden-silvery colour as an adult. It is known to grow to 120 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. The golden trevally schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range. The golden trevally is a considerable constituent of several Middle Eastern fisheries and being of minor importance to many others, with a worldwide annual catch of 1187 t to 3475 t recorded between 2000 and 2010. The golden trevally is a popular gamefish, taken by bait, lure, fly and also spear throughout its range. Several Asian countries currently farm the fish in caged aquaculture. Due to their brilliant colouration, juveniles are popular in marine aquaria.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some have}} claimed the fungus to be {{inedible}} or merely [...] "non-poisonous", most other sources {{agree that it}} is edible but flavorless.

500|$|The Mecoptera and Siphonaptera (fleas) share {{features}} such as {{the production of the}} <b>rubbery</b> cuticle material resilin and panoistic ovarioles which have germ cells forming a continuous tube in place of the usual nurse cells. The Mecoptera are related to these other insect orders [...] as shown in the cladogram, based on a 2008 DNA and protein analysis of 128 flea taxa from around the world. The Boreidae (snow scorpionflies) are the sister clade to the Siphonaptera, so the Mecoptera as traditionally understood is paraphyletic, though the rest of the order forms a clade.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} of Rhodotus has a cap, and stem without a ring or volva. The cap {{initially}} assumes a [...] shape before flattening somewhat with age, and typically reaches widths of [...] The {{edges of the}} cap are rolled inwards, and the cap surface typically has a conspicuous network of lightly colored ridges or veins that outline deep and narrow grooves or pits—a condition technically termed sulcate or reticulate. Between the ridges, the surface color is somewhat variable; depending on the lighting conditions experienced by the mushroom during its development, it may range from salmon-orange to pink to red. The texture of the cap surface is , and the internal flesh is firm but <b>rubbery,</b> and pinkish in color.|$|E
500|$|Spongiforma squarepantsii is {{a species}} of fungus in the Boletaceae family, genus Spongiforma. Found in Malaysia, it was {{described}} as new to science in 2011. It produces sponge-like, <b>rubbery</b> orange fruit bodies that have a fruity or musky odour. The fruit bodies reach dimensions of [...] wide by [...] tall. Like a sponge, they will resume their original shape if water is squeezed out. The spores, produced on the surfaces of the hollows of the sponge, are almond-shaped with rough surfaces, and measure 10–12.5 by 6–7 micrometers.

S.squarepantsii is one of two species in Spongiforma; it differs from S.thailandica in its colour, odour, and spore structure.|$|E
500|$|Guepinia is a genus of fungus in the Auriculariales order. It is a {{monotypic}} genus, {{containing the}} single species Guepinia helvelloides, {{commonly known as}} the apricot jelly. The fungus produces salmon-pink, ear-shaped, gelatinous fruit bodies that grow solitarily or in small tufted groups on soil, usually associated with buried rotting wood. The fruit bodies are [...] tall and up to [...] wide; the stalks are not well-differentiated from the cap. The fungus, although <b>rubbery,</b> is edible, and may be eaten raw with salads, pickled, or candied. It has a white spore deposit, and the oblong to ellipsoid spores measure 9–11 by 5–6 micrometers. The fungus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, and has also been collected from South America.|$|E
500|$|As with Instant Vintage, Ray Ray {{features}} Saadiq's characteristic {{fusion of}} programmed beats, strings, neo soul melodies, and live guitars. The songs are mostly mid-tempo and groove-based, and also feature <b>rubbery</b> bass lines and horns. AllMusic's Andy Kellman views that the album's music is [...] "a little funkier {{and a lot}} more energetic than 2002's Instant Vintage, yet just as full of Saadiq's stylish flourishes." [...] He writes of the album's subject matter, [...] "for every song that's charmingly simple and full of lighthearted romantic sentiments, there's something message-oriented". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe characterizes the album's mood as [...] "playful" [...] and writes that it is composed as [...] "a bouncy song cycle that's a throwback to '70s funk." ...|$|E
500|$|Suillus bovinus [...] tastes {{mild and}} is edible, {{although}} it is not highly regarded. When cooked, it releases a lot of fluid, which can be collected and reduced or strained to make a sauce. Its flavour is made more intense by drying. The soft and <b>rubbery</b> consistency of older specimens—as well as their proneness to maggot infestation—renders them almost inedible. Fruit bodies are part of the [...] later summer diet of the red squirrel in Eurasia, which collect the mushrooms and store them in tree forks for a ready food supply after the onset of frost. There are several fly species that often use S.bovinus fruit bodies to rear their young, including Bolitophila rossica, Exechia separata, Exechiopsis indecisa, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica.|$|E
