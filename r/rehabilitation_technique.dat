40|$|Keynote paperThe {{estimation}} of the service life of concrete rehabilitation works {{is more and more}} important. The <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>techniques</b> appeared as a need to solve problems posed by the degradation of concrete structures. Some years ago the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>techniques</b> were not developed and it was important to find solutions for the problems. Now, there is more preoccupation with the service life of concrete <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>techniques,</b> like external strengthening with FRP, increase of concrete sections or reinforcement of cracked sections. The increase of the service life started with the quality of the concrete rehabilitation works. This includes the quality of the design, the products and the execution. Some standards are now available and establish specifications for concrete rehabilitation works. This paper presents the main questions related with this subject. The use of polymers in concrete rehabilitation imposes a different analysis related with durability...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Harold Dull adapted Zen Shiatsu {{for use in}} warm water pools at Harbin Hot Springs in {{northern}} California, with emphasis on connecting with the breathing patterns of the receiver and establishing a meditative state during sessions. Dull observed that people receiving Watsu treatments entered a deep relaxation state, with strong physical and emotional effects. In the early years, massage therapists were the main practitioners of Watsu, offering sessions as a new category of aquatic therapy called aquatic bodywork. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, physical therapists and other healthcare providers began applying Watsu to treat diverse orthopedic and neurologic conditions. While Watsu's roots in Shiatsu and the close physical contact led to some early resistance among those trained in conventional healthcare, Watsu is now practiced in spas, clinics, and hospitals, and utilized as an aquatic <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E
50|$|Evidence that {{supports}} the use of constraint induced movement therapy has been growing since its introduction as an alternative treatment method for upper limb motor deficits found in stroke populations. Recently, constraint induced movement therapy {{has been shown to}} be an effective <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> at varying stages of stroke recovery to improve upper limb motor function and use during daily activities of living. The greatest gains are seen among persons with stroke who exhibit some wrist and finger extension in the effected limb. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes plastic changes in function and structure in patients that perform constraint induced movement therapy. These changes accompany the gains in motor function of the paretic upper limb. However, there is no established causal link between observed changes in brain function/structure and the motor gains due to constraint induced movement therapy.|$|E

40|$|Multi-storey {{reinforced}} concrete frames that were built {{prior to the}} 19702 ̆ 7 s generally do not meet current seismic design code requirements. The lateral load carrying capacity of these structures is often insufficient due to non-ductile reinforcement detailing, which includes either insufficient or no beam-column joint transverse reinforcement. It was observed during recent earthquakes that deficient beam-column joints can jeopardise the integrity of entire structures. Thus, several beam-column joint <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>techniques</b> have emerged to upgrade such substandard joints. It is essential to evaluate the standings of joints rehabilitated with such techniques based on current design code requirements. This paper critically examines beam-column joint <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>techniques</b> using FRP {{that emerged in the}} last decade. For this purpose, a full-scale code-conforming beam-column joint was made and tested under reversed cyclic load to serve as a benchmark for this comparison. Enhancements imparted to substandard beam-column joints by FRP <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>techniques</b> in terms of strength, ductility and energy dissipation gains are assessed. It is shown that FRP joints repair schemes generally enhanced the performance of substandard joints, but they often came short of satisfying current standard level performance, and that different rehabilitation strategies can be adopted {{depending on the type of}} joint deficiency and the purpose of the rehabilitation scheme...|$|R

40|$|International audienceElectrical {{currents}} have {{deleterious effects}} on biomedical metallic implants. However, following arthroplasty, neuro-myoelectrostimulation (NMES) {{is often used}} in patient rehabilitation. Such a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> could compromise patient recovery through deleterious effects on metallic alloys and biological tissues. The purpose of our study {{was to assess the}} effects of NMES on a Ti 6 Al 4 V implant placed in a rat tibial crest and the surrounding muscle tissues. This in vivo study allowed to bring to the fore the prosthesis behavior under mechanical and electromagnetic loads induced by NEMS stimulation. After 3 weeks, implant-to-bone adhesion significantly decreased in stimulated animals compared with nonstimulated animals. Surface mapping indicated titanium implant degradation after NMES. Furthermore, NMES alone did not induce muscle damage contrary to that found in implanted animals. The muscle damage rate was significantly higher in implanted and stimulated animals compared with implanted-only animals. It seems obvious that rehabilitation programs using the NMES technique could induce early deterioration of biomaterial employed for surgical implants. Clinicians should reconsider the use of NMES as a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> for patients with titanium prostheses. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Riparian {{clearing}} and {{the removal of}} wood from channels have affected many streams in agricultural landscapes. As a result, these streams often have depauperate in-stream wood loads, and therefore decreased habitat complexity and lower levels of in-stream biodiversity. The introduction of wood was investigated as a possible <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> for agricultural streams. Wood was re-introduced to eight streams in two separate high-rainfall, intensively grazed regions of Victoria, Australia and the effect on aquatic macroinvertebrate communities was measured. The addition of wood increased overall family richness and the richness of most functional feeding groups occupying edge and benthic habitats within the stream. Wood addition led to less overlap between benthic and edge macroinvertebrate communities, suggesting increased habitat heterogeneity within the stream ecosystem. Of all sampled habitats, wood supported the greatest density of families and was colonised by all functional feeding groups. Wood habitats also had the highest overall richness and supported the most taxa that were sensitive to disturbance. These findings suggest that re-introducing wood to agricultural streams is an appropriate <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> where those streams are affected by reduced habitat complexity. Additional work is needed to confirm these findings over larger spatial and temporal scales. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Many {{cities in}} Iowa have {{retained}} the original brick street surfaces in downtown areas and in older residential areas {{as the base}} for modern driving surfaces. The original brick surfaces were not built to handle current and future traffic loadings. In recent years, these surfaces have tended to shift and become uneven, creating problems with safety. Asphaltic concrete overlays have been the typical <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> in these situations. This {{has proven to be}} a successful <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>technique</b> in some cases; in other cases, the combination of movement of the brick and flexibility of the asphalt has proven to accentuate the original problems.
