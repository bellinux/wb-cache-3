25|$|A {{television}} set, {{also called}} a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is {{a device that}} combines a tuner, display, and speakers {{for the purpose of}} viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first <b>recorded</b> <b>media</b> in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Combining the {{advantages}} of hard-disk magnetic recording and magneto-optical recording, hybrid recording is regarded as promising candidate for extremely-high density recording technology beyond Tera bits/in 2. To obtain such high areal density, hybrid <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> are required to have high coercivity and large remanent magnetization at room temperature, the desired temperature dependence of coercivity and magnetization, as well as very short thermal response time. Currently, the researches on the hybrid <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> mainly involve the magnetic hard-disk polycrystalline <b>recording</b> <b>media</b> and the magneto-optical amorphous media. This report presents the latest progresses in the researches on these two kinds of <b>media</b> for hybrid <b>recording.</b> 1...|$|R
