All this is better forgotten; better burnt; better never thought over again; and all the more, because its aspect was so wise, and even praiseworthy.

50|$|Stony corals, {{which are}} defined by their calcerous calcium {{carbonate}} skeletons (CaCO3), {{are the focus of}} many advanced reef keepers. These corals require additional attention to water chemistry, especially maintenance of stable and optimal calcium, carbonate, and pH levels. These parameters may be tracked and adjusted with test kits and frequent manual dosing of calcium and pH buffer additives requiring no additional equipment. Alternatively, automated methods employing small dedicated computers with electronic water quality monitoring capabilities are often used to control water chemistry parameters via several components including calcium reactors and kalkwasser reactors. Calcium reactors are canisters filled with crushed coral skeletons. Carbon dioxide is injected into the canister acidifying the water and dissolving the coral skeletons. The acidified and CaCO3 <b>rich</b> <b>solution</b> is then pumped into the sump. The excess CO2 then diffuses {{out of the water and}} into the air leaving behind the CaCO3. Kalkwasser is an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2. The kalk reactor stirs the solution, preventing precipitation, and dispenses the solution into the sump where the Ca(OH)2 combines with dissolved CO2 to produce CaCO3. These components must be controlled by a computer to prevent dangerous changes in pH due to the acidic calcium reactor effluent or alkaline kalkwasser effluent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{practical}} transportation model known as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB), which aims at designing the minimum cost route set for satisfying both delivery and pick-up demands. In methodological terms, we propose a local search metaheuristic which explores <b>rich</b> <b>solution</b> neighborhoods composed of exchanges of variable-length customer sequences. To efficiently investigate these <b>rich</b> <b>solution</b> neighborhoods, tentative local search move are statically encoded by data structures stored in Fibonacci Heaps which are special priority queue structures offering fast minimum retrieval, insertion and deletion capabilities. To avoid cycling phenomena and induce diversification, we introduce the concept of promises, which is a parameter-free mechanism based on the regional aspiration criterion used in Tabu Search implementations. The proposed metaheuristic development was tested on well-known VRPB benchmark instances. It exhibited fine performance, as it consistently generated the best-known solutions for all the examined benchmark problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Natural zeolites {{are more}} and more {{frequently}} employed to remove excess ammonium in wastewater, since their capital cost is not excessive and their cation exchange capacity is elevated. Recently, natural zeolites have been also applied as fertilizer in orthoculture, after an exchange step within a ammonium <b>rich</b> <b>solution.</b> Despite of all this applications, many are the unknown parameters which can affect the cation exchange capacity of natural zeolites from an ammonium <b>rich</b> <b>solution.</b> For this reason a series of numerical scenarios have been performed to quantify possible side effects. The geochemical code PHREEQC- 2, was used in batch mode to evaluate the variation of the equilibrium exchange between ammonium and other cations (present onto the exchanger site of natural zeolites) induced by selected master parameters. The master parameters which were varied in a range of two order of magnitude, are: temperature (- 10 to 90 °C), ammonium concentration (2 to 200 mM/L), bulk cation exchange capacity of the matrix (1 to 100 meq/ 100 g) and the composition of the exchanger sites. The latter two parameters are dependent from the type and amount of zeolites present in the original rock/sediment matrix. Results are important to understand what is the best parameters combination to enhance ammonium exchange onto natural zeolites and to provide optimal ammonium concentrations for agricultural purposes...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} since been a mystery why most {{proteins}} fold within a flash of time into particular structures out of astronomically large numbers of possible conformations. Even more confusing is that protein folding in vivo is played out in <b>rich</b> <b>solution</b> containing various organic and non-organic, big and small molecules and ions which would potentially bind the protein molecules and prevent them folding. A possible answer to these mysteries might be, &#x 22;Nature have favoured such proteins that quickly fold in <b>rich</b> <b>solution</b> through natural selection&#x 22;. Then what mechanism of folding has been favoured? Here I show how to decipher protein sequences to reveal the folding mechanism. The entropic landscape of a protein sequence tells which region of the sequence sets out to fold first which next and last. Each step of the folding procedure is programmed in the sequence. This make it clear why proteins fold quickly and escape from surrounding molecules and ions. The folding pathways represented by the entropic landscape agree with the pathways experimentally proposed. Besides, the simulation of protein folding scheduled by the entropic landscape generates native-like conformations, where the lower the entropy of a sequential region is the earlier its conformation is optimized in terms of energy minimization. The attempt to simulate protein folding gives further insights into the folding mechanism...|$|E

In recent years, a novel process named a membrane flash process for regeneration of the absorbent was developed to realize an energy-saving technology. In this study, the effects of pore size and thickness of microporous hollow fiber membrane on the CO 2 desorption rate in the membrane flash process were examined. CO 2 desorption experiments were performed using the three purchased microfiltration (MF) membranes with different pore sizes, 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1. 0 μm, and the two microporous hollow fiber membranes made from alumina particles with different thicknesses. A 30 wt%-monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solution {{was used as the}} chemical absorbent. The MEA solution which absorbed CO 2 in advance was fed into the tube side of the hollow fiber and was forced to permeate through the membrane by reducing the pressure on the shell side to 40 – 1 kPa. The results indicated the CO 2 desorption rate increased with decreasing pore size. Also, the thicker membrane showed the greater CO 2 desorption rate. The results and observation implied that CO 2 desorption occurred not only {{on the surface of the}} <b>rich</b> <b>solution</b> falling down along the outer surface of the hollow fiber after permeating through the membrane but inside the pores of the membrane wall.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} have triggered {{a debate about}} the ability of protons to transfer through individual layers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).

Here, on the basis of first principles calculations, we show that the barrier for proton penetration is significantly reduced, to less than 1 eV, upon hydrogenation {{even in the absence of}} pinholes in the lattice. Analysis reveals that the barrier is reduced because hydrogenation destabilises the initial state (a deep-lying chemisorption state) and expands the honeycomb lattice through which the protons penetrate.
