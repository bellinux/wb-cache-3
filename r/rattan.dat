5|$|The sixteen contestants were {{initially}} separated into two tribes, named Tagi and Pagong, which represented {{the names of}} their beaches. When ten players remained, the contestants merged into one tribe, named Rattana. While Tagi and Pagong's names and makeups were picked by the producers, Rattana was named by contestants Sean Kenniff and Jenna Lewis, because of a large amount of <b>Rattan</b> wood on the island. After 39 days of competition, corporate trainer Richard Hatch was named the Sole Survivor, defeating whitewater rafting guide Kelly Wiglesworth in a 4–3 jury vote.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, the Sultanate of Sulu granted {{use of an}} area {{of land in the}} Sandakan Bay to William Frederick Schuck, {{a former}} agent of the German {{consular}} service who had lived on the Sulu island of Jolo since 1864. The arrival of German warship Nymph at the Sulu Sea in 1872 to investigate the Sulu-Spanish conflict made the Sultanate believe Schuck was connected with the German government. The Sultanate authorised Schuck to establish a trading port to monopolise the <b>rattan</b> trade in the northeast coast, where Schuck could operate freely, without the Spanish blockade. He continued this operation until this land also was ceded to Overbeck, with the Sultan receiving an annual payment of $5,000, by a treaty signed in 1878.|$|E

5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and <b>rattan</b> cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E

5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus <b>rattan</b> palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna. In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus are found.|$|E

5|$|The District Railway ordered 60 x 7-car {{electric}} {{trains in}} 1903. A {{third of the}} vehicles were made in England, the rest in Belgium and France and electrical equipment was installed on arrival at Ealing Common Works. Access was by sliding doors, double doors in the centre and single doors at either end. First and third class accommodation were provided in open saloons with electric lighting. The seats were covered with <b>rattan</b> in third class and plush in first. From 1906 the standard formation was six cars, with {{an equal number of}} motor and trailer cars running in either two or four car formations off-peak. By 1910 the District required additional rolling stock and ordered cars largely constructed of steel. The first batch arrived in 1911, followed by more in 1912 from a different manufacturer but to a similar design. Further cars arrived in 1914 with an elliptical roof instead of the clerestory roof on the earlier designs. In 1920 the District took delivery of new cars, incompatible with the existing fleet, with three hand-operated double sliding doors on each side.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1899, {{construction}} {{had started}} on shoplots, a pier and government buildings. This new administrative centre was renamed Jesselton after Sir Charles Jessel, who was the then Vice-Chairman of BNBC. Eventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, <b>rattan,</b> honey, and wax. The North Borneo Railway was used to transport goods to the Jesselton harbour. The Malay and Bajau uprisings during those times were not uncommon, and BNBC worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region. Jesselton suffered a large-scale destruction when it was razed by the British in their retreat from the Japanese and suffered more destruction when the Allies bombed it in 1945. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Several rebellions against the Japanese military administration took place in Api. One major rebellion in the town occurred on 10 October 1943 by a group called Kinabalu Guerrillas in the Jesselton Revolt consisting of local inhabitants. Japanese forces quelled the rebellion after its leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, {{what remained of the}} town was destroyed again by Allied bombings day and night for over six months as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on 10 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|During the 7th century CE, a settled {{community}} {{known as}} Vijayapura, a tributary to the Srivijaya empire, {{was thought to}} have existed in northwest Borneo. The earliest kingdom, supposed to have existed from the 9th century, was Po Ni, as recorded in the Chinese geographical treatise Taiping Huanyu Ji. It was believed that Po Ni existed {{at the mouth of}} Brunei River and was the predecessor to the Bruneian Empire. As China had been under the conquest of Mongol Empire, all Chinese vassal state subsequently controlled by the Mongol emperors of China. Early in 1292, Kublai Khan is said to have sending an expedition to northern Borneo, before departing for the invasion of Java in 1293. As a result of this campaign, it is believed that many of his followers in addition to other Chinese traders eventually settled and established their own colony at Kinabatangan River. In the 14th century, Brunei became the vassal state of Majapahit but in 1370 transferred its allegiance to Ming dynasty of China. The Maharaja Karna of Borneo then paid a visit to Nanjing with his family until his death. He was succeeded by his son Hsia-wang who agreed to send tribute to China once every three years. Since then, Chinese junks came to northern Borneo with cargoes of spices, bird nests, shark fins, camphor, <b>rattan</b> and pearls. More Chinese traders eventually settled in Kinabatangan, as stated in both Brunei and Sulu records. A younger sister of Huang Senping (Ong Sum Ping), the Governor of the Chinese settlement then married Sultan Ahmad of Brunei. Perhaps due to this relationship, a burial place with 2,000 wooden coffins, some estimated to be 1,000 years old, were discovered in Agop Batu Tulug Caves and around the Kinabatangan Valley area. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to northern Borneo as similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. In addition with the discovery of Chinese ceramics from a shipwreck in Tanjung Simpang Mengayau which estimated to be from 960–1127 A.D. of Song dynasty and Vietnamese Đông Sơn drum in Bukit Timbang Dayang on Banggi Island that had existed between 2,000–2,500 years ago.|$|E

25|$|In forests where <b>rattan</b> grows, its {{economic}} value can help protect forest land, by providing {{an alternative to}} loggers who forgo timber logging and harvest <b>rattan</b> canes instead. <b>Rattan</b> {{is much easier to}} harvest, requires simpler tools and is much easier to transport. It also grows much faster than most tropical wood. This makes it a potential tool in forest maintenance, since it provides a profitable crop that depends on rather than replaces trees. It {{remains to be seen whether}} <b>rattan</b> can be as profitable or useful as the alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{properties}} of <b>rattan</b> that make it suitable for furniture also make it a popular choice for handicraft and art pieces. Uses include <b>rattan</b> baskets, plant containers, and other decorative works.|$|E
25|$|Rattans are {{threatened}} with overexploitation, as harvesters are cutting stems too young and reducing {{their ability to}} resprout. Unsustainable harvesting of <b>rattan</b> can lead to forest degradation, affecting overall forest ecosystem services. Processing can also be polluting. The use of toxic chemicals and petrol in the processing of <b>rattan</b> affects soil, air and water resources, and also ultimately people's health. Meanwhile, the conventional method of <b>rattan</b> production is threatening the plant's long-term supply, and the income of workers.|$|E

50|$|Fossilized pollen referable to this genus {{has been}} {{recovered}} in upper Miocene deposits in northwest Borneo; its long history, and its {{wide variety of}} unusual features may indicate its climbing habit evolved independently of other <b>rattans.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the New World {{there are}} 2 genera with {{climbing}} representatives, Chamaedorea (subfamily Ceroxyloxideae, tribe Hyophorbeae) and Desmoncus (subfamily Arecoideae, tribe Cocoeae), {{the last one}} is utilized and commercialized much {{in the same way}} as <b>rattans.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Rattan</b> cane is {{also used}} {{traditionally}} to make polo mallets, though {{only a small portion}} of cane harvested (roughly 3%) is strong, flexible, and durable enough to be made into sticks for polo mallets, and <b>rattan</b> mallets are becoming decreasingly popular next the more modern variant, fibrecanes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rattan</b> (from the Malay rotan) is {{the name}} for roughly 600 species of old world {{climbing}} palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae (from the Greek 'kálamos' = reed). <b>Rattan</b> {{is also known as}} manila, or malacca, named after the ports of shipment Manila and Malacca City, and as manau (from the Malay rotan manau, the trade name for Calamus manan canes in Southeast Asia). The climbing habit is associated with the characteristics of its flexible woody stem, derived typically from a secondary growth, makes <b>rattan</b> a liana rather than a true wood.|$|E
25|$|Rattans are {{extensively}} {{used for}} making baskets and furniture. When cut into sections, <b>rattan</b> {{can be used}} as wood to make furniture. <b>Rattan</b> accepts paints and stains like many other kinds of wood, so it is available in many colours, and it can be worked into many styles. Moreover, the inner core can be separated and worked into wicker.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I know that; but {{we might}} cut these <b>rattans</b> which bind them together. In the first place, dig {{down with your}} knife, {{and see if the}} bamboos are sound underneath. They may have rotted there.|$|R
25|$|Subfamily Calamoideae {{includes}} the climbing palms, such as <b>rattans.</b> The leaves are usually pinnate; derived characters (synapomorphies) include spines on various organs, organs specialized for climbing, {{an extension of}} the main stem of the leaf-bearing reflexed spines, and overlapping scales covering the fruit and ovary.|$|R
5000|$|The country also {{produced}} vegetables, yams, and tubers {{which came from}} the hinterland. A certain amount of sandalwood, damar, and <b>rattans</b> was also exported. Silk weaving existed on a small scale. Imports included opium, silk, salt, and there was small demand for European cloth.|$|R
25|$|Thin <b>rattan</b> canes {{were the}} {{standard}} implement for school corporal punishment in England and Wales, {{and are still}} {{used for this purpose}} in schools in Malaysia, Singapore, and several African countries. Similar canes are used for military punishments in the Singapore Armed Forces. Heavier canes, also of <b>rattan,</b> are used for judicial corporal punishments in Aceh, Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the women}} of the Wemale ethnic group of Seram Island, Indonesia wore <b>rattan</b> girdles around their waist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rattan</b> is the {{preferred}} natural material used to wick essential oils in aroma reed diffusers (commonly used in aromatherapy, or merely to scent closets, passageways, and rooms), because each <b>rattan</b> reed contains 20 or more permeable channels that wick (suck) the oil from the container up the stem and release fragrance into the air, through an evaporation diffusion process. In contrast, reeds made from bamboo contain nodes which inhibit the passage of essential oils.|$|E
50|$|The mature lowland forests {{tend to have}} {{an uneven}} canopy height. <b>Rattans</b> and lianas grow in the understory, {{receiving}} the light they need to thrive through areas of disturbance. There is generally {{a large amount of}} herbaceous undergrowth, with epiphytic ferns and orchids growing on the thick branches of tall trees.|$|R
6000|$|... “This {{was very}} unusual, {{but since they}} were awake so late, Davidson thought {{that he would go}} up {{to say that he was}} in a hurry to be off and to ask that what <b>rattans</b> there were in store should be sent on board with the first sign of dawn.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{rarity in}} {{cultivation}} is {{likely due to}} their extreme spininess and their particular tropical needs. [...] The stems and sheaths are made into rope, baskets and binding in house construction, but, unlike many other <b>rattans</b> they are irregularly knobby and scarred, which generally excludes their use in worked and polished furniture.|$|R
