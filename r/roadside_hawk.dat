50|$|The <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> is 31 - 41 cm {{long and}} weighs 250 - 300 g. Males are about 20% smaller than females, but {{otherwise}} the sexes are similar. In most subspecies, the lower breast and underparts are barred brown and white, and the tail has {{four or five}} grey bars. Twelve subspecies are usually recognised and there is significant plumage variation between these. Depending on the subspecies involved, the <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> is mainly brown or grey. It is fairly common to observe a touch of rufous (i.e., a light reddish-brown) on the bird's wings, especially when seen in flight. Its call is a very high-pitched piercing squeak. The eyes of adult roadside hawks are whitish or yellow. As suggested by its specific name (magni = large; rostri = beak), its beak is relatively large.|$|E
50|$|Birds include biguá (Phalacrocórax olivaceus), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), {{striped owl}} (Pseudoscops clamator), green {{kingfisher}} (Chloroceryle americana), great black hawk (Buteogallus urubitinga), <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> (Rupornis magnirostris), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), checkered woodpecker (Veniliornis mixtus), greater thornbird (Phacellodomus ruber), rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris) and straight-billed reedhaunter (Limnoctites rectirostris).Endangered birds include yellow cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata), Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) and Eskimo curlew (Numenius borealis).|$|E
50|$|Buteos {{are fairly}} large birds. Total length {{can vary from}} 30 to 71 cm and {{wingspan}} can range from 67 to 161 cm. The lightest known species is the <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk,</b> {{at an average of}} 269 g although the lesser known white-rumped and Ridgway's hawks are similarly small in average wingspan around 75 cm, and average length around 35 cm and in standard measurements. The largest species in length and wingspan is the upland buzzard, which averages around 65 cm in length and 152 cm in wingspan. The upland is rivaled in weight and outsized in foot measurements and bill size by the ferruginous hawk. In both of these largest buteos, adults typically weigh over 1200 g, and in mature females, can exceed a mass of 2000 g. All buteos may be noted for their broad wings and sturdy builds. They frequently soar on thermals at midday over openings and are most frequently seen while doing this. The flight style varies based on the body type and wing shape and surface size. Some long-winged species, such as rough-legged buzzards and Swainson's hawks, have a floppy, buoyant flight style, while others, such as red-tailed hawks and rufous-tailed hawks, tend to be relatively shorter-winged, soaring more slowly and flying with more labored, deeper flaps. Most small and some medium-sized species, from the <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> to the red-shouldered hawk, often fly with an alternation of soaring and flapping, thus may be reminiscent of an Accipiter hawk in flight, but are still relatively larger-winged, shorter-tailed, and soar more extensively in open areas than Accipiter species do. Buteos inhabit a wide range of habitats across the world, but tend to prefer some access to both clearings, which provide ideal hunting grounds, and trees, which can provide nesting locations and security.|$|E
5000|$|The Buteo hawks {{include many}} of the most widely distributed, most common, and best-known raptors in the world. Examples include the red-tailed hawk of North America, the common buzzard of Eurasia, and the <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> of {{tropical}} Central and South America. Most Northern Hemisphere species are at least partially migratory. In North America, species such as broad-winged hawks and Swainson's hawks are known for their huge numbers (often called [...] "kettles") while passing over major migratory flyways in the fall. Up {{to tens of thousands of}} these Buteos can be seen each day during the peak of their migration. Any of the prior mentioned common Buteo species may have total populations that exceed a million individuals. On the other hand, the Socotra buzzard and Galapagos hawks are considered vulnerable to extinction per the IUCN. The Ridgway's hawk is even more direly threatened and is considered Critically Endangered. These insular forms are threatened primarily by habitat destruction, prey reductions and poisoning. The latter reason is considered the main cause of a noted decline in the population of the more abundant Swainson's hawk, due to insecticides being used in southern South America, which the hawks ingest through crickets and then die from poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Northern {{goshawks}} {{are sometimes}} mistaken for species even {{outside of the}} Accipiter genus especially as juveniles of each respective species. In North America, four species of buteonine hawk (all four of which are smaller than goshawks to a certain degree) may be confused with them on occasion despite the differing proportions of these hawks, which all have longer wings and shorter tails relative to their size. A species so similar it is sometimes nicknamed the “Mexican goshawk”, gray hawk (Buteo plagiatus) juveniles (overlapping with true goshawks in the southwest United States into Mexico) have contrasting face pattern with bold dusky eye-stripes, dark eyes, barred thighs and a bold white “U” on the uppertail coverts. The <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> (Rupornis magnirostris) (rarely in same range in Mexico) is noticeably smaller with paddle shaped wings, barred lower breast and a buff “U” on undertail coverts in young birds. Somewhat less likely to confused despite their broader extent of overlap are the red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus) which have a narrow white-barred, dark-looking tail, bold white crescents on their primaries and dark wing edges and the broad-winged hawk (Buteo playpterus) which also has dark wing edges and a differing tapered wing shape. Even wintering gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) juveniles have been mistaken for goshawks and vice versa on occasion, especially when observed distantly perched, but have many tell-tale falcon characteristics like pointed, longer wings, a brown malar stripe {{as well as its}} more extensive barring both above and below.|$|E
5000|$|All Buteo {{species are}} {{to some extent}} {{opportunistic}} {{when it comes to}} hunting, and prey on almost any type of small animal as it becomes available to them. However, most have a strong preference for small mammals, mostly rodents. Rodents of almost every family in the world are somewhere preyed upon by Buteo species. Since many rodents are primarily nocturnal, most buteos mainly hunt rodents that may be partially active during the day, which can include squirrels and chipmunks, voles, and gerbils. More nocturnal varieties are hunted opportunistically and may be to be caught in the first or last few hours of light. Other smallish mammals, such as shrews, moles, pikas, bats, and weasels, tend to be minor secondary prey, although can locally be significant for individual species. Larger mammals, such as rabbits, hares, and marmots, including even adult specimens weighing as much as 2 to 3 kg, may be hunted by the heaviest and strongest species, such as ferruginous, red-tailed and white-tailed hawks. Birds are taken occasionally, as well. Small to mid-sized birds, i.e. passerines, woodpeckers, waterfowl, pigeons, and gamebirds, are most often taken. However, since the adults of most smaller birds can successfully outmaneuver and evade buteos in flight, much avian prey is taken in the nestling or fledgling stages or adult birds if they are previously injured. An exception is the short-tailed hawk, which is a relatively small and agile species and is locally a small bird-hunting specialist. Other prey may include snakes, lizards, frogs, salamanders, fish, and even various invertebrates, especially beetles. In several Buteo species found in more tropical regions, such as the <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> or gray-lined hawk, reptiles and amphibians may come to locally dominate the diet. Swainson's hawk, despite its somewhat large size, is something of exceptional insect-feeding specialist and may rely almost fully on crickets and dragonflies when wintering in southern South America. Carrion is eaten occasionally by most species, but is almost always secondary to live prey. The importance of carrion in the Old World [...] "buzzard" [...] species is relatively higher since these often seem slower and less active predators than their equivalents in the Americas. Most Buteo species seem to prefer to ambush prey by pouncing down to the ground directly from a perch. The secondary approach in many is that prey is spotted from a great distance while soaring and is set down upon while circling down to the ground.|$|E
40|$|Studies of raptors 2 ̆ 7 diet are {{important}} for understanding the ecological relationships of the raptors themselves, {{as well as for}} assessing the influence of these predators on community ecology (Marti et al. 2007). Although there is abundant information about food habits of raptor species around the world, data on the trophic ecology of neotropical raptors are scarce and the diets of many species are poorly known (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Bierregaard 1998, Bó et al. 2007). The <b>Roadside</b> <b>Hawk</b> (Buteo magnirostris) is a widespread raptor species of Central and South America, ranging from northern Mexico to Río Negro Valley in central Argentina (Thiollay 1994). This medium-sized raptor usually inhabits woodlands and forest edges and, to a lesser extent, open fields near woodlands (Canevari et al. 1991). Near the southern boundary of its range, in the pampas of Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), this raptor is also associated with agroecosystems and grasslands (Narosky and Di Giacomo 1993, Mazar-Barnett and Pearman 2001). Despite being a common species with broad distribution, the <b>Roadside</b> <b>Hawk</b> has been little studied and information about its food habits is scarce and mostly limited to qualitative and anecdotal information (e. g., Haverschmidt 1962, Massoia 1988). In two studies, the diet of Roadside Hawks was quantitatively analyzed.

40|$|Although most raptor {{species are}} found {{mainly in the}} tropics, {{information}} on their home range and spatial requirements in the Neotropics is still scarce. In this study, we used radio telemetry to evaluate the home range and the habitat use and selection of five Roadside hawks, Rupornis magnirostris (Gmelin, 1788) in a heterogeneous landscape in southeastern Brazil. The average home range size calculated using the adaptive kernel method (95 % isopleth) was 126. 1 ha (47. 4 - 266. 7 ha), but using the minimum convex polygon method (95 % isopleth) it was 143. 54 ha (32. 6 - 382. 3 ha). The <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> explored {{a wide variety of}} habitats, most of them opportunistically, as suggested in the literature.

Results for the ordinary abundance (number of individuals/transect) were similar in both cases.

40|$|In 1993 and 1994, {{as part of}} the Peregrine Fund Inc., Maya Project, I {{compared}} the breeding ecology, density, and reproductive success of nesting Roadside Hawks (Buteo magnirostris) in two study plots. An 8. 25 -km 2 plot in the primary forest supported 13 territorial pairs in 1993, but only five pairs attempted to nest. In 1994, this plot contained 11 territorial pairs, of which seven pairs nested. The 8 -km 2 slash-and-burn plot contained 12 territorial pairs in 1993, 10 of which nested. In 1994, this plot supported 13 territorial pairs, of which 10 nested. Both years, there were non-nesting territorial pairs, especially in the forest plot, that copulated, courted, and carried sticks but did not nest. Pairs in the slash-and-burn plot nested in smaller, more slender trees and at lower heights than did pairs in the forest plot. Forest nest-sites and random points differed significantly with respect to several habitat characteristics. Pairs in the pristine forest nested selectively in 2 ̆ 2 bajo 2 ̆ 2 forest habitat characterized by low topographic elevation, seasonal inundation, and a low canopy (10 - 15 m). In the slash-and-burn habitat, characteristics of nest-sites and random points did not differ significantly. One <b>Roadside</b> <b>Hawk</b> young fledged in the forest plot each year; the overall means for both study years were 0. 17 successful nests per nesting attempt, and 0. 08 fledglings per pair. In the slash-and-burn plot, five young fledged in 1993 and three young fledged in 1994; the overall means for the two-year study were 0. 30 successful nests per nesting attempt, and 0. 32 fledglings per pair. Sixteen <b>Roadside</b> <b>Hawk</b> nests failed during incubation, and eight failed during the nestling stage. Human persecution caused five slash-and-burn nests to fail. Rates of prey delivery to nests did not differ significantly between the two habitats, but prey type and size did.

30|$|The {{assemblage}} on {{the coastal}} plain was characterized by species associated with wet habitats and that are also tolerant of human disturbance. The most abundant species, the Black Vulture and Southern Caracara, are both regularly found in urban and agricultural areas (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Alencar-Carvalho and Marini 2007), although the latter {{is also found in}} natural grasslands (Filloy and Bellocq 2007; Pedrana et al. 2008). The American Kestrel and <b>Roadside</b> <b>Hawk</b> are abundant in Rio Grande do Sul (Belton 1984). They are food and habitat generalists (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001), show a high tolerance to human disturbance, and are even found inside big cities (Belton 1984; Scherer et al. 2005). The Snail Kite and Savanna Hawk are common in coastal areas of southern Brazil and Uruguay (Belton 1984; Albuquerque et al. 1986; Arballo and Cravino 1999; Zilio et al. 2012). These species were abundant on {{the coastal plain}}, surely favored due to the availability of marshes and rice fields in the region. The Long-winged Harrier had a similar pattern of distribution, being more abundant on the coastal plain than on altitudinal grasslands, agreeing with Albuquerque et al. (1986) who found high abundances further to the south. The occurrence of Long-winged Harriers was positively associated with marshes (Pedrana et al. 2008), a common habitat type on the coastal plain, but a habitat type less frequently encountered in altitudinal grasslands (F Zilio personal observation).|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the species composition, relative abundance, habitat use, and seasonal variability of raptor assemblages in the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, {{which represents the}} southeastern part of the biome known as the Rio de la Plata Grasslands. We conducted seasonal roadside surveys to detect raptors in modified and natural habitats over a 3 -yr period from spring 2006 through autumn 2009. We classified raptor species according to their relative abundances and occurrence frequencies, and compared the assemblage composition among land-cover types (croplands, grazing fields, periurban areas, and grasslands) and seasons. The raptor assemblage in the Flooding Pampas comprised 16 species, representing approximately 43 % of all raptor species in the biome. The Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) was the dominant species in all land-cover types and seasons. The Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus), American Kestrel (Falco sparverius), and <b>Roadside</b> <b>Hawk</b> (Rupornis magnirostris) were all abundant and very frequently observed species, whereas Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia), White-tailed Kite (Elanus leucurus), and Long-winged Harrier (Circus buffoni) were less abundant but recorded during most surveys. The remaining raptors (Aplomado Falcon [Falco femoralis], Cinereous Harrier [Circus cinereus], Short-eared Owl [Asio flammeus], Sharp-shinned Hawk [Accipiter striatus], and Snail Kite [Rostrhamus sociabilis]) were much less abundant in the study area. We also recorded four other raptor species (Variable Hawk [Geranoaetus polyosoma], Black-chested Buzzard-Eagle [G. melanoleucus], Striped Owl [Asio clamator], and Barn Owl [Tyto alba]), but only outside of the standard transect surveys. Species composition differed among land-cover types, but we detected no distinct overall seasonal patterns except that species diversity indices were lower in autumn and especially, spring. Milvago chimango was important to determine similarity in assemblage composition within land-cover types, but other less abundant species, such as C. plancus, A. cunicularia, and R. magnirostris, were more important to differentiate land-cover types based on raptor composition. Species diversity was highest in grazing fields and grasslands, and lowest in periurban areas. Our results suggest that although some raptor species appear to benefit from land-cover patterns in the study area, man...|$|E
40|$|Background: Buteo magnirostris, {{popularly known}} as <b>roadside</b> <b>hawk</b> belongs to the family Accipitridae, Ciconiiformes. The {{specimen}} is common throughout Brazil inhabiting open areas, tolerating disturbed areas very well, but avoiding dense forests. The trematodes are common parasites in the intestines of birds of prey, with scant notice of pathogenic infections. However, severe infections of trematodes Strigeidae family have been previously reported {{as a cause of}} anemia, diarrhea, enteritis, weight loss and death. This paper aims to report the occurrence of infection in S. Falconis in B. magnirostris diagnosed by post mortem examination. Case: The specimen of B. magnirostris, male, young was sent for necropsy at the Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Federal Rural University of Semi-Arid (UFERSA), Mossoró-RN, Brazil. With a history of apathy, anorexia, diarrhea and death in one course of 24 h. The free bird life and even puppy had been captured for training and practice of falconry shortly before the clinical manifestation of infection (time of captivity uninformed). On physical examination ruffled feathers, cachexia and pallor of skeletal muscle was observed. At necropsy there was severe enteritis with petechiae and accumulation of liquid contents into the duodenum. Fifty-two trematodes were found set in duodenal mucosa. The other organs and structures showed no changes. Fragments of all organs were harvested, fixed in 10 % formalin buffered, routinely processed for histopathology and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Parasites were carefully collected, washed in saline, fixed, processed and identified according to the morphology and taxonomy. Histologically, the lesions were restricted to the duodenum and were characterized by melting, severe atrophy and necrosis of the epithelial cells of the intestinal villi; inflammatory infiltrate (consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils) in the lamina propria, in addition to trematodes infiltrated the mucosa and lamina propria. These were 60 - 80 mm in diameter, consisted of parenchymal body enclosed by the integument. In some cross sections of the parasite was possible to observe the presence of cecum, testis and uterus, with some variations between sections; there were also yellowish eggs and coated with a delicate membrane. The trematodes contain approximately 1 mm in length and used as morphology and taxonomy has been identified as S. Falconis. Discussion: S. Falconis is a trematode intestinal parasite of birds of prey, with reports of its occurrence in Europe, North America and Central. In neotropical regions is described the occurrence of the subspecies S. Falconis brasiliana. Although the absence of clinical signs is a common pattern, parasitism by trematodes may become evident, common to captivity stress conditions, and thus infections, even for low pathogenic parasites can cause diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss and death, as reported in this paper. A factor that possibly contributed to the scant notice is its small size, which makes the observation of this parasite in analysis of necropsy in non-pathological conditions and also not familiar with the technical laboratories in the morphological shape of the eggs, which creates difficulty in finding the parasite in parasitological analysis in captive animals. Despite being considered poorly pathogenic trematodes, epidemiologically, the presence of the parasite should be considered a health risk to free-living predators, newly captive in parks, zoos, veterinary hospitals, triage center for wildlife and creators, as they may express pathogenicity in immunosuppressed animals. This work contributes to recording the presence S. falconis parasitizing the duodenal mucosa of B. magnirostris in Brazil...|$|E
