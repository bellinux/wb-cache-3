40|$|BACKGROUND Haemodynamic {{changes that}} occur during direct {{laryngoscopy}} and intubation {{is a major concern}} for the managing anaesthesiologist. Various drugs have been used to attenuate this response. The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of IV clonidine and IV dexmedetomidine in attenuating the haemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation during general anaesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS 100 patients who were scheduled for various elective surgeries under general anaesthesia requiring direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation were included in the study. The patientâ€™s age was varying between 18 to 60 years. After recording, the baseline parameters, patient received dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg or clonidine 2 mcg/kg based on the random allocation of groups by computer generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>table</b> number. Their haemodynamic changes were monitored. RESULTS In the present study, dexmedetomidine group had lower heart rate than that of clonidine group at different time intervals with a p value of < 0. 05. In clonidine group, the blood pressures were lower than that of dexmedetomidine group at different time intervals with p value of < 0. 05. CONCLUSION In this present study, dexmedetomidine at 1 mcg/kg attenuated the stress response to laryngoscopy and intubation as effectively as clonidine at 2 mcg/kg with better control of heart rate and systolic blood pressure with less hypotensive episodes...|$|E
40|$|Background Many {{patients}} with asthma or {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) routinely receive {{a combination of}} an inhaled bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory glucocorticosteroid, but those with severe disease often respond poorly to these classes of drug. We assessed the efficacy and safety of a novel inhaled dual phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE 3) and PDE 4 inhibitor, RPL 554 for its ability to act as a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory drug. Methods Between February, 2009, and January, 2013, we undertook four proof-of-concept clinical trials in the Netherlands, Italy, and the UK. Nebulised RPL 554 was examined in study 1 for safety in 18 healthy men who were randomly assigned (1 : 1 : 1) to receive an inhaled dose of RPL 554 (0. 003 mg/kg or 0. 009 mg/kg) or placebo by a computer-generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>table.</b> Subsequently, six non-smoking men with mild allergic asthma received single doses of RPL 554 (three received 0. 009 mg/kg and three received 0. 018 mg/kg) in an open-label, adaptive study, and then ten men with mild allergic asthma were randomly assigned to receive placebo or RPL 554 (0. 018 mg/kg) by a computer-generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>table</b> for an assessment of safety, bronchodilation, and bronchoprotection. Study 2 examined the reproducibility of the bronchodilator response to a daily dose of nebulised RPL 554 (0. 018 mg/kg) for 6 consecutive days in a single-blind (patients masked), placebo-controlled study in 12 men with clinically stable asthma. The safety and bronchodilator effect of RPL 554 (0. 018 mg/kg) was assessed in study 3, an open-label, placebo-controlled crossover trial, in 12 men with mild-to-moderate COPD. In study 4, a placebo-controlled crossover trial, the effect of RPL 554 (0. 018 mg/kg) on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cell infiltration in induced sputum was investigated in 21 healthy men. In studies 3 and 4, randomisation was done by computer-generated permutation with a block size of two for study 3 and four for study 4. Unless otherwise stated, participants and clinicians were masked to treatment assignment. Analyses were by intention to treat. All trials were registered with EudraCT, numbers 2008 - 005048 - 17, 2011 - 001698 - 22, 2010 - 023573 - 18, and 2012 - 000742 - 34. Findings Safety was a primary endpoint of studies 1 and 3 and a secondary endpoint of studies 2 and 4. Overall, RPL 554 was well tolerated, and adverse events were generally mild and of equal frequency between placebo and active treatment groups. Efficacy was a primary endpoint of study 2 and a secondary endpoint of studies 1 and 3. Study 1 measured change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC(20) MCh) in participants with asthma. RPL 554 produced rapid bronchodilation in {{patients with}} asthma with an FEV 1 increase at 1 h of 520 mL (95 % CI 320 - 720; p Interpretation In four exploratory studies, inhaled RPL 554 is an effective and well tolerated bronchodilator, bronchoprotector, and anti-inflammatory drug and further studies will establish the full potential of this new drug for the treatment of patients with COPD or asthma...|$|E
40|$|Many {{paediatric}} {{brain tumour}} survivors (PBTS) suffer from neurocognitive impairments. Promising effects of neurofeedback (NF) on neurocognitive functioning have been reported, however research into NF for PBTS {{has not been}} conducted. We investigated the effects of NF on neurocognitive functioning in PBTS using a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial with a parallel-group design (Pediatric Research on Improving Speed, Memory, and Attention; the PRISMA study). Eligible for inclusion were PBTS with neurocognitive complaints, aged 8 - 18 years, > 2 years post-treatment. They were recruited from five medical centres in the Netherlands. A <b>randomisation</b> <b>table</b> assigned participants to 30 sessions (two per week) of either NF or placebo feedback (PF) (ratio 1 : 1). Participants, parents, trainers, and researchers handling the data were blinded to group assignment. Participants were assessed pre-, post- and 6 months post-training to determine whether NF training would lead to improved functioning as compared with PF training. Primary outcome measures were attention, processing speed, memory, executive functioning, visuomotor integration, and intelligence. Linear mixed models analyses were used to test differences between NF and PF training over time. A total of 82 children were enrolled (mean age 13. 9 years, standard deviation = 3. 2, 49 % males); 80 participants were randomised (NF: n = 40, PF n = 40); 71 participants completed the training (NF: n = 34, PF: n = 37); 68 participants completed training and 6 months post-training assessment (NF: n = 33, PF: n = 35). Similar improvements were found over time for the two treatment groups on the primary outcomes (all p's > 0. 15). Results indicated no specific treatment-effects of NF on neurocognitive functioning of PBT...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: WHO 2013 {{guidelines}} recommend universal {{treatment for}} HIV-infected {{children younger than}} 5 years. No paediatric trials have compared nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Africa, where most HIV-infected children live. We aimed to compare stavudine, zidovudine, or abacavir as dual or triple fixed-dose-combination paediatric tablets with lamivudine and nevirapine or efavirenz. METHODS: In this open-label, parallel-group, randomised trial (CHAPAS- 3), we enrolled children from one centre in Zambia and three in Uganda who were previously untreated (ART naive) or on stavudine for more than 2 years with viral load less than 50 copies per mL (ART experienced). Computer-generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>tables</b> were incorporated securely within the database. The primary endpoint was grade 2 - 4 clinical or grade 3 / 4 laboratory adverse events. Analysis was intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry number, 69078957. FINDINGS: Between Nov 8, 2010, and Dec 28, 2011, 480 children were randomised: 156 to stavudine, 159 to zidovudine, and 165 to abacavir. After two were excluded due to randomisation error, 156 children were analysed in the stavudine group, 158 in the zidovudine group, and 164 in the abacavir group, and followed for median 2. 3 years (5 % lost to follow-up). 365 (76 %) were ART naive (median age 2. 6 years vs 6. 2 years in ART experienced). 917 grade 2 - 4 clinical or grade 3 / 4 laboratory adverse events (835 clinical [634 grade 2]; 40 laboratory) occurred in 104 (67 %) children on stavudine, 103 (65 %) on zidovudine, and 105 (64 %), on abacavir (p= 0. 63; zidovudine vs stavudine: hazard ratio [HR] 0. 99 [95 % CI 0. 75 - 1. 29]; abacavir vs stavudine: HR 0. 88 [0. 67 - 1. 15]). At 48 weeks, 98 (85 %), 81 (80 %) and 95 (81 %) ART-naive children in the stavudine, zidovudine, and abacavir groups, respectively, had viral load less than 400 copies per mL (p= 0. 58); most ART-experienced children maintained suppression (p= 1. 00). INTERPRETATION: All NRTIs had low toxicity and good clinical, immunological, and virological responses. Clinical and subclinical lipodystrophy was not noted in those younger than 5 years and anaemia was no more frequent with zidovudine than with the other drugs. Absence of hypersensitivity reactions, superior resistance profile and once-daily dosing favours abacavir for African children, supporting WHO 2013 guidelines.

40|$|There can be {{no purpose}} more inspiring than to begin the age of restoration, reweaving the wondrous {{diversity}} of life that still surrounds us" â€“ E. O Wilson. Ecological restoration is an expensive, time consuming and labour intensive activity. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} potential for disturbed natural ecosystems to recover without the need for intervention. This project investigates the rate of vegetation and soil recovery from different types of disturbance at 18 sites within four major ecosystems (grassy, dry sclerophyll, wet sclerophyll, and rainforest) in Tasmania. All sites have a known disturbance history (type and age). At each site, randomly located quadrats were placed in the disturbed and control areas and the percentage cover of species, bare ground and litter estimated using a modified Braun-Blanquet scale. The pH, N, P, C of surface soils from the subset of these quadrats was measured. Topographic and climatic data were obtained at the site level. Global non-metric multi-dimensional scaling was performed on the presence/absence data for all taxa. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices were produced and these were used to examine similarities and dissimilarities between disturbed and control areas. Vectors were fitted for all variables and significance determined by 1000 <b>randomisations.</b> Sorted <b>tables</b> were used to indicate the abundance and presence or absence of taxa at site and ecosystem levels. Relationships between independent variables and the mean distances between control and disturbance vegetation and soils were determined at the site level. The type of initial disturbance (superficial or severe) rather than the time since cessation of the initial disturbance or other factors was the best single predictor of the recovery of both vegetation and soil. Restoration effort should be directed towards areas that are known (as determined by site history) to have been subjected to extensive soil and vegetation disturbance...|$|R
40|$|More {{than seven}} out of 10 Dutch {{construction}} workers describe their work as physically demanding. Ergonomic measures {{can be used to}} reduce these physically demanding work tasks. To increase the use of ergonomic measures, employers and workers {{have to get used to}} other working methods and to maintaining them. To facilitate this behavioural change, participatory ergonomics (PE) interventions could be useful. For this study a protocol of a PE intervention is adapted in such a way that the intervention can be performed by an ergonomics consultant through face-to-face contacts or email contacts. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the face-to-face guidance strategy and the e-guidance strategy on the primary outcome measure: use of ergonomic measures by individual construction workers, and on the secondary outcome measures: the work ability, physical functioning and limitations due to physical problems of individual workers. The present study is a randomised intervention trial of six months in 12 companies to establish the effects of a PE intervention guided by four face-to-face contacts (N[*]=[*] 6) or guided by 13 email contacts (N[*]=[*] 6) on the primary and secondary outcome measures at baseline and after six months. Construction companies are randomly assigned to one of the guidance strategies with the help of a computer generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>table.</b> In addition, a process evaluation for both strategies will be performed to determine reach, dose delivered, dose received, precision, competence, satisfaction and behavioural change to find possible barriers and facilitators for both strategies. A cost-benefit analysis will be performed to establish the financial consequences of both strategies. The present study is in accordance with the CONSORT statement. The outcome of this study will help to 1) evaluate the effect of both guidance strategies, and 2) find barriers to and facilitators of both guidance strategies. When these strategies are effective, implementation within occupational health services can take place to guide construction companies (and others) with the implementation of ergonomic measures.

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{potentiating}} effect of short acting lipophilic opioid fentanyl {{and a more}} selective Î± 2 agonist dexmedetomidine is used to reduce the dose requirement of bupivacaine and its adverse effects and also to prolong analgesia. In this study, we aimed {{to find out whether}} quality of anaesthesia is better with low dose bupivacaine and fentanyl or with low dose bupivacaine and dexmedetomidine. Methods: This prospective randomised double-blinded study was carried out in a tertiary health care centre on 150 patients by randomly allocating them into two groups using a computer generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>table.</b> Group F (n = 75) received bupivacaine 0. 5 % heavy (0. 8 ml) +fentanyl 25 Î¼g (0. 5 ml) + normal saline 0. 3 ml and Group D (n = 75) received bupivacaine 0. 5 % heavy (0. 8 ml) + dexmedetomidine 5 Î¼g (0. 05 ml) + normal saline 0. 75 ml, aiming for a final concentration of 0. 25 % of bupivacaine (1. 6 ml), administered intrathecally. Time to reach sensory blockade to T 10 segment, peak sensory block level (PSBL), time to reach peak block, time to two segment regression (TTSR), the degree of motor block, side-effects, and the perioperative analgesic requirements were assessed. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in the time to reach T 10 segment block (P > 0. 05) and TTSR (P > 0. 05);time to reach PSBL (P < 0. 05) and modified Bromage scales (P < 0. 05) were significant. PSBL (P = 0. 000) and time to first analgesic request (P = 0. 000) were highly significant. All patients were haemodynamically stable and no significant difference in adverse effects was observed. Conclusion: Both groups provided adequate anaesthesia for all lower abdominal surgeries with haemodynamic stability. Dexmedetomidine is superior to fentanyl since it facilitates the spread of the block and offers longer post-operative analgesic duration...|$|E
40|$|No {{high-quality}} {{trials have}} provided evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HIV treatment adherence intervention strategies. We therefore examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Adherence Improving self-Management Strategy (AIMS) compared with treatment as usual. We did a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, {{randomised controlled trial}} in seven HIV clinics at academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligible participants were patients with HIV who were either treatment experienced (ie, with â‰¥ 9 months on combination antiretroviral therapy [ART] and at risk of viral rebound) or treatment-naive patients initiating their first combination ART regimen. We randomly assigned participants (1 : 1) to either AIMS or treatment as usual (ie, containing a range of common adherence intervention strategies) using a computer-generated <b>randomisation</b> <b>table.</b> Randomisation was stratified by treatment experience (experienced vs naive) and included block randomisation at nurse level with randomly ordered blocks of size four, six, and eight. 21 HIV nurses from the participating clinics received three training sessions of 6 h each (18 h in total) on AIMS and a 1 Â· 5 h booster training session at the clinic (two to three nurses per session) after each nurse had seen two to three patients. AIMS was delivered by nurses during routine clinic visits. We did mixed-effects, intent-to-treat analyses to examine treatment effects on the primary outcome of log 10 viral load collected at months 5, 10, and 15. The viral load results were exponentiated (with base 10) for easier interpretation. Using cohort data from 7347 Dutch patients with HIV to calculate the natural course of illness, we developed a lifetime Markov model to estimate the primary economic outcome of lifetime societal costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov (number NCT 01429142). We recruited participants between Sept 1, 2011, and April 2, 2013; the last patient completed the study on June 16, 2014. The intent-to-treat sample comprised 221 patients; 109 assigned to AIMS and 112 to treatment as usual. Across the three timepoints (months 5, 10, and 15), log viral load was 1 Â· 26 times higher (95 % CI 1 Â· 04 - 1 Â· 52) in the treatment-as-usual group (estimated marginal mean 44 Â· 5 copies per mL [95 % CI 35 Â· 5 - 55 Â· 9]) than in the AIMS group (estimated marginal mean 35 Â· 4 copies per mL [29 Â· 9 - 42 Â· 0]). Additionally, AIMS was cost-effective (ie, dominant: cheaper and more effective) since it reduced lifetime societal costs by â‚¬ 592 per patient and increased QALYs by 0 Â· 034 per patient. Findings from preparatory {{studies have shown that}} AIMS is acceptable, feasible to deliver in routine care, and has reproducible effects on medication adherence. In this study, AIMS reduced viral load, increased QALYs, and saved resources. Implementation of AIMS in routine clinical HIV care is therefore recommended.

40|$|Background: Infant simulator-based programmes, which aim {{to prevent}} teenage pregnancy, {{are used in}} high-income as well as low-income and middle-income {{countries}} but, despite growing popularity, no published evidence exists of their long-term effect. The aim of this trial {{was to investigate the}} effect of such a programme, the Virtual Infant Parenting (VIP) programme, on pregnancy outcomes of birth and induced abortion in Australia. Methods: In this school-based pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial, eligible schools in Perth, Western Australia, were enrolled and randomised 1 : 1 to the intervention and control groups. <b>Randomisation</b> using a <b>table</b> of random numbers without blocking, stratification, or matching was done by a researcher who was masked to the identity of the schools. Between 2003 and 2006, the VIP programme was administered to girls aged 13 â€“ 15 years in the intervention schools, while girls of the same age in the control schools received the standard health education curriculum. Participants were followed until they reached 20 years of age via data linkage to hospital medical and abortion clinic records. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of pregnancy during the teenage years. Binomial and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test for differences in pregnancy rates between study groups. This study is registered as an international randomised controlled trial, number ISRCTN 24952438. Findings: 57 (86 %) of 66 eligible schools were enrolled into the trial and randomly assigned 1 : 1 to the intervention (28 schools) or the control group (29 schools). Then, between Feb 1, 2003, and May 31, 2006, 1267 girls in the intervention schools received the VIP programme while 1567 girls in the control schools received the standard health education curriculum. Compared with girls in the control group, a higher proportion of girls in the intervention group recorded at least one birth (97 [8 %] of 1267 in the intervention group vs 67 [4 %] of 1567 in the control group) or at least one abortion as the first pregnancy event (113 [9 %] vs 101 [6 %]). After adjustment for potential confounders, the intervention group had a higher overall pregnancy risk than the control group (relative risk 1 Â· 36 [95 % CI 1 Â· 10 â€“ 1 Â· 67], p= 0 Â· 003). Similar results were obtained with the use of proportional hazard models (hazard ratio 1 Â· 35 [95 % CI 1 Â· 10 â€“ 1 Â· 67], p= 0 Â· 016). Interpretation: The infant simulator-based VIP programme did not achieve its aim of reducing teenage pregnancy. Girls in the intervention group were more likely to experience a birth or an induced abortion than those in the control group before they reached 20 years of age.
