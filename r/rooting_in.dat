500|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the Marsileaceae are the Salviniaceae, which are also aquatic and heterosporous. [...] However, both of these other fern families float freely {{on the surface of}} ponds or lakes instead of <b>rooting</b> <b>in</b> soil or mud. [...] The close relationship of these groups to the Marsileaceae is supported by both morphologic and molecular analysis, {{as well as by the}} discovery of an intermediate fossil named Hydropteris. [...] In general, the Salviniaceae and Azollaceae have a much better fossil record than the Marsileaceae. [...] Until recently, Rodeites dakshinii was the oldest fossil member known; it is a preserved sporocarp containing spores, found in Tertiary chert of India. [...] In 2000, the discovery of fossilized sporocarps from the Cretaceous of eastern North America was announced. [...] These fossils were assigned to the species Regnellidium upatoiensis, and pushed the known history of the Marsileaceae back into the Mesozoic. [...] The oldest fossil known for the Marsileaceae is Regnellites nagashimae from the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous of Japan. The fossils include leaves with visible veins, as well as sporocarps.|$|E

A single <b>root</b> <b>in</b> {{the center of}} a cylinder of soil has been the standard geometry for which most root-level water and nutrient uptake models have been derived. However, this implies assumptions about complete root–soil contact and regularly spaced, parallel roots that do not conform to the situation in the field. In reality, the frequency distribution of transport distances will differ from what the cylinder model assumes, both by partial root–soil contact and irregular three-dimensional (3 -D) distribution.
