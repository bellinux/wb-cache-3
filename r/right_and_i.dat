25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E

One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person.

500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream.

500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} they {{returned}} home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. [...] "Christianity will go," [...] Lennon had said. [...] "It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – {{on the eve of the}} group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American [...] "Bible Belt". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, [...] "If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it." [...] Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: [...] "If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for The Joshua Tree. The Edge said, [...] "We were jamming with Brian [...] He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost highlife, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> went with it." [...] Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as {{he felt that he}} could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a Bond Electraglide guitar to play a solo with a [...] "heavy fuzz" [...] sound {{at the end of the}} song. Three musicians from Toronto—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer Daniel Lanois, the Armins used [...] "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument" [...] they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, [...] " [...] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." [...] Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.|$|E

Robbie Daw of Idolator said that, although he [...] "liked the dancability of the Kelly's upbeat tunes," [...] it was [...] "as nice to hear her take on a ballad again." [...] He called the single her best chance of [...] "finally crack {{the upper reaches of the}} Hot 100 once again." [...] Following the video's premier, Daw said that, alongside [...] "Kelly looking stunning in the video," [...] the song had [...] "hit" [...] potential. [...] "Surely the timing is right—especially with all the other singles Dr. Luke has had a hand in dominating the charts—for Rowland to be allowed into the spotlight once more." [...] Lizzie Goodwin of Gather.com agreed that the song, though different from her previous singles, stands on its own as a catchy tune. [...] "Though it’s no 'When Love Takes Over', Kelly Rowland’s latest single and music video 'Rose Colored Glasses' isn’t half-bad. It might not be a dance hit, but her new single is pretty catchy and is a great addition to include in a breakup/girl empowerment playlist." [...] Mack from Sound-Savvy said, [...] "Kelly always makes those love songs that make you re-examine things...While I don’t think Rose Colored Glasses will impact as hard as Commander, it's a formidable single in its own <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> kinda like it." [...] Despite accepting that Rowland has had her moments with the club songs, Melinda Newman of HitFix praised Dr. Luke's production work, stating that [...] "the song is a show stopper (a nice production by him- we often find him too slick)." [...] Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant said that Rowland had done a smart thing by not releasing [...] "Commander" [...] in the United States. He said, [...] " [...] edgier preference of dance music is very different to the dance-pop that Lady Gaga often tops the charts with."

I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft.

2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E

[...] and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported [...] "The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'". In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic [...] "I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> may have been wrong" [...] Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings.
