40|$|AbstractThe {{importation}} {{market has}} been turned into an attractive market for merchants with ever-growing increase in number <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> companies and rising volume of imports during recent years. The basic and fundamental changes are required for their structure in importation companies due to the wide range of various types of imported commodities and effect of their performance on economic variables. The improvement in variables of marketing potentials to enhance performance and competitive advantage <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> companies with impact of moderating role of risk management are necessarily assumed as the reasons for selection of the subject of this study. The present research is of applied type in terms of goal and a descriptive-survey in terms of method of data collection. The statistical population of this study includes 100 importer companies that actively deal with <b>importation</b> <b>of</b> through custom house at Imam Khomeini International Airport out of which 80 enterprises were determined as sample size and research questionnaire was distributed collected among 120 participants <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> experts as raters of corporate performance within statistical sample.

The results of study signify that the marketing potentials affect on competitive advantage of the importer company {{and at the same time}} marketing capability impacts on performance <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> company while competitive advantage might affect on performance <b>of</b> <b>importation</b> companies...|$|R

40|$|Background: Given the {{interconnectivity}} of Brazil {{with the}} rest of the world, Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have the potential to spread rapidly around the world via viremic travellers. The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. Design: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> dengue to estimate the number <b>of</b> ZIKV <b>importations</b> into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. Results: Our model estimated between 508 and 1, 778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> being into France, Portugal and Italy. Conclusions: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe. Such data can assist policymakers and public health professionals in estimating the extent <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> in order to prepare for the scale up of laboratory diagnostic assays and estimate the occurrence of Guillain–Barré Syndrome, potential sexual transmission, and infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMeasles is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} vaccine-preventable disease {{that can lead to}} serious complications. Although measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur each year as a result <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> the disease from countries in which it remains endemic. We describe the epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>importations</b> <b>of</b> measles virus into the US during the post-elimination 0 era. MethodsMeasles is nationally notifiable in the USA and local and state health departments report confirmed measles cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A 0 case is considered internationally imported if {{at least some of the}} exposure period (7 - 210 days before rash onset) occurred outside of the USA, rash onset occurred within 210 days of entering the USA, and there was no known exposure to measles in the US during that time.
