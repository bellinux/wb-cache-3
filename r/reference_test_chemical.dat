40|$|Background: Studies {{investigating}} the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are typically performed using the clinical diagnosis or amyloid-β {{positron emission tomography}} as the <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> However, neither {{can be considered a}} gold standard or a perfect <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> for AD.

Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of AD biomarkers while taking the imperfectness of the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> into account. Methods: To determine the diagnostic accuracy ofADbiomarkers and taking the imperfectness of the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> into account, we have developed a Bayesian method.

40|$|A {{number of}} in vitro test methods using Reconstructed human Tissues (RhT) are {{regulatory}} accepted {{for evaluation of}} skin corrosion/irritation. In such methods, <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> corrosion/irritation potential is determined by measuring tissue viability using the photometric MTT-reduction assay. A known limitation of this assay is possible interference of strongly coloured <b>test</b> <b>chemicals</b> with measurement of formazan by absorbance (OD). To address this, Cosmetics Europe evaluated use of HPLC/UPLCspectrophotometry as an alternative formazan measurement system. Using the approach recommended by the FDA guidance for validation of bio-analytical methods, three independent laboratories established and qualified their HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry systems to reproducibly measure formazan from tissue extracts. Up to 26 <b>chemicals</b> were then <b>tested</b> in RhT test systems for eye/skin irritation and skin corrosion. Results support that: (1) HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry formazan measurement is highly reproducible; (2) formazan measurement by HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry and OD gave almost identical tissue viabilities for <b>test</b> <b>chemicals</b> not exhibiting colour interference nor direct MTT reduction; (3) independent of the test system used, HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry can measure formazan for strongly coloured <b>test</b> <b>chemicals</b> when this is not possible by absorbance only.

40|$|There is {{conflicting}} {{evidence about the}} accuracy of bone scintigraphy (BS) for the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome 1 (CRPS 1). In a meta-analysis of diagnostic studies, the evaluation of test accuracy is impeded {{by the use of}} different imperfect <b>reference</b> <b>tests.</b> The aim of our study is to summarize sensitivity and specificity of BS for CRPS 1 and to identify factors to explain heterogeneity. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model test accuracy and threshold, and we present different models accounting for the imperfect nature of the <b>reference</b> <b>tests,</b> and assuming conditional dependence between BS and the <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> results. Further, we include disease duration as explanatory variable in the model. The models are compared using summary ROC curves and the deviance information criterion (DIC). Our results show that those models which account for different imperfect <b>reference</b> <b>tests</b> with conditional dependence and inclusion of the covariate are the ones with the smallest DIC. The sensitivity of BS was 0. 87 (95 % credible interval 0. 73 - 0. 97) and the overall specificity was 0. 87 (0. 73 - 0. 95) in the model with the smallest DIC, in which missing values of the covariate are imputed within the Bayesian framework. The estimated effect of duration of symptoms on the threshold parameter was 0. 17 (- 0. 25 to 0. 57).

40|$|Abstract. Experimental {{studies on}} <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases are of capital {{importance}} {{to support the}} development of models and coupling strategies for simulations on fluid-structure interaction problems. The need for experimental test cases specially addressed for the validation and diagnostic of numerical tools has triggered the present contribution to design and to study two-dimensional <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases both in laminar and turbulent flows. From the experimental view point, investigations on coupled unsteady flow and structure motions require specially adapted test rigs and measuring techniques to obtain accurate time-phase resolved results. Therefore a new experimental facility to be operated with a large range of viscous liquids was built exclusively for the present study. It made possible to perform measurements, using optical laser measurement techniques, in laminar and turbulent flows under very well controlled boundary and working conditions. A Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measuring system was adapted to measure both the periodical flow velocity field and the structure deflection modes. The first <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> cases were conducted in laminar flows (Reynolds number ≤ 200). In that period an extended investigation {{was performed on the}} coupled motion of relatively simple two-dimensional reference structures immersed in a high viscous fluid (kinematic viscosity of 0, 000164 m 2 /s). This paper presents a complete characterization of a <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> case for an incoming velocity of 1, 45 m/s. ...|$|R

This study compares the diagnostic performance of a single open question 'What about swallowing?' (usual care) with the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT- 10) as <b>reference</b> <b>test</b> in screening for oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD). 303 outpatients at risk of OD were recruited at three university hospitals: 162 men and 141 women {{with a mean age of}} 70 years. All data were retrieved by phone. To identify patients at risk of dysphagia, two different cut-off scores for the EAT- 10 total score were retrieved from the literature. The diagnostic performance of the single question was determined by comparing dichotomized answers to the single question (no problems versus difficulties in swallowing) with the EAT- 10 as <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values ranged between 0. 75 - 0. 76, 0. 75 - 0. 84, 0. 93 - 0. 97 and 0. 38 - 0. 43, respectively. Mostly, the results of this exploratory study indicate a sufficient diagnostic performance of the single question in identifying patients who are at risk of dysphagia when using the EAT- 10 questionnaire as a <b>reference</b> <b>test.</b> Further research, is, however, necessary to provide additional psychometric data on Functional Health Status (FHS) questionnaires including the single question using either FEES or VFS as gold standard or <b>reference</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{co-culture}} clonal survival assay {{was developed}} to measure the cytotoxicity of <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> treatments to BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells because the standard clonal survival assay using 200 wild type (WT) cells frequently overestimates chemical cytotoxicity when compared with identical treatment doses in high-density cultures. The assay used co-cultures of 3. 2 x 10 (4) WT cells, the same seeding density used in the transformation assay, and 200 ouabain resistant (OUAr) cells. After a 48 -hr <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> treatment, co-cultured cells were fed with culture medium containing 4 mM ouabain. The <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> was cytotoxic to an equal percentage of WT and OUAr cells. Ouabain treatments killed the remaining WT cells. Thus, OUAr cells surviving the <b>test</b> <b>chemical</b> treatment measured the relative cloning efficiency (RCE) of all treated cells in the high-density cell co-culture. The co-culture assay succeeded because metabolic cooperation at the OUAr locus was not detected in BALB/c- 3 T 3 cells. Five chemicals induced comparable cytotoxic responses in both assays, including actinomycin D, 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine, N'-methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine, dimethyl sulfoxide and sodium chloride. In contrast, chemical cytotoxic responses detected in the standard and co-culture assays differed by > or = 10 -fold for 11 -aminoundecanoic acid, benzo[a]pyrene, cytosine arabinoside, and 3 -methyl-cholanthrene and differed by > 2 -fold for 2 -acetylaminofluorene and dimethylnitrosamine.
