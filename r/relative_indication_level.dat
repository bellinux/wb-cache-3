40|$|Background: Colonoscopy is an {{invasive}} procedure and a limited resource. It is there- fore desirable to restrict its use {{to those in}} whom it yields an important diagnosis, without missing pathology in others. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether standard clinical criteria can be used to reliably distinguish when colonoscopy is advisable in women 30 years and younger. Methods: A retrospective audit was performed at a single centre of 100 consecutive colonoscopies performed in women 30 years old and younger. The indications for the colonoscopy were recorded, and divided into clear and <b>relative</b> <b>indications.</b> The primary outcome of whether an endoscopic diagnosis was made was compared between the two groups. Clear indications for colonoscopy included overt rectal bleeding, elevated inflammatory markers, anaemia, iron deficiency and strong family history of colorectal cancer. <b>Relative</b> <b>indications</b> included abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating and altered bowel habit/motions. Results: The average age was 23 years. Sixty women had both <b>relative</b> and clear <b>indications.</b> Eleven had only clear indications and 28 only <b>relative</b> <b>indications.</b> Alto- gether, 58 colonoscopies were normal, and 17 showed inflammatory bowel disease. No subject with only <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> had an abnormal finding (0 / 28). The diagnostic yield was significantly different between those with only <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> (0 %) versus those with at least one clear indication (59 %; P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Standard clinical criteria can be used to restrict safely the use of colonoscopy in young women. This will avoid performing procedures in people without clear indications, saving costs, resources and complications. K. D. Williamson, K. Steveling, G. Holtmann, M. Schoeman and J. M. Andrew...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{appropriateness}} of prescribing acid suppressive therapy (AST) in a general medicine service in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the inpatient records of all patients admitted to the general medical service in a tertiary care hospital in Beirut, Lebanon, from April 1 to May 31, 2011. Treatment with AST was considered appropriate if the patient had a specific indication or appropriate treatment purpose [e. g., gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, dyspepsia, acute or suspected gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding]. Appropriate administration of stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) was derived from an internal guideline {{that is based on}} the American Society of Health System Pharmacists guidelines. Prophylaxis was considered appropriate if a patient had 1 absolute indication (coagulopathy or requiring mechanical ventilation), or 2 or more <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> (sepsis, occult bleeding, use of high dose corticosteroids, recent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for more than 3 mo, renal or liver failure, enteral feeding and anticoagulant use). RESULTS: Of the 153 patient admissions during the study period, 130 patients (85 %) were started on AST, out of which 11 (8. 5 %) had a diagnosis that supports the use of this therapy (GI bleed, gastritis and GERD), 16 (12. 3 %) had an absolute indication for SUP, 59 (45. 4 %) had 2 or more <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> for SUP, and 44 (33. 8 %) received AST without an appropriate indication. In addition, one patient with an absolute indication for SUP and four with two or more <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> did not receive AST. Rabeprazole was the most frequently used AST (59. 2 %), followed by omeprazole (24. 6 %), esomeprazole (11. 6 %) and ranitidine (4. 6 %). The dose of AST was appropriate in 126 patients (96. 9 %) and the route of administration was appropriate in 123 patients (94. 6 %). Fifteen of the admitted patients (10 %) were discharged on AST, 7 of which (47 %) did not have an appropriate indication. CONCLUSION: AST is overused in hospitalized non-critically ill patients and many patients are discharged on unnecessary AST which can increase cost, drug interactions and adverse events.

40|$|Introduction Given advancements in {{endoscopic}} image quality, instrumentation, surgical navigation, {{skull base}} closure techniques, and anatomical understanding, the endonasal endoscopic approach has rapidly {{evolved into a}} widely utilized technique for removal of sellar and parasellar tumors. Although pituitary adenomas and Rathke cleft cysts constitute the majority of lesions removed via this route, craniopharyngiomas, clival chordomas, parasellar meningiomas, and other lesions are increasingly removed using this approach. Paralleling {{the evolution of the}} endonasal route to the parasellar region, the supraorbital eyebrow craniotomy has also been increasingly used as an alternative minimally invasive approach to reach this skull base region. Similar to the endonasal route, the supraorbital route has been greatly facilitated by advances in endoscopy, along with development of more refined, low-profile instrumentation and surgical navigation technology. Objectives This review, encompassing both transcranial and transsphenoidal routes, will recount the high points and advances that have made minimally invasive approaches to the sellar region possible, the evolution of these approaches, and their <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> and technical nuances. Data Synthesis The literature is reviewed regarding the evolution of surgical approaches to the sellar region beginning with the earliest attempts and emphasizing technological advances, which have allowed the evolution of the modern technique. The surgical techniques for both endoscopic transsphenoidal and supraorbital approaches are described in detail. The <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> for each approach are highlighted using case illustrations. Conclusions Although tremendous advances have been made in transitioning toward minimally invasive transcranial and transsphenoidal approaches to the sella, further work remains to be done. Together, the endonasal endoscopic and the supraorbital endoscope-assisted approaches are complementary minimally invasive routes to the parasellar region...|$|R

Paper IV: To compare sensitivity for stone detection and renal outflow obstruction with non-enhanced helical CT (NCCT) versus urography in the diagnosis of acute renal colic. Patients and methods: Paper I: In a prospective cohort study in Sweden, 1171 patients treated for renal stones with ESWL with 7 different ESWL-machines at 11 centres were evaluated regarding treatment results. Paper II: In a retrospective study, an unselected patient material was reviewed. In 1998, 173 ureteric stones were treated, URS was first-line treatment in 124 patients. In 2000, 176 patients were treated, ESWL was first-line treatment in 158 patients. Paper III: In a prospective randomised study, 172 patients with renal colic who became pain-free after analgetics were included. They were randomised to immediate or deferred (within 2 - 3 weeks) radiological examination. All patients answered a questionnaire on a daily basis regarding morbidity, defined as impairment of daily activities, consumption of analgetics, need for emergency department revisits or hospitalisation. Treatments were registered Paper IV: Prospectively, 131 patients with acute renal colic were included. All patients underwent NCCT immediately followed by urography. Two independent, blinded radiologists assessed the NCCT findings regarding stone detection and renal outflow obstruction, in comparison with urography. Results: Paper I: Treatment outcome differed statistically between centres and between centres with the same type of EWSL-machines. Larger and multiple stones as well as location in a cavity increased the risk for treatment failure. Paper II: Treatment success with ESWL was 90 % compared with 95 % for URS, no statistical difference was noted. Paper III: The incidence of acute renal colic was 0. 9 / 1000 inhabitants and year, 74 % became pain-free after analgetics. There was no statistical difference regarding morbidity or treatment incidence between the two groups. Impairment of daily activities lasted a median of two days in both groups. Paper IV: In patients with absolute indication for immediate radiological examination, NCCT detected all stones, urography missed two stones of 22. Corresponding figures for patients with <b>relative</b> <b>indication</b> were 49 out of 52, urography missed 15 stones. In each group, NCCT detected all but one patient with moderate or severe renal outflow obstruction.

Paper III: In patients with renal colic, 74 % had <b>relative</b> <b>indications</b> for immediate radiological examination. The morbidity following renal colic was low and was not altered by performing the radiological examination within 24 hours, as compared with 2 - 3 weeks.
