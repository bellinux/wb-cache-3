5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This <b>reserve</b> <b>capacity</b> can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E

Reserving Operating Room (OR) capacity {{is a common}} technique to maximize the responsiveness of an OR in case of arrival of an emergency patient.

In this study two approaches of <b>reserving</b> <b>capacity</b> were compared: (1) concentrating all <b>reserved</b> OR <b>capacity</b> in dedicated emergency ORs, and (2) evenly <b>reserving</b> <b>capacity</b> in all elective ORs.
