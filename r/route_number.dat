The first route, which was formed in 1933, connected US-50/US-89/US-91 (now US-89) to SR-68 in Bluffdale until the route was decommissioned in 1953. From May 8, 1961 to February 14, 1964, the <b>route</b> <b>number</b> was used for a road from US-91 to I-15 {{in the city of}} Beaver.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{originally}} constructed to connect rural cities in eastern Utah with Grand Junction, Colorado, {{the largest city}} in the region. Part of the highway was merged into the Utah state highway system in 1931; the rest {{was taken over by}} the state and assigned <b>route</b> <b>number</b> 128 in 1933. Today, the highway is used as a scenic drive for visitors to the area.|$|E
5|$|The roadway on {{its current}} {{alignment}} has existed {{since at least}} 1926, however there are records of a road between Paterson and Prosser since 1906.

5|$|All {{of what is}} now NY31F was {{originally}} designated as part of Route20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route20 entered the village of Macedon on modern NY31 and continued westward to Rochester on current NY96. On March1, 1921, Route20 was realigned to utilize modern NY31 and NY250 between Macedon and Fairport. Although all of modern NY31F was part of a legislative route at one time and was state-maintained west of Fairport and from Macedon Center to Macedon by 1926, it was not assigned a posted <b>route</b> <b>number</b> until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{several of the}} routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways which {{did not yet have}} a <b>route</b> <b>number,</b> such as the Preston–Norwich state highway, were assigned one. The road was designated as NY319 and maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation west of the Norwich city limits and by the city of Norwich within the city. The alignment of NY319 remained unchanged for the next half-century.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 2016 {{the route}} saw several changes. Faster buses were {{introduced}} at peak time between Manchester and Burnley, and the route was extended twice an hour beyond Burnley to Skipton via the M65 and Colne. Nelson, however, {{is no longer}} served by off-peak X43 buses, although services remain during peak hours. A Sunday extension of the route to Grassington was introduced; these services had already operated, but had previously used <b>route</b> <b>number</b> 872.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{constructed}} as a divided four-lane road with two traffic circles, {{the route of}} Highway420 formed part of the QEW between 1941 and 1972 before being assigned a unique <b>route</b> <b>number.</b> This {{took place during the}} reconstruction of the four lane divided highway into a freeway and the construction of the large interchange at the freeway's western terminus. In 1998, the section of Highway420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to the responsibility of the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Regional Road420.|$|E
50|$|Tasmania {{introduced}} an alphanumeric <b>route</b> <b>numbering</b> system in 1979, {{based on the}} British system from 1963. The new system aimed to upgrade the signing of destinations, including previously unmarked roads, and to simplify navigation by allowing visitors to follow <b>numbered</b> <b>routes.</b> National Highway 1 was retained as the only route without an alphanumeric designation.In the 1990s Victoria and South Australia also overhauled their systems.

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} states, {{there are no}} formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same <b>route</b> <b>number</b> under {{different}} systems. Motorists using Michigan's highways may encounter I-75 and M-75, as well as both US8 and M-8. Many of the state's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated M-n trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.|$|E
5|$|With the {{completion}} of I-68 and the change in its <b>route</b> <b>number,</b> the US48 designation was removed. In 2002, AASHTO approved {{the establishment of a}} new US48, this time for the Corridor H highway from Weston, West Virginia, to Strasburg, Virginia. This marks the third time that the US48 number has been assigned to a highway, the first use being for a highway in California that existed in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|An early road {{following}} the current path {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the <b>route</b> <b>number</b> went further west than its current-day designation; that section was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but that section too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E

5|$|In Tompkins County, {{the road}} was reconstructed {{as part of a}} project {{contracted}} out on August24, 1916. Work on the highway was completed in the early-to-mid-1920s, and the improved road was added to the state highway system as SH1433. The Groton–Cortland state highway did not have a posted <b>route</b> <b>number</b> until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time. SH446, SH996, and SH1433 were collectively designated as NY222, which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets. The alignment of NY222 has not been changed since that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} antiquity, {{the western}} Istria route {{was first used}} by Via Flavia in the classical antiquity, but the roads in the area declined in the Middle Ages and subsequent division of the Istrian Peninsula by the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg Empire was not conductive to development of a road system. In the 19th century, the First French Empire started road construction, including the TriestePula route now largely followed by D21. The present-day D21 route {{was a part of}} M2 Adriatic Highway route after the Second World War. It was made a separate state road and assigned its present <b>route</b> <b>number</b> in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways without a posted <b>route</b> <b>number</b> {{were given a}} signed designation for the first time. The Altona–Chazy Landing state highway was designated as NY191. At its east end, the route connected to Vermont RouteF-2 on Isle La Motte {{by way of a}} ferry across part of Lake Champlain. The ferry was discontinued in 1937; however, the endpoints of NY191 remained unchanged. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of all of NY191 was transferred from the state of New York to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The entirety of the highway was designated as CR23 by Clinton County and NY191 was truncated to consist only of the portion of the route between Sciota and Chazy. The route was decommissioned on March 18, 2015.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{several of the}} routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways that {{did not yet have}} a <b>route</b> <b>number</b> were assigned one. This included both SH1282 and the section of SH286 south of Morton Road as both became part of NY18, a highway that was extended eastward from Buffalo to Rochester as part of the renumbering. At the time, NY18 entered the hamlet of Morton on Kenmore Road and followed Morton, Redman, and Church Roads and Lake Road West Fork into Hamlin, where it overlapped with NY63 (modern NY19) south along Lake Road to rejoin its modern alignment at Hamlin Center Road. By the following year, NY360 was assigned to what is now NY18 between NY272 and Lake Road (then-NY63) in Hamlin. The alignments of NY18 and NY360 between Morton and Hamlin were flipped , placing both highways on their modern routings.|$|E
5|$|NY73 was {{truncated}} to {{its current}} eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US9, while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY74, matching the other Vermont <b>route</b> <b>number</b> that ends in Larrabees Point. The already existing NY74 in Chautauqua County (in the Jamestown area) was renumbered to NY474 as a result. The opening of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY74 from US9 to I-87. By 1981, NY74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga, on a concurrency with NY22. The highway has remained the same since that date.|$|E
5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The state did not add traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed <b>route</b> <b>number</b> until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E
