40|$|Using panel data on six Chinese {{manufacturing}} industries {{over the}} period 2005 – 2007, this article explores the interrelationship among foreign presence, <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> and export intensity of local firms. We find that the <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> and exports are complementary for local firms in China’s pharmaceutical industry, whereas {{in the case of}} the textile, transportation equipment, beverage, communication equipment and general equipment manufacturing industries, <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> and exports are substitutes. An increase in the average <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> increases foreign presence in all industries. The same applies to an increase in the average export intensity. An increase in the level of competition in China’s textile industry increases the export intensity as well as <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of local textile firms. However, an increase in the level of competition in the pharmaceutical industry leads to a very large decrease in export intensity of local pharmaceutical firms. In the case of China’s transportation equipment manufacturing industry, an increase in the level of competition decreases <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of local firms. Furthermore, an increase in the firm size increases <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of Chinese firms in all six manufacturing industries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and quantifies {{the impact}} on <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of being an exporter. It is widely assumed that exporters sell in domestic market more than non-exporters, among other important features. However, export participation also slows the growth rates of <b>domestic</b> <b>sales.</b> We will refer to this fall in <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> growth as residual export. The empirical analysis uses Spanish microdata provided by the Encuesta Sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE) for the period 1990 - 2011 in a difference-in-difference model. This method compares <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> before and after entry in exporting for two time periods and for two groups of firms: exporters and non-exporters. The results confirm that participation in export activities slows down <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> growth significantly, although the amount of this result varies when we distinguish between different types of firms according to their persistence as exporter. ...|$|R

40|$|How do firms' sales {{interact}} across markets? Are {{foreign and}} <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> complements or substitutes? Using a large French firm-level database that combine balance-sheet and product-destination-specific export information {{over the period}} 1995 - 2001, we study the interconnections between exports and <b>domestic</b> <b>sales.</b> We identify exogenous shocks that affect firm demand on foreign markets to instrument yearly variations in exports. Our results show that exogenous variations in foreign sales are positively associated with <b>domestic</b> <b>sales,</b> even after controlling for changes in domestic demand. A 10 % exogenous increase in exports generates a 1. 5 to 3 % increase in <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> in the short-term. This result is robust to various estimation techniques, instruments, controls, and sub-samples. It is also supported by the natural experiment of the Asian crisis in the late 1990 's.

40|$|Export tax {{and export}} quota are {{traditional}} policies used by {{developing countries to}} restrict exports. However, {{a new breed of}} export control policy, namely <b>domestic</b> <b>sale</b> requirement, is pursued by some developing countries. According to this policy, a certain percentage of the output is required to be sold in the domestic market and only the remaining production can be exported. Indonesia has undertaken this policy in addition to subsidizing <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of crude oil to benefit the consumers. This study analyzes the effects of these two policies on prices, quantities, and welfare, and compares these effects to those of export quota. The results show that the <b>domestic</b> <b>sale</b> requirement-cum-subsidy policies are clearly inferior to free trade but superior to export quota, because under these policies, unlike under the export quota, supply is allowed to respond to world market prices. <b>domestic</b> <b>sale</b> regulation, export quota, price support, subsidy, welfare,...|$|R

40|$|We {{present and}} test a model {{relating}} a firm's idiosyncratic cost, its exporting status, and the volatilities of its <b>domestic</b> and export <b>sales.</b> In prior models of trade, supply costs for domestic and exports were linear and thus additively separable. We introduce a nonlinear cost function {{in order to}} link the domestic and export supply costs. This theoretical contribution has two new implications for the exporting firm. First, the demand volatility in the foreign market now directly affects the firm's <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> volatility. Second, firms hedge domestic demand volatility with exports. The model has several testable predictions. First, larger firms have lower total and <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> volatilities. Second, foreign market volatility increases <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> volatilities for exporters. Third, exporters allocate output across both markets {{in order to reduce}} total sales volatility. We find evidence for these predictions with Danish firms operating between 1992 and 2006. ...|$|R

40|$|Sweden {{has seen}} a rise in {{business}} R&D intensities and dependence on exports to make its economy grow since the early 1990 s. This paper examines the role of foreign sales for stimulating R&D as compared to a <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> effect. In line with the literature, we find in cross-sections from 1991 to 2001 that R&D rises proportionally to sales. But among manufacturing firms foreign sales is distinctly more strongly associated {{with an increase in}} R&D than <b>domestic</b> <b>sales.</b> For service firms <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> are as important as foreign. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that manufacturing firms more easily separate production from R&D, that they economize on transport costs and are subject to learning-by-export effects. In general, the results highlight the dependence and the role of openness for stimulating R&D in a small economy, especially among manufacturing firms. R&D; size; exports; Sweden...|$|R
