50|$|Den had got {{involved}} with The Firm over the summer of 1988 and his only option was to flee the square. After a spell on <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> and a dramatic escape from the police and {{from members of the}} Firm who ambushed him on his way to court, viewers watched a mysterious gunman shoot at Den with a gun hidden in a bunch of daffodils, before hearing a splash. A shot depicting Den's death was cut from the final scene, in the hope that Grantham might one day be persuaded to return to the role. The following year, a body believed to be Den's was found in the canal.|$|E

50|$|The {{three men}} {{were held in}} the borough police station until they could appear before the magistrates {{on the morning of}} Monday, 8 September. Dudley appears to have been {{confident}} that the magistrates would dismiss the charges and Liddicoat visited the men to apologise for their inconvenience, but all magistrates had recently been instructed to seek advice of the Treasury Solicitor in all murder cases and the clerk probably prompted Laverty to ask for a <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> and adjournment while advice was sought. Local solicitor Harry Tilly appeared for the men and requested bail but after the magistrates, including Liddicoat, had consulted, they were returned to the police cells until 11 September.|$|E
50|$|On 24 November 2010, {{just four}} months after being paroled, Chindamo was arrested in Catford and {{detained}} by police for questioning {{in connection with a}} mugging. He is alleged to have threatened to kill a man before robbing him of a wallet and mobile phone in Camden. As a result of his arrest and <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> Chindamo was recalled to custody {{under the terms of the}} life licence which comes with his original life sentence. On 24 August 2011, Chindamo and his two co-defendants were acquitted of robbery. He remained in custody under the terms of his life license as he was adjudged to present a risk. On 2 May 2014 the Parole Board announced its approval of Chindamo's re-release from custody after serving three-and-a-half years.|$|E

Assessment by doctors en-abled magistrates to reduce remands in custody of persons suspected of suffering from mental disorder and to grant bail in more cases. Only {{a small proportion of}} prisoners were admitted to hospital and although doctors and nurses recommended out-patient treatment in many cases, the attendance rate was low. Doctors were more likely than nurses to identify prisoners with medical needs that needed to be {{brought to the attention of}} the prison health care service, and to recommend out-patient psychia-tric treatment and identify relevant medicolegal issues.

40|$|Judges are afforded {{considerable}} {{discretion in}} decisionmaking. Through their exercise of discretion, judges construct society’s notion {{of crime and}} justice. This study examined 61 lay judges ’ bail decision-making in the English criminal justice system. The law states that in particular cases decisions to grant bail or <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> {{should be based on}} the risk of a defendant absconding, offending, or obstructing justice while on bail. However, there is little guidance on how these judgments should be made and how they should affect decisions. It was found that judges varied (disagreed) in their risk judgments and decisions on the same set of simulated cases. The extent of judicial disagreement differed across cases, and the source of disagreement in decisions lay in the variability of judges ’ earlier risk judgments. The paper discusses how judicial disagreement may be reduced. Copyright # 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Disparity in judicial decisions has been studied in the context of how cases that vary in their ‘‘extra-legal’ ’ characteristics are treated (see, e. g., Bushway & Piehl, 2001; Thomson & Zingraff, 1981), and how different judges treat cases with identical ‘‘legal’ ’ characteristics. This paper focuses on the latter form of disparity (also called disagreement). Studies have found disagreement among judges ’ sentencing decision...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the records of 1241 men remanded in prison on {{criminal}} charges over four months yielded a high prevalence of psychiatric disorder. Of the total prison intake of 2743 men over the same period, 246 (9. 0 %) showed major symptoms of psychiatric illness and a further 237 (8. 6 %) symptoms of withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. Symptoms of neurotic disorders were underrecorded, so in terms of diagnosis 237 men (8. 7 %) {{were considered to be}} psychotic. Of these, 166 (70 %) were schizophrenic. The influence of affective psychosis was small. The risk of violence among men with schizophrenia was high. Twenty five (9 %) non-fatal personal assaults and 24 (21 %) offences of damage to property were committed by men with schizophrenia. The presence of mental illness probably influences the decision to <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> for some of these offences, but this is unlikely to explain the substantially higher prevalence of schizophrenia among men convicted of homicide (five (11 %)) and arson (six (30 %)) than would be expected in the general population of Greater London (0. 1 - 0. 4 %). The prevalence of schizophrenia among men convicted of homicide may even be an underestimate, as may the prevalence of affective psychosis and possibly of other psychiatric abnormalities, given the substantial incidence of concurrent suicide in such men...|$|E

40|$|In the Criminal Justice {{system in}} England and Wales, Magistrates’ and Crown Courts wanting {{psychiatric}} opinion on a defendant, currently {{have to pay}} for that opinion from a psychiatrist working independently. If the psychiatric advice is not forthcoming or delayed defendants can wait unnecessarily long periods on <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody,</b> failing to access mental health support and/or appropriate sentencing. This system can lead to tensions between the court and the mental health service providers. To address this, a local partnership between Mental Health services and the Criminal Justice system in the SW of England has developed a Service System Development Project. Part of this is the collection of baseline data to identify current challenges to the system from the perspectives of both the Court and Mental Health service personnel. This paper explores the latter, namely the Court’s perspective. As part of the baseline of a longitudinal survey design, questionnaires were sent to all legal advisors, lawyers, magistrates/judges and probation officers linked to courts participating in the project. Findings of the study revolved around their perceptions of the adequacy of current mental health advice provision and highlighted {{what they see as the}} strengths and limitations of the system. The paper concludes with a discussion of potential resolutions to the above tensions, exploring where these perceptions may be in conflict with those held by the mental health system and how these relate to the needs of the defendant themselves. As an audience, participants will learn of the: o	Challenges facing interprofessional working at the interface between the UK Court and mental health services. o	Potential conflict between two working cultures o	Ways in which these may be resolved. As presenters, we will learn: o	How these challenges can be compared and contrasted with the experiences of international colleagues. ...|$|E
40|$|The NSW {{imprisonment}} rate {{is about}} {{twice that of}} Victoria: this bulletin examines the influence of sentencing practice and other factors on the difference between NSW and Victoria in their imprisonment rates. The NSW imprisonment rate is about twice that of Victoria (204 per 100, 000 population vs. 104 per 100, 000 population) (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2009 a). This fact is widely believed to indicate that sentencing policy and practice in NSW is much harsher than in Victoria. A higher imprisonment rate, however, does not necessarily indicate tougher sentencing. The {{difference between the two}} states in their imprisonment rates may, for example, arise from differences in the rate of arrest for serious crime, differences in their bail laws or differences in their parole policies. Aim: To examine the influence of sentencing practice and other factors on the difference between NSW and Victoria in their imprisonment rates. Method: Descriptive analysis of national crime, court and prison data. Results: The NSW court appearance rate is 26 per cent higher than that in Victoria. The overall conviction rate in NSW is 85. 7 per cent, compared with 79. 0 per cent in Victoria. The overall percentage imprisoned is significantly higher in NSW (7. 5 %) than in Victoria (5. 4 %). The mean expected time to serve among prisoners dealt with by Victorian courts is slightly longer than the mean expected time to serve among prisoners dealt with by NSW courts. The NSW remand rate is approximately 2. 5 times the Victorian remand rate. Conclusion: The higher NSW imprisonment rate is attributable to a higher rate of court appearance, a slightly higher conviction rate, a higher likelihood of imprisonment and a higher likelihood of <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody.</b> Image: Summers / flick...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis analyses the law governing pre-trial detention in Germany {{with regard to}} potentially penal effects and their conditions. The study consists of five chapters: The first chapter serves as an introduction into the subject. It shortly summarises {{the status of the}} discussion in academia and jurisprudence, defines the term “conditional punishment” and finally outlines the structure of the thesis. The second chapter deals with the question if crediting periods of <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> as time served of the sentence (§ 51 I StGB) evokes a certain comparability or even similarity of pre-trial detention and punishment. Considering theories on the aims of punishment, it may be the crediting itself that is the reason for some penal effects. The third chapter is headed “pre-trial detention and penal effects of criminal proceedings”. It examines the effects of the suspicion, the grounds for detention and the principle of propor-tionality. In addition, the rules of the German Code of Criminal Procedure on pre-trial deten-tion are tested for non-intentional, retributive effects, such as prejudgments and the anticipa-tion of guilt, but also for preventive aspects. These first chapters require a broadening of perspective. Therefore in the fourth chapter on “pre-trial detention and human rights” the implications of human rights law are discussed: Do the right to liberty (Art. 2 II 2, 104 GG) and the presumption of innocence (Art. 20 III, 1 I, 2 I GG, Art. 6 I, II of the European Convention on Human Rights) protect remand prisoners from penal effects? The fifth and last chapter concludes that pre-trial detention may be seen as a conditional pun-ishment. In spite of its interim character, it includes penal effects like retribution, deterrence and incapacitation. Through crediting as time served which always requires a sentence (§ 51 I StGB), the penal effects are subsequently quasi-authorised. That, in fact, gives rise to the problem that the issue of crediting does not only reduce the period of deprivation of liberty, but - because of denying the normative difference criterion - also entails irreparable disad-vantages to remand prisoners...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{correctness}} of the application of provisional arrest represents the bulk of case law addressed by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which considers each case {{through the prism of}} conventional standards. In accordance with article 5 § 1 c) Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, remand shall apply to „the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fl eeing after having done so” Against this background is the issue of threat of severe punishment (article 258 § 2 p. p. c.) as an independent rationale for the provisional application of arrest. Important, therefore, is that this provision does not provide for the application of on <b>remand</b> <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> on grounds of threat of severe punishment. In both ECHR case-law and related literature, the view is accepted that threat of severe punishment may be justifi ed on the presumption that the accused will interfere with the investigation in its early stages. However, {{with the passage of time}} and the development of evidence this argument loses ground. ECHR allows use of the premise but only under certain conditions: availability of supporting evidence, the time at which it will be applied during the provisional stage, the length of detention period envisaged, whether the application of provisional arrest can be justifi ed in preparatory proceedings over time. Hence, recognition by the Supreme Court that the threat of severe punishment is a premise for the provisional application of an arrest warrant is at least questionable, especially in view of the revision of article. 258 § 2 p. p. c., and new interpretation of the provision that denies the wording expressed by the Supreme Court in its resolution of 19 January 2012. Therefore, it should be adopted that the interpretation of articles. 258 § 2 p. p. c. presented by the Supreme Court in its previously cited resolution, confl icts with the conventional standards referred to in article 5 § 1 c) of the ECHR.
