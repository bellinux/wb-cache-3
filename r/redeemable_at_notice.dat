40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact of}} decreasing MFI interest rates on household deposits and saving goals in 12 Monetary Union member countries in the years 2009 - 2015. It analyses tendencies in household deposits (overnight, with agreed maturity and <b>redeemable</b> <b>at</b> <b>notice),</b> and attempts to link them with certain household saving motives (target, retirement and precautionary). The paper identifies those deposit categories which appeared as sensitive to declining interest rates and indicates the Eurozone countries whose populations are expected to revise their savings plans. Precise implications are drawn for target saving motives of households in Austria, Cyprus and Malta. However, {{in the case of}} two other motives, the analysis does not conclude on the impact of decreasing MFI interest rates...|$|E

5000|$|A {{sensible}} {{manner of}} discounting {{interest to the}} depositors against what could be earned by employing their money in the trade of the bench soon developed; in short, selling an [...] "interest" [...] {{to them in a}} specific trade, thus overcoming the usury objection. Once again this merely developed what was an ancient method of financing long-distance transport of goods.Medieval trade fairs, such as the one in Hamburg, contributed to the growth of banking in a curious way: moneychangers issued documents <b>redeemable</b> <b>at</b> other fairs, in exchange for hard currency. These documents could be cashed at another fair in a different country or at a future fair in the same location. If <b>redeemable</b> <b>at</b> a future date, they would often be discounted by an amount comparable to a rate of interest. Eventually, these documents evolved into bills of exchange, which could be redeemed at any office of the issuing banker. These bills made it possible to transfer large sums of money without the complications of hauling large chests of gold and hiring armed guards to protect the gold from thieves.|$|R
