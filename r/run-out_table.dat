40|$|Abstract: Strip threadability is {{an ability}} to keep a strip flowing {{smoothly}} between inter-stands and <b>run-out</b> <b>tables</b> without severe longitudinal and lateral movements. The occurrence of a longitudinal movement is mainly related to looper–tension control performance, while a lateral movement is affected by steering control actions.

Non-uniform temperature distribution and cooling across the strip width are the main reasons why the strip becomes unflatten after cooling process although the strip is rolled flat at the finishing mill. A thermal, microstructural and mechanical coupling analysis model for predicting flatness change of steel strip during the <b>run-out</b> <b>table</b> cooling process was established using ABAQUS Finite Element Software.

An elasto-plasticity constitutive model of the material, in which conventional elastic and plastic strains, thermal strain, phase transformation strain and transformation induced plastic strain were taken into account, was derived and realized using the user subroutine program UMAT. The conclusion that the flatness of the steel strip will develop to edge wave defect under the functions of the different thermal and microstructural behaviors across strip width direction during the <b>run-out</b> <b>table</b> cooling procedure was acquired through the analysis results of this model.

This study includes the investigation of austenite grain growth during reheating, constitutive behaviour and static recrystallization kinetics of austenite, and austenite decomposition during simulated <b>run-out</b> <b>table</b> cooling conditions. To develop and validate the microstructure models for these phenomena, experimental studies {{have been carried out}} in the laboratory using a Gleeble 3500 thermomechanical simulator.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} study utilised a dilatometer {{to simulate the}} <b>run-out</b> <b>table</b> cooling rate and the coiling temperature to investigate {{the effect of the}} cooling rate and simulated coiling conditions on the age hardening response of a niobium microalloyed Ultra-thin Cast Strip (UCS®) steel, produced by the CASTRIP® Process. Three cooling rates of 1, 5 and 40 °C/s, covering very slow (1 °C/s) to typical <b>run-out</b> <b>table</b> cooling rates (40 °C/s), down to two coiling temperatures of 500 and 675 °C were used. Dilatation curves were used to determine the temperature range over which the ¿-¿ phase transformations occurred and the final microstructures were characterized using an optical microscope equipped with an image analysis software. The subsequent age hardening response, which previous studies have shown, results from the retention of Nb in solid solution, was assessed by the hardness changes after a post heat treatment at 700 °C for 60 s. A range of age hardening responses were obtained, depending on cooling rates and cooling stop (coiling) temperatures, which indicate a different degree of Nb retention. At the same cooling rate, the lower coiling temperature of 500 °C resulted in higher Nb retention compared to the higher coiling temperature of 675 °C. As the coiling temperature of 675 °C was within the austenite to ferrite transformation range, the simulated slow cooling of the coil impacted the precipitation behaviour of Nb rendering the interpretation more complex and this will be discussed in this paper. For the 500 °C simulated coiling temperature, the higher cooling rate resulted in a higher age hardening increment thus more Nb retention...|$|E

40|$|In the {{production}} of steel strip, the temperature distribution and cooling rates along the mill <b>run-out</b> <b>table</b> {{have a significant effect}} on the steel microstructure and hence on final material properties, e. g., yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility. Noncontacting optical temperature sensors are typically used to implement feedback control of cooling, but water spray and surface emissivity irregularities can adversely affect these sensors. Ideally, the control of cooling path should account for the progress of dynamic transformation at required points rather than the strip temperature alone. There are several reports describing the use of magnetic sensors to monitor transformation. These sensors exploit the change in the electromagnetic properties as the steel progresses through transformation, for example the austenitic phase is paramagnetic and the ferritic phase is ferromagnetic below the Curie point. Previous work has concentrated on the operation and design of individual transformation sensors. This paper now describes the use of an array of electromagnetic sensors to image the progression of transformation along a sample steel block on a pilot scale industrial mill.

40|$|Constitutive {{behavior}} {{models for}} steels are typically semi-empirical, however recently neural network {{is also being}} used. Existing neural network models are highly complex with a large network structure i. e. the number of neurons and layers. Furthermore, the network structure is different for different grades of steel. In the present study a simple neural network structure, 3 : 4 : 1, is developed which models flow behavior better than other models available in literature. Using this neural network structure constitutive behavior of 8 steels: 4 carbon steels, V and V-Ti microalloyed steels, an austenitic stainless steel and a high speed steel could be modeled with reasonable accuracy. The stress-strain behavior for the vanadium microalloyed steel was obtained from hot compression tests carried out at 850 - 1150 ï°C and 0. 1 - 60 s- 1. It is found that a better estimate of the constants in the semi-empirical model developed for this steel could be obtained by simultaneous nonlinear regression. A model that can predict the effect of chemical composition on the constitutive behavior would be industrially useful for e. g., in optimizing rolling schedules for new grades of steel. In the present study, a neural network model, 5 : 6 : 1, is developed which predicts the flow behavior {{for a range of}} carbon steels. It is found that the effect of manganese is best accounted for by taking Ceq=C+Mn/ 6 as one of the inputs of the network. Predictions from this model show that the effect of carbon on flow stress is nonlinear. The hot strip mill at Jindal Vijaynagar Steel Ltd., Toranagallu, Karnataka, India, was simulated for calculating the rolling loads, finish rolling temperature (FRT) and microstructure evolution. DEFORM- 2 d a commercial finite element package was used to simulate deformation and heat transfer in the rolling mill. The simulation was carried out for 18 strips of 2 - 4 mm thickness with compositions in the range and 0. 025 - 0. 139 %C. The rolling loads and FRT could be calculated within ï± 15 % and ï± 15 ï°C respectively. Analysis based on the variation in the roll diameter, roll gap and the effect of roll flattening and temperature of the roll showed that an error of ï± 6 % is inherent in the prediction of loads. Simulation results indicated that strain induced transformation to ferrite occurred in the finishing mill.

40|$|Thinly {{cold-rolled}} steel sheet, following hot-rolling, sporadically present a defect known in industry as ridge-buckle. The defect is only {{detected in the}} last stage of production of thin rolled strips, {{after they have been}} hot rolled, cold rolled, annealed and tempered. Ridge-buckle consists of sinusoidal waveforms located in one or two bands near the central region of the strip width and in most cases, affecting the full length of the strip. Coils with such a defect have to be discarded or degraded. The aim of this manuscript is to present our contribution towards an elucidation of the origins of ridge-buckle defect by experimental and theoretical approaches combined with analysis of plant data. We explored two of the main factors that in the past, has been regarded as possible origins of ridge-buckle defect: a) the occurrence of microstructural variations along the width of the hot rolled strip, which could lead to different extents of deformation during cold rolling and subsequent operations; and b) the presence of a protuberance (also called ridge) on the hot rolled strip, which will directly affect the shape of the cold rolled strip. The possibility that variations in grain size or crystallographic texture along the width of the strip could contribute to the formation of ridge-buckle defect was explored by studying samples extracted from strips hot-rolled in the industrial process. We determined experimentally and compared quantitatively, the ferrite grain sizes and the crystallographic orientations of grains along the width of the strip. In the strips studied, no evidence was found of any statistically significant variations in these two microstructural variables. Empirical models of recrystallization were used in an attempt {{to gain a better understanding}} of the quantitative impact of minor temperature variations (of the order experienced in practice) on the strip strength and hence, its mechanical behaviour within the rolling process. This exploratory exercise confirmed that the strip strength during hot rolling varies very little as a result of relatively small variations in temperature along the width of the strip. Furthermore, the ferrite grain size developed following hot-rolling and cooling on the <b>run-out</b> <b>table,</b> also varies very little due to the temperature variations measured. Therefore, the strength of the hot rolled strip along its width is not affected to the extent that can have a significant influence on the deformation in the subsequent rolling processes. These calculations led us to conclude that ridge in the hot rolled strip is not related to uneven deformation during rolling due to strength variations and hence, ridge buckle defect cannot be attributed to strength differences along the width of the hot-rolled strip. In industrial practice, the occurrence of ridge-buckle in subsequent cold rolling operations has been linked to the presence of ridges in the hot rolled strip. Moreover, a modelling study conducted in parallel with this investigation confirmed this link. Having established that variations in microstructure, texture or strength along the hot-rolled strip width are unlikely causes of the occurrence of ridgebuckle defect we attempted to link ridge occurrence in hot rolled strips and to uneven roll-wear in the finishing mill. By collecting data of 40 consecutive schedules, we were able to determine that ridge formation in hot rolled strips is a common occurrence. Moreover, uneven roll-wear was frequently observed, at least in the period and in the schedules over which our data were collected. A significant finding was the establishment of a strong link between ridge occurrence on the hotrolled strips and uneven roll wear occurring close to the centre of the work-rolls in the finishing-mill. The evidence of uneven wear on the work-rolls in the hot strip mill led our study to an assessment of the possible causes of uneven roll-wear. A thorough review of the available literature in conjunction with the evidence we found of excessive ridge formation in steels containing silicon, led to the hypothesis that the integrity of the tertiary strip scale in the roll bite could be a major contributing factor to uneven roll-wear. We developed a method to study in-situ the formation of oxides on the hot steel substrate, by adapting a High Temperature Microscope with means to introduce air instantaneously onto the surface of the sample. This technique enabled us to study oxidation of the steel surface under conditions closely simulating the oxygen potential pertaining to the rolling temperatures in industrial finishing rolling practice (excluding the complicating effects of water cooling). The in-situ experimentation was complemented with a thorough characterisation of the oxides remaining on the samples after cooling by using relevant metallographic techniques. The experiments were conducted on two types of steel, low carbon steel and silicon containing steel. The results show distinctive differences in the oxidation behaviour of the two types of steel. The low carbon steel form a typical three-layered structure of iron oxides although with very little (almost undetectable) hematite formation. On the other hand, the silicon steels, which apart from silicon also contain aluminium and manganese in small amounts, formed a thick interface layer of complex oxides and intermetallics between the substrate and a layer of magnetite followed by a hematite layer at the gas/oxide interface. It was evident that in silicon steels, the formation of the interface layer interfered with the diffusion of iron species as the final oxide layer was significantly thinner than the oxide layer that formed on low-carbon steel. Another significant finding in the case of low carbon steel was the tendency of the oxide to detach or “spall” from the surface during oxide growth. We were able to observe the detachment of the oxide in-situ with precise account of the time and temperature of occurrence. The relevance of this finding is that if sufficient time elapsed between spallation of the scale and the strip entering the roll-bite, brittle scale would form (due to isolation of the oxide layer from the iron source). The scale then will fracture under the loads applied in the roll-bite, affecting the heat transfer to the rolls and hence, its thermal fatigue resistance. Furthermore, we were able to observe and determine the time to nucleation of new oxides that form on top of already existing oxides on low carbon steel substrate. The time required to nucleate the new oxide is related to the austenite grain size of the steel substrate. Further studies are proposed to elucidate the exact nature of this interesting sequence of events. Finally, early oxidation events were linked to uneven roll-wear due to fracture of the scale in the roll-bite, an increase in the heat transfer rate to the work-roll surface and friction in the roll-bite. An assessment of the possible causes that may affect the integrity of the tertiary scale led us to conclude that whenever uneven changes occur in the cooling patterns of the strip or roll, in descaling efficiency or in the lubrication systems, uneven roll-wear could result. Although a definitive solution to the 40 -year old problem of ridge-buckle defect is still to be found, we have made advances in narrowing the possible origins of the defect to specific causes or events. Ridge-buckle is originated mainly by the presence of ridge in the hot-rolled strip; in turn, ridge occurrence is related to uneven wear of the work-rolls in the finishing-mill. Uneven wear is most likely caused by failure of the tertiary scale, due most probably to uneven cooling and/or lubrication patterns during the hot rolling process. In addition to these findings, a novel method of studying scale formation during the early stages of the interaction between oxygen and the steel substrate was developed...|$|E
