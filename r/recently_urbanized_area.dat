40|$|Scotts Valley polygonum Polygonum hickmanii (Polygonaceae) is {{a narrow}} endemic plant {{restricted}} to a specialized microhabitat (exposed bedrock in California prairie) in Santa Cruz County, California. The species was named in 1995 and subsequently listed as endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act and California Endangered Species Act in 2003 and 2005, respectively. Two occurrences exist on three properties in a <b>recently</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> {{at the northern}} edge of the city of Scotts Valley, with a geographic range of 0. 03 km 2. As of 2012 the species has declined to 128 plants on 61 m 2, having decreased from 604 plants in 2003, 1, 612 plants in 1998 and 2, 388 plants in 1997. In 2013 the primary threats to P. hickmanii are habitat alteration due to adjacent land uses and developments, and invasive plant species and accumulation of thatch. Cessation of grazing and fire suppression have likely contributed to the increasing presence of invasive plant species and accumulation of thatch. Intensive and adaptive management with monitoring will be necessary for P. hickmanii to survive. Unless management is implemented as a matter of urgency, the species will likely disappear within just a few years...|$|E
40|$|Chorizanthe robusta var. hartwegii (Scotts Valley spineflower, Polygonaceae) is {{a narrow}} endemic plant {{restricted}} to a specialized microhabitat (exposed bedrock in California prairie) in Santa Cruz County, California. This taxon and the nominate variety were listed as endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act in 1994. Three occurrences of C. robusta hartwegii exist on four properties in a <b>recently</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>area</b> {{at the northern}} edge of the city of Scotts Valley. Ten of 80 known colonies are now likely extirpated. In 2014 the primary threats are habitat alteration due to adjacent land uses and developments, and invasive plant species (non-natives) and accumulation of thatch. Using international standards, C. robusta hartwegii is critically endangered: area of occupancy, 0. 39 ha; extent of occurrence, 1. 3 km 2; landscape, severely fragmented; and quality of the habitat, continuing to decline. With these attributes, C. robusta hartwegii faces an extremely high risk of extinction. As a matter of urgency, we recommend reducing and controlling invasive plant species and thatch using a combination of methods: mowing with biomass removal, cutting by hand tools with biomass removal, pulling by hand with biomass removal, controlled grazing, prescribed mini-burns (testing 1 m 2), and spot-treating invasive grasses with a grass-specific herbicide...|$|E

40|$|Gated communities, {{which are}} walled and gated {{residential}} neighborhoods, represent {{a form of}} urbanism where public spaces are privatized. In the U. S., they represent {{a substantial part of}} the new housing market, especially in the <b>recently</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas.</b> They have thus become a symbol of metropolitan fragmentation. This paper focuses on how local governments consider them as a valuable source of revenue because suburbanization costs are paid by the private developers and the final homebuyer, and how this form of public – private partnership in the provision of urban infrastructure ultimately increases local segregation. An empirical study in the Los Angeles region aims to evaluate this impact on socio-economic and ethnic patterns using factorial analysis (dissimilarity indices). As a result, the sprawl of gated communities increase segregation. Very significant socio-economic dissimilarities are found {{to be associated with the}} enclosure, thus defining very homogeneous territories, especially on income and age criteria. But gated communities are located in ethnic buffer zones and stress an exclusion that is structured at a municipal scale. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|Walled and gated {{residential}} neighborhoods {{have become}} a common feature within US metropolitan areas. As a standardized form of urban product, these neighborhoods represent a form of urbanism where public spaces are being privatized. In the most <b>recently</b> <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> they represent an increasing {{part of the new}} homes market and they have thus become a symbol of contemporary metropolitan fragmentation and social segregation. They not only enclose space but they also actively select residents through restrictive covenants as well as through life style marketing and price. Because they are managed as private corporations, there is perhaps an injevitable tendency to seek political and fiscal independence through a process of municipal incorporation. This has led to a project of partition - strengthened by and strengthening existing partitioning movements - and to the prospect of increased social segregation. The study reported in this chapter discusses the consequences of fading boundaries between public and private management when a gated community engages in municipal incorporation. The sprawl of gated communities is not to be understood as secession from public authority, but as a public-private partnership. It is a local game where the gated community provides benefits to the public authority, in return for which, the Property Owners Association is granted autonomous local governance. The spillover effects of this method of ordering new urban space is to increase segregation. This is particularly so when gated communities are incorporated since the municipal institution is instrumental in securing public funds and property for the privilege of a gated enclave...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The World is {{undergoing}} rapid urbanization, with 70 % of the World population expected {{to live in}} urban areas by 2050. Nevertheless, nationally representative analysis of the health differences in the leading causes of avoidable mortality disaggregated by urbanization level is lacking. We undertake a study of temporal trends in mortality rates for deaths considered avoidable by the Concerted Action of the European Community on Avoidable Mortality for four different levels of urbanization in Taiwan between 1971 and 2008. We find that for virtually all causes of death, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) were lower in more urbanized than less <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas,</b> either throughout the study period, or {{by the end of}} the period despite higher rates in <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> initially. Only breast cancer had consistently higher AMSRs in more <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> throughout the 38 -year period. Further, only breast cancer, lung cancer, and ischemic heart disease witnessed an increase in ASMRs in one or more urbanization categories. More <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas</b> in Taiwan appear to enjoy better indicators of health outcomes in terms of mortality rates than less <b>urbanized</b> <b>areas.</b> Access to and the availability of rich healthcare resources in urban areas may have contributed to this positive result...|$|R
