50|$|In July 2005, safety {{officials}} temporarily restricted Field <b>Mill's</b> <b>capacity</b> to 5,000 when {{fire safety}} certificates {{could not be}} located. The ground's capacity was again reduced in May 2007, from 9,368 to 4,684, when Nottinghamshire County Council, who enforced the reduction, cited a poor standard of stewarding {{and a lack of}} a pro-active approach to safety. In July 2007 the capacity was raised to 6,553 following an inspection from safety officials, but was reduced back to 4,684 in September after visiting Chesterfield supporters were given too many tickets by mistake. Field <b>Mill's</b> <b>capacity</b> was then increased to 5,457, and in January 2008 further increased to 7,300 for the FA Cup tie against Middlesbrough after a problem with the turnstiles and other issues were resolved.|$|R

40|$|Because {{enforcement}} of forestry law has become extremely difficult in Indonesia, {{a ban on}} export of logs has been suggested {{as a means of}} controlling over-harvest and illegal logging. A model of a log export ban can help us visualize its effects on the forestry sector. The model consists of simplified overviews of the wood processing sector, demand - price feedback loops, forest standing stock and log availability, log harvest capacity, and log exports. It examines important feedbacks that must be understood if the potential costs and benefits of a log export ban are to be properly considered. Although some scenarios can help reduce log harvests to sustainable levels, others encourage expansion of small domestic <b>milling</b> <b>capacity</b> leading to increased log harvests. Excess domestic <b>milling</b> <b>capacity</b> added during a log export ban may continue to operate even after a log export ban is lifted. For a log export ban to be an effective tool in combating over-harvest and illegal harvest, limits must also be placed on possible increases in domestic <b>milling</b> and logging <b>capacity...</b>|$|R
