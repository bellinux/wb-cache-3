40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{development}} of a device for skin cancer tissue detection, this report is about {{the development}} of a new calibration procedure for measuring complex permittivity with an open-ended coaxial probe. The developed method is based on comparing the measured reflection coefficient to an array of reference coefficients for different complex permittivities. The implementation consists of the following parts: - Correct Vector Network Analyser setup and readout from 0. 5 to 20 GHz; - Simulations to generate the reference data for <b>relative</b> <b>real</b> <b>permittivities</b> from 1 to 41 and relative imaginary permittivities from 0 to 15; - Calibration using a 3 -term error model; - The permittivity lookup algorithm, which matches a given load reflection coefficient ΓL to the corresponding complex permittivity. The program works well but the quality of the results depends on the accuracy of the 3 -D EM simulation model which generates the lookup table data. This is visible in the relative errors that are decreasing with higher frequencies. The set of materials under test consisted of three liquids: butanol, methanol and propanol, and two skin depicting phantoms: with 30 % and 50 % oil. The estimation errors of the liquid permittivities are often below 1, but have peaks up to 5 at lower frequencies. The skin depicting phantom with 30 % oil turned out to have a non-uniform structure and gave the most variation in permittivity results. The permittivity results could be improved to be smoother by implementing better interpolation methods for complex numbers. The execution time of the program has been found to be 1058 ms, which is deemed fast enough for the targeted application, but could still be improved by making a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

This method {{can be used for}} preparing self-cleaning superhydrophobic coatings on large areas for different kinds of substrates. The synergistic effect of the micro/nanobinary scale roughness was produced by a multilayer RTV SR/TiO 2 composite.

40|$|The coarse {{and loose}} nature of unbound {{granular}} road materials presents {{a number of}} challenges for conventional permittivity characterisation approaches. An alternative that appears better suited to these materials involves measuring the phase-shift at discrete frequencies through a sample of known thickness. To validate this approach against more established methods, a comparison is required on materials {{that can be easily}} measured using either method. To this end phase-shift measurements were undertaken on a range of solid dielectric slabs including various types of stone, plastic and an artificial material. Permittivity predictions from this method were then compared to results from a one-port coaxial cell. As an additional comparison, and to better understand the results, the phase-shift test setup was also modelled using GPRMax software. To improve the predictions, reverberations within the test apparatus were minimized by isolating the direct wave using time-domain Blackman windowing. However, the narrow window necessary for this particular test setup also degraded the ability to detect frequency-dependent permittivity changes. Overall the phase-shift approach produced <b>real</b> <b>relative</b> <b>permittivity</b> predictions similar to that from the one-port coaxial cell.

40|$|Recent {{metamaterial}} (MM) research faces {{several problems}} when using metal-based plasmonic components as {{building blocks for}} MMs. The use of conventional metals for MMs is limited by several factors: metals such as gold and silver have high losses in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) ranges and very large negative <b>real</b> <b>permittivity</b> values, and in addition, their optical properties cannot be tuned. These issues that put severe constraints on the device applications of MMs could be overcome if semiconductors are used as plasmonic materials instead of metals. Heavily doped, wide bandgap oxide semiconductors could exhibit both a small negative <b>real</b> <b>permittivity</b> and relatively small losses in the NIR. Heavily doped oxides of zinc and indium were already reported to be good, low loss alternatives to metals in the NIR range.
