25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed <b>on</b> the top <b>sieve.</b> Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample <b>residues</b> <b>on</b> the <b>sieves</b> have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet sieving it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|R

The response variable was weight percentage of product <b>residue</b> <b>on</b> 32 -micrometer <b>sieve</b> (or fineness), while the input parameters were revolution percent, falofon percentage, and the elevator amperage (amps), which exhibits elevator charge to the separator. The process data collected from a local plant, Cimenta Cement Factory, in 2004, were used in model construction and testing. First, ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model was constructed. A feed forward network type with one input layer including 3 input parameters, two hidden layer, and one output layer including <b>residue</b> percentage <b>on</b> 32 micrometer <b>sieve</b> as an output parameter was constructed. After testing the model, it was detected that the model. s ability to predict the <b>residue</b> <b>on</b> 32 -micrometer <b>sieve</b> (fineness) was successful (Correlation coefficient is 0. 92). By detailed analysis of values of parameters of ANN model. s contour plots, Mamdani type fuzzy rule set in the fuzzy model on MatLAB was created. There were three parameters and three levels, {{and then there were}} third power of three (27) rules. In this study, we constructed mix of Z type, S type and gaussian type membership functions of the input parameters and response. By help of fuzzy toolbox of MatLAB, the <b>residue</b> percentage <b>on</b> 32 -micrometer <b>sieve</b> (fineness) was predicted. Finally, It was found that the model had a correlation coefficient of 0. 76. The utility of the ANN and fuzzy models created in this study was in the potential ability of the process engineers to control processing parameters to accomplish the desired cement fineness levels. In {{the second part of the}} study, a quantitative procedure for monitoring and evaluating cement milling process performance was described. Some control charts such as CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) and EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) charts were used to monitor the cement fineness by using historical data. As a result, it is found that CUSUM and EWMA control charts can be easily used in the cement milling process monitoring in order to detect small shifts in 32 -micrometer fineness, percentage by weight, in shorter sampling time interval...|$|R

The disadvantages of existing technological lines for the preparation of mineral feed additives are high specific energy consumption, low economic efficiency and inadequate conditions for environmental safety insuring. That is why energy-efficient production method for the feed additive based on zeolite and a technological line for its realization was developed at the Department of Technology of bread, pastry, pasta and grain processing industries in VSUET. Application of refrigeration unit operating in heat pump mode allows preparation of heat transfer agents with a maximum utilization of secondary heat sources. After drying the spent drying agent is fed to the preheating methioninate copper suspension through the regenerative heat exchange, then to the dehumidification into the evaporator of refrigeration unit and then it is returned to {{the first section of}} the two-part condenser in closed-loop mode. Feed fat is heated to 55 [...] . 60 ° C, by "hot water", heating of which takes place in the second section of the 11 th condenser to the temperature of 70 [...] . 75 ° C and is fed into the jacket of fat melting device. Then it is returned to the second capacitor section to form a recirculation loop. We developed a feed additive with the following particle size distribution: a large fraction of 2. 8 %, the average fraction of 95. 2 %, the fine fraction of 2. 0 %, the <b>residue</b> <b>on</b> the <b>sieve</b> with a mesh № 1, 2 of 2, 0 %, with a moisture content of 6. 2 %, the angle of repose of 42 deg., dispersibility of 6. 9 %, a bulk density of 385 kg / m 3. The proposed method for the production of the feed additive based on zeolite ensures environmental safety of production due to closed recirculation circuits on material and energy flows, helps to reduce energy and resource consumption for the production of the feed additive, to obtain high quality product with high uniformity and low moisture content...|$|R
