The village is located on both the banks of Wadi al-Lajjun, with Jenin and the entire valley visible from it. It is bordered by Tall al-Mutsallem to the northeast, and by Tall al-Asmar to the northwest. Lajjun, which was linked by secondary roads to the Jenin-Haifa road, and the <b>road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> southwest {{to the town of}} Umm al-Fahm, laid close to the junctions of the two highways.

5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian army {{proceeded}} to sack and burn Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities {{that had not}} submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens. Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single <b>road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> through it and built a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring {{the passage of the}} Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|Within Antananarivo, the {{territory}} of the Andriamboninolona, designated generations before by King Andrianjaka, included the neighborhood of Ambatomasina (east of Andohalo) and extended from Ambohitantely eastward to Ambatolampy and north to the principal <b>road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to Ambavahadimasina. The neighborhoods reserved in Antananarivo for the Andriandranando, also decreed by Andrianjaka, laid to the northeast of Andohalo and extended from Ambavahadimasina in the west to Ambohimanoro in the east, and from the road to Ambavahadimasina northward to Ambatonandriankoto. King Andriamasinavalona decreed that within the capital city, the Zanaralambo would live in the area delimited by Ambohitsoa to the southwest, Ambodivoanonoka to the east, and Andohalokely in the north. Outside the capital, each group had its designated villages. The Andriamboninolona lived in Ambohitromby, Fieferana, Ambohipiainana and Ambohitriniandriana. The Andriandranando lived in Soamanandrarina, Betsizaraina, Ambohibe, Ihadiambola and Akadindramamy. Finally, the Zanaralambo inhabited Lazaina, Ambatofotsy and Masindray.|$|E

25|$|The Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great {{passed through}} Gordium in 333 BC and severed the Gordian Knot {{in the temple}} of Sabazios ("Zeus").

With Gordium sited on the Persian Royal <b>Road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> {{through the heart of}} Anatolia, the prophecy had some geographical plausibility. With Alexander, Phrygia became part of the wider Hellenistic world. Upon Alexander's death in 323, the Battle of Ipsus took place in 301 BC.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of Höfen lay a paved main <b>road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> through the Monschau Forest, at whose eastern edge it forked.

It then intersected a main east-west road at Bullingen. This was the road network the Germans needed to meet their objectives. If the Germans penetrated Höfen, the U.S. soldiers would have to withdraw several miles to the next defensible position.|$|E
50|$|In early May 1864, the Confederate {{government}} granted Johnston's {{request for}} reinforcements to his camps around Dalton, Georgia. As the brigade of Brig. Gen.

This land was located at the intersection of several <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to Baltimore and points to the north in Pennsylvania. It is believed that Reister decided to purchase this land while traveling along the road on his way to Annapolis. He probably noticed its strategic location and decided to open an inn and tavern for travelers moving along the road.|$|R

25|$|He {{did so in}} a field next to the old <b>road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to Pitești. Maluțan {{then told}} his four {{passengers}} {{that he could do}} nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to Târgoviște. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November, Saint-Cyr's host {{stumbled}} into Vidreres which {{was near the}} coast <b>road</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to Malgrat de Mar, Mataró, and Barcelona. That evening the Imperial soldiers saw the campfires of Lazán {{to the north and}} other enemy campfires to the south. But Saint-Cyr knew of a secret path from a Perpignan smuggler; the route connected the coast road with the inland road. Several search parties that were sent out to find the path during the 14th failed to locate it, so Saint-Cyr personally set out with a small escort to find it. In this he was successful, though the group was nearly captured by guerillas and had to fight its way clear. On the 15th the entire Franco-Italian army snaked through the hills, bypassing the small fortress of Hostalric and reaching the inland road at Sant Celoni. At the latter place the Imperial troops scattered a force of miquelets under Milans. Though his men were tired, Saint-Cyr hustled his soldiers along the highway until they reached the dangerous Trentapassos defile which was found to be unoccupied. That evening the Franco-Italians could see a line of campfires ahead of them, indicating the presence of the Spanish army.|$|E

Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant porters, they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers.|$|E
50|$|David Johnston did {{not have}} to hike Coldwater Ridge to get to his {{observation}} post (the ridge depicted in the movie for his outpost), and the movie also erroneously omitted {{the fact that he had}} a truck and camper up there. The way up Coldwater Ridge at the time was a series of switchback logging <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to a small clearing, at which his truck and camper were located. Incidentally, the propane tank and remnants of his camper were found three miles away from where his observation site was located, in 1993.|$|R

Gordon Locke scored three touchdowns {{in the first half}} for Iowa. Heavy rain soaked Iowa Field and turned the dirt <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> into Iowa City to mud. Hundreds of cars stalled on the road to Cedar Rapids and thousands of Hawkeye fans were stranded that night.|$|R

And rather than attempting to maneuver on several of the <b>roads</b> <b>that</b> <b>led</b> to Hampton's rear, Sheridan's command expended their efforts on costly frontal assaults.|$|R
