50|$|Solid {{aluminum}} conductors {{were originally}} {{made in the}} 1960s from a utility grade aluminum alloy that had undesirable properties for a building wire, and were used with wiring devices intended for copper conductors. These practices were found to cause defective connections and potential fire hazards. In the early-1970s new aluminum wire made from one of several special alloys was introduced, and all devices — breakers, switches, <b>receptacles,</b> splice <b>connectors,</b> wire nuts, etc. — were specially designed for the purpose. These newer aluminum wires and special designs address problems with junctions between dissimilar metals, oxidation on metal surfaces and mechanical effects that occur as different metals expand at different rates with increases in temperature.|$|R

40|$|Optical links for the {{transmission}} of analog signals have continued to expand thanks to its simplicity, low loss, large bandwidth, low cost, and immunity to electromagnetic interference from external RF sources. However, {{due to the lack}} of economic analog transceiver which has the highest operation frequency between 3 to 10 GHz in current market, the applications within this band need to use the 10 GHz transceiver product, which inevitably complicates the system design and increases the associated cost. In this thesis, a cost effective 6 GHz 20 Km reach optical analog transceiver is proposed, designed, and experimentally demonstrated. Theoretical analysis and design of the system is performed through the power budget analysis, bandwidth budget analysis, noise analysis, linearity analysis, and economic consideration. Several criteria for choosing components are proposed accordingly. An OptiSystem RoF application simulation is conducted to verify the analysis results. After choosing components and fabricating the circuit, we perform DC and AC test for both transmitter and receiver, link S parameter measurement, SFDR measurement by two tone test, and 20 Km fiber transmission UWB OFDM single channel test and multi-channel test, the result demonstrates that the proposed transceiver has more than 6 GHz 3 -dB gain bandwidth with - 10 dB link gain and very good match at its input and output impedances, 31 dB link noise figure, - 9 dBm output P 1 dB, 10 dBm OIP 3 and 102 dB SFDR, and it’s an ideal option for OFDM UWB RoF systems. In RoF system, a post amplifier is almost following the optical receiver. It boosts the output RF signal power to facilitate the further use of the signal. A proposed 6 GHz 30 dB gain 1 Watt power amplifier is also designed, fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated within this thesis. Finally, the further search for better components to improve the transceiver performance, the size optimization of the transceiver, and the design of an adaptor for LC <b>receptacle</b> and LC <b>connector</b> are proposed as future research topics. ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the depressurization, {{the pilots}} {{did not receive}} {{supplemental}} oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask hose connector {{was found in the}} wreckage disconnected from its valve <b>receptacle</b> (the other <b>connector</b> was not recovered), damage to the recovered <b>connector</b> and both <b>receptacles</b> was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' oxygen masks.A possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates {{the rate at which the}} accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a seal failure, the cabin could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about [...] may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached [...] (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks; of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression, or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.|$|R
