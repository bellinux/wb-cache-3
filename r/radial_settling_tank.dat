Modeling of flow in these tanks is difficult, {{therefore it is}} necessary to find right tool to perform as precise work as possible. In this article flow velocity measurement in two different secondary settling tanks in Slovakia is presented. Rectangular settling tank in Dolný Kubín and <b>radial</b> <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> with horizontal flow in Nižná nad Oravou were chosen for this purpose. Data gained from these measurement events will be used for building a model and followed by simulation.

40|$|Density {{currents}} {{exist in}} most secondary sedimentation basins and cause the usual hydrodynamic flow patterns in these basins to deviate substantially from ideal condition flow patterns. In real tanks, the diurnal variations of inflow, temperature and concentration of suspended solids result in unsteady density currents. In this dissertation, the internal flow regimes {{associated with the}} density currents due to diurnal heat loading in radial sedimentation tanks are investigated. This study is restricted to currents due to an inflow which is denser than the ambient fluid in the tank. Experimental studies are made of the flow under different conditions of geometry, momentum and buoyancy. Velocity measurements of 90 tests at different flow regimes were determined. Temperatures at {{a large number of}} points at several sections along the tank radius were measured for a total of 66 tests. In addition, flow visualization dye tests were carried out. During the experiments, the phenomena progressed through a sequence of density flow regimes: (1) The denser radial wall jet; (2) The splash at the weir; (3) The travelling radial internal hydraulic jump; (4) The submerged internal hydraulic jump; (5) The splash at the gate; (6) Stratification. The temperature and photographic data are analyzed to determine the characteristic depths, velocities and temperatures of the radial denser wall jet and the sequent depths and surge velocities of the moving radial internal hydraulic jump. The velocity experiments showed a three layer velocity distribution. The occurrence of the shallow surface layer with positive horizontal velocity, and the increased bottom and recirculation velocities are distinguishing features of the present velocity measurements compared to those of neutral density flows. A numerical model was formulated to predict the flow characteristics associated with the radial denser wall jet. The jet depth, velocity and temperature were determined from the jet submodel while the sequent depth, surge velocity and the longitudinal position of the internal hydraulic jump were predicted by the moving internal hydraulic jump submodel. The model was verified by comparison with experimental data from the present study. The mathematical model is in fair agreement with the experimental data.

The energy used here is for pumping the raw water from the sump to the primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> The disinfectant tank, sand filter and carbon filter account for the least energy consumption.

40|$|One of the {{important}} environmental problems in human settlements is the contamination of water bodies and terrain by pollutants arriving with sewage. The main reasons for this are the physical deterioration of treatment facilities and insufficient funding. Thus, it becomes impossible to maintain wastewater treatment facilities in operative condition and provide treatment of discharged wastewater to the standard quality. Therefore the task of intensifying the operation of facilities and plants for the water settling as well as reducing the areas occupied by this water acquires the particular importance. The present work deals {{with the construction of}} a new vertical <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> with spiral-wound nozzle. The design of this <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> has a patent. Compared to a conventional vertical <b>settling</b> <b>tank,</b> in the proposed <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> with spiral-wound nozzle there are more favorable hydrodynamic conditions. At the same settling time these conditions allow improving of the lightening effect by increased staying of treated water in the spiral-wound nozzle. The application of this vertical <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in the water and sewage treatment helps to reduce the facilities volume and improve the cleaning effect. Based on the theory of suspended particles sedimentation for this <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> a mathematical model and calculation method were developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of resuspension {{has been considered}} to be an important factor in the imperfect behavior of sedimentation basins receiving suspensions containing flocculent solids. Resuspension is the entrainment into the flow of particles that have once settled {{to the floor of the}} basin. This investigation has been undertaken to study the resuspension phenomenon and to find ways in which its harmful effects can be reduced. Resuspension has been found extremely difficult to isolate and define scientifically because many other factors produce the same overall effect upon the <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Furthermore it is practically necessary to identify individual particles in order to know whether a particular one found in suspension in the downstream portion of a <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> had earlier been settled out and resting on the floor. Laboratory studies on <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> behavior were conducted on a glass-walled "scour flume" 1. 27 ft wide by 14 ft long with depth adjustable from 0. 5 to 2. 0 ft (see Fig. 1. 1). In order to simulate certain aspects of the behavior of full-scale <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> the laboratory flume was fitted with moving flight scrapers similar to those installed in primary sewage <b>settling</b> <b>tanks.</b> For some of the later tests the flume was fitted with 14 probes that made it possible to sample the tank contents at practically any point of five cross sections along the length of the flume. Most of the studies on the laboratory flume utilized a discrete suspension of gilsonite s. g. 1. 04) particles or a flocculent suspension of ferric chloride and bentonite clay particles. Tests for critical velocity required for entrainment of particles from a smooth bed showed that fine light particles are more easily lifted from the bed than was previously supposed. With scrapers moving upstream, the critical velocity for two sizes of gilsonite tested was found to vary between 10. 5 and 14. 5 times the particle settling velocity. Field and laboratory studies on one scheme proposed to improve the performance of <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> - a series of transverse sloping baffles installed throughout the main body of a rectangular <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> - both indicate that baffling a tank is not the answer. Tests on full-scale <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> of a sewage treatment plant showed that conventional measures of <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> performance are meaningless when the suspension entering the tank is flocculent (as is sewage). Newer measures of performance are proposed, which show promise in evaluating the behavior of <b>settling</b> <b>tanks</b> receiving flocculent suspensions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Design {{of primary}} <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> has {{historically}} been done more empirically than rationally. The main {{reason for this is}} a lack of understanding of what pollutants primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> are capable of removing. Inlets should be designed to dissipate the kinetic energy or velocity head of the mixed liquor. They should be able to distribute the flow equally in vertical and horizontal directions. Inlets should also be designed to prevent short-circuiting. Flow in primary <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> is simulated by means of computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The fluid is assumed incompressible and non-buoyant. Two-dimensional simulation for one-phase flow has been done. The RNG turbulent model was solved with the Navier-Stockes equations. The flow pattern properties in the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> include the velocity profiles, the flow separation area and kinetic energy. In this study, the effect of inlet configurations on these characteristics is considered. Due to this object, rectangular, slope and curved shape of inlet slot are suggested...|$|R

30|$|Activated sludge {{system for}} {{biological}} wastewater treatment consists essentially of an activated sludge reactor and a <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Reports on {{the analysis of}} the performance of the activated sludge plants based on reactor- settler interaction are rather scarce. Sherrard and Kincannon (1974) proposed a correlation among the mean solid retention time, sludge recycle ratio and sludge concentration factor in secondary <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> Riddell et al. (1983) combined the functions of the reactor and the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in order to choose permissible flow rate of an activated sludge plant. Sheintuch (1987) introduced the concept of system response for analyzing the interactions of the functions of the reactor and <b>settling</b> <b>tank.</b> But it was Cho et al. (1996) who described the reactor-settling tank interaction in very comprehensive way. They used the sludge recycle ratio and sludge waste ratio as the operating parameters and obtained the responses of the output variables such as biomass concentration in aerator, dissolved pollutant and solid concentration in the effluent. Diehl and Jeppsson (1998) presented a dynamic simulation model of an activated sludge plant. For describing the continuous sedimentation in the secondary clarifier, a one-dimensional model based on non-linear partial differential equation was proposed. The analysis of the settling process lied on vigorous mathematical treatment of the equation. The Diehl-Jeppsson model, however, does not correlate the dynamics of the reactor to that of the <b>settling</b> <b>tank</b> in a comprehensive way.|$|R
