50|$|The {{drive to}} invest {{overseas}} stemmed from several motives. A {{major reason for}} many early investments was to obtain access to raw materials. As Japan became more dependent on imported <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>energy,</b> and food during the 1960s and 1970s, direct investments were one way of ensuring supply. The Middle East, Australia, and some Asian countries (such as Indonesia) were major locations for such investments by 1970. Second, rising labour costs during the 1960s and 1970s led certain labour-intensive industries, especially textiles, to move abroad.|$|R

The optimisation of the fuel-energy balance is not a new procedure. However, the existing models suffer from shortcomings, which to some extent are not present in our model. It is based on the following points. (1) A source of <b>energy</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> is a production complex of an output, processing and utilisation of the reserves, and manufacture of by-products. (2) Each type of production has its own characteristics. (3) Direct and feedback production links exist between the existing and newly created production capacities. The model reviews the influence of scientific and technical progress. (4) The model is designed largely for energotechnologic utilisation towards the production of essential energy products. (5) The model foresees a discrete variation of power capacity. This way the non-linear function of expense is taken into account. (6) The worked out model makes it possible to ground the rational structure and volume of oil shale use, to draw into production more from its enormous reserves and in this way to favour the relative autonomy of the national energy economy. ...|$|R
