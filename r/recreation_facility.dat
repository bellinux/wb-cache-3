50|$|Passive {{recreation}} typically requires little {{management and}} can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity {{in the form of}} walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active <b>recreation</b> <b>facilities</b> and developed infrastructure. Many ski resorts combine active <b>recreation</b> <b>facilities</b> (ski lifts, gondolas, terrain parks, downhill runs, and lodges) with passive <b>recreation</b> <b>facilities</b> (cross-country ski trails).|$|R
