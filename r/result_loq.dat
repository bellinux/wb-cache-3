40|$|In the {{preceding}} chapters, I have discussed my doctoral research on studying the siRNA loading pathway in Drosophila using both biochemical and genetic approaches. We established a gel shift system {{to identify the}} intermediate complexes formed during siRNA loading. We detected at least three complexes, named complex B, RISC loading complex (RLC) and RISC. Using kinetic modeling, we determined that the siRNA enters complex B and RLC early during assembly when it remains double-stranded, and then matures in RISC to generate Argonaute bearing only the single-stranded guide. We further characterized the three complexes. We showed that complex B comprises Dcr- 1 and Loqs, while both RLC and RISC contain Dcr- 2 and R 2 D 2. Our study suggests that the Dcr- 2 /R 2 D 2 heterodimer plays {{a central role in}} RISC assembly. We observed that Dcr- 1 /Loqs, which function together to process pre-miRNA into mature miRNA, were also involved in siRNA loading. This was surprising, because it has been proposed that the RNAi pathway and miRNA pathway are separate and parallel, with each using a unique set of proteins to produce small RNAs, to assemble functional RNA-guided enzyme complexes, and to regulate target mRNAs. We further examined the molecular function of Dcr- 1 /Loqs in RNAi pathway. Our data suggest that, in vivo and in vitro, the Dcr- 1 /Loqs complex binds to siRNA. In vitro, the binding of the Dcr- 1 /Loqs complex to siRNA is the earliest detectable step in siRNA-triggered Ago 2 -RISC assembly. Futhermore, the binding of Dcr- 1 /Loqs to siRNA appears to facilitate dsRNA dicing by Dcr- 2 /R 2 D 2, because the dicing activity is much lower in loqs lysate than in wild type. Long inverted repeat (IR) triggered white silencing in fly eyes is an example of endogenous RNAi. Consistent with our finding that Dcr- 1 /Loqs function to load siRNA, less white siRNA accumulates in loqs mutant eyes compared to wild type. As a <b>result,</b> <b>loqs</b> mutants are partially defective in IR trigged white silencing. Our data suggest considerable functional and genetic overlap between the miRNA and siRNA pathways, with the two sharing key components previously thought to be confined to just one of the two pathways. Based on our study on siRNA loading pathway, we also elucidated the molecular function of Armitage (Armi) protein in RNAi. We showed that armi is required for RNAi. Lysates from armi mutant ovaries are defective for RNAi in vitro. Native gel analysis of protein-siRNA complexes suggests that armi mutants support early steps in the RNAi pathway, i. e., the formation of complex B and RLC, but are defective in the production of the RISC...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{only two}} AOAC Official Methods SM have been {{available}} {{for the analysis of}} fructans: Method 997. 08 and Method 999. 03. Both are based on the analysis of the fructan component monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) after hydrolysis. The two methods have some limitations due to the strategies used for removing background interferences (such as from sucrose, α-glucooligosaccharides, and free sugars). The method described in this paper has been developed to overcome those limitations. The method is largely based on Method 999. 03 and uses combined enzymatic and SPE steps to remove the interfering components without impacting the final analytical result. The method has been validated in two laboratories on infant formula and adult nutritionals. Recoveries were in the range of 86 - 119 %, with most being in the range of 91 - 104 %. RSDr values were in the range of 0. 7 - 2. 6 %, with one exception when the fructan concentration was close to the <b>LOQ,</b> <b>resulting</b> in an RSDr of 8. 9 %.

40|$|Double-stranded RNA-binding {{proteins}} (dsRBPs), such as R 2 D 2 and Loquacious (Loqs), {{function in}} tandem with Dicer (Dcr) enzymes in RNA interference (RNAi). In Drosophila, Dcr- 1 /Loqs and Dcr- 2 /R 2 D 2 complexes generate microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. Although R 2 D 2 does not regulate siRNA production, R 2 D 2 and Dcr- 2 coordinately bind siRNAs to promote assembly of the siRNA-induced silencing (siRISC) complexes. Conversely, Loqs enhances miRNA production. It is uncertain if Dcr- 1 and Loqs facilitate miRNA loading onto the miRISC complexes. Here we used loqs knockout (KO) flies to characterize the physiological functions of Loqs in the miRNA pathway. Northern analysis revealed consistent accumulation of precursor (pre) -miRNAs in loqs KO flies. However, the lack of Loqs had differential effects on mature miRNAs: some are diminished, whereas others maintain wild-type levels. Importantly, the data suggest that miRNA production is not the rate-limiting step of the miRNA pathway. We show that Dcr- 1, but not Loqs, is critical for assembly of miRISCs by using dcr- 1 or loqs null egg extract. Consistent with this, recombinant Dcr- 1 could efficiently interact with miRNA duplex {{in the absence of}} <b>Loqs.</b> Together, our <b>results</b> indicate that <b>Loqs</b> plays a prominent role in miRNA biogenesis, but is largely dispensable for miRISC assembly. Thus, Loqs and R 2 D 2 represent two distinct functional modes for dsRBPs in the RNAi pathways...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cuscuta species {{known as}} dodder, {{have been used}} in {{traditional}} medicine of eastern and southern Asian countries as liver and kidney tonic. Flavonoids are considered as the main biologically active constituents in Cuscuta plants especially in C. chinensis Lam. Objective In the present study, a fast, simple and reliable method for the simultaneous determination and quantization of C. chinensis flavonols including hyperoside, rutin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol has been developed. Materials and methods The chromatographic separation was carried out on a reversed phase ACE 5 C 18 with eluting at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a gradient with O -phosphoric acid 0. 25 % : acetonitrile for 42 min. UV spectra were collected across the range of 200 – 900 nm, extracting 360 nm for the chromatograms. The method was validated according to linearity, selectivity, precision, recovery, LOD and <b>LOQ.</b> <b>Results</b> The method was selective for determination of rutin, hyperoside, isorhamnetin and kampferol. The calibration graphs of flavonols were linear with r 2 [*]>[*] 0. 999. RSDs% of intra- and inter-day precisions were found 1. 3 & 3. 4 for rutin, 1. 5 & 2. 8 for hyperoside, 1. 3 & 3. 3 for isorhamnetin and 1. 7 & 2. 9 for kaempferol which were satisfactory. LODs and LOQs were calculated as 1. 73 & 8. 19 for rutin, 0. 09 & 4. 19 for hyperoside, 2. 09 & 6. 3 for isorhamnetin and 0. 18 & 0. 56 for kaempferol. The recovery averages of above-mentioned flavonols were 90. 3 %, 97. 4 %, 98. 7 % and 90. 0 %, respectively. Conclusion The simplicity of the method makes it highly valuable for quality control of C. chinensis according to quantization of flavonols. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the Mamais-Jenkins-Pitt {{method for}} {{determination}} of readily biodegradable COD (SS), 2 alternatives were {{proposed for the}} intermediate determination of soluble inert COD (SI). When a full-scale treatment plant exists, influent SI = effluent truly soluble COD. When there is no full-scale plant, then the truly soluble COD of the effluent of a 24 h fill-and-draw batch reactor treating the wastewater is taken as influent SI. In this study, both SI methods were statistically compared on 24 wastewater samples from 2 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). While average SI obtained for the 2 methods was the same, individual samples usually had very different SI values. In fact, virtually no correlation {{was found between the}} 2 methods. Also, the SS values obtained using both SI alternatives were statistically compared. A good correlation was observed, in spite of the poor SI correlation – low, dispersed SI values did not seriously affect the correlation between both SS determinations. A method was proposed for determination of the limit of detection and the limit of quantification (LOQ) for both SS methods. The <b>LOQ</b> <b>resulted</b> in 28. 6 mg/l and 32. 6 mg/l, respectively, for the full-scale and the laboratory-scale alternatives. Some assumptions of the original laboratory-scale (LS) method could potentially be sources of error in SI determination. Two modifications to the laboratory-scale method were implemented in order to avoid these potential problems: Washing biomass with tap water, and correcting SI in the fill-and-draw reactor by the SI of the original biomass suspension. These method modifications were tested on wastewater samples from the mentioned WWTPs. The fundamentals and results of both modifications are discussed in this paper, as well as the imprecision associated with estimating influent SI from effluent CODsol in all studied methods, and its impact on SS determination.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was studied {{during the period}} 2006 – 2008 in northern Finland (Pallas), 1998 – 2008 in southern Finland (Evo) and 2002 – 2004 in the Gulf of Finland archipelago (Utö). Retrospective snow samples {{were taken from the}} whole snowbank in Evo in 2003 and 2004, and recently fallen snow was collected in Evo in 2006 – 2008. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs in the depositions were usually small. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was often reached in Pallas and Utö. The analysis results of PCDD/F and PCB congeners from Evo were used to predict numerical results with linear regression for those congeners with <b>results</b> below <b>LOQ.</b> The {{deposition of}} PCDD/Fs in Pallas was mostly less than 0. 4 pg·m− 2 ·day− 1 WHO-TEQ and less than 1. 0 pg·m− 2 ·day− 1 WHO-TEQ and 0. 5 pg·m− 2 ·day− 1 WHO-TEQ in Evo and Utö, respectively. The deposition of co-planar PCBs (cPCBs) was between 0. 01 and 0. 1 pg·m− 2 ·day− 1 WHO-TEQ. Annual PCDD/F deposition, calculated from the amount of collected rain and chemical analysis results, varied in Pallas between 0. 04 and 0. 15 ng·m− 2 ·year− 1 WHO-TEQ, in Evo between 0. 11 and 0. 22 ng·m− 2 ·year− 1 WHO-TEQ and in Utö between 50 and 145 pg·m− 2 ·year− 1 WHO-TEQ. For cPCBs the annual deposition in Pallas was 2 – 11 pg·m− 2 ·year− 1 WHO-TEQ, in Evo 6 – 17 pg·m− 2 ·year− 1 WHO-TEQ and in Utö 4 – 8 pg·m− 2 ·year− 1 WHO-TEQ. Wind directions are considered to be the main reason for the variation between seasons. Congener 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -PeCDD dominated in Pallas, Evo, and Utö, being 35 %, 48 %, and 47 % of the overall WHO-TEQ, followed by 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeCDF (about 10 %). The calculated pg/L concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -PeCDD were about the same level as 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeCDF, but the TEF  correlations being twice as big ensured that all WHO-TEQ contributions were bigger. PCB 126 accounted for 30 % of WHO-TEQ in Pallas, whereas in Evo and Utö the proportion was less than 5 %. Of PCDD/F homology groups, the highest concentration was found in Pallas as OCDDs (55 %), followed by Evo and Utö, at 42 % and 38 %, respectively. Decreasing temporal PCDD/F deposition trends were observed for highly chlorinated octa-, hepta-, and hexacongeners. The findings indicate that, regardless of the major importance of Kymijoki to the dioxins in the Gulf of Finland, deposition sources may contribute more to the PCDD/Fs’ intake of fish in the studied sea area...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a {{potentially}} curable disease that cause hypertension (HT). The {{first step in}} diagnosing PA consists in {{the determination of the}} aldosterone-renin-ratio (ARR). Recently, new methods with superior analytical performance for the measurement of both, aldosterone and renin, have been introduced in clinical practice. While aldosterone can be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or automated immunoassays, renin is predominantly measured by direct immunoassays. ARR is strongly method dependent. Insufficient data exists on ARR in healthy subjects and PA patients when aldosterone and renin are measured with one of these new methods. Aim of study The present study evaluated the analytical performance a commercial LC-MS/MS method from Perkin Elmer (CHS ™ MSMS Steroids) for the measurement of aldosterone. In addition, we established a reference range for ARR when aldosterone is measured with the before mentioned LC-MS/MS method and renin is measured by a direct immunoassay from DiaSorin on a Liaison XL auto-analyser. Materials and methods The Perkin Elmer CHS ™ MSMS Steroids method is a multiplex assays. Analyses were performed on a Shimadzu 8050 LC-MS/MS. The analytical performance of aldosterone measurement was evaluated determining the following performance indices: LoD, LoQ, recovery, carryover, linearity and precision. For the establishment of the ARR reference range serum aldosterone and plasma renin were measured in samples from 128 normotensive blood donors. <b>Results</b> LOD and <b>LOQ</b> were respectively 12. 9 pg/mL and 26 pg/mL. Intraassay precision at different concentrations was 7 % (at 79. 9 pg/mL.), 7. 6 % (at 161. 8 pg/mL.) and 1. 5 % (at 3506. 08 pg/mL). Interassay precision was 8. 5 %, 9. 6 % e 5. 1 % respectively. Recovery ranged between 80. 5 and 104. 4 %. Between x and y the method was linear. ARR in healthy blood donors varied between 0. 6 - 62. 4 pg/µU with a median of 5. 7 pg/µU. The 2. 5 th and 97. 5 th percentiles (without outlier) were 1. 0 and 16. 4, respectively. Conclusion The performance characteristics of the here tested LC-MS/MS method for the measurement of aldosterone are satisfactory and justify the use of this test in clinical practice...|$|R
