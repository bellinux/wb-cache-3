5|$|At {{the start}} of her legal career, Ginsburg faced {{difficulty}} finding employment as a wife, a mother of a five-year-old daughter and a Jew. In 1960, despite a strong <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> Albert Martin Sacks, a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship position due to her gender. Later that year, Ginsburg began a clerkship for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a position she held for two years.|$|E
5|$|Based upon another <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> Cabranes, Sotomayor was {{a member}} of the board of {{directors}} of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, 1996, the Seattle City Council {{designated}} the exterior and {{roof of the}} original 1931 building as a Seattle city landmark, having approved a <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> the Landmarks Preservation Board. The move was prompted by a long-term proposal from The Seattle Times Company to redevelop their land in South Lake Union, {{at a cost of}} $150 million while preserving the historic character of the two buildings. The plans included two 10-story office buildings, a larger printing plant, and a multilevel parking garage.|$|E

When Innes, {{acting on a}} <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> an advisory jury, dismissed an unrelated fraud case brought by Marshall in Innes' district court, Marshall retaliated by convincing Congressman John Rowan to file an impeachment petition against Innes in the House of Representatives. Innes countered by having his son-in-law, Thomas Bodley, pursue a censure of Marshall in the state House. Rowan's petition against Innes failed, but Bodley's against Marshall succeeded, and Marshall was expelled from the House in 1808, only to be re-elected the following year.|$|E

5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; {{it was not a}} currency in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E
5|$|With a {{loan from}} his cousin, Dudley Selden, and letters of <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> Ellsworth, Colt formed a {{corporation}} of venture capitalists in April 1836 {{to bring his}} idea to market.

Colt was given a commission for each gun sold {{in exchange for his}} dam of patent rights, and stipulated the return of the rights if the company disbanded.|$|E

5|$|After a <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> {{high-ranking}} Dutch naval {{officers that}} the Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) be bolstered so any attacker {{would have to}} deploy {{a significant amount of}} their fleet to the East Indies, keeping it from other theaters of war, the Minister of Defense ordered the Navy to prepare designs for a two or three-member class of battlecruisers. As they had not previously designed a modern capitalship, and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane's Fighting Ships, the Dutch turned to Germany. This initially bore no results, as the two sides were unable to come to terms. During this time, a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance; completed on 11 July 1939, it was missing many of the post-First World War advances in warship technology. In particular, the armor protection was completely outmoded.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Toulmin's {{letters of}} <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> Jefferson and Madison, {{the board of}} {{trustees}} of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky, elected him president of the seminary in February 1794. He was the first president of the seminary who was not a Presbyterian, and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members. His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members, and at their insistence, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re-elect the seminary's president. Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796.|$|E
5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the <b>recommendation</b> <b>from</b> Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
