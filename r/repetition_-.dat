In such a case the draw is not automatic - a player must claim it if he wants the draw. When the position will occur for the third time after the player's intended next move, he writes the move on his scoresheet but does not make the move on the board and claims the draw. Article 9.2 states that a position is considered identical to another if the same player is on move, the same types of pieces of the same colors occupy the same squares, and the same moves are available to each player; in particular, each player has the same castling and en passant capturing rights. (A player may lose his right to castle; and an en passant capture is available only at the first opportunity.) If the claim is not made on the move in which the repetition occurs, the player forfeits the right to make the claim. Of course, the opportunity may present itself again.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount {{life on the}} home front. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles for place and influence, and [...] "with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant." [...] Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the Fortunes of War, the conflict is viewed largely {{from the perspective of}} a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War battlescenes; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that [...] "it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper." [...] There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and <b>repetition</b> <b>–</b> of stories, events and deaths – used to give [...] "the impression of lives trapped in an endless war" [...] for which there is no end in sight.|$|E

It was necessary to see the smaller ones; the letters were at my hand for the purpose, but I was not going to lose this experience; and, instead of writing mere letters, have poured out a lot of stuff for the book. How this works and fits, time is to show. But I believe, in time, I shall get the whole thing in form. Now, up to date, that is all my design, and I beg to warn you till we have the whole (or much) of the stuff together, you can hardly judge - and I can hardly judge.

Problems of style are (as yet) dirt under my feet; my problem is architectural, creative - to get this stuff jointed and moving. If I can do that, I will trouble you for style; anybody might write it, and it would be splendid; well-engineered, the masses right, the blooming thing travelling - twig? ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether extensive repetition can diminish age-related {{differences between}} {{younger and older}} adults in functional magnetic resonance adaptation (fMR-A). Datasets were obtained from 26 younger and 24 older healthy adults presented with two scenes that repeated 20 times amongst other novel scenes during fMRI scanning. The average cortical responses to the first eight (<b>Repetitions</b> 1 <b>-</b> 7) and the last eight (<b>Repetitions</b> 12 <b>-</b> 19) presentations out of 20 were compared within each group. Younger adults showed similar levels of fMR-A in both repetition sets. Conversely, older adults did not show reliable fMR-A in <b>Repetitions</b> 1 <b>-</b> 7, but they did in <b>Repetitions</b> 12 <b>-</b> 19; subtracting the latter from the former revealed a significant effect within left inferior occipital, left lingual, and the posterior part of fusiform gyrus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to examine the mechanomyographic (MMG) and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude and frequency responses of the biceps brachii muscle during fatiguing isokinetic muscle actions of the forearm flexors. Ten adults [three women (mean r SD age = 20 r 2 yrs) and seven men (mean r SD age = 23 r 3 yrs) ] volunteered to perform 50 consecutive maximal, concentric isokinetic muscle actions of the dominant forearm flexors at 180 °•s- 1. Piezoelectric MMG recording sensors were placed over the belly of the biceps brachii muscle between bipolar surface EMG electrodes (Ag-AgCl). Isokinetic peak torque (PT), as well as MMG and EMG root-mean-square (rms) amplitude and mean power frequency (MPF) values were calculated for each of the 50 muscle actions and averaged across all subjects. Polynomial regression analyses indicated a cubic (p < 0. 05) reduction in PT across the 50 repetitions. There were linear (p < 0. 05) decreases in both MMG amplitude and MMG MPF throughout the test. The results for EMG amplitude demonstrated a cubic (p < 0. 05) pattern, where EMG amplitude increased during <b>repetitions</b> 1 <b>-</b> 20, remained stable during <b>repetitions</b> 20 <b>-</b> 40, and increased during <b>repetitions</b> 40 <b>-</b> 50.
