40|$|Abstract. Algorithms for {{recognizing}} strings of connected words from whole word patterns (either templates or statistical models) have {{advanced to the}} point of high efficiency and accuracy. Although the computation rate of these connected word recognition algorithms remains high, advances in VLSI hardware make even the most ambitious connected word recognition tasks practical with todays technology. The greatest impediment to the successful utilization of connected word recognizers is the difficulty in extracting reliable, robust whole word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns.</b> In the past, connected word recognizers have relied on either isolated word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> (which are trivially obtained), or <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> derived from limited context strings of words k g. the middle digit from strings of 3 digits). The resulting whole word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> were adequate for slow rates of speech articulation, but proved inadequate when users spoke strings of words at high rates k g. on the order of 200 - 300 words per minute). To alleviate this difficulty, a training procedure for extracting whole word patterns from naturally spoken word strings has been implemented and is described here. The training procedure is essentially a k-means loop in which a set of known word strings is segmented into individual words based on matching an initial set of word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> (typically a speaker independent set of isolated word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> is used). The segmented words are then used to create an updated set of word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> (either via clustering methods, for templates or via statistical techniques, for word models), which are then used in the segmental loop to give an updated set of word tokens from the labelled training set. This procedure is iterated until a stable set of whole word <b>reference</b> <b>patterns</b> is obtained. The training procedure was implemented and tested in a connected digits recognition task. For this task, string accuracies (on variable length strings with from 1 - 7 digits) on the order of 98 - 99 % were obtained. I...|$|R

[...] Subsequently other researchers presenting at the 22nd VLDB conference noted that for random access patterns and repeated scans over large datasets (sometimes known as cyclic access patterns) MRU cache algorithms have more hits than LRU due to their tendency to retain older data.

50|$|This {{algorithm}} {{cannot be}} implemented in a general purpose operating system because {{it is impossible to}} compute reliably how long it will be before a page is going to be used, except when all software that will run on a system is either known beforehand and is amenable to static analysis of its memory reference patterns, or only a class of applications allowing run-time analysis. Despite this limitation, algorithms exist that can offer near-optimal performance — the operating system keeps track of all pages referenced by the program, and it uses those data to decide which pages to swap in and out on subsequent runs. This algorithm can offer near-optimal performance, but not on the first run of a program, and only if the program's memory <b>reference</b> <b>pattern</b> is relatively consistent each time it runs.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{to other}} methods of analysis, powder {{diffraction}} allows for rapid, non-destructive analysis of multi-component mixtures {{without the need}} for extensive sample preparation. This gives laboratories around the world the ability to quickly analyze unknown materials and perform materials characterization in such fields as metallurgy, mineralogy, forensic science, archeology, condensed matter physics, and the biological and pharmaceutical sciences. Identification is performed by comparison of the diffraction pattern to a known standard or to a database such as the International Centre for Diffraction Data's Powder Diffraction File (PDF) or the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Advances in hardware and software, particularly improved optics and fast detectors, have dramatically improved the analytical capability of the technique, especially relative to the speed of the analysis. The fundamental physics upon which the technique is based provides high precision and accuracy in the measurement of interplanar spacings, sometimes to fractions of an Ångström, resulting in authoritative identification frequently used in patents, criminal cases and other areas of law enforcement. The ability to analyze multiphase materials also allows analysis of how materials interact in a particular matrix such as a pharmaceutical tablet, a circuit board, a mechanical weld, a geologic core sampling, cement and concrete, or a pigment found in an historic painting. The method has been historically used for the identification and classification of minerals, but it can be used for any materials, even amorphous ones, so long as a suitable <b>reference</b> <b>pattern</b> is known or can be constructed.|$|E

For this purpose, we develop a library of parallel reduction algorithms, including both previously known and novel schemes, which includes algorithms specialized for different classes of access behavior.
