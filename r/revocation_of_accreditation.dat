50|$|In November 2015 the Texas Education Agency (TEA) {{announced}} that it had revoked the accreditation of Pearsall ISD. Pearsall ISD appealed the TEA's <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b> If the appeal fails, the district will close on July 1, 2016.|$|E
50|$|This {{concentration}} {{of power in}} the hands of a small group—characterized by the absence of democratic governing structures and the lack of effective oversight by the Board—was an important factor in the Western Association of Schools and Colleges', or WASC's, decisions to impose sanctions on the college through much of the school's history. WASC actions and criticism periodically resulted in short-lived reforms that were invariably dismantled by the administration after the accrediting agency eased its scrutiny—a pattern that was repeated several times during the school's history. The pattern itself was criticized by WASC when it sanctioned the college in July 2007, months prior to the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>accreditation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The college {{closed in}} 1988 after a {{financial}} scandal {{led to the}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> its <b>accreditation,</b> and its eligibility to receive funds from charities such as the United Negro College Fund. Purchased in 1990 by Comer S. Cottrell, the campus is now used by Paul Quinn College.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{the school}} {{district}} was rated [...] "Accredited-Probation" [...] by the Texas Education Agency, {{which means that the}} district exhibits deficiencies in performance that, if not addressed, will lead to <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the district’s <b>accreditation</b> status.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{shutting}} down the school district, Commissioner of Education Michael Williams gave the La Marque schools ample opportunity and time for improvement. In 2011, the school district was judged [...] "academically unacceptable." [...] Similarly, in 2013 and 2014, La Marque schools were given a rating of [...] "improvement required." [...] Finally, an October 2015 review by the TEA found La Marque ISD's rating at [...] "substandard achievement." [...] This ultimately led to the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>accreditation</b> status. Critics <b>of</b> the school district point out that administrators failed to manage the tax funds properly, failed to hire and train competent instructors, and emphasized sports {{to the exclusion of}} academics.|$|R
50|$|UNVA was {{formerly}} accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, but this accreditation was revoked for unspecified reasons on August 6, 2008. The <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> UNVA's <b>accreditation</b> led the Singaporean Ministry of Education to stop {{organizations in the}} country offering UNVA courses, affecting about 270 students. Singaporean educators and students called for more rigorous checking of academic standards. As of January 2010, the university was an applicant for Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) <b>accreditation.</b> As <b>of</b> August 2011, UNVA was not included on the SACS list of accredited, candidate, and applicant institutions. The University of Northern Virginia was certified to operate by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) as a non-accredited institution.|$|R
50|$|In March 1990, Westmar {{merged with}} Teikyo University to form Teikyo-Westmar University. Teikyo agreed to send 500 Japanese {{students}} to the Iowa campus, {{at a cost of}} $15,000 each, and to give an additional $4 million for debt reduction. The next few years were tumultuous ones for the college. The United Methodist Church severed its ties with the college two months after the merger with Teikyo. In 1994, the school was threatened with <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> its <b>accreditation</b> by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools; it was placed on a two-year probation in August of that year. (The probation was renewed in 1996.) In 1995, Robert Driscoll, a private investor from California, purchased the college from Teikyo University, leading to one final name change, to Westmar University. Less than a year later, the city of Le Mars extended a $40,000 loan to the school to keep it afloat, and in 1996 they bought the school outright.|$|R
50|$|The {{provision}} {{allowing for}} <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> naturalisation {{as a consequence}} of residence abroad has been criticised as creating two classes of Liberian citizens and for reducing the capabilities of naturalised Liberians to pursue employment and educational opportunities abroad. The provision for the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> a minor's naturalisation following the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation has been criticised as unfair to the child.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{naturalisation}} awarded to children {{on the basis of}} a father's naturalisation, the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the father's naturalisation entails the <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> the child's naturalisation unless the child has reached age 21.|$|R
