25|$|Clone {{phishing}} {{is a type}} of {{phishing attack}} whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email. The attachment or link within the email is replaced with a malicious version and then sent from an email address spoofed to appear to come from the original sender. It may claim to be a <b>resend</b> of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.|$|E

[...] This continued until a small boy suggested the sending operator be allowed to complete the word, after which it was understood.

40|$|Time {{critical}} {{nature of}} the real-time communication usually makes connection-oriented protocols such as TCP useless, because retransmission of old and probably expired packets is not desired. However, connectionless protocols such as UDP do not provide such packet loss control and suitable for real-time communication such as voice or video communication. In this paper, we present an adaptive approach for the intelligent packet loss control for connectionless real-time voice communication. Instead of detecting and <b>resending</b> lost voice packets, this heuristic estimates the packet loss rate adaptively using {{a modified version of}} reinforcement learning and <b>resends</b> the most critical packets before they are expired. Our simulations indicate that this approach is promising for a remarkable improvement in QoS of real-time voice communication...|$|R

50|$|A problem {{arises when}} the connection-finalizing ACK packet {{sent by the}} client is lost, and the {{application}} layer protocol requires the server to speak first (SMTP and SSH are two examples). In this case, the client assumes that the connection was established successfully and waits for the server to send its protocol banner, or <b>resend</b> the SYN+ACK packet; however, the server is {{not aware of the}} session and will not <b>resend</b> the SYN+ACK because it discarded the backlog queue entry that would enable it to do so. Eventually, the client will abort the connection due to an application layer timeout, but this may take a relatively long time.|$|E
5000|$|Greylisting is {{effective}} because many mass email tools used by spammers do not queue and reattempt mail delivery as is normal for a regular mail transport agent. They do not queue and <b>resend</b> email as this requires {{the expenditure of}} resources (spamming normally operates on very narrow margins [...] ). Since the advent of greylisting, spammers have taken to rerunning their mail delivery tools to <b>resend</b> the same email again without having to expend resources queueing the email. However, this approach still requires them to expend additional resources resending the email a second time. As of 2011, spammers have been using this technique for many years.|$|E
50|$|Immediate mode is an {{alternative}} approach; the two styles can coexist in the same library and are not necessarily exclusionary in practice. For example, OpenGL has immediate mode functions that can use previously defined server side objects (textures, vertex and index buffers, shaders, etc.) without <b>resending</b> unchanged data.|$|R
