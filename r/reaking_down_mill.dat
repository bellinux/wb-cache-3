40|$|Peripheral milling is a {{metal cutting}} {{operation}} {{in which the}} cutter produces a machined surface parallel to the axis of rotation of cutting. This is approached either by upmilling or downmilling methods. The fundamental difference among these modes of milling shows a marked variation in the magnitude of cutting forces during the process, chip formation {{and the quality of}} metal cutting. This work examines the difference brought out on the resultant component/part in terms of surface finish and hardness on aircraft grade precipitation hardenable Aluminum 2124 T 851 alloy. Other cutting parameters like feeedrate, depth of cut, spindle speed, tool over hang length, tool diameter, number of flutes etc., are maintained identical on both types of milling. This study is examined on finishing operation of Aluminum plates of different aspect ratio in attaining a defined thickness on all the specimens. Metal cutting is carried using three different types of cutters for both upmilling and <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> strategies. The surface texture, surface finish and hardness are evaluated and the results are presented. The results indicate that hardness values are relatively high in <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> strategy for the same machining variables as against the case of upmilling and the surface roughness is higher in case of <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> compared to upmilling operations...|$|R

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper In this study, {{the effects}} of cutting speed, <b>milling</b> direction (<b>down</b> <b>milling,</b> up milling), coating layer (TiAlN and TiAlN-TiN) {{and the number of}} inserts of tool holder on the surface roughness and tool life in dry milling of Inconel 718 superalloy were investigated. In the first place, {{the effects of}} control factors on the tool life were studied at the cutting speeds of v = 50 m/min and v = 100 m/min. The alternation of flank wear depending on the cutting time was examined. The types of wear and wear mechanisms were determined by examining the optical images of worn tools. In {{the second part of the}} study, for the purpose of investigating the effects of control factors on the surface roughness, L 16 Taguchi Technique was used and the optimal control factor levels, giving the lowest value of the average surface roughness parameter (Ra) were determined. The effect of cutting speed on the tool life was more than the effects of the milling type and number of inserts. <b>Down</b> <b>milling</b> resulted in longer tool life compared to up milling method. In up milling, longer tool life was obtained with 2 inserts at low cutting speeds and with 4 inserts at high cutting speeds. TiAlN-TiN coated tools exhibited twice as long tool life than the TiAlN coated tools. For both milling methods, the most effective wear types were flank wear and nose wear...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePeripheral milling of {{wood with}} up <b>milling</b> and <b>down</b> <b>milling</b> {{techniques}} {{is very well}} known from a geometrical point of view. However, in processing anisotropic materials such as wood, these geometrical aspects imply relevant differences when machining. In fact, milling of anisotropic material leads to different cutting geometries when up- or down-milling and when increasing or decreasing the depth of cut resulting in different grain orientations depending on the adopted process. In this paper, tests performed when processing Douglas Fir with different depths of cut and grain orientations are described. The cutting forces were measured, and the dependence of the cutting forces with respect on the cutting geometry are analysed and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the cave}} had some {{potentially}} dangerous problems. The first visitors had to hike up and <b>down</b> <b>Mill</b> Creek canyon {{to reach the}} entrance. Later, a rickity swinging bridge had been constructed over the canyon eliminating the exhausting hike, but creating a new danger. Also, the sinkhole entrance was still quite dangerous. Schermerhorn would have a safer road across the canyon built and a new man-made entrance to the cave constructed. Other improvements included a new parking lot, landscaping around the cave, and a new ticket office and gift shop. The trails within the cave were slightly altered and replaced with stone. Also, pipe welded hand rails, and a new indirect lighting system was added.|$|R
