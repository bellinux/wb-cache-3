Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is another manifestation of this process, which occurs in approximately 12 % of SScl patients [1].

Although the acoustic basis of this recognition has been explored in several species, only {{a few studies have}} experimentally tested the acoustic coding-decoding strategy used for mate identification. Here, we investigated mate recognition in the Scopoli's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) by conducting playbacks of calls with modified acoustic features. We showed that females and males in a seabird species with a moderate vocal dimorphism are likely to share the same coding-decoding rule for vocal mate identification. Specifically, a disruption of call temporal structure prevented mate recognition in both sexes, in line with the parameters previously identified as supporting an individual signature. Modifications of spectral cues and envelope structure also impaired recognition, but at a lesser extent: almost half of the tested males and females were still able to <b>recognise</b> their <b>partner.</b> It is likely that this equal ability of female and male Scopoli's shearwaters to vocally <b>recognise</b> their <b>partner</b> could be found in other seabirds...|$|R

Thus, a conformational change in the chromosomes at the onset of meiosis can be correlated directly with recognition.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the adoption of a social development paradigm on human resource planning within the welfare sector, focusing particularly on the consequences for social work {{and the rise of the}} social service professions. Social work, both in South Africa and in the Western world, evolved out of a political process which gave it legitimate sanction to offer social welfare services. In fact, in South Africa, the development of social work as a profession was intimately tied to the development of government social welfare provision. Thus, for forty years social work enjoyed government support and played a dominant role in the provision of organised welfare services, both government and private. Within the apartheid welfare system, private or voluntary welfare organisations were subsidised by government as <b>recognised</b> <b>partners</b> in welfare provision. In keeping with apartheid policy, their focus was mainly, though not exclusively, on white urban populations. Through the struggle years of the 1980 s non-governmental organisations, outside the established welfare sector, gained prominence. Foreign funding to support the struggle against apartheid and to address the needs of the neglected majority, increasingly became channelled through this anti-establishment sector. With the advent of the first democratic government in South Africa in 1994 the non-government sector was bound to exert a great deal of influence on future policies and practices within the welfare and development arenas. The African National Congress (ANC 1994) formulated its policy in the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), which laid the foundations for reconstruction and development in South Africa. RDP policy provided a blueprint for social development, which like most social development frameworks, was practically unworkable and pie-in-the-sky (Gray 1998 b 1 Midgley 1997). The RDP soon gave way to Growth Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) as the dominant economic paradigm. However, its principles remained highly influential in the formation of policy within specific sectors. especially within welfare (McKendrick 1998 a). Crucial to this examination of {{the effects of the}} social development paradigm on human resource planning within welfare is my view of the process leading up to the formation of the Council for Social Service Professions. It provides a backdrop to the discussion which follows. While realising that others might take a different view, my interpretation of recent events is offered in the spirit of healthy academic debate and, hopefully, it will be seen in that light. There is much that needs open discussion and debate if we are to progress successfully along the path which has been mapped out for us...|$|R

In Zimbabwe itself, the road to democracy since independence from colonial oppresssion has been filled with blind alleys and impasses. Throughout history, the church has been a <b>recognised</b> key <b>partner</b> with the state in particular, and society in general, in the discourse facilitating the democratisation process. In this context, the church shares in the mission of Christ as a pacesetter in offering prophetic advocacy, and in education as a driver of social transformation. This article explores church engagement in the transition to democracy, using access points that include promoting liberation, reconciliation and reconstruction, and inculcating democratic values of respect for human dignity and the participation of all people in decisions that affect the quality and direction of their lives. The article explores the question of how the church has exercised its role in the transition from colonial rule to democracy in Zimbabwe by defining the term “transition to democracy”, examining the situation in Zimbabwe, and exposing the church’s engagement with it. Pertinent questions for the appraisal are: What has been done? What is being done? Do the interventions go deep enough? What needs to be done...|$|R
