40|$|Fiber Reinforced Polymer, FRP {{material}} {{has been accepted}} as an alternative construction material for several civil engineering applications. This paper presents the use of FRP material for the precast industry and more specifically Concrete Sandwich Panels typically used as bearing wall panels and building envelopes of many structures. The research program examines {{the use of a}} carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) material, configured as a grid and placed in composite action with rigid foam insulation, as the main shear transfer mechanism for precast concrete sandwich panels. The motivation for the use of these materials is in their ability to provide composite action between the two concrete wythes, allowing for greater structural capacity, higher thermal efficiency, and a longer service life. This study investigates the effect of several parameters believed to affect the shear flow capacity of the CGRID/foam insulation material mechanism, including the type of <b>rigid</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>foam,</b> the spacing between rows of CFRP grids, and the thickness of the foam insulation. A comprehensive experimental program was conducted to determine the characteristics of the shear transfer mechanism of the grid/insulation. Test results are used to develop an equation to estimate the shear flow strength using the CFRP grid/rigid foam as affected by these parameters. A non-linear 3 -D finite element program was used to model and predict the behavior of the test specimens and to study the behavior under several other parameters is presented. A solid element with different crushing and cracking characteristics are selected to model the concrete and the rigid foam materials. Contact elements are used by means of Coulomb Friction theory to model the shear transfer mechanism at the interface between the different layers. Rupture and buckling behavior of CGRID was simulated by non-linear spring elements. The ultimate strength and the degree of composite action were found to depend on the combined action of the bond between CGRID/Rigid foam and concrete...|$|E

Its large penetration depth makes it ideal for the nondestructive visualization of internal structure of materials or objects unobtainable otherwise. Currently widely used nondestructive evaluation (NDE) tools-X-ray radiography and tomography are absorption-based, and work well in highly absorbing materials where density or composition variations due to internal structure or defects are high enough to be spatially distinguished in terms of absorption contrast. However, in many cases where materials such as <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> are light-weight, the conventional absorption-based X-ray methods for NDE become less effective. Indeed, the low-density shuttle <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> used for flight mission poses a great challenge to the standard NDE tools in that the absorption contrast arising from internal defects of such a low- density material is either weak or indistinguishable.

40|$|Abstract — A {{subsurface}} holographic radar using a multi-frequency signal {{has been}} developed for inspecting dielectric construction materials. The characteristic feature of this device {{is the ability to}} obtain one-sided radar soundings/images with a high sensitivity and high resolution (2 cm) in the frequency band of 3. 6 – 4. 0 GHz. One promising application of the device is non-destructive evaluation of the heat protection system and other materials on the U. S. Space Shuttle, and proposed crewed exploration vehicle (CEV). The advantages of this continuous-wave holographic radar over traditional impulse subsurface radars are discussed and illustrated by experimental results. The disastrous loss of the space shuttle Columbia, as well as even more recent dangerous incidents that were thankfully resolved, have aroused interest in possible new methods and devices for non-destructive testing and evaluation of the Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System, the external fuel tank <b>insulating</b> <b>foam,</b> and other materials and structures on the shuttle (see Figure 1), proposed CEV, and other space vehicles. Voids in or under the external tank <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> are considered potential sites for “cryopumping ” where water seeps in and then evaporates explosively at altitude, pulling the foam from the tank (Figure 2). One of the possible means for non-destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation of structural ma-terials is subsurface radar. This method is based on the propensity of electromagnetic waves to be reflected at permittivity contrasts. Up to now, the use of radar for NDT has been hindered by Figure 1 : Suspect flaws on the external hy-drogen tank coating [1].

40|$|Presence of defects such as disbonds, delaminations, impact damage, in thermal {{protection}} systems can significantly reduce {{safety of the}} Space Shuttle and its crew. The physical cause of Space Shuttle Columbia's catastrophic failure was a breach in its {{thermal protection}} system, caused by a piece of external tank <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> separating from the external tank and striking {{the leading edge of}} the left wing of the orbiter. There is an urgent need for a rapid, robust and life-circle oriented nondestructive testing (NDT) technique capable of inspecting the external tank <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> as well as the orbiter's protective (acreage) heat tiles and its fuselage prior and subsequent to a launch. Such a comprehensive inspection technique enables NASA to perform life-cycle inspection on critical components of the orbiter and its supporting hardware. Consequently, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center initiated an investigation into several potentially viable NDT techniques for this purpose. Microwave and millimeter wave NDT methods have shown great potential to achieve these goals. These methods have been successfully used to produce images of the interior of various complex, thick and thin external tank <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> structures for real focused reflectometer at operating frequency from 50 - 100 GHz and for synthetic aperture techniques at Ku-band (12 - 18 GHz) and K-band (18 - 26 GHz).

This paper presents recent results of an investigation for the purpose of detecting anomalies such as debonds and corrosion in metal substrate in complex multi-sectioned protective heat tile specimens using a real focused 150 GHz (D-band) reflectometer and wide-band millimeter wave holography at 33 - 50, GHz (Q-band) ...|$|R

40|$|The figure shows {{a fixture}} for {{measuring}} the tensile strength of the bond between an aluminum substrate and a thermally <b>insulating</b> polymeric <b>foam.</b> The specimen {{is meant to be}} representative of <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> on an aluminum tank that holds a cryogenic liquid. Prior to the development of this fixture, tensile tests of this type were performed on foam/substrate specimens immersed in cryogenic fluids. Because the specimens were cooled to cryogenic temperatures throughout their thicknesses, they tended to become brittle and to fracture at loads below true bond tensile strengths. The present fixture is equipped to provide a thermal gradient from cryogenic temperature at the foam/substrate interface to room temperature on the opposite foam surface. The fixture includes an upper aluminum block at room temperature and a lower aluminum block cooled to - 423 F (approx. - 253 C) by use of liquid helium. In preparation for a test, the metal outer surface (the lower surface) of a foam/substrate specimen is bonded to the lower block and the foam outer surface (the upper surface) of the specimen is bonded to the upper block. In comparison with the through-the-thickness cooling of immersion testing, the cryogenic-to-room-temperature thermal gradient that exists during testing on this fixture is a more realistic approximation of the operational thermal condition of sprayed <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> on a tank of cryogenic liquid. Hence, tensile tests performed on this fixture provide more accurate indications of operational bond tensile strengths. In addition, the introduction of the present fixture reduces the cost of testing by reducing the amount of cryogenic liquid consumed and the time needed to cool a specimen...|$|R
