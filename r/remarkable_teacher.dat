40|$|A {{very common}} {{perspective}} concerning Vakhtangov {{is that he}} is an eclectic who combines Stanislavsky’s psychological realism and Meyerhold’s theatricalism. Based on historical facts, however, this paper indicates that although Vakhtangov was deeply influenced by Stanislavsky in the early stage of his career, under the impact of anti-realism in Western European and Russian theatre, he gradually changed from Stanislavskian realism to Meyerholdian theatricality. Particularly, The Princess Turandot directed by Vakhtangov in the very year of his death was a stage production of pure anti-realism. Since his life was short, Vakhtangov only proclaimed his theory of “fantastic realism”, but did not have enough time to practise it fully. Furthermore, this paper also analyzes the historical reasons for misunderstanding Vakhtangov: in the Soviet Union then, “socialist realism ” dominated literature and arts such that “realism ” was a positive term while “anti-realism ” was a negative one; naturally, Vakhtangov’s students had to emphasize that “fantastic realism ” was not beyond realism, {{and on the other hand}} de-emphasize their <b>remarkable</b> <b>teacher’s</b> anti-realistic leanings...|$|R

40|$|Martha Harris (1919 - 1987) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} and also one of the most loved psychoanalysts of the generation that trained with Melanie Klein. She also worked with Wilfred Bion, and wrote many books and papers on psychoanalytic training and child development. Her colleague James Gammill cites Mrs Klein as saying: "She is one of the best people I have ever known for the psychoanalysis of children … and she has a mind of her own. " Harris was responsible for the child psychotherapy training at the Tavistock Clinic from 1960 onwards, developing laterally the method founded on infant observation that had been put in place by Esther Bick. She established cross-clinic work discussion groups, a pioneering schools’ counselling course (in collaboration with her husband Roland Harris), and individual work with disturbed children in the school environment. Her belief that psychoanalytic ideas could and should “travel”, both geographically and across the professions, led to her seeding the “Tavi Model” in many other countries through regular teaching trips, in company with her later husband Donald Meltzer. Her influence was not as a theorist, but as a teacher with an extraordinary capacity to engage processes of introjective learning in both students and readers. This tribute by some of those who studied with her is not simply testimony to a <b>remarkable</b> <b>teacher</b> and clinician whose wisdom has been rarely equalled; it also offers inspiration to others who may be struggling to find ways of using psychoanalytic ideas imaginatively in a variety of contexts - clinical, social or scholarly - in what can at times appear to be an unreceptive world...|$|E

However, the concept of Indigenous identity is complex and contested as is the relationship between Indigenous identity and school success. This paper draws on qualitative research in a small urban secondary school. It details the practices of two <b>remarkable</b> <b>teachers</b> as they work to support the diverse identities of their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in ways which also allow the students to take on identities as knowers and learners in their classrooms. Their understanding of the students' identities involved them in seeing the students in multiple ways, constantly moving between the individual interests and needs of the student, their family connections and contemporary Indigenous life. Their practices in supporting Indigenous students as knowers and learners were based on recognising the complex interactions between race, history, school structures and peer relationships. Through their practices, they intentionally rejected the reproductive tendencies of schooling and created spaces where Indigenous youth could challenge "commonsense" about themselves...|$|R

This, in particular, the results of an analysis of selected categories, the teacher’s experiences as students in elementary and high school (EHS). To better understand this development was adopted as a qualitative research method, focusing on narrative, based on semi-structured interviews. Building on a concept of professional development perspective taken continuously, conceived in a broader context of teaching, permeating crises and conflicts, the analysis shows that teachers bring in to their teaching practice "brands" of meaningful experiences as students in the EHS. It was also possible to verify that some realized early on the desire to be teachers and others realized that later influenced by faculty or bystanders. The early stage of their education were influenced by striking teachers, whose way of teaching was often a point of support in the early years of teaching. The influence of striking teachers has been highlighted as possibly important factor in undergraduate courses. Moraes (1991) in their study reveals that the presence of these <b>remarkable</b> <b>teachers,</b> perhaps, is even more important stages in the school prior to graduation, ie, teaching EHS.

5000|$|Russell was well-spoken and urbane, he {{was also}} an {{excellent}} pianist and had an appreciation of the best music; Percy Grainger recollected him as 'the first exquisite pianist in my life'. Russell was a fine surgeon and a <b>remarkable</b> clinical <b>teacher.</b> Every case was made the subject of careful, accurate and complete study, and every student was trained to think on surgical lines, always with the proviso that the recovery of the patient was the important thing. As a student of Lister he believed in the importance of the dressing of the wounds, and to go the rounds with him while he explained the reason for each method of application was an education in itself. Russell was not a believer in complicated methods of surgery and was always seeking the simplest way. He earned the affection and admiration of all his students, and his great ability made him a member of the small band of Australian medical men whose influence has been felt outside his own country. There is a bust of Russell by Paul Montford at the Alfred hospital, and an intermediate hospital block attached to the Alfred hospital has been named Hamilton Russell House in his memory.|$|R
40|$|Chapter One {{identifies}} {{areas of}} actual and potential {{confusion in the}} analysis of 'mass' and 'elite' education systems. It attempts to clarify the area of enquiry. The chapter concludes with a statement of a 'problem'. The problem is the relation between rapidly changing types of school and higher education institutions, and 'theories of general education'. Chapter Two continues the task of clarification by selecting and explaining the techniques of enquiry which are used to clarify the problem in England. The techniques are reviewed and the tradition within which the analysis is located is briefly identified. This chapter concludes the initial phase of problem analysis. Chapter Three undertakes the identification of the problem in different contexts, i. e. in four countries. It notes variations in the patternings of the problem. It considers selected aspects of the internal dynamics of educational systems in their relation to the problem. Chapter Four is a short abstract statement {{of the ways in which}} theories in general education are sustained; and thus potentially changed. Chapter Five offers some comment on the possibilities of changing the 'theory of general education' in England. 3 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I have been fortunate. In my formal education, I have been taught by four <b>remarkable</b> <b>teachers.</b> Of these, two have been Professor and Head of the Comparative Education Department at the University of London Institute of Education. The impact of these two men, Professor Lauwerys and Professor Holmes on comparative education students, for a period of time which is now approaching forty years, has been extensive and intensive. Extensive, in that their students are now teachers of comparative education all over the world. Intensive, in that the intellectual attraction of their teaching has often been so strong as to change the ways in which individuals see their lives. They had this effect on me. I thank them for their teaching. My particular debt to Professor Holmes will be clear, to specialists in comparative education, in the pages that follow. Here I would like to acknowledge a crucial departmental institution: the Holmes' research seminar which has been held fortnightly for many years now. The seminar is a normal part of the life of a research student in the department. Everyone attends, and regularly. I suppose most people attend because, like me, they find that their thought processes in difficult comparative analyses are, when fast, not rigorous enough for the seminar; and when rigorous, too slow. One learns. The learning is 'cumulative. It is possible to meet the standards expected in the seminar; occasionally. For the pressure to meet those standards, for the freely given energy of the teaching process, and for the example of how comparative education work might be well done, I acknowledge with great pleasure a permanent debt. ...|$|R

Therefore, modelling predictive relationships for the tested TEDS-M countries can be done simultaneously, for Taiwan the analysis is to be conducted separately.|$|R
