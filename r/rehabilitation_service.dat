5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service.</b> The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E

40|$|Background: As {{health care}} practitioners, it is {{important}} to have an understanding of the common barriers to and facilitators of the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> we provide. Objectives : This article aimed to review the relevant literature regarding barriers to and facilitators of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> for people with disabilities. Method: Articles for the period 1990 – 2010 using descriptors related to <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services,</b> barriers, facilitators and the physically disabled population were retrieved for this review. Results: A total of 19 article titles were identified from references of other articles but following application of the inclusion criteria selected for this review, only six articles were chosen. Five of these articles were qualitative studies and one was a quantitative study. Barriers and facilitators regarding <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> highlighted by participants in the studies included a perception that health professionals have a lack of understanding of rehabilitation for people with disabilities and there was a lack of information sharing from health professionals about the rehabilitation process. On the other hand some participants reported that health professionals demonstrated confidence in the disability and rehabilitation process during consultation and highlighted that their needs were met by the rehabilitation professionals. Conclusion: Even though there were few studies highlighting the barriers to and facilitators of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services,</b> they highlighted that there are gaps in the process of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>services</b> provided.
