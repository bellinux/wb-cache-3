40|$|The {{design of}} central {{receivers}} in {{solar thermal power}} plants is critical for eﬃcient plant operation and sufficient operational lifetimes. The high, non-uniform concentration ratios used in central receivers lead to high, non-uniform receiver temperatures. For the same operational conditions, small changes to the receiver design {{can make a big}} impact on the expected lifetime of the receiver. This is due to limitations of the <b>receiver</b> <b>materials</b> to high temperatures and thermal cycling. In this study, we investigate the effect of several engineering concepts on the resultant surface temperatures of tubular billboard receivers. Four tubular billboard designs are investigated along with the sensitivity these designs have to high temperatures resulting from changes in the aiming point of the heliostat array. We examined a receiver with single diameter tubes, an ideal ﬂow receiver, a receiver using various diameter tubes and a receiver made of tube panels in series. The single-diameter and multi-diameter receivers were found to have high temperatures and high sensitivity under non-standard irradiation. The multi-pass receiver was found to out-perform the other designs by reducing both the maximum surface temperatures under standard irradiance and the risk of high temperatures from irradiance changes.

40|$|As {{the need}} for {{achieving}} super high temperatures (2000 K and above) in solar heat receivers has developed so has {{the need for}} secondary concentrators. These concentrators refocus the already highly concentrated solar energy provided by a primary solar collector, thereby significantly reducing the light entrance aperture of the heat receiver and the resulting infrared radiation heat loss from the receiver cavity. Although {{a significant amount of}} research and development has been done on nonimaging hollow reflective concentrators, there has been no other research or development to date on solid, single crystal, refractive concentrators that can operate at temperatures above 2000 K. The NASA Lewis Research Center recently initiated the development of single-crystal, optically clear, refractive secondary concentrators that, combined with a flux extractor, offer a number of significant advantages over the more conventional, hollow, reflective concentrators at elevated temperatures. Such concentrators could potentially provide higher throughput (efficiency), require no special cooling device, block heat <b>receiver</b> <b>material</b> boiloff from the receiver cavity, provide for flux tailoring in the cavity via the extractor, and potentially reduce infrared heat loss via an infrared block coating.

40|$|This work is {{centered}} on low-frequency and high-frequency multiphysics problems of piezoelectric structures submerged in a quiescent fluid domain for the applications of vibration energy harvesting, biomimetic actuation, and contactless acoustic energy transfer. In {{the first part of}} this research, Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC) -based piezoelectric structures are employed for underwater mechanical base excitation and electrical biomimetic actuation in bending mode at low frequencies (the fundamental underwater bending resonance being in the infrasonic frequency range). The MFC technology (fiber-based piezoelectric composites with interdigitated electrodes) exploits the effective 33 -mode of piezoelectricity, and strikes a balance between structural deformation and force levels for actuation to use in underwater locomotion, in addition to offering high power density for energy harvesting to enable battery-less aquatic sensors. Following in-air electroelastic composite model development, the fundamental research problem is to establish semi-analytical models that can predict the underwater dynamics of thin MFC cantilevers for different length-to-width aspect ratios. In-air analytical electroelastic dynamics of MFCs is therefore coupled with added mass and nonlinear hydrodynamic damping effects of fluid to describe the underwater electrohydroelastic dynamics in harvesting and actuation. To this end, passive plates of different aspect ratios are tested to extract and explore the repeatability of the inertia and drag coefficients in Morison’s equation. The focus is placed on the first two bending modes in this semi-empirical approach. In particular, electrode segmentation is studied for performance enhancement in the second bending mode. Additionally, nonlinear dependence of the output power density to aspect ratio is characterized theoretically and experimentally in the underwater base excitation problem. In the second part of this work, Ultrasonic Acoustic Energy Transfer via piezoelectric transduction is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Contactless energy transfer using acoustic excitation offers larger distances of power transmission as compared to well-studied inductive method. Various transmitter configurations (e. g. spherical, cylindrical, and focused) are explored for energy transfer to a piezoelectric receiver bar (operating in the longitudinal/thickness mode) that is shunted to a generalized resistive-reactive circuit. Fixed-free and free-free mechanical boundary conditions of the receiver are explored in detail. The resulting multiphysics analytical model framework is compared with finite-element simulations and experiments conducted in fluid (water and oil).

40|$|The {{first law}} and second law {{efficiencies}} are determined for {{a stainless steel}} closed-tube open rectangular cavity solar receiver. It {{is to be used}} in a small-scale solar thermal Brayton cycle using a micro-turbine with low compressor pressure ratios. There are many different variables at play to model the air temperature increase of the air running through such a receiver. These variables include concentrator shape, concentrator diameter, concentrator rim angle, concentrator reflectivity, concentrator optical error, solar tracking error, receiver aperture area, <b>receiver</b> <b>material,</b> effect of wind, receiver tube diameter, inlet temperature and mass flow rate through the receiver. All these variables are considered in this paper. The Brayton cycle requires very high receiver surface temperatures in order to be successful. These high temperatures, however, have many disadvantages in terms of heat loss from the receiver, especially radiation heat loss. With the help of ray-tracing software, SolTrace, and receiver modelling techniques, an optimum receiver-to-concentrator-area ratio of A 0 0. 0035 was found for a concentrator with 45 rim angle, 10 mrad optical error and 1 tracking error. A method to determine the temperature profile and net heat transfer rate {{along the length of the}} receiver tube is presented. Receiver efficiencies are shown in terms of mass flow rate, receiver tube diameter, pressure drop, maximum receiver surface temperature and inlet temperature of the working fluid. For a 4. 8 m diameter parabolic dish, the larger the receiver tube diameter and the smaller the mass flow rate through the receiver, the higher the receiver surface temperature and the less efficient the collector becomes. However, the smaller the receiver tube diameter, the higher the pressure drop through the tube and the smaller the second law efficiency. It was found that the receiver with larger tube diameter would perform better in a solar thermal Brayton cycle. An overall solar-toheat efficiency of between 45 % and 70 % is attainable for the solar collector using the open-cavity receiver.

40|$|Most of the {{deployed}} commercial line-focusing {{solar power}} plants with Parabolic Troughs (PTC) or Linear Fresnel (LF) solar collectors and Rankine power cycles use a Single Loop Solar Field (SF), Configuration 1 illustrated in Fig. 2, with synthetic oil as Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) [1, 2]. However, thermal oils maximum operating temperature should be below ~ 400 ºC for assuring no oil degradation, hence limiting the power cycle gross efficiency up to ~ 38 %. For overcoming this limitation Molten Salts (MS) as HTF in linear solar collectors (PTC and LF) were recently experimented in pilot facilities [3, 4]. Direct MS main drawbacks are the equipments and components material corrosion and the salts freezing temperature, requiring heat tracing to avoid any sald solidification, hence increasing the Solar Field (SF) capital investment cost and parasitic energy looses. Concentrated Solar Power plants (CSP) with Dual Loop SF are being studied since 2012 [5] for gaining the synergies between thermal oils and MS properties. In the Dual Loop SF the HTF in the primary loop is thermal oil (Dowtherm A) [6] for heating the Balance Of Plant (BOP) working fluid from ~ 300 ºC up to ~ 400 ºC, and a secondary loop with Solar Salt (60 % NaNO 3, 40 % KNO 3) as HTF, for boosting the working fluid temperature from ~ 400 ºC up to 550 ºC [7, 8, 9]. The CSP Dual Loop {{state of the art}} technology includes Rankine power cycles, the main innovation of this paper is the integration between Dual Loop SF and the supercritical Carbon Dioxide (s-CO 2) Brayton power cycles [10], see Configurations 2 and 3 illustrated in Fig. 3 a, Fig 3 b. A secondary innovation studied in this paper is the integration between thermal oil HTF (Dowtherm A) in linear solar collectors, a widely validated and mature technology, with the s-CO 2 Brayton power cycles. This technical solution is very cost competitive with carbon steel receiver pipes, low SF operating pressure, and no requiring any heat tracing. Two main conclusions are deducted from this researching study.

40|$|Direct Steam Generation (DSG) in Linear Fresnel (LF) solar {{collectors}} is being consolidated as a feasible technology for Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants. The competitiveness {{of this technology}} relies on the following main features: water as heat transfer fluid (HTF) in Solar Field (SF), obtaining high superheated steam temperatures and pressures at turbine inlet (500 ºC and 90 bar), no heat tracing required to avoid HTF freezing, no HTF degradation, no environmental impacts, any heat exchanger between SF and Balance Of Plant (BOP), and low cost installation and maintenance. Regarding to LF {{solar collectors}}, were recently developed {{as an alternative to}} Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) technology. The main advantages of LF are: the reduced collector manufacturing cost and maintenance, linear mirrors shapes versus parabolic mirror, fixed receiver pipes (no ball joints reducing leaking for high pressures), lower susceptibility to wind damages, and light supporting structures allowing reduced driving devices. Companies as Novatec, Areva, Solar Euromed, etc., are investing in LF DSG technology and constructing different pilot plants to demonstrate the benefits and feasibility of this solution for defined locations and conditions (Puerto Errado 1 and 2 in Murcia Spain, Lidellin Newcastle Australia, Kogran Creek in South West Queensland Australia, Kimberlina in Bakersfield California USA, Llo Solar in Pyrénées France,Dhursar in India,etc). There are several critical decisions that must be taken in order to obtain a compromise and optimization between plant performance, cost, and durability. Some of these decisions go through the SF design: proper thermodynamic operational parameters, <b>receiver</b> <b>material</b> selection for high pressures, phase separators and recirculation pumps number and location, pipes distribution {{to reduce the amount of}} tubes (reducing possible leaks points and transient time, etc.), etc. Attending to these aspects, the correct design parameters selection and its correct assessment are the main target for designing DSG LF power plants. For this purpose in the recent few years some commercial software tools were developed to simulatesolar thermal power plants, the most focused on LF DSG design are Thermoflex and System Advisor Model (SAM). Once the simulation tool is selected,it is made the study of the proposed SFconfiguration that constitutes the main innovation of this work, and also a comparison with one of the most typical state-of-the-art configuration. The transient analysis must be simulated with high detail level, mainly in the BOP during start up, shut down, stand by, and partial loads are crucial, to obtain the annual plant performance.

40|$|A {{promising}} and novel {{solar concentrator}} design has been thoroughly investigated and optimised. A prototype concentrator {{based on this}} novel geometry was validated using ray tracing techniques. This ray tracing demonstrated the comparative performance of this novel concentrator in regards to equivalent parabolic dishes. The effect of mirror surface normal errors on performance was established using Monte-Carlo based ray tracing code, which agreed well with the optical performance of this prototype which was determined experimentally. 	 A need for low-cost solar cookers to replace bio-mass worldwide was identified, and the concentrator design was then developed as a low-cost solar oven. Despite existing in some number, no current design is able to achieve high performance at low-cost. An industrial partner, Dytecna, was initially {{involved in the process}} of this development of the system as a solar cooker. In support of a field trial for the solar cooker developed with Dytecna, a detailed thermal model of the oven was developed. A low-cost lightmeter was constructed and calibrated in order to measure the direct normal irradiance during the field trial in Italy. Laboratory work provided baseline results for the heating of various thermal masses in the oven. The Italian field trials provided a wealth of feedback into the design of the system and many valuable results. The solar cooker was able to bring 0. 75 L of water to the boil in 33 minutes with an average heat throughput of 203 W. Important benchmark results and practical experience of several competing receiver materials was obtained; further lab testing provided more accurate measurements of the receivers' performances. The experiences of the Italian field trial were fed back into the design of a subsequent prototype, intended for a much larger field trial in Tanzania. Improvements in the hotplate, <b>receiver</b> <b>material,</b> and the oven were all incorporated into the design. Additionally, the structure of the solar cooker was redesigned to incorporate a low-cost wooden construction. Supporting work was conducted for the month long trial in which 8 solar cookers would be distributed to families in Tanzania. The field trial in Tanzania provided a wealth of user feedback into the design. At the same time the new solar cooker exceeded previously established performances in Italy. The new design was able to provide an average of 246 W of heat to 1 kg of water, which was brought to boiling point in 25 minutes. This represents a heating efficiency of 66 % compared to the incident solar flux on the hotplate. In response to findings during the Tanzanian trials, further laboratory work was conducted into establishing the reflectivities of low-cost candidate mirror materials. Throughout all phases of the project the design of the solar cooker was refined and improved with the goal of a solar cooker design that could reach price-point, performance, and usability standards which would ensure market success. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hot spots {{have been}} {{experimentally}} observed in porous materials in several applications as volumetric solar receivers. In this application, cold ambient air flows through a solid, which is heated by concentrated solar radiation. After that the hot porous material transfers {{the heat to}} the cold air flow. The heated air then transfers its heat to an air-water heat exchanger. The evaporated water drives a conventional steam turbine process. To obtain high efficiencies, a high absorptivity in the visible and near infrared range has to be combined with a high porosity of the volumetric solar receiver to create large surfaces for convective heat transfer from the solid absorber to the fluid. For the durability of the <b>receiver</b> <b>materials</b> it is of key importance to avoid the occurrence of hot spots. Following studies showed that these hot spots {{have been caused by}} flow instabilities, which generally may occur, if cold air flows through a heated porous material. This phenomenon is due to the temperature dependent viscosity properties of air. In a theoretical analysis it could be shown that heat conductivity as well as permeability properties of the porous materials have significant influence on the probability of the occurrence of flow instabilities. A numerical study has been performed to investigate the occurrence of instable flow in heated ceramic foam materials. In the simulations a constant heat flow of radiation, that is absorbed in a defined volume, and constant permeability coefficients are assumed. Boundary conditions {{similar to those of the}} 10 MW Solucar Solar project have been chosen. In a three dimensional, heterogeneous two phase heat transfer model it was possible to simulate local overheating of the porous structure. The parameters heat conductivity, turbulent permeability coefficient and radial dispersion coefficient have been varied systematically. Consequently, for a heat flux density of 1 MW/m 2 a parameter chart could be generated, showing the possible occurrence of “instable” or “stable” thermal and fluid mechanical behaviour. These numerical results are beneficial for the design of optimized <b>materials</b> for volumetric <b>receivers.</b> In order to be able to make use of these results, a precise knowledge of the mentioned quantities heat conductivity, turbulent permeability coefficient and radial dispersion coefficient is necessary.

The work {{comprised the}} following activities: 1. Investigations of direct coupling of concentrated radiation, {{with the emphasis on}} the development and testing of a semi-industrial prototype particle receiver. Also, the existing particle diagnosis systems were to be improved, and the measuring system HERMES II was to be enhanced for field applications. 2. Development and testing of semi-industrial volumetric receivers for electric power generation in tower focus power stations and dish gas turbines systems (VOBREC), and for solar methane reforming in tower focus systems (SCR). Further activities in this context comprised the development of secondary concentrators, investigations of the <b>receiver</b> <b>materials</b> used (absorber, window, insulation, supporting structures) and the development of mathematical models for the receivers used. 3. Investigation of solar chemical processes and development of solar-specific catalytic solar absorbers. Apart from final work on the ASTERIX project, also problems concerning the kinetics of the methane reforming process and the improvement of the catalytic absorber (optical and chemical characteristics) by different catalyst materials were investigated.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} a new concept of Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) for Concentrating Solar Plants (CSP) {{applications}} through fluidized bed. CSP plants with very high concentration (such as solar tower plant technology) offer good efficiencies because of high operating temperatures. CSP efficiency could be greatly increased through more efficient HTF. Molten salts, mineral oils, water and air {{have some of the}} following drawbacks: limited range of operating temperatures, corrosiveness, high pressure, low energy storage capacity and toxicity. To replace classical HTF, Dense Particle Suspension (DPS) fluidized with air (approximately 40 % of solid) is proposed. DPS has a volume heat capacity similar to those of liquid HTF, does not need pressurization, is safe, inert and is only limited by the maximal working temperature of the <b>receiver</b> <b>material</b> (1100 K), thus opening new opportunities for high efficiency thermodynamic cycles. This work is the hydrodynamic study of a gassolid dense suspension upward flow at ambient temperature, in a vertical 2 ‐tube bundle of small diameter tubes, which have their bottom immersed in a slightly pressurized fluidized bed (pressure approximately equal to the ratio of the solid weight in a tube over its cross section area). This type of flow is yet implemented in the field of hyper‐dense phase vertical conveying of powders and it is currently under development for solar receivers using dense suspensions of particles as heat transfer and storage medium. This application was patented by Flamant and Hemati in 2010 (France 1058565 (2010) CNRS/INP Toulouse, G. Flamant, H. Hemati; PCT Extension, No. WO 2012 / 052661 A 2), and its development is funded by the European Commission. In this technological breakthrough, the concentrated solar energy is collected, carried and stored directly by the fine particles flowing upward, with a suspension void fraction close to that of a dense fluidized bed. Contrary to circulating fluidized bed “risers”, it offers a good contact area between the wall and the particles. The important hydrodynamic and thermal coupling required a step‐by‐step approach. Ambient flows had to be understood and controlled first. Thus a 2 ‐pass “cold” mock‐up, each pass composed of two vertical parallel tubes, was built. Pressure drop, solid weight and helium volume fraction measurements demonstrated the ability to handle a regular solid upward flow (imperative here), with solid flow rates from 20 to 130 kg/h, with void fractions from 0. 57 to 0. 63 and with an even distribution of the solid flow rate between the tubes. Moreover, the governing parameters of this flow were established as: the solid feeding flow rate, the fluidization velocity, the solid holdup, the freeboard pressure and the aeration velocity. The secondary air injection, also called “aeration”, is the most important parameter for the stability and the even distribution of the total solid flow rate in the tubes. The 1 D modelling of the suspension flow in the tubes was also performed in the flow direction. The flow structure was described using the bubble‐emulsion model formalism, and by adding the solid entrainment by the bubble wake. Predictions of the model are compared with the experimental measurements of driving pressure and axial pressure profile along the tubes...|$|E

40|$|Object A {{new method}} for 3 D {{localization}} of N fiducial markers from 1 D projections is presented and analysed. It applies to semi-active markers and active markers using a single <b>receiver</b> channel. <b>Materials</b> and methods The novel algorithm computes candidate points using peaks in three optimally selected projections and removes fictitious points by verifying detec-ted peaks in additional projections. Computational com-plexity was significantly reduced by avoiding cluster analysis, while higher accuracy {{was achieved by}} using opti-mal projections and by applying Gaussian interpolation in peak detection. Computational time, accuracy and robustness were analysed through Monte Carlo simulations and experi-ments. The method was employed in a prototype MRI guided prostate biopsy system and used in preclinical experiments. Results The computational time for 6 markers was better than 2 ms, an improvement of up to 100 times, compared to the method by Flask et al. (J Magn Reson Imaging 14 (5) : 617 – 627, 2001). Experimental maximum localiza-tion error was lower than 0. 3 mm; standard deviation was 0. 06 mm. Targeting error was about 1 mm. Tracking update rate was about 10 Hz. Conclusion The proposed method is particularly suitable in systems requiring any of the following: high frame rate, tracking of three or more markers, data filtering or interleaving...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Technology {{development}} and new grades of alloys creation put before construction materials {{the number of}} requirements in range of durability and reliability of created constructions. <b>Receivers</b> expect <b>materials</b> with high strength properties, low production cost of the finished product, availability, corrosion resistance and low specific gravity. So {{the specific needs of}} customers mean that studies are constantly associated with the exploration of new materials and technologies that could meet made requirements [1, 2, 3]. In large scale this demand is met through the use of non-ferrous metals and their alloys. Selection of appropriate manufacturing techniques and the use of heat treatment procedures allow to obtain materials with better mechanical properties. Here the leading role has the aluminium and its alloys. Due to specific mechanical properties aluminium based materials are used in almost each field of industry. In aircraft industry they are used for the manufacture of fuselage elements in automobile industry the light alloys are used to make cylinder blocks, and other elements of internal combustion engines. In the construction industry they are used to manufacture windows and doors, as well as beautiful self-supporting lightweight facades. While the aluminium alloy products such as films or cans are also used in the food industry. The combination of physico-chemical an...|$|R
40|$|This chapter reports {{concepts}} and realizations of integrated optical circuits, i. e., {{the concept of}} optical waves which are traveling through planar circuits and confined {{in one or two}} directions. Integrated optical components such as array waveguide gratings (AWGs) {{turned out to be a}} key enabler for modern broadband optical communications based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). The requirements on integrated optical circuits range from passive functions such as beam splitters and optical filters over slow and fast optical switches to active transmitters and <b>receivers.</b> The <b>material</b> systems include glasses, polymers, LiNbO 3, silicon, and III-V semiconductors. Weakly guiding integrated optical circuits, the traditional approach exhibiting waveguiding properties close to those of standard single-mode fibers (SSMF), offer ease of fabrication through single-mode field diameters of several wavelengths and large radii of curvature. Such components are based on a low refractive index contrast between the waveguide and its environment. Modern approaches aim at increasingly compact circuits to meet the system-driven requirements, mainly cost and footprint. They are based on waveguides with high refractive index contrast or photonic crystal waveguides and submicron waveguide cross-sections, e. g., on silicon, which exhibit single-mode field diameters much smaller than the wavelength and thus extremely small radii of curvature...|$|R

ESTAR is an instrument concept for {{the measurement of}} soil moisture from space using synthetic aperture radiometry. The thermal design goal is to minimize the orbital temperature variation of the radiometer <b>receivers</b> using established <b>materials</b> and techniques. Two design approaches have been investigated; the first uses the waveguide as a heat sink, and the second uses a nadir facing radiator on the receiver assembly. The second approach minimizes the receiver's impact on the waveguide temperatures.
