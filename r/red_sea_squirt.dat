5000|$|Aplousobranchia is a {{suborder}} of <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> in {{the class}} Ascidiacea. They are colonial animals, and are distinguished from other <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> {{by the presence of}} relatively simple pharyngeal baskets. This provides the etymology of their name: in ancient greek, [...] means [...] "simple". The posterior part of the abdomen contains the heart and gonads, and is typically larger than in other <b>sea</b> <b>squirts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The stalked <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> (Styela clava), {{also known}} as the club <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> club tunicate, Asian tunicate, {{leathery}} <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> or rough <b>sea</b> <b>squirt,</b> is a solitary, hermaphroditic, ascidian tunicate that is native to the Pacific coast of Asia, ranging from the Sea of Okhotsk to Japan, Korea and northeast China. It has been introduced widely around the world such as off Australia, New Zealand, both coasts of North America, and Europe. It is considered invasive outside the native range, as adults lack natural predators, can outcompete native animals, feed on their planktonic larvae, and foul fishing gear and boats. In the most extreme cases, it can reach densities of up to 1,500 per square meter (140 per square foot).|$|R

50|$|Over {{the last}} few hundred years, most of the world's harbors have been invaded by {{non-native}} <b>sea</b> <b>squirts</b> that have clung to ship hulls or to introduced organisms such as oysters and seaweed. Several factors, including quick attainment of sexual maturity, tolerance {{of a wide range}} of environments, and a lack of predators, allow <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> populations to grow rapidly. Unwanted populations on docks, ship hulls, and farmed shellfish cause significant economic problems, and <b>sea</b> <b>squirt</b> invasions have disrupted the ecosystem of several natural sub-tidal areas by smothering native animal species.|$|R
