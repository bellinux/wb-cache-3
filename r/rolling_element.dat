VA is {{a key component of}} a Condition Monitoring (CM) program, and {{is often referred to as}} Predictive Maintenance (PdM). Most commonly VA is used to detect faults in rotating equipment (Fans, Motors, Pumps, and Gearboxes etc.) such as Unbalance, Misalignment, <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing faults and resonance conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a bearing {{is how the}} distance between the parts which are separated by the bearing varies with applied load. With <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings {{this is due to the}} strain of the ball and race. With fluid bearings it is due to how the pressure of the fluid varies with the gap (when correctly loaded, fluid bearings are typically stiffer than <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings).|$|E
50|$|Tapered roller {{bearings}} are <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings that can support axial forces (i.e., {{they are good}} thrust bearings) as well as radial forces.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of making <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> by forming low mass cores having either hollow centers or being {{of a low}} mass material.

50|$|A {{sideways}} torque on a {{radial bearing}} also applies {{pressure to the}} cage that holds the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> at equal distances, due to the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> trying to all slide together {{at the location of}} highest sideways torque. If the cage collapses or breaks apart, the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> group together, the inner ring loses support, and may pop out of the center.|$|R
40|$|Instrument for {{detecting}} defects in <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> of bearings is described. Detection depends on {{rate at which}} <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> impact defect and establishes envelope amplitude of ball resonant frequency. Block diagram of instrument is provided and results obtained in conducting tests are reported...|$|R
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} can be {{made with}} a lower NRRO (non repeatable run out) than a ball or <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing. This can be critical in modern hard disk drive and ultra precision spindles.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} recovered {{example of}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing is a wooden ball bearing supporting a rotating table from {{the remains of the}} Roman Nemi ships in Lake Nemi, Italy. The wrecks were dated to 40 BC.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{there is}} {{considerable}} speed range overlap between bearing types. Plain bearings typically handle only lower speeds, <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearings are faster, followed by fluid bearings and finally magnetic bearings which are limited ultimately by centripetal force overcoming material strength.|$|E

50|$|A {{composite}} bearing is used {{to maintain}} separation and control friction between two moving parts. The distinguishing characteristic of a composite bearing is that the bearing is made {{from a combination of}} materials such as a resin reinforced with fibre and this may also include friction reducing lubricants and ingredients. A composite bearing is not simply a PTFE bearing in a carrier of another material, this is a PTFE bearing in a carrier. The plain composite bearing can be lighter than a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing but this is not always a feature as some composites are extremely dense which results in lower porosity. Another distinctive feature of the composite bearing is its lightweight design - it can be one-tenth the weight of the traditional <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing. No heavy metals are used in its manufacture.|$|E

5000|$|Roller bearing, {{in which}} the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> are {{cylindrical}} rollers ...|$|R
50|$|A rolling-element bearing, {{also known}} as a rolling bearing, is a bearing which carries a load by placing <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> (such as balls or rollers) between two bearing rings called races. The {{relative}} motion of the races causes the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> to roll with very little rolling resistance and with little sliding.|$|R
50|$|Also if {{a bearing}} is not rotating, {{oscillating}} {{forces on the}} bearing can cause impact damage to the bearing race or the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> known as brinelling. A second lesser form called false brinelling occurs if the bearing only rotates across a short arc and pushes lubricant out away from the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> {{rotary bearing}} uses a shaft {{in a much}} larger hole, and {{cylinders}} called [...] "rollers" [...] tightly fill {{the space between the}} shaft and hole. As the shaft turns, each roller acts as the logs in the above example. However, since the bearing is round, the rollers never fall out from under the load.|$|E
50|$|Composite {{bearings}} {{are designed}} with a self-lubricating polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) liner with a laminated metal backing. The PTFE liner offers consistent, controlled friction as well as durability whilst the metal backing ensures the composite bearing is robust and capable of withstanding high loads and stresses throughout its long life. Its design also makes it lightweight-one tenth {{the weight of a}} traditional <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing.|$|E

40|$|The {{press fitting}} of rolling bearings, the {{centrifugal}} {{expansion of the}} spindle and inner ring, and the thermal expansion of <b>rolling</b> bearing assembly <b>elements</b> modify the ball and races clearance, creating the hoop-stress. Consequently, the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> and races contact loads and contact angles change. At high speed, beside the centrifugal forces acting on the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> the gyroscopic moment must be considered. The error introduced by neglecting the hoop-stress and the gyroscopic moment acting on balls in the computing of ball and races contact angles and contact loads is estimated for a steel {{angular contact ball bearing}} from 7206 C series...|$|R

The Winsted Precision Ball Company was founded in 1949 with {{the sole purpose of}} manufacturing high-precision balls for the use in miniature precision ball bearings. Acquired by Barden Corporation in the 1960s, WPBC is not a separate legal entity, but a department of the Barden Corporationâ€™s Danbury location.

50|$|Mostly large <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing {{are used}} as pitch bearings. The bearing is {{subjected}} to high bending moments, radial and axial loads in both directions. Therefore, the rolling elements for {{state of the art}} wind turbines are ball bearings, which are used in a double rowed four-point contact. This means each raceway carries on two points, and in sum four points are carrying. Other possible options are different arrangements of the rolling elements or multirow cylindrical roller bearings. Pitch bearing of modern wind turbines can reach diameters of more than 4 meters.|$|E
50|$|Spherical {{bearings}} {{can be of}} a hydrostatic or mechanical construction. A {{spherical bearing}} by itself consists of an outer ring {{and an inner ring}} and a locking feature that makes the inner ring captive within the outer ring in the axial direction only. The outer surface of the inner ring and the inner surface of the outer ring are spherical (or more correctly, toroidal) and are collectively considered the raceway and they slide against each other, either with a lubricant, a maintenance-free (typically polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE) based liner, or they incorporate a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> such as a race of ball-bearings, allowing lower friction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of a variable- {{friction}} floor device for clinical and rehabilitation applications. Several designs based on <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> were proposed and investigated. Coefficients of static friction were measured to compare capabilities of floor tiles made of ball transfer units or covered with PTFE. The measurements showed that while a device based on <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> is limited in supported footwear and in simulating heel strike, and can lead to a complex friction-variation system, it can simulate friction coefficients as low as ice...|$|R
40|$|The {{residual}} stress field of HIPed Si 3 N 4 <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> were studied. Two kinds of HIPed Si 3 N 4 ball blanks self-finished at different nominal lapping loads ranging from 1. 3 to 10. 87 kgf/ball and four kinds of commercially finished 1 / 2 in (12. 7 mm) HIPed Si 3 N 4 balls before, {{during and after}} RCF tests were investigated. The experimental results showed that in the finishing process of HIPed Si 3 N 4 <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b> the surface and subsurface compressive {{residual stress}} induced {{is proportional to the}} lapping load applied. There was initially a high compressive residual stress layer on the HIPed Si 3 N 4 ball blanks and this layer is mostly removed during the finishing process. During the rolling contact fatigue process of HIPed Si 3 N 4 <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> the residual stresses on the rolling track will change dramatically as RCF proceeds...|$|R
5000|$|Slewing {{bearings}} {{often use}} {{two rows of}} <b>rolling</b> <b>elements.</b> They often use three race elements, such as an inner ring and two outer ring [...] "halves" [...] that clamp together axially.|$|R
50|$|There {{is still}} a room for {{discussion}} whether the <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> excites the natural frequencies of bearing component when it passes the fault on the outer race. Hence we need to identify the bearing outer race natural frequency and its harmonics. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a FFT analysis. The natural frequencies of a <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3 kHz. Therefore, {{in order to use}} the bearing component resonance bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range accelerometer should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired. A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the outer race. The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a bearing outer race fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults waveform, spectrum and envelope techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency demodulation is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect bearing fault characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of resonance, as {{it may or may not}} contain fault frequency components.|$|E
5000|$|Oil mist {{lubrication}} oils {{are applied to}} <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> (antifriction) bearings as an oil mist. Neither oil rings nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header). The point of origin is usually a mixing valve (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pillow block}} usually {{refers to a}} housing with an {{included}} anti-friction bearing. A pillow block refers to any mounted bearing wherein the mounted shaft is in a parallel plane to the mounting surface, and perpendicular to the center line of the mounting holes, as contrasted with various types of flange blocks or flange units. A pillow block may contain a bearing with one of several types of rolling elements, including ball, cylindrical roller, spherical roller, tapered roller, or metallic or synthetic bushing. The type of <b>rolling</b> <b>element</b> defines the type of pillow block. These differ from [...] "plumber blocks" [...] which are bearing housings supplied without any bearings and are usually meant for higher load ratings and a separately installed bearing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A simplified, plane {{model for}} {{determination}} of resisting torques {{of the rolling}} bearing cage motion of low speed kinematic pairs is presented. The considerations are devoted to an arbitrary character of the point contact of a rolling elementâ€“cage pairs lying in a plane which is crossing the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> in their geometrical centre.

50|$|If a {{sideways}} torque {{is applied to}} a deep groove radial bearing, an uneven force {{in the shape of}} an ellipse is applied on the outer ring by the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements,</b> concentrating in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} outer ring. If the outer ring is not strong enough, or if it is not sufficiently braced by the supporting structure, the outer ring will deform into an oval shape from the sideways torque stress, until the gap is large enough for the <b>rolling</b> <b>elements</b> to escape. The inner ring then pops out and the bearing structurally collapses.|$|R
