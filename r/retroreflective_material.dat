"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 20 - 21) This {{study examined}} the potential effects of the spectral power distributions of mercury-free high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps on discomfort glare for oncoming drivers and on color rendering of <b>retroreflective</b> traffic <b>materials.</b> In both cases, the effects of mercury-free HID light sources were compared to the changes in these properties that occurred when the tungsten-halogen light sources were replaced with traditional (mercury containing) HID light sources.

The sheeting consists of retroreflective glass beads, microprisms, or encapsulated lenses sealed onto a fabric or plastic substrate. Many different colors and degrees of reflection intensity are provided by numerous manufacturers for various applications.

50|$|The {{standard}} specifies {{three classes}} {{of activities and}} the minimum quantity of fluorescent and <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material</b> to be worn in each class. In Class 1 activities there is a relatively low hazard from slow-moving vehicles, for example, in a parking lot. Garments must have retroreflective strips 1 inch wide and a minimum of 217 square inches of fluorescent material. Class 2 activities take place in proximity to vehicles moving up to 25 miles per hour, for example, railway workers or school crossing guards. The standard requires reflective bands of greater width and 755 square inches of conspicuously colored fabric. Class 3 activities take place near traffic moving faster than 25 miles per hour, for example, highway construction. The standard requires at least 1240 square inches of fluorescent fabric, and two-inch retrorefector bands. Only very large vests have enough area to meet this standard, so full sleeves may be required. A further class of garment is Class E high visibility pants, which, {{in conjunction with a}} Class 2 or Class 3 vest, are recommended by the standard for Class 3 activities.|$|E

"Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 18 - 19) Because {{of rapid}} {{improvements in the}} light output of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), serious consideration is being given to using LEDs as light sources for headlamps. This study examined the potential effects of LEDs on discomfort glare for oncoming drivers and on color rendering of <b>retroreflective</b> traffic <b>materials.</b> In both cases, the effects of LED light sources were compared to the changes in these properties that occurred when the traditional tungsten-halogen light sources were replaced with high-intensity discharge (HID) light sources. Specifically, the effect on discomfort glare was estimated by comparing the chromaticities of 7 LED light sources (considered for use in headlamps) with the chromaticities of the light sources from 17 actual HID headlamps. Analogously, the effects on color rendering were estimated by comparing the chromaticities of 46 <b>retroreflective</b> <b>materials</b> when illuminated by the LED light sources with the chromaticities of the same materials when illuminated by the HID light sources. The main findings concerning the range of LEDs that are currently being considered for use in headlamps are as follows: (1) Headlamps using LEDs with the chromaticities examined here are predicted to lead to more discomfort glare than the current HID headlamps, and substantially more discomfort than tungsten-halogen headlamps. Keeping the correlated color temperature as low as practicable is likely to minimize the problem. However, the relationship between spectral power distribution and discomfort glare is not fully understood, and further research on this issue would be valuable.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of ultrabright <b>retroreflective</b> <b>materials</b> {{may provide the}} opportunity to develop highway signs with improved conspicuity- especially when viewed in highly complex (i. e., ”cluttered”) driving environments. In order to investigate this possibility, the glance conspicuity of briefly presented highway signs was examined as a function of sign brightness (bright vs. ultrabright), background scene complexity (low, moderate, high) and age of observer (young vs. old). Glance conspicuity- measured in terms of both reaction time and accuracy- was found to improve as a function of increased sign brightness when viewed against high complexity (but not low complexity) backgrounds. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for improved design of traffic control devices...|$|R
50|$|The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices {{requires}} that signs be either illuminated or made with <b>retroreflective</b> sheeting <b>materials,</b> and though most {{signs in the}} U.S. are made with <b>retroreflective</b> sheeting <b>materials,</b> they degrade over time.

The MUTCD now {{requires that}} agencies maintain traffic signs to a set of minimum levels but provide a variety of maintenance methods that agencies can use for compliance. The minimum retroreflectivity requirements do not imply that an agency must measure every sign. Rather, the new MUTCD language describes methods that agencies can use to maintain traffic sign retroreflectivity at or above the minimum levels.|$|R
40|$|A {{nighttime}} {{field study}} was conducted to assess the effects of <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material</b> area, distribution, and color on judgments of conspicuity. Participants, seated in a stationary vehicle, took part in a pairwise comparison of the stimuli. The independent variables included retroreflective power, area and distribution of the <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material,</b> color of the <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material,</b> participant age, and participant gender. The results indicate that color (white, fluorescent yellow-green, and fluorescent red-orange) was a significant factor in the judgment of conspicuity, as might be predicted from the Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect. In addition, color interacted with the distribution of material at the high level of retroreflective power. The area of the <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material</b> was also significant. The present study, in agreement with a number of previous studies, indicates that color influences the conspicuity of retroreflective stimuli, but that the results are not always in agreement with color correction factors prescribed in ASTM E 1501. The discrepancy between empirically derived color correction factors seems to be attributable to an interaction of the stimulus size (subtended angle) and color, which previous studies have not extensively examined. To a lesser degree, the retroreflective power of a material also appears to influence conspicuity. While the ASTM correction factors may be appropriate for intermediate subtended solid angles, particularly for nonsaturated colors, smaller correction factors appear appropriate for markings subtending small angles (approaching point sources), and larger factors for larger subtended angles of saturated stimuli...|$|E

The use of SCBA can help to prevent the direct inhalation of these gases (Johnson [1976]; Burgess et al. [1977]; Selkirk et al. [2004]). Pressurised air, oxygen (O 2) enriched air or pure O 2 {{is used in the}} SCBA (Louhevaara et al. [1985]). Although the fire-fighters are benefitted with the SCBA, they may be over burdened and further stressed depending on the material used, design and model of the SCBA (Bruce-Low et al.

40|$|A static {{field study}} was conducted, both {{during the day}} and at night, to examine the effect that color {{contrast}} within a safety vest has on noticeability. Fluorescent orange and yellow fabrics were matched with orange, yellow, silver, or white retroreflective trim to appear similar to a safety vest. The method of paired comparisons was used to develop a linear scale of how noticeable the various color combinations appeared under cluttered and uncluttered viewing conditions. The results indicate that color contrast within the safety vest, as well as relative to the environmental surround, affects judgments of noticeability. However, in the nighttime condition color contrast was not an identifiable attribute, as all the <b>retroreflective</b> <b>materials</b> used appeared white when illuminated. In the nighttime condition, the luminance of the retroreflective trim accounted for almost all {{of the variance in the}} noticeability judgments. The results of this study suggest that a design for safety apparel that includes a combination of fluorescent yellow and fluorescent orange fabrics (providing color contrast for the daytime) with silver/white micro-prismatic retroreflective trim (proving high luminance for nighttime) is likely to be the most noticeable combination in both daytime and nighttime conditions...|$|R

Curves may present a challenging situation during adverse conditions or to inattentive drivers. Chevron signs provide advanced warning and positive guidance throughout the curve. Some agencies place supplemental <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material</b> on sign posts to enhance the signs? conspicuity and visibility. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine any incremental benefits in vehicle speed and lateral lane position when <b>retroreflective</b> <b>material</b> was applied to Chevron sign posts (ChevFull). This study analyzed three separate evaluation scenarios in a before, after, and after-after experimental design. There was an existing Baseline evaluation with no vertical delineation, a standard Chevron evaluation, and an experimental ChevFull treatment evaluation. Data collection measured vehicle speed and lateral position data at the point of curvature and mid-point on two separate curves. Findings showed that both Chevrons and the ChevFull treatment moved vehicles away from oncoming traffic by about 15 inches. Overall, there was little difference between the lateral position findings of the two Chevron treatment scenarios. Chevrons achieved a 1. 28 MPH reduction in mean vehicle speed from the Baseline evaluation and the ChevFull treatment obtained a 2. 20 MPH reduction. The findings determined that the benefits of the ChevFull treatment were not substantial. The author recommends that the MUTCD should continue to present the ChevFull treatment as an optional delineation tool.

This {{is a result of the}} flooding of the marking optics, thereby reducing retroreflectivity. Several technologies are available to improve wet marking performance. In this project, six technologies were tested using both standard measurement methods and participant evaluations. The results show that two of the marking technologies, raised retroreflective markers and wet retroreflective tape, outperformed the group under all conditions. These markings were also highly accepted by the participants. The results also show that the standard paint and glass beads technology is the worst performing and the least desirable of those evaluated. A comparison of the ASTM retroreflectivity measurement methods and the measured luminance results also indicates that the methods are suitable for the conditions used in the evaluation; however, possible additions and corrections to the methods are outlined in this report.
