5|$|This {{plant was}} {{introduced}} to North America simultaneously by the French colonists in Canada and the British in the Thirteen Colonies {{for use as a}} <b>root</b> <b>vegetable,</b> but in the mid-19th century, it was replaced as the main source of starch by the potato and consequently was less widely cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a <b>root</b> <b>vegetable,</b> usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
5|$|When {{they were}} first cultivated, carrots were grown for their {{aromatic}} leaves and seeds rather than their roots. Carrot seeds {{have been found in}} Switzerland and Southern Germany dating back to 2000–3000 BC. Some close relatives of the carrot are still grown for their leaves and seeds, such as parsley, cilantro, coriander, fennel, anise, dill and cumin. The first mention of the root in classical sources is from the 1st century; the Romans ate a <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> called pastinaca, which may have been either the carrot or the closely related parsnip.|$|E
50|$|Among the <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> {{are also}} onions and garlics which many Brahmin {{families}} refrain from considering them Tamasik. Though like other <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> onions and garlics also have many medicinal values. People following Jainism also refrain from <b>root</b> <b>vegetables.</b>|$|R

[...] <b>Root</b> <b>vegetables</b> are cultivated on land cleared by slash-and-burn farming. After {{the introduction of}} the sweet potato roughly 150 years ago, food production increased, as the crop could be grown in harsher conditions than existing <b>root</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Around the same time, the Fore began domesticating pigs, replacing the need to hunt wild ones. The sweet potato not only became a staple food, but was used as feed for domesticated pigs.|$|R

5|$|The parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is a <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> {{closely related}} to the carrot and parsley. It is a {{biennial}} plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh; and left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. By this time, the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible. The seeds are pale brown, flat, and winged.|$|E
5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, <b>root</b> <b>vegetable,</b> berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E
5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an edible <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> of the Brassicaceae {{family that}} was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and {{consumed}} throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for sprouting.|$|E

5|$|As a Northern Igbo city, Enugu shares {{cultural}} traits {{with its}} neighbouring towns. Two important Igbo traditional festivals {{take place in}} Enugu annually; the Mmanwu festival and the New yam festival. The Mmanwu festival takes place in November and features various types of masquerades that each have a name. This festival is held at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium as a parade of carnival-like masquerades that are accompanied by music and it {{is supported by the}} Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The second important Igbo festival, the New yam festival known as 'iwa ji', is held between August and October marking the harvesting and feasting of the new yam. The yam is a <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> that is the staple crop and a cultural symbol for the Igbo people. Recently created festivals include the Enugu Festival of Arts which is managed by the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture. The festival highlights African culture and traditions and it is here that the Enugu Council of Arts and Culture included the Mmanwu parade as part of the events. The Enugu Festival of Arts was started in 1986; it has modernised the Mmanwu festival by transferring it from its traditional village surroundings to the urban setting of Enugu. Diana, Princess of Wales was a notable spectator of Enugu's cultural shows when she visited the city in 1990.|$|E

25|$|Foods like seitan, tofu skin, meat {{alternatives}} {{made from}} seaweeds, <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> starch and, tofu, originate in China and became popularized {{because so many}} people periodically abstain from meat.

This type of parsley {{produces}} much thicker roots than types cultivated for their leaves. Although seldom used in Britain and the United States, root parsley {{is common in}} central and eastern European cuisine, where it is used in soups and stews, or simply eaten raw, as a snack (similar to carrots).|$|E
25|$|Beta vulgaris (beet) is a plant {{which is}} {{included}} in Betoideae subfamily in the Amaranthaceae family. It is the economically most important crop of the large order Caryophyllales. It has several cultivar groups: the sugar beet, of greatest importance to produce table sugar; the <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> known as the beetroot or garden beet; the leaf vegetables chard and spinach beet; and mangelwurzel, which is a fodder crop. Three subspecies are typically recognised. All cultivars fall into the subspecies Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris. The wild ancestor of the cultivated beets is the sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima).|$|E
25|$|Taro was {{consumed}} by the early Romans {{in much the same}} way the potato is today. They called this <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> colocasia. The Roman cookbook Apicius mentions several methods for preparing taro, including boiling, preparing with sauces, and cooking with meat or fowl. After the fall of the Roman Empire the use of taro dwindled in Europe. This was largely due to the decline of trade and commerce with Egypt, previously controlled by Rome. It is still important to note the Taro because when the Spanish and Portuguese sailed to the new world, they brought taro along with them. Taro has remained popular in the Canary Islands. Recently there has been renewed interest in exotic foods and consumption is increasing.|$|E
