40|$|In {{its recent}} {{decision}} in United States v. Apex Oil, Inc., the Seventh Circuit considered whether an injunction under an environmental statute, even one that requires significant expenditures {{on the part}} of the debtor, could ever be a 2 ̆ 2 <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> 2 ̆ 2 under the Bankruptcy Code, which would allow the claim to be discharged in the bankruptcy. The Seventh Circuit answered in the negative. Since the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Ohio v. Kovacs, the federal circuits have disagreed on the discrete issue of when a claim arises for purposes of bankruptcy with respect to clean-up injunctions under environmental laws. The Sixth Circuit has suggested that all money obligations of the debtor are claims under the Code, while the Third Circuit and others distinguish claims based on whether they may be reduced to money judgments. Because the environmental statute in Apex does not authorize any form of monetary relief, the Seventh Circuit concluded that that the clean-up order at issue could not be deemed a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment.</b> In light of the current circuit split, this Note analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the circuits 2 ̆ 7 various applications of section 105 (B) of the Bankruptcy Code. It concludes that while the Seventh Circuit correctly determined that a clean-up injunction requiring money expenditures is not a claim under the Code, equitable concerns remain in the wake of the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Accordingly, this Note suggests that courts should adopt the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s analysis, but with the caveat that bankrupt debtors may not receive the fabled 2 ̆ 2 fresh start 2 ̆ 2 in bankruptcy as a result...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to clarify the problematics of the {{creation}} of a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>payment</b> of insurance claim in range of personal insurance. The thesis is divided into six chapters in accordance with the topics. In order to introduce the problematics, there are historical roots of insurance in the world as well as of insurance in the area of Bohemia and Moravia stated. The second chapter deals with current legal regulation of personal insurance, with the focus on two-legal regime of the insurance contract. The crucial part of this thesis are chapters three, four and five, where conditions, presumptions and factors, which affect the creation of a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>payment</b> of insurance claim, are thoroughly dealt with. In the third chapter, there are basic conditions {{of the creation of}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>payment</b> of insurance claim, such as the existence of insurance contract, the occurance of insurance event and the absence of exclusions analyzed. The fourth chapter mentions factors that influence the creation of a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the <b>payment</b> of insurance claim itself, and these are common with all kinds of insurance, such as for instance the inception of insurance, inception of insurance protection, insurance payment, exclusion, demand of a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> insurance claim by the authorised person, reasons for rejection of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A debtor {{can give}} a {{security}} interest in collateral only when, among other things, the debtor has rights in that collateral. This rule becomes complicated when a holder of a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license wishes to grant a security interest in the proceeds it may receive from selling that license in the future. The question of when an FCC licensee acquires the right to receive revenues {{from the sale of}} its license is a controversial one, {{due to the fact that}} any sale of an FCC license cannot occur until there is (1) a contract for sale and (2) approval from the FCC. The existence of contingencies in future rights to payment, however, is not a new phenomenon. In several industries, acquisition of the item from which the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> stems triggers this right—in the FCC context, this right arises upon acquisition of the FCC license itself. This Note argues that, given the similarities between the FCC licensing scheme and these other industries, and the presence of only inconsequential differences, there is no reason to treat FCC licensing differently. As such, the right to receive revenues from the sale of an FCC license should be found to exist upon acquisition of the FCC license, and should not depend on whether the two contingencies required for sale have occurred...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a concursus creditorum in insolvency and the rectification of an agreement: Nedbank Ltd v Chance Brothers 2008 4 SA 209 (D) The issue {{discussed in this article}} deals with the legal position in the case where, prior to sequestration or liquidation, an insolvent and another party enter into an agreement in terms of which the other party becomes a creditor of the insolvent estate. Of particular importance is the situation where, after sequestration or liquidation, the other party realises that the written agreement does not correctly reflect the terms initially agreed upon by the parties and consequently applies for the rectification of the agreement. The effect of such rectification order will place the party concerned in a stronger position in relation to the other creditors. In Nedbank Ltd v Chance Brothers the court refused such an application. The court held that the rectification of the agreement would cause Nedbank to be entitled to a much larger amount than the amount specified in the written agreement. The core question is whether a court order to rectify an agreement would result in the creation of new rights or whether it is simply an acknowledgement of existing rights. There is a clear difference between these two situations. The application is one for the rectification of an agreement. The continued validity of the agreement during sequestration or liquidation will in any event depend on the provisions of the law of insolvency. The exact rights of the creditor at the time of liquidation should be fully investigated. In the case under discussion the debtor was at all relevant times in debt to the creditor. The common intention of the parties was that this <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> was preferential. Admittedly, after rectification of the agreement the creditor would have been in a more preferential position owing to the terms of the original agreement. If the original agreement is, however, unreasonable and unfair, it should be brought into question. This can be done by way of impeachable transactions under the insolvency law...|$|E
40|$|It is in {{the area}} of the {{regulation}} of a company's share capital and distributions to shareholders that the inherent conflict between creditors and shareholders, and the fragile balance among shareholders internally, intersect. The share capital of a company underlies its corporate structure and represents not only its initial own funds from which creditors can be paid, but also the relative equity interests of the shareholders. The balance between shareholders can be disturbed by capital reorganisations through increase, reduction or variation of share capital or through disproportionate contributions by, or distributions to, shareholders. Share repurchases are particularly risky in this regard. Creditor interests are affected when their prior <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> is endangered by distributions to shareholders. This study analyses the South African Law relating to share capital and distributions against the background of a comparative study of the laws of England, New Zealand, Delaware and California, as well as the provisions of the American Model Business Corporations Act. Two main approaches to creditor protection are evident. The capital maintenance doctrine, which is followed in England and Delaware, protects creditors by emphasising the notional share capital of the company as a limit on distributions. In contrast, the solvency and liquidity approach focuses on the net assets of the company and on its ability to pay its debts. New Zealand, California and the Model Business Corporations Act represent this approach. Regulatory responses to shareholder protection range from insistence on compliance with procedural requirements to minimal statutory intervention in the internal affairs of companies, instead relying on general principles of fairness and good faith. There is little correlation between a particular system's approach to creditor protection on the one hand, and to shareholder protection on the other. England, New Zealand and South Africa prescribe specific formalities, while the American approach is more relaxed. South Africa is a hybrid system. Its transition from capital maintenance to solvency and liquidity has been incomplete and its protection of equity interests is relatively unsophisticated. A number of recommendations are made for an effective and coherent approach that will safeguard the interests of creditors and shareholders alike. School: LawLL. D...|$|E

40|$|Subordination {{agreements}} among creditors {{are common}} in financial transactions. When a company seeks additional credit, the new lender may insist on an agreement with existing creditors which provides that their <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> will be subordinated to the full payment of the new loan. The existing creditors {{may be willing to}} sign such an agreement for the purpose of encouraging the new lender to provide the borrower with liquidity needed to continue the business as a profitable venture, thereby increasing the likelihood that the borrower will meet all future financial obligations. In addition, contractual subordination is used frequently in connection with the issuance of debt securities. The level of priority of the debt securities, whether senior or junior, will directly affect their interest rate and market price. In general, contractual subordination will be respected in the event the borrower becomes a debtor in a bankruptcy case. Section 510 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law. ” Unless a bankruptcy court rearranges priorities based on equitable principles, known as equitable subordination, or the class of senior creditors effectively waives the benefits of the subordination agreement by voting to accept a chapter 11 plan in which they give up their rights to junior creditors, the subordination agreement controls the ranking of prebankruptcy claims against the bankruptcy estate. In addition to using subordination agreements to achieve priority over other creditors with respect to the payment of their claims, senior creditors also use them to obtain other rights from junior creditors. In particular, subordination agreements have included provisions that give the senior creditor the right to cast the junior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s vote to either accept or reject a plan of reorganization in the event the borrower is in chapter 11. These provisions effectively give a senior creditor two votes; it may vote with respect to its own claim and may vote again with respect to the subordinated claim. Senior creditors have argued that these provisions should be enforceable as a matter of contract, but junior creditors, wishing to vote on a chapter 11 plan despite the contractual provision, have argued that the enforcement of these provisions would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code granting voting rights only to the holders of claims. This article will examine how courts have dealt with these voting rights provisions found in subordination agreements...|$|E
40|$|Teens {{have emerged}} as a {{significant}} market segment, especially with respect to online goods and services. This increased market presence is likely to foreground the contract infancy doctrine, which permits a person under age eighteen to void a contract with a few exceptions. This article provides solid foundations {{for a discussion of}} where the doctrine fits {{in the face of a}} rising youth market and the digital revolution. Part II covers the general parameters of the infancy doctrine and dispels the notion that the doctrine will not be applicable to online services. This part critiques the one case that has addressed the infancy doctrine in the online arena — A. V. v. iParadigms, LLC. Although this case appears to create or expand an infancy doctrine defense based on the use of benefits, the court misapplies the law. Part II also addresses a possible secondary explanation of iParadigms and the seemingly eternal question of whether the infancy doctrine can be used as a “sword,” whatever that means in various jurisdictions and contexts. It then explores a variety of infancy doctrine defenses and illustrates that they are sufficiently narrow to provide little comfort for online vendors and service providers. Part III focuses on the peculiarities of online contracting. It briefly provides context for the current state of contract law doctrine and the increasing laxity in maintaining traditional protections. This part then reviews the major objections to enforcing many terms of service or end-user agreements and assesses whether other contract doctrines provide sufficient basis for policing their abuses. Part III then concludes that, if the infancy doctrine needs to be limited to better accommodate current market needs, the online licensing agreement is not the best place to begin. Part IV predicts the collision of the infancy doctrine and a market ever more greedy to engage minors. It addresses minors’ economic power, whether online businesses are less at risk because they do not take cash, and the extent to which a parent or other entity secondarily guarantees the payment of online financial promises. It next considers the more subtle economic costs associated with minors’ ability to avoid contract terms even if the service is free or the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> is not challenged. Lastly, Part IV outlines the options available and offers recommendations for how online service providers could and should respond to an upswing in infancy doctrine claims. Certainly, the infancy doctrine may become an unmanageable factor in digital market economics. But dramatic changes in contract law should not occur without serious consideration of historical values and long-term implications, especially in an arena where the risk of contract abuses is increased. At least with respect to online agreements, the infancy doctrine should be enforced — and perhaps publicized to encourage its use...|$|E
40|$|Are {{investors in}} securitized {{receivables}} {{to be treated}} as the owners of an asset whose sale has taken it {{beyond the reach of the}} trustee in bankruptcy of their sellers? O are they {{to be treated as}} holders of a security interest in the transferred asset who have left behind an interest in the sellers 2 ̆ 7 hands that would cause the asset to be subject to claims and interference by the sellers 2 ̆ 7 grasping trustee? By adopting contrasting-arguably conflicting-statements in two subsections of a single section, the drafters of 1999 Article 9 have thrust this issue in the faces of courts and commentators. They did this by adopting section 9 - 318 which reads in full as follows: Section 9 - 318. No interest retained in <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>payment</b> that is sold; rights and title of seller of account or chattel paper with respect to creditors and purchasers. (a) [Seller retains no interest. ] A debtor that has sold an account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note does not retain a legal or equitable interest in the collateral sold. (b) [Deemed rights of debtor if buyer 2 ̆ 7 s security interest unperfected. ] For purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of an account or chattel paper from, a debtor that has sold an account or chattel paper, while the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s security interest is unperfected, the debtor is deemed to have rights and title to the account or chattel paper identical to those the debtor sold. Subsection (a) embraces the securitizers 2 ̆ 7 position; it unequivocally indorses the form of the transaction. Upon 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 everything is gone: all is beyond the grasp of the trustee. There are no qualifications; neither perfection, nor notice, nor any other act is required. This 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 of receivables is as much a 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 as the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s sale of inventory to a buyer for value would be a 2 ̆ 2 sale. 2 ̆ 2 But subsection (b) looks to the substance of the transaction and rejects the form. Here a 2 ̆ 2 sale 2 ̆ 2 of certain covered receivables is the grant of a 2 ̆ 2 security interest. 2 ̆ 2 Like the grant of a security interest, this sale without perfection leaves behind fragments of title large enough to give purchase to the sellers 2 ̆ 7 creditors. Of course lawyers are accustomed to ignoring form and following substance, and of doing the opposite. What is different here is that the drafters ask us-with respect to the same transaction-to do one in subsection (a) (respect form) and the other in subsection (b) (ignore form). It may be possible to make the two subsections get along with one another, but it requires work. On their face, they appear inconsistent. I am not the first to see the apparent inconsistency between the two subsections. Members of the drafting committee saw it, 2 ̆ 7 and the use of the verb 2 ̆ 2 deemed 2 ̆ 2 in subsection (b) shows that the drafters anticipated this claim. In this article I consider how we came to this place and whether the drafters have successfully found a path through this thicket that will allow them to satisfy the securitizers (all is gone with a sale) and the creditors of a seller whose buyer has not perfected (enough is left behind despite a sale to give the creditors a hold) without, at the same time, giving purchase to the trustee in bankruptcy of a seller of perfected, securitized receivables...|$|E
