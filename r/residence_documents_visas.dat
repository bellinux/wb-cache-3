30|$|The overrepresentation {{may also}} {{be related to the}} {{insecure}} asylum status of URMs. This uncertainty, including difficulties obtaining legal <b>residence</b> <b>documents,</b> is associated with psychological problems (Fazel et al. 2012; Vervliet et al. 2014). At referral, 86 % of URMs displayed symptoms relating to stress in the asylum process, including indications or a decision from migration authorities that would involve returning to another EU country often associated with previous adversities. This seems to have created a sense of despair and elicited an acute stress reaction (Hodes et al. 2008; Bronstein et al. 2013). Higher rate of suicide attempts and hospital-treated suicidal behaviour in groups of asylum seekers have been documented (Staehr & Munk-Andersen 2006; Goosen et al. 2011). Further, immigrant background has been associated with use of restraint among adolescents in psychiatric treatment (Furre et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|Traffickers {{involved}} in Greece are largely Albanian, Romanian, and Bulgarian, and while Greeks are infrequent victims of trafficking, Greek citizens do {{participate in the}} trafficking of non-Greek nationals. Traffickers recruit victims through false advertisements for low skilled jobs with good salaries, such as waitresses, nannies, dancers, or hostesses; one study of newspapers in Ukraine showed each newspaper contained 5-20 suspicious adverts. Traffickers sometimes use a woman’s legal <b>documents</b> and <b>visas</b> to get her into Greece and then confiscate them so she cannot leave. Additionally, traffickers use threats, intimidation, and physical, emotional, and sexual abuse to control these women and force them into prostitution.|$|R
