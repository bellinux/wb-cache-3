40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} different aircraft configurations from three different data sources using four well-known criteria to predict adverse aircraft-pilot coupling (APC) problems in the roll axis. 17 representative configurations were selected for further analyses and experiments. All evaluations were performed using a MATLAB based software package. The LATHOS program provides {{a large number of}} configurations covering a wide range regarding the criterion parameters. Generally, a good correlation can be observed between criterion parameters and pilot ratings, while mainly the configurations with <b>Racheting</b> problems are out of place. For the F- 18 A in-flight simulation program some discrepancies regarding pilot ratings and criterion results were detected. Therefore, this data-base is not suitable to validate the application of the longitudinal frequency domain criteria to the roll axis. The YF- 16 first flight configuration has been shown as a very interesting case regarding the understanding of the APC phenomenon; at this time it is not quite clear whether the APC occurred during the first flight is mainly due to bad linear aircraft dynamics or due to rate saturation. Therefore, further nonlinear analysis and simulator experiments are required.

40|$|The {{history of}} the present is {{assessed}} in terms of forecasts {{that proved to be}} spectacularly incorrect. Debate about power in the past was largely state-centred but the realisation that the opposite of the state is not a free market but a political anarchy seems to have been forgotten. The society of the spectacle, to use Guy Debord's concept, reigns supreme today, but in ways unimagined by European situationists. The spectacle ignites a new politics of identity, constituted in terms that depart radically from the older terms of class analysis. While some analysts have spoken of the rise of the risk society it is necessary today to add the state of insecurity to contemporary characterisations, whether represented in reality or rhetoric. Global identities constituted by religiosity sit uneasily within nation states as containers of identity and the attempts of states to reaffirm national identity in the face of its rejection by significant subsections of the population is most likely to achieve a rhetorical <b>racheting</b> up of tensions. Consequently, the state of insecurity leads to increasing surveillance and control as a societal project for which every failure is the guarantee of further resources, tighter surveillance and an increasing simulacrum of control. power; terrorism; state of insecurity; identity; security; business; surveillance; control. ...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Plasma Material Interaction (PMI) science {{requires}} in-situ {{time and}} space-resolved measurements {{over a large}} area of Plasma Facing Component (PFC) surfaces to study fuel retention & recovery, erosion & redeposition, material mixing, etc. A novel PFC diagnostic technique Accelerator-based In-situ Materials Surveillance (AIMS) has been developed for Alcator C-Mod. At present, the AIMS covers a relatively small (35 cm) poloidal section of the inner wall PFCs at a single toroidal angle; an upgrade has been proposed which will enable nearly full poloidal (124 cm) and 40 degree toroidal PFC coverage. This paper introduces the design, analysis and fabrication of the new TF magnet power supply system for this upgrade. First, {{the design of the}} busbar system and its support structure is described, which are required to carry 15 kA current for long pulse operation of up to 25 minutes and fault condition of 400 kA for 1 second. Additional elements in the power supply system include a bidirectional crowbar, varistor protection assemblies, and a high current bus switch. Secondly, multi-physics analyses involved in the design are presented. Electro-magnetic analysis is performed to evaluate the spreading load of the two current-carrying busbars while Joule heating with thermal <b>racheting</b> analysis is to estimate the temperature rise in the components. Structural analysis taking into account dead weight, thermal expansion, spreading load and seismic load is performed. All analyses are completed using finite element analysis software COMSOL. Analytical calculations are included to validate the FEA results. The power supply system is ready for fabrication. United States. Department of Energy (award DE-FC 02 - 99 ER 54512...|$|R

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that behaviour of unsaturated soils is governed by two independent stress-state variables, soil suction and net normal stress. Most documented case histories focused on responses of soil suction but often overlooked possible influences due to net normal stress. The principal objectives of this research are to investigate seasonal performance of a saprolitic hillslope due to changes of soil suction and net normal stress and to identify in situ groundwater flow mechanisms. Moreover, effects of the two variables and drying-wetting cycle on stress-dependent soil-water characteristic curve (SDSWCC) and permeability function, k(ψ) of a saprolite are measured and investigated. Three interconnected research methodologies, namely full-scale field monitoring (Part I), laboratory investigations (Part II) and two- and three-dimensional (2 D and 3 D) flow analyses (Part III), are adopted. In Part I, a saprolitic hillslope situated in Hong Kong was selected to be heavily instrumented. Two-year seasonal variations of soil suction and net normal stress were closely monitored by heat dissipation matric water potential sensors and earth pressure cells, respectively. Slope movements were also measured. To provide input parameters for flow analyses in Part III, SDSWCC and k(ψ) of the saprolite were measured by two new test apparatuses directly in Part II. A series of 2 D and 3 D transient flow analyses were performed in Part III to back-analyse measured pore-water pressure (PWP) responses in Part I. Evident seasonal slope movements are observed throughout the 2 -year monitoring period. When a heavy rain fell in wet seasons, measured increases of both positive PWP and equivalent “effective” stress led to a “deep-seated”-type of down-slope ground deformation. An inelastic horizontal displacement of 40 mm was resulted and a shear strain of 8 % was estimated at 5. 5 depth. In dry seasons, owing to suction recovery of 190 kPa and substantial reduction of total horizontal stress, “cantilever”- and “translational”-type of up-slope movements were resulted at the top 5 m of the ground. After subjecting to 2 cycles of dry-wet seasons, up-slope rebounds in dry seasons appear not to recover down-slope displacements measured in previous wet seasons fully. A general down-slope <b>rachetting</b> is identified. Under the heavy rainfalls, significant rise of the main groundwater table which was at 11 m depth is observed. This is mainly attributed to 3 D cross-slope groundwater flow on top of a shallowed decomposed rock stratum. The increase of positive PWP in deeper regions due to the GWT rise and the observed “deep-seated” mode of ground deformation shape imply a reduction of stability for “deep-seated” slope failure. Drying and wetting full-suction SDSWCCs and stress-dependent k(ψ) s of the saprolite were measured at vertical net normal stresses of 0, 40 and 80 kPa. At a given suction, the k(ψ) decreased by up to 1 order of magnitude when average net normal stress increased from 4 to 78 kPa. A noticeable hysteresis loop is observed between the measured drying and wetting k(ψ) s. On the contrary, hysteresis between the drying and wetting k(θ) s (where θ is volumetric water content) appear to be not very significant at any stress level...|$|R
5000|$|When Barbie was {{introduced}} to Mexico, it quickly replaced the traditional dolls, such as the Lupita dolls made of cartonería. However, there are various artisans who still make dolls from various materials by hand, often updating designs. Blanca Molina designs about fifty different kinds of dolls each year, and herself makes about 200 that are generally sold in specialty stores. Ana Karen Allende is a doll maker in Mexico City, whose works include traditional forms but her most popular items include male and female lucha libre wrestlers as well as aluxes, chaneques, calacas, and Mayan guardian figures. Each creation is unique with no two exactly alike. [...] The Miss Lupita project, headed by Carolina Esparragoza received government funding to hold workshops and other events {{with the aim of}} reviving the tradition of making the dolls in Mexico City, with new designs.The most common traditional toy still made are miniatures, generally reproductions of real world people, creatures, and objects, sold as collectibles. They have toy bows and arrows, cooking utensils, other tools. They made {{in a wide variety of}} materials including clay, wood, metal. They can be sold individually or in sets, generally to depict social scenes such as weddings, bullfights, battles, baptisms, and more. One important creator of miniatures was Angel Carranza, born in Tlaquepaque in 1901, whose work is mostly done in glass. These include sets that recreate weddings, baptisms, market scenes, bullfights, charreadas as well as Nativity scenes. Mexican toys are also often rich in ethnographic information. Miniature market scenes, similar to those made by the Aguilar family in Ocotlán, Oaxaca, and ceramic bands from Michoacán and Guerrero are often models of real-life equivalents, thereby making them invaluable tools for a better understanding of Mexican culture. Specialty miniatures include musical instruments from Ixmiquilpan, miniatures in glass from Toluca and Guadalajara, miniatures woven from palm fronds in Chigmecatitlan, and those carved from peach and other pits in the form of animals.A number of toys were associated with certain festival, with a few remaining today. Ones that are no longer commonly made for this purpose include cartonería masks for Carnival and a small mule made of palm fronds for Corpus Christi. These were sold outside of churches on that day, complete with baskets carrying miniature fruits and vegetables. Among those that can still be found (though many have been replaced by plastic versions) include <b>rachets,</b> whistles, and cardboard periscopes for Holy Week [...] Horns for Independence Day were once made of cartoneria, decorated in the national colors with a wood mouthpiece, but these are now mostly plastic. Two that remain are the Judas figure for Holy Saturday and piñatas, originally used to celebrate Las Posadas but now also used for birthdays and other special occasions. Both are filled with candy for children to grab when they are broken. However, the Judas figure (often in the form of a devil or an unpopular personality) is destroyed by fireworks attached to its body. The piñata is broken by blindfolded children who take turns hitting it with a stick.|$|R
