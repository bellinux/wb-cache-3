5000|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of {{drive systems}} usually {{result in a}} significant fluctuation of the rotational speed of the rotor of the driving electric motor. Such oscillations of the angular speed superimposed on the average rotor rotational speed cause more or less severe perturbation of the electromagnetic flux and thus additional oscillations of the electric currents in the motor windings. Then, the generated electromagnetic torque is also characterized by additional variable in time components which induce torsional vibrations of the drive system. According to the above, mechanical vibrations of the drive system become coupled with the electrical vibrations of currents in the motor windings. Such a coupling is often complicated in character and thus computationally troublesome. Because of this reason, till present majority of authors used to simplify the matter regarding mechanical vibrations of drive systems and electric current vibrations in the motor windings as mutually uncoupled. Then, the mechanical engineers applied the electromagnetic torques generated by the electric motors as ‘a priori‘ assumed excitation functions of time or of the rotor-to-stator slip, e.g. in paper [...] usually basing on numerous experimental measurements carried out for the given electric motor dynamic behaviours. For this purpose, by means of measurement results, proper approximate formulas have been developed, which describe respective electromagnetic external excitations produced by the electric motor,. However, the electricians thoroughly modelled electric current flows in the electric motor windings, but they usually reduced the mechanical drive system to one or seldom to at most a few rotating rigid bodies, as e.g. in [...] In many cases, such simplifications yield sufficiently useful results for engineering applications, but very often they can lead to remarkable inaccuracies, since many qualitative dynamic properties of the mechanical systems, e.g. their mass distribution, torsional flexibility and damping effects, are being neglected. Thus, an influence of drive system vibratory behaviour on the electric machine rotor angular speed fluctuation, {{and in this way}} on the electric current oscillations in the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> <b>windings,</b> can not be investigated with a satisfactory precision.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{developments}} of IGBT technology, switching time and frequency are dramatically increased. At higher carrier frequencies, IGBTs induce more capacitive coupled current into a <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> a <b>stator</b> frame <b>and</b> lead to faster bearing damage. Common mode voltage enables motor to create shaft voltage through electrostatic couplings between the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> the <b>stator</b> <b>windings</b> <b>and</b> between the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> the frame, {{and it can}} caused bearing currents when the shaft voltage exceeds a breakdown voltage level of the bearing grease. Also, high frequency leakage current occurs through stray capacitors between <b>stator</b> winding <b>and</b> the motor frame due to {{a high rate of}} the common mode dv/dt at motor terminals which can produce induced shaft voltage. Conducted and radiated Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) emissions are major problems in recent motor drives that produce undesirable effects on electronic devices. In modern power electronic systems, increasing power density and decreasing cost and size of system are market requirements. Switching losses, Harmonics and EMI are the key factors which should be considered at the beginning stage of a design to optimise a drive system. In most of power electronic designs, EMI issues have not been taken into account as one of the main factors; and mitigation techniques for EMI are considered at the last stage of design.

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is focused on}} developing simple parametric models of the unbalanced magnetic pull produced in eccentric-rotor electrical machines. The influence of currents circulating in the parallel paths of the stator winding on the unbalanced magnetic pull is given the main attention. The interaction between these currents and those circulating in the rotor cage/damper winding is also considered. First, a parametric force model for an eccentric-rotor salient-pole synchronous machine is developed. The effects of the parallel stator windings are not considered in this model. Next, a low-order parametric force model is built for electrical machines equipped with parallel stator windings but operating without the rotor cage/damper winding. This force model is applicable to salient-pole synchronous machines {{as well as to}} induction motors. And finally, a special force model is developed for electrical machines furnished with parallel paths both in the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> <b>windings.</b> This model accounts for the equalising currents circulating in the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> <b>windings</b> and also for the interaction between these currents. This third force model can be applied to a salient-pole synchronous machine and to an induction machine. The parameters of the force models are estimated from the results of numerical simulations applying a soft-computing-based estimation program. All the developed force models with the estimated parameters demonstrate a very good performance in a wide whirling frequency range. The effects of parallel paths in the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> <b>windings</b> on the unbalanced magnetic pull are investigated numerically. The acquired results reveal that the total unbalanced magnetic pull and its constituents related to the fundamental magnetic field and slotting are strongly affected by the presence of parallel paths in the stator winding. However, unlike the rotor cage, parallel stator windings may instigate anisotropy in the unbalanced magnetic pull. In such cases, the results of the numerical impulse response test may differ significantly from the conventional calculation results. It is also shown that, {{despite the fact that the}} number of parallel paths in the stator is often substantially lower than the number of parallel paths in the rotor, parallel stator windings may still provide a more efficient UMP mitigation than the rotor cage/damper winding. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|To {{support the}} Revolutionary Aeropropulsion Concept Program, NASA Glenn Research Center' s Structural Mechanics and Dynamics Branch is {{developing}} a compact, nonpolluting, bearingless electric machine with electric power supplied by fuel cells for future more-electric aircraft.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design and analyze the {{carrying}} structure of a multiple air gap generator for tidal turbine application. An initial patent pending electromagnetic design was provided by SmartMotor AS. Electromagnetic values, such as forces from the rotor-stator interaction, were given by SmartMotor. The final product is a 3 D-model of the generator with dimensions and shape based on required power output, production and assembly limitations and static and eigenmode simulations. The multiple air gap principle allows for a more compact generator, as there are several layers - in the radial direction - of <b>rotors</b> (magnets) <b>and</b> <b>stators</b> (<b>windings)</b> instead of one set of <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator.</b> A generator normally uses a gearbox to increase power output. This however increases maintenance and introduces more friction losses. By using multiple air gaps, the generator can potentially maintain {{the same size and}} power output while eliminating the gearbox. The multiple air gap principle, as well as some basic electromagnetic theory, was discussed to give an insight in the planned generator. A requirement specification was set, with the most important ones being a power output of 1. 1 MW and a maximum outer diameter of 3 m. The rotor has 132 magnets in each layer <b>and</b> the <b>stator</b> 144 teeth, creating a varying force between the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> the <b>stator.</b> The air gap in each layer is initially 5 mm, and the forces increase if the air gap gets smaller. To evaluate different solutions for the carrying structure, the generator was broken down into smaller parts. Several design ideas were evaluated and discussed with engineers at SmartMotor. The chosen design was influenced especially by deformation and production/cost demands. Complex shapes become expensive and difficult to produce when the total diameter is above two meters. Instead it is used torque plates to counteract the torque forces and radial plates to counteract the bending from the radial forces. The most challenging parts to produce are the rings, which both the <b>stator</b> <b>and</b> <b>rotor</b> active parts are mounted to. These have to be casted due to its large size. The chosen design was modeled and analyzed for deformations and stresses in UGS NX 7. 5. To reduce simulation time and the complexity of the model, the <b>stator,</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> rings were simulated separately. Some simplifications and assumptions had to be done, but always on the conservative side. The results from the static simulations showed that increasing the axial length and decreasing the diameter resulted in a stiffer structure. The <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> structure were also analyzed for eigenfrequencies in UGS NX, and it was these simulations which set the final dimensions for the generator structure. The final generator has an outer diameter of 2. 32 m, a total length of 2. 035 m (excluding bearings) and uses 4 air gap layers. The total weight was estimated to 25. 4 tons. A step-by-step description of the generator assembly was presented. Finally possible sources of error in the simulations and further work on the generator were discussed...|$|R

In this study, an inverted rotor induction motor is designed and produced. This motor has mechanical revolving characteristics both rotor and stator. In this type of construction the rotor has three-phase winding as well, similar to the stator wound for {{the same number of}} poles as the stator winding. The wound-rotor winding terminates in slip rings mounted on the rotor shaft. Brushes ride on the slip rings. Also measurement coils are placed upper of the same slots of the stator and rotor windings of the inverted rotor induction motor. Regardless of the rotor construction employed, rotor currents in this motor are induced by the stator’s changing, or rather, rotating, and magnetic fields. This induction action is the central operating principle of ac induction motors. Waveforms of the induced voltages on the <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> <b>windings</b> are investigated. Rotating magnetic fields of the rotor and stator are measured by using these measurement coils.

40|$|Abstract — A {{substantial}} amount of power system load is made of large number of three phase induction machine. The transient phenomena of these machines {{play an important role}} in the behavior of the overall system. Thus, modeling of induction machine is an integral part of some power system transient studies. The analysis takes a detailed form only when its modeling becomes perfect to a greater accuracy. When the stator eddy current path is taken into account, the uniform air-gap theory in phase model analysis becomes inefficient to take care of the transients. This drawback necessitates the introduction of analysis of the machine in d-q axis frame. A widely accepted induction machine model for stability studies is the fifth-order model which considers the electrical transients in both <b>rotor</b> <b>and</b> <b>stator</b> <b>windings</b> and the mechanical transients. In practice, some flux-transient can be ignored due to the quasi-stationary nature of the variables concerned. This philosophy leads to the formation of reduced order model. Model Order Reduction (MOR) encompasses a set of techniques whose goal is to generate reduced order models with lower complexity while ensuring that the I/O response and other characteristics of the original model (such as passivity) are maintained. This paper takes the above matter as a main point of research. The authors use the philosophy of the speed-build up of induction machine to find the speed versus time profile for various load conditions and supply voltage disturbances using numerical methods due to Runge-Kutta, Trapezoidal and Euler’s in Matlab platform. The established fact of lesser computation time in reduced order model has been verified and improvement in accuracy is observed. Keywords- Induction machine, Model order reduction, Stability...|$|E
