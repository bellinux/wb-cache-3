5|$|Two {{types of}} small <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>RNA)</b> molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>RNA)</b> is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode their genetic information using an RNA genome.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>RNA).</b> Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation.|$|E

Compared to human breast milk, cow's milk has lower levels of the nucleotides uridine, inosine, and cytidine.

The mushroom contains a unique laccase enzyme that can break down several dyes used in the laboratory and in the textile industry, such as [...] bromothymol blue, eriochrome black T, malachite green, and reactive brilliant blue.

[...] The nitrogenous bases of each strand of a nucleic acid will form hydrogen bonds with certain other nitrogenous bases in a complementary strand of nucleic acid (similar to a zipper). Adenine binds with thymine and uracil; thymine binds only with adenine; and cytosine and guanine can bind only with one another.|$|E
2500|$|Caffeine is a bitter, white {{crystalline}} purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically {{related to}} the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>RNA).</b> It {{is found in the}} seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to South America and East Asia and helps to protect them against predator insects and to prevent germination of nearby seeds. The most well known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, a misnomer for the seed of Coffea plants. [...] Beverages containing caffeine are ingested to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water, a process called infusion.

2500|$|Research {{continued}} {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s. [...] The smith antigen {{was found to}} be a complex of <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>RNA)</b> molecules and multiple proteins. [...] A set of uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules was part of this complex, and given the names U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6. [...] Four of these snRNAs (U1, U2, U4 and U5) were found to be tightly bound to several small proteins, which were named SmB, SmD, SmE, SmF, and SmG in decreasing order of size. [...] SmB has an alternatively spliced variant, SmB', and a very similar protein, SmN, replaces SmB'/B in certain (mostly neural) tissues. [...] SmD was later discovered to be a mixture of three proteins, which were named SmD1, SmD2 and SmD3. [...] These nine proteins (SmB, SmB', SmN, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG) became known as the Sm core proteins, or simply Sm proteins. [...] The snRNAs are complexed with the Sm core proteins and with other proteins to form particles in the cell's nucleus called small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, or snRNPs. [...] By the mid 1980s, it became clear that these snRNPs help form a large (4.8 MD molecular weight) complex, called the spliceosome, around pre-mRNA, excising portions of the pre-mRNA called introns and splicing the coding portions (exons) together. After a few more modifications, the spliced pre-mRNA becomes messenger RNA (mRNA) which is then exported from the nucleus and translated into a protein by ribosomes.|$|E
