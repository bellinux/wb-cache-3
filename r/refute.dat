40|$|Eight decades ago, Arthur Holmes introducted {{the idea}} of mantle {{convection}} as a mechanism for continental drift. Five decades ago, continental drift was modified to become plate tectonics theory, which included mantle convection as an absolutely critical component. Using the submarine design and operation concept of "neutral buoyancy", which follows from Archimedes' discoveries, the concept of mantle convection is proven to be incorrect, concomitantly <b>refuting</b> plate tectonics, <b>refuting</b> all mantle convection models, and <b>refuting</b> all models that depend upon mantle convection...|$|R
5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, it showed {{that he was a}} humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to <b>refute</b> the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Claudius was a heretic in {{the view}} of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, who later wrote to <b>refute</b> some of his teachings {{at the request of the}} emperor. The last {{recorded}} act of Claudius is in a charter of the monastery of St Peter at Novalesa in May 827. He was dead by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, so it can be presumed that he died that year.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigations have}} a variety of applications. The most common is to support or <b>refute</b> a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts.

5|$|Einstein's {{affiliation}} with the Institute for Advanced Study would last {{until his death in}} 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to <b>refute</b> the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model his theory of the mind and to <b>refute</b> alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E

5|$|Paul Joseph Goebbels {{was born}} on 29 October 1897 in Rheydt, an {{industrial}} town south of Mönchengladbach near Düsseldorf. Both of his parents were Roman Catholics with modest family backgrounds. His father Fritz was a factory clerk; his mother Katharina (née Odenhausen) was ethnically Dutch. Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893–1947), Hans (1895–1949), Maria (1896–1896), Elisabeth (1901–1915), and Maria (1910–1949), who married the German filmmaker Max W. Kimmich in 1938. In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to <b>refute</b> the rumors that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.|$|E

5|$|Several German art {{experts have}} {{attempted}} to <b>refute</b> all the claims made by Hawass, pointing to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt {{has been accused of}} foul play in the deal. The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E
5|$|Shaiva scriptures narrate {{that god}} Shiva assumed the Avatar (incarnation) of Sharabha to pacify Narasimha - the fierce man-lion avatar of Vishnu worshipped by Vaishnava sect.

The Vaishnavas <b>refute</b> the {{portrayal}} of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva-Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu.
