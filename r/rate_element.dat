40|$|The {{study is}} {{set out to}} {{discover}} a new multi factor model for Shariah investing in Malaysian stocks based on musharakah principle. It also wants to know the model explanatory power of stocks‟ risk decomposition and return attribution as well to forecast risk given the current volatile market. Existing single factor model such as Capital Asset Pricing Model and multi factor model like Fama French Model are formulated {{on the basis of}} risk-free <b>rate</b> <b>element</b> in which rescind out with Shariah principle of musharakah. Moreover, the models do not explained their factors well in emerging markets that include Malaysia. Thus, exploring the alternative model is pertinent. A fundamental factor model is carefully constructed from four key essential elements of musharakah: Business Sector, Management Quality, Profitability Growth and Capital Strength factors. It gives greater insight into the sources of stocks performance and leads to intuitive action items. The cross-sectional approach is used to build the model. Key results show that the model has high explanatory power for contemporaneous returns, maintains high forecasting ability in high and low volatility environments and stays unbiased with no significant under-forecasting or over-forecasting of risk for a broad variety of portfolios. Despite the existence of long established multi factor models, this study offers new empirical evidence suggesting the application of musharakah principle as a framework, although without risk-free <b>rate</b> <b>element,</b> is able to increase the explanatory power of Shariah-compliant stocks‟ risk and return. Moreover, it goes well with those who subscribe to principle based investing...|$|E
40|$|The new {{ionization}} gauge CONE {{was developed}} and calibrated using the vacuum facilities of the University of Bonn. The rocketborne sensor is designed to perform simultaneous measurements of electron and neutral densities in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (65 - 110 km). Turbulent parameters such as the turbulent energy dissipation <b>rate</b> <b>element</b> of are obtained by applying a spectral model to the power spectra of the measured small scale density fluctuations. To improve the spatial resolution the overall time constant of the sensor has been optimized. During the campaign SCALE- 93 in Northern Norway two instruments were employed successfully to derive profiles of turbulent parameters and neutral density. In addition to the improved time constant one result of the flight data is that the ram pressure inside the sensor was reduced compared to the previous model. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract. Repertory grid tools {{systematically}} {{collect data}} that consists of a topic, its elements, constructs and element ratings. Gaining meaningful insights from repertory grids data is a challenge because data analysis is timeconsuming and a significant mental effort is needed. Visualizations aim at facilitating data analysis through a visual and interactive approach, which allows users to understand their data, reflect, and make better decisions. This paper presents an interactive visualization tool for teachers and students. The tool visualizes repertory grid data using two dashboards, where teachers and students can investigate constructs and <b>rating</b> <b>elements</b> of students at the individual or group level. Visualizing the repertory grid data is an initial attempt towards teaching analytics. Future work will focus on evaluating the tool in a real setting with teachers and students, and collecting suggestions for improvement. ...|$|R
50|$|In practice, the {{distinction}} between price-cap and rate-of-return regulation may be lost, as regulators may end up making implicit decisions on the acceptable real rates of return on capital employed in order to arrive at price limit determinations. This has been the experience in the UK water sector, where the 1999 periodic review led Ofwat to determine a standard (real post-tax) cost of capital of 4.75%, with minor adjustments for smaller companies. This standard rate was then used to help calculate X. In addition, detailed aspects of the price elements incorporated into the price index {{may be more important}} to the actual operation of a price cap regulatory regime than either the X-factor or the inflation adjustment. How <b>rate</b> <b>elements</b> are incorporated and removed from price caps is particularly important in industries with rapidly changing service offerings.|$|R

In the present study, four pairs of slalom skis that differed in flexural and torsional rigidity were tested by advanced and expert skiers.

For each pair of skis, physical measurements were compared with the ratings of the two groups of skiers. Correlations (Spearman) were then determined between (i) different mechanical properties of the skis (static and dynamic), (ii) subjective assessments of the participants, and (iii) properties of the skis and the participants’ assessments. The latter showed that expert skiers rate the aspects of the skis more accurately than advanced skiers. Importantly, expert skiers are particularly sensitive to torsion of the skis.

40|$|In {{parallel}} adaptive {{finite element}} simulations the work {{load on the}} individual processors may change frequently. To (re) distribute the load evenly over the processors a load balancing heuristic is needed. Common strategies try to minimise subdomain dependencies by optimising the cutsize of the partitioning. However for certain solvers cutsize only plays a minor role, and their convergence is highly dependent on the subdomain shapes. Degenerated subdomain shapes cause them to need significantly more iterations to converge. In this work a new parallel load balancing strategy is introduced which directly addresses the problem of generating and conserving reasonably good subdomain shapes in a dynamically changing Finite Element Simulation. Geometric data is used to formulate several cost functions to <b>rate</b> <b>elements</b> {{in terms of their}} suitability to be migrated.
