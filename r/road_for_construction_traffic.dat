40|$|With the {{increasing}} traffic contradiction between supply and demand, urban traffic problems have become quite complex. Reasons for traffic congestion have {{become much more}} diverse. During the construction of urban road project, the surrounding road network will encounter a huge impact, traffic problems therefore emerged. Simulation is an important means for transport impact assessment, which has an important role <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>traffic</b> impact analysis. Accordingly, traffic simulation is particularly important for policy setting and traffic organization. Taking an improvement project of Changjiang rapid road in Zhongshan city for example, this paper used the professional simulation software Vissim to analysis the impact of Qiwan road during the construction project. The simulation and traffic evaluation results can give some forward-looking and targeted measures about traffic safety, traffic organization, road facilities alteration and so on. The traffic impact analysis results shown that traffic safety and high-efficiency transport system must protected by good traffic re-organization projects and the simulation method is an effective mean to actualize traffic impact assessment...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using high calcium fly ash and cement in stabilising fine-grained clayey soils (CL,CH) {{was investigated in}} the laboratory. Strength tests in uniaxial compression, in indirect (splitting) tension and flexure were carried out on samples to which various percentages of fly ash and cement had been added. Modulus of elasticity was determined at 90 days with different types of load application and 90 -day soaked CBR values are also reported. Pavement structures incorporating subgrades improved by in situ stabilisation with fly ash and cement were analyzed <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>traffic</b> and <b>for</b> operating traffic. These pavements are compared with conventional flexible pavements without improved subgrades and the results clearly show the technical benefits of stabilising clayey soils with fly ash and cement. In addition TG-SDTA and XRD tests were carried out on certain samples in order to study the hydraulic compounds, which were formed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
