25|$|In {{the cities}} of Hubli, Belgaum and Gulbarga {{in the state of}} Karnataka, the private {{operator}} Veolia increased water supply from once every 2–15days for 1–2hours, to 24hours per day for 180,000 people (12% {{of the population of the}} 3 cities) within 2years (2006–2008). This was achieved by carefully selecting and <b>ring-fencing</b> demonstration zones (one in each city), renovating the distribution network, installing meters, introducing a well-functioning commercial system, and effective grass-roots social intermediation by an NGO, all without increasing the amount of bulk water supplied. The project, known by its acronym as KUWASIP (Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project), was supported by a 39.5million loan from the World Bank. It constitutes a milestone for India, where no large city so far has achieved continuous water supply. The project is expected to be scaled-up to cover the entire area of the three cities.|$|E

50|$|Unlike most {{developed}} financial markets, {{there is}} no legal structure similar to segregated portfolio companies in South Africa.

One advantage to the Verein structure is that because control of the firm is decentralized, offices are only bound by regulators in their country.
