40|$|The {{properties}} of hydration of apolar solutes have become of large {{interest for the}} applications in many chemical processes in industrial technology and biochemistry. Computer simulation studies on aqueous solutions of <b>rare</b> <b>gases</b> indicate that at ambient conditions the solvation is governed by the formation of hydration cages around the solute. On raising temperature the solute tends to disrupt the cage. Recent neutron diffraction studies performed at supercritical conditions in mixtures of water and <b>rare</b> <b>gases</b> found that the structure of water is compressed {{by the presence of}} the solutes. The solubility of <b>rare</b> <b>gases</b> shows a very interesting temperature dependence: it presents a minimum between room temperature and the water boiling point, then it increases with raising temperature and more steeply above the water critical point. It has also been observed that the solubility of <b>rare</b> <b>gases</b> is larger for larger size of the solute. In this paper we study with computer simulation the structure of mixtures of Ar and water from ambient to supercritical conditions and we present a comparison of the pair correlation functions of these mixtures at supercritical conditions with recent experimental data. Results about the solubility of Ar and Ne in water are also shown and discussed. In the numerical calculations water is simulated with the SPC/E potential and the polarizable model developed by Brodholt, Sampoli and Vallauri (BSV). ...|$|R

50|$|Molecules {{that are}} only stable in {{electronically}} excited states are called excimer molecules, but may be called exciplex molecules if they are heteronuclear. The exciplex halides constitute an important class of <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> halides with formula RgX. Rg is the noble gas, and X is the halogen. These molecules are de-excited by emitting a photon whose energy is some Electronvolts. Therefore, the wavelength of produced light produced is in the visible or ultraviolet spectra. Gas or gaseous mixtures {{that may lead to}} the formation of these molecules is a quasi-ideal laser medium since the population inversion is directly obtained when the excimer is formed. The other consequence of the unstable ground state is that the excimer or exciplex species must be generated by an external excitation (either through a discharge, an electron beam, microwave, or radiation). At least two gases must be used to generate exciplexes: a halogen donor and a <b>rare</b> <b>gas.</b> However, as shown in Table 1, not all <b>rare</b> <b>gas</b> halide molecules lead to the development of lasers; some may not even exist.
