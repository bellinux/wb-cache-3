500|$|Although he {{initially}} helps the Winchesters in Season 7 {{in their struggle}} against the Leviathans—God's original creations, trapped for millennia in Purgatory until they were unintentionally released by Castiel—despite the destruction of his house, even determining their new foes' vulnerability to the chemical Borax, Bobby is eventually {{shot in the head}} by Dick Roman in [...] "How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters". He spends the next episode, [...] "Death's Door", in a coma, trying to reawaken to reveal the Leviathan's plot. Despite efforts to save him, Bobby flatlines from his injuries; his last word being [...] "idjits" [...] (sic, idiots) to Sam and Dean after passing on a sequence of numbers. The episode ends with a reaper asking Bobby if he is going to become a ghost or move on to the afterlife. It's indicated that he stayed as a ghost to help the boys as there have been times since his death when the information they need inexplicably makes itself known to them, but they were initially unable to confirm or deny Bobby's possible presence. During [...] "Party On, Garth," [...] Sam reveals that he tried to use a talking board to contact him if he is still around, but received no response. However, Garth registers high readings on an EMF detector around Bobby's old flask, and when Dean needed a sword to slay a shojo, it inexplicably slid across the ground to him, leading him to believe that Bobby had helped him. At the end of the episode, Bobby's spirit {{can be seen in the}} brother's motel room, and he is annoyed when Dean comes in, looks <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and does not see him, instead grabbing his flask.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "11:53 to Odessa", Noah {{tries to}} get Malina to Odessa to stop the H.E.L.E. but during a massive storm, a car is flung <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Noah {{suddenly}} disappears leaving behind only his broken glasses.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I did, for I aimed <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and he wasn't {{over twenty}} feet away," [...] was the reply. [...] "Wonder if he'll come back?" ...|$|E
50|$|So, then I cussed <b>right</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{and really}} got him told.|$|R
5000|$|The Super Friends {{version of}} Icicle {{appeared}} in the [...] "Post Super Heroes Create a Villain Contest" [...] cereal commercial from the 1980s. Robin says [...] "Holy Icicles!"

60|$|GREGORY [chuckling]. It {{sounded like}} {{something}} to drink. But I have no <b>right</b> to laugh <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> My Christian name is Gregory, which {{sounds like a}} powder.|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} {{not strong enough}} to see clearly, and nobody had the courage to make more of an illumination. Sobber stood {{in the center of the}} room and as he did this the snake {{suddenly}} seemed to fly through the air <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|I leaped <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with all}} my might as the goad flew over me. He turned to run as I jumped, and I bore him to the ground, came down right upon him, and slipped upon his smashed body and fell. He seemed to wriggle under my foot.|$|E
60|$|And {{when he saw}} him {{he stopped}} awhile, for {{he had never seen}} so strange a beast. His body was a man’s: but his head was the head of a bull; and his teeth were the teeth of a lion, and with them he tore his prey. And when he saw Theseus he roared, and put his head down, and rushed <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} I said {{anything}} about him,' said she to Anne; 'it was scarcely <b>right</b> to laugh <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> especially before Dora; I am afraid she will never see the monument without thinking of the chimney.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dead cedars <b>right</b> <b>at</b> hand assured <b>him</b> a {{comfortable}} night with steady fire; {{and when he}} had satisfied his hunger he arranged an easy seat before the blazing logs, and gave his mind over to thought of his weird, lonely environment.|$|R
60|$|By and by, {{looking up}} through {{the top of the}} big pine-tree, he saw the little stars come out one by one. They seemed to be looking <b>right</b> down <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and winking <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in the jolliest way. Somehow, he didn't feel quite so lonely then, and he tried to wink back. Then little, soft, silvery bars of light began to creep through the {{branches}} of the trees and along the ground. They were moonbeams, and Sammy could see just a little, a very little. He began to feel better.|$|R
6000|$|... "You would {{scarcely}} believe, lads, what we {{went through}} on that 'ere journey. Many a time Tom and I made up our minds to bolt for it; {{and we would have}} done it if we had had the least idea which way to go or how we were to keep alive on the journey. We had agreed when we started that we would do our best, and that we would not put up with any flogging. We didn't much care whether they killed us or not, for we would just as leave have died as passed our lives in that country with all its beastly ways. Well, {{a couple of days after}} we had started, a big nigger driver who had been laying on his stick freely on the backs of the slaves came along, and let Tom and me have one apiece. Tom, who was nearest to him, chucked down his load and went <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and knocked him over like a ninepin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{standing}} on the platform waiting for the people to let me into the car, and this beast, this conductor, hollered at me, 'Come on, you, move up!' Why, I've never had anybody speak to me that way in all my life! I was so astonished I just turned to him and said--I thought there must be some mistake, and so I said to him, perfectly pleasant, 'Were you speaking to me?' and he went on and bellowed at me, 'Yes, I was! You're keeping the whole car from starting!' he said, and then I saw he was one of these dirty ill-bred hogs that kindness is wasted on, and so I stopped and looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and I said, 'I--beg--your--pardon, I am not doing anything of the kind,' I said, 'it's the people ahead of me, who won't move up,' I said, 'and furthermore, let me tell you, young man, that you're a low-down, foul-mouthed, impertinent skunk,' I said, 'and you're no gentleman! I certainly intend to report you, and we'll see,' I said, 'whether a lady is to be insulted by any drunken bum that chooses to put on a ragged uniform, and I'd thank you,' I said, 'to keep your filthy abuse to yourself.' And then I waited for Paul to show he was half a man and come to my defense, and he just stood there and pretended he hadn't heard a word, and so I said to him, 'Well,' I said--" ...|$|E
60|$|One night Rilla {{came home}} late from a {{recruiting}} {{meeting at the}} Glen {{where she had been}} giving patriotic recitations. Rilla had never been willing to recite in public before. She was afraid of her tendency to lisp, which had a habit of reviving if she were doing anything that made her nervous. When she had first been asked to recite at the Upper Glen meeting she had refused. Then she began to worry over her refusal. Was it cowardly? What would Jem think if he knew? After two days of worry Rilla phoned {{to the president of the}} Patriotic Society that she would recite. She did, and lisped several times, and lay awake most of the night in an agony of wounded vanity. Then two nights after she recited again at Harbour Head. She had been at Lowbridge and over-harbour since then and had become resigned to an occasional lisp. Nobody except herself seemed to mind it. And she was so earnest and appealing and shining-eyed! More than one recruit joined up because Rilla's eyes seemed to look <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> when she passionately demanded how could men die better than fighting for the ashes of their fathers and the temples of their gods, or assured her audience with thrilling intensity that one crowded hour of glorious life was worth an age without a name. Even stolid Miller Douglas was so fired one night that it took Mary Vance a good hour to talk him back to sense. Mary Vance said bitterly that if Rilla Blythe felt as bad as she had pretended to feel over Jem's going to the front she wouldn't be urging other girls' brothers and friends to go.|$|E
50|$|Warner has {{a younger}} brother Ian who {{graduated}} from Iowa State University. His younger brother finished <b>right</b> behind <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the 2012 Canadian Olympic Trials {{with a time of}} 10.20.|$|R
5000|$|Erik Hage singles out {{two of the}} {{performances}} at the concert, calling {{the interaction between the}} brass and Morrison [...] "simply stunning" [...] on [...] "Troubadours" [...] and [...] "Angeliou" [...] remarking that: [...] "On the former, Ellis and Morrison were locked in with each other, Ellis offering high, intense blasts and Morrison crying out <b>right</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in the throes of that elusive musical 'connection' he spent so much of his life seeking out." ...|$|R
60|$|Now it just {{happened}} that Old Man Coyote had started to cross the Green Meadows <b>right</b> <b>at</b> {{the foot of the}} hill just as the barrel started down. Of course, he heard the noise and looked up to see what it meant. When he saw that barrel rushing <b>right</b> down <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> it frightened him so that he just gave one yelp and started for the Old Pasture like a gray streak. He gave Peter a chance to see just how fast he can run, and Peter made up his mind right then that he never would run a race with Old Man Coyote.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "11:53 to Odessa", Noah {{tries to}} get Malina to Odessa to stop the H.E.L.E. but during a massive storm, a car is flung <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Noah {{suddenly}} disappears leaving behind only his broken glasses.|$|E
50|$|Sherlock Holmes soon tracks down Silver Blaze, literally: {{his tracks}} (along with a man's) are clearly {{visible in the}} soil, albeit intermittently. Holmes also deduces why the police {{could not find the}} horse, despite having looked <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Holmes ensures Silver Blaze's safety, and turns his mind to other aspects of the case.|$|E

Then he starts to worry.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, Wright made a {{surprising}} discovery. He mixed boric acid with silicone {{oil in a}} test tube. Instead of forming the hard rubber material he was looking for, the compound remained slightly gooey to the touch. Disappointed with the results, he tossed a gob of the material from the test tube onto the floor. To his surprise, the gob bounced <b>right</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> The new compound was very bouncy and could be stretched and pulled. However, it wasn't a good rubber substitute, so Wright and other GE scientists continued their search.|$|R
60|$|But Peter didn't laugh. No, Sir, Peter didn't laugh, {{for just}} that very minute {{something}} happened. Sniff! Sniff! That was <b>right</b> behind <b>him</b> <b>at</b> {{the very edge}} of the old brushpile, and every hair on Peter stood on end with fright.|$|R
2500|$|In 1992, Parcells made a {{handshake}} agreement to become {{head coach of}} the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At the last minute, Parcells opted not to take the job.

5000|$|Baldomir would {{eventually}} get his chance against the pound-for-pound king, Floyd Mayweather Jr., on November 4, 2006 in Las Vegas for the WBC, The Ring and lineal welterweight titles. Said Baldomir of this challenge: [...] "Mayweather is very good, but I can beat him. I'm going <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> I'm {{going to keep}} attacking and not {{give him a chance}} to breathe or move. Mayweather has never fought anyone like me before." ...|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{audience}} survives and escapes and when the twins come out, the police try to arrest them. Instead of surrendering, they turn on each other and stab each other repeatedly, killing each other. The news talks to Steven about Deborah's films {{and the possibility of}} her actions becoming a film, which he doubts will happen, commenting that if it were, Deborah would rise from the dead by now. As he leaves, a worker causes Deborah's body to move and she seems to stare <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> freaking him out slightly.|$|E
50|$|In the Florida State-Houston {{game in the}} Gator Bowl in 1968, the 'Noles {{brought the}} safeties up and they ignored the QB, running <b>right</b> past <b>him</b> <b>at</b> times, and crashed into the {{trailing}} back, usually Paul Gipson. This took the pitch option away. The Veer wasn't stopped but it was slowed. Florida State won the game 40-20.|$|R

50|$|Goren is back {{to working}} the door at Arcadia with Stoat, and Melago {{approached}} Stoat, saying she {{wants to talk to}} him alone. When she tells Stoat that Santana is out on bail, Stoat is stunned. Later, Stoat and Goren break into Santana's place and force Santana out of bed. Testarosa is also there and questions Santana while Stoat beats him. Santana denies everything, but Stoat finds Santana’s lighter wired. Since Goren already said that Santana was clean, Testarosa tells Goren to kill Santana there and now. When Goren pulls out a gun and points it at Santana’s head, the police burst in. We see Goren with his gun pointed at the police, with a stunned Eames pointing one <b>right</b> back <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Now {{you just}} can't {{do a thing}} like that. Herbert Heller sees his boy Tommy embraced by this [...] "Commie queer" [...] and he gets his shotgun and fires it <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> But of course Helbert is the [...] "true example of American manhood" [...] and gets elected Man of the Century anyways. So it's all right. Even if he isn't much of a shot anymore. A man can't do {{everything}} well. All {{he can do is}} try. And [...] "Now Is The Time For All Good Men" [...] to do just that.|$|E

After the impact, Praimnath found himself alive under his desk with only minor injuries. When Clark found Praimnath, there was a wall standing between the two, and the only way for Praimnath to escape was to jump up and go over the wall.|$|E
