For this purpose was chosen the Prague Public Transport Company {{which is the largest}} public city transport company in the Czech Republic. The theoretical part focuses on determination <b>of</b> conditions for <b>cofinancing</b> <b>of</b> city public transport from public sources. The practical part analyses economy of Prague Public Transport Company and then based on this analyses describes the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>cofinancing</b> <b>of</b> public city transport from public sources and possible consequences of changing the structure of financing...|$|R
40|$|Mobilizing {{sufficient}} {{resources is}} essential for supporting environmental activities in developing countries, and cofinancing is generally considered an important tool to help developing countries increase the resources they need. Moreover, cofinancing should increase ownership of projects by local authorities while improving accountability. The literature, however, has not explored why certain projects receive higher levels <b>of</b> <b>cofinancing</b> than others. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the cofinancing ratio and its determinants using projects financed by the GEF Trust Fund. The empirical results confirm that {{the rules of the}} fund, requiring different minimum cofinancing ratios by size and focal area of the GEF projects, do matter. Other important factors include funds 9 ̆ 2 origins (foreign vs. domestic), types <b>of</b> <b>cofinancing</b> sources (reimbursable vs. non- reimbursable) and the particular GEF agencies involved...|$|R

Methods abstractlogical method. 	Results on the basis of statistical data statements and publications of various researchers in the studied area it was revealed that the practice of modern Islamic financial institutions is inconsistent with their socioeconomic goals as expressed in the predominance of debt financing models. The cause of the problem is the inconsistency of the modern operational structure of Islamic financial institutions to the possibilities of debt financing implementation. It is proposed to solve this problem by developing direct investment funds as a form of Islamic financial institutions.

40|$|Cofinancing is a {{term used}} in the movie {{industry}} to describe films for which multiple firms share the cost of production and revenues. We find that one-third of movies produced by major studios between 1987 and 2000 are cofinanced. Anecdotal evidence strongly indicates that cofinancing is {{for the purpose of}} risk management. However, the major studios are publicly traded firms, which allows investors to make their own diversification decisions, leading us to question the importance <b>of</b> <b>cofinancing</b> for risk management. Contrary to industry-claims, we find that cofinancing decisions are unrelated to the distribution of individual movie returns—studios do not appear to cofinance relatively risky films. But we do find that studios are more likely to cofinance movies that account for a large fraction of their total annual production budget, which reduces portfolio risk via the law of large numbers. Toward an alternative explanation for cofinancing, we also find that cofinancing between two major studios impacts the release dates of their other movies...|$|R

In the first part of this study I describe and analyze the progress of transport policy in Czech Republic from the earlies 90 s till the entrance to EU. In the second part of the study I analyze after which Czech Republic has entered the EU till present and I describe the process <b>of</b> <b>cofinancing</b> by the EU and it's structural funds and Cohesion fund in the budget period from 2004 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2013. Than I compare these two periods and my aim is to find out the influence of drawing the funds on the transport policy in Czech Republic. I also chose two projects and I would like to analyze them. The first project is about building-up the orbital of Holice city, funded only by the state and the second one is about building-up the motorway I/ 34 Stráž nad Nežárkou, funded by both state and EU. By analyzing these two projects, I am going to find more economically efficient way of financing...|$|R
