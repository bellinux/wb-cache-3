40|$|Conservation farming (CF) {{offers a}} set of {{sustainable}} agronomic practices for Zambian smallholder farmers using either <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> or animal draft tillage. The CF package includes dry-season land preparation using minimum tillage methods (<b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> basins or ADP ripping), crop residue retention, precision input application (in a precise grid of planting basins or along rip lines), and nitrogen-fixing crop rotations. These practices aim to improve soil structure and water retention and {{reduce the need for}} chemical fertilizers {{while at the same time}} increasing crop yield. Yet CF also increases weeding labor, at least in the early years following adoption. Using survey data from the 2001 / 2 cropping season, this paper evaluates yield gains against input usage increases in order to assess financial incentives for farmers to switch from conventional to CF tillage systems.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the impact of tillage system in combination with different herbicides on weed density, diversity, crop growth and yields on 18 farms in Kadoma, Zimbabwe. Experiments were set up as a split plot design with three replications on each farm. Tillage was the main plot (Conservation Tillage (CT), Conventional Tillage (CONV)) and weeding option (hand weeding, cyanazine, atrazine, glyphosate only and mixture of cyanazine + alachlor and atrazine + alachlor) as the sub-plots. Due to the heterogeneous nature of farmers' resource base, the farms were grouped into three farm types: high (Type 1), medium (Type 2) and poorly resourced farmers (Type 3). The <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> weeded treatments had 49 percent higher total weed densities in CT relative to CONV, and was statistically similar to the glyphosate treatment. The mixed pre-emergence herbicides reduced the diversity indices by 69 and 70 percent {{when compared to the}} <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> weeded treatment under CT in cotton and maize, respectively. The effectiveness of all pre-emergence herbicides were not influenced by tillage but were affected by farmers resource endowments with pronounced effect in Farm Type 1. Maximum plant heights of 85 and 238 cm were recorded for mixed pre-emergence herbicides under CT for cotton and maize, respectively. Minimum plant heights of 75 and 217 cm were recorded for the respective <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> weeded treatments. The <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> weeded treatments resulted in average cotton lint yield of 1497 and 2018 kg ha− 1 for maize.

40|$|In South Kivu (RD-Congo), Rwanda and Burundi, bananas (AAA-EA, Musa spp.) are {{frequently}} intercropped with annual crops, of which common bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{are the most}} common. At the onset of each rainy season, the soil in between the bananas is tilled manually using a <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> or a fork up to 10 - 15 cm depth to prepare the seedbed. Farmers believe that tillage favors the bean performance, {{but it may also}} seriously damage the superficial banana root system. This may negatively affect banana productivity and nematode and fungal disease pressure on banana roots. The aim of the research was {{to assess the impact of}} tillage on the banana root systems and growth 12 months after the application of no-till. We monitored characteristics of primary roots (biomass, length, nematode infection rate) in the topsoil (0 - 20 cm) on a monthly basis for a 6 months period in three on-farm trials. Mature banana plantations were subjected to no-till, tillage using a hoe, and tillage using a forked hoe. The latter was to test whether the fork would cause less damage to the root systems than conventional tillage. Immediately after tillage, <b>hand</b> <b>hoe</b> tillage reduced the root biomass by 85 % on average in the top 10 cm compared to no-till plots, with no significant differences between tillage methods. There was no effect of tillage below this depth. Both in terms of length and biomass, roots recovered within 2 to 3 months to levels similar to no-till plots in a radius of 45 cm around the tree. Nematode infection rates were similar across treatments. Pseudo-stem volume of the banana trees did not differ significantly between tilled and no-till plots during the trial period. <b>Hand</b> <b>hoe</b> and fork affected at the same level the banana root system in the top 10 cm. We conclude that tillage strongly, but temporarily, damages the banana root system in the top 10 cm, which represents 24 - 50 % of the total root biomass between 0 and 20 cm depth. The decrease in root length and biomass in the topsoil may have adverse effects on the banana productivity, but longer term monitoring is required to quantify these effects on yield.

In Zimbabwe, 74 % of smallholder farming areas are located in semi-arid areas mostly in areas with soils of low fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant crop in these areas, maize (Zea mays L.), is susceptible to drought. Under smallholder farming in Zimbabwe, conventional tillage entails cutting and turning the soil with a mouldboard plough thereby burying weeds and crop residues. Seed is planted by hand into a furrow made by the plough, ensuring that crops germinate in relatively weed free seedbeds. Inter-row weed control is performed using the plough or ox-drawn cultivators and <b>hand</b> <b>hoes.</b> Conventional tillage has been criticised for failure to alleviate negative effects of long dry spells on crops and to combat soil loss caused by water erosion estimated at 50 to 80 t ha- 1 yr- 1. Therefore, conservation tillage has been explored for improving {{soil and water conservation}} and crop yields. Our objective was to determine the maize yield advantage of the introduced technology (conservation tillage) over conventional tillage (farmers’ practice) based on a review of experiments in semi-arid Zimbabwe. We use a broad definition of conservation tillage instead of the common definition of = 30 % cover after planting. Eight tillage experiments conducted between 1984 and 2008 were evaluated. Conventional tillage included ploughing using the mouldboard plough and digging using a <b>hand</b> <b>hoe.</b> Conservation tillage included tied ridging (furrow diking), mulch ripping, clean ripping and planting pits. Field-edge methods included bench terraces (fanya juus) and infiltration pits. Results showed small yield advantages of conservation tillage methods below 500 mm rainfall. For grain yields = 2. 5 t ha- 1 and rainfall = 500 mm, 1. 0 m tied ridging produced 144 kg ha- 1 and mulch ripping 344 kg ha- 1 more than conventional tillage. Above 2. 5 t ha- 1 and for rainfall > 500 mm, conventional tillage had = 640 kg ha- 1 yield advantage. Planting pits had similar performance to ripping and conventional tillage but faced digging labour constraints.

Runoff volumes and eroded soil were measured at 4 experimental runoff plots, 20 m× 2 m in dimension, with different treatments; millet cultivation with manure and crop residue application before the onset of the season (MM), millet cultivation with no fertility management (M), bare surface (B) and bare surface with stone lines at 10 m interval (BS.) All plots received weeding tillage twice with traditional <b>hand</b> <b>hoes</b> during the season. A Tension Disk Infiltrometer was used to measure changes in infiltration rates in these plots and in the surrounding field. Throughout the growing season, the total runoff from the M and the B amounted to 13 - 15 % and 21 - 23 % of the total rainfall, respectively. These two plots showed same runoff characteristics until leaf area index of the millet became significant to intercept the rain. Runoff from the MM was remarkably less than that of the M and the B until the first weedin...|$|R
