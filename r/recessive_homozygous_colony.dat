40|$|Apple scab {{caused by}} Venturia inaequalis, is an {{important}} disease, spread worldwide, having a major negative impact in apple production. In this study, there were analyzed four apple cultivars (Liberty, Florina, Starkrimson, Golden Spur), used as genitors in a diallel cross, and their seedlings. In the field, plants selection was done after {{presence or absence of}} the scab on leaves, and afterwards, phenotipically selection was completed by marker assisted selection. The molecular analysis conducted with the markers AL- 07, AM- 19 and U 1400, detects the presence of the Vf gene, introgressed from Malus floribunda 821, which confers resistance to the pathogen, in the parental cultivars Liberty and Florina, and in all the F 1 hybrids belonging these two genitors. Starkrimson and Golden Spur were susceptible scab parents with <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> genotype (vfvf), while Liberty and Florina were identified as heterozygous scab resistant parents with genotype (Vfvf). From the 60 apple seedlings analyzed, grouped in six combinations after their genitors (in each combinations were selected ten hybrids, among them five resistant and five susceptible to apple scab attack) 28 were resistant and heterozygous for Vf gene (Vfvf) and 32 were susceptible to scab with <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> genotypes (vfvf), being obtained almost Mendelian ratio for response to the pathogen, 50 % resistant: 50 % susceptible. Seedlings belonging to Starkrimson x Golden Spur were only <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> genotype (vfvf), and in combination resistant x resistant (Liberty x Florina) were identified susceptible and resistant offspring, but at last, only with heterozygous for Vf gene (Vfvf) and no one with dominant homozygous genotypes (VfVf) ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{development}} of invasive Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) disease after prior immunization with the Hib conjugate vaccine (ie, Hib vaccine failure) is extremely rare, suggesting that affected children {{may have an}} underlying genetic susceptibility in their immune response. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to affect function in biologically plausible genes in relation to the risk of Hib vaccine failure and its clinical manifestations. METHODS: The families of UK children with Hib vaccine failure diagnosed during the period October 1992 through December 2005 were identified through enhanced national surveillance and approached for the study at a median interval of 4 years after invasive disease. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data sets were used as controls. Nineteen functional SNPs in 14 immune response genes were investigated in 172 white children. RESULTS: The <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> genotype for a SNP in the TIRAP (also known as MAL) gene (rs 1893352) that is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r 2 = 0. 93) with the known functional Ser 180 Leu polymorphism in white persons was strongly associated with nonmeningitis cases of Hib vaccine failure (odds ratio, 5. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 7 - 11. 5; P= 1. 2 x 10 (- 7)). In addition, the <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> genotype for another SNP (rs 1554286) in strong linkage disequilibrium with both the C- 819 T (r 2 = 0. 87) and C- 592 A (r 2 = 0. 75) promoter polymorphisms in the interleukin- 10 gene was associated with epiglottitis only (odds ratio, 5. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 4 - 14. 2; P= 1. 1 x 10 (- 5)).

40|$|A {{supposed}} sporulation-deficient mutation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is found}} to affect mating in haploids and in diploids, and to be inseparable from the mating-type locus by recombination. The mutation {{is regarded as a}} defective a allele and is designated a*. This is confirmed by its dominance relations in diploids, triploids, and tetraploids. Tetrad analysis of tetraploids and of their sporulating diploid progeny suggests the existence of an additional locus, RME, which regulates sporulation in yeast strains that can mate. Thus the <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> constitution rme/rme enables the diploids a*/α, a/a*, and α/α to go through meiosis. Haploids carrying rme show apparent premeiotic DNA replication in sporulation conditions.

We identified eligible studies through a comprehensive literature search to determine whether an association exists between XRCC 1 gene polymorphisms and CAD susceptibility. Findings were assessed using the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval (CI), which were calculated using a fixed- or random-effects model, based on the heterogeneity of the studies. Ten eligible studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. Our pooled analysis found that XRCC 1 polymorphisms {{were significantly associated with}} CAD susceptibility under recessive (Arg 194 Trp: OR = 1. 47, 95 % CI = 1. 13 - 1. 93; Arg 399 Gln: OR = 1. 45, 95 % CI = 1. 12 - 1. 89), homozygous (Arg 194 Trp: OR = 1. 37, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 81; Arg 399 Gln: OR = 1. 56, 95 % CI = 1. 19 - 2. 05), and allele (Arg 399 Gln: OR = 1. 18, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 1. 32) genetic models. Following subgroup analysis by ethnicity, in Asian populations, we found evidence of associations between the XRCC 1 Arg 194 Trp polymorphism and CAD under <b>recessive</b> and <b>homozygous</b> genetic models, and between the XRCC 1 Arg 399 Gln polymorphism and CAD under <b>recessive,</b> <b>homozygous,</b> and allele genetic models.

In the present study genetics of peanut nonnodulation was investigated in four crosses from data on F 2 populations and F 3 progenies from nonnodulating F 2 plants. The F 2 data of all the four crosses studied showed a better fit for a trigenic ratio of 61 nodulating to three nonnodulating plants compared to the previously reported duplicate digenic ratio of 15 nodulating to one nonnodulating F, plants. Further, the segregation of F 2 progenies from nonnodulating F 2 plants indicated the inadequacy of the duplicate factor model. A new genetic model involving three genes in the inheritance of nonnodulation is proposed. Two genes produce nodulation while the third gene inhibits nodulation only when it is dominant and the former two genes are in <b>recessive</b> <b>homozygous</b> condition. By assuming differential heterozygosity at the three loci of the parents involved in various crosses, the duplicate factor and monogenic ratios reported by previous workers on nonnodulation could be explained by the new model.

The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria was noticeably decreased in R plants under both paddy and upland conditions (0. 8 % and 3. 0 %, respectively) relative to those in D plants (10. 3 % and 17. 4 %, respectively). Population shifts of the Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales were mainly responsible for this low abundance in R plants. The abundance of Anaerolineae (Chloroflexi) and Clostridia (Firmicutes) was increased in R plants under paddy conditions. The abundance of a subpopulation of Actinobacteria (Saccharothrix spp. and unclassified Actinosynnemataceae) was increased in R plants under upland conditions. Principal coordinate analysis revealed unidirectional community shifts in relation to OsCCaMK gene dosage under both conditions.

Similarly, <b>homozygous</b> <b>recessive</b> condition of the other gene, g 2 g 2 has {{the same effect on}} the dominance relationship at the g 1 locus.

Therefore, the genotypes G 1 g 1 g 2 g 2, g 1 g 1 G 2 g 2 and g 1 g 1 g 2 g 2 all produce glandless condition; hence, the F 2 phenotypic ratio 11 : 5 was observed.
