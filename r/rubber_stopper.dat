5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper,</b> a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
2500|$|A Vacutainer blood {{collection}} tube is a sterile glass tube with a colored <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> [...] creating a vacuum seal {{inside of the}} tube facilitating the drawing of a predetermined volume of liquid.

Tubes are available with a safety-engineered closure (<b>rubber</b> <b>stopper),</b> {{with a variety of}} labeling options and stopper colors as well as a range of draw volumes.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "dry ice bomb" [...] is a balloon-like device using dry ice in {{a sealed}} {{container}} such as a plastic bottle. [...] Water is usually added to accelerate the sublimation of the dry ice. As the dry ice sublimes, pressure increases, causing the bottle to burst causing a loud noise that can be avoided when a #3 <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> replaces the screw on cap to make a water rocket with a two-liter bottle.|$|E

40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) rates in aquatic environments are {{often based on}} the incubation of water samples, during which the consumption of methane (CH 4) is monitored. Typically, incubation vessels are sealed with butyl rubber because these elastomers are essentially impermeable for gases. We report on the potential toxicity of five different commercially available, lab-grade butyl stoppers on MOx activity in samples from marine and lacustrine environments. MOx rates in incubations sealed with non-halogenated butyl were > 50 % lower compared to parallel incubations with halogenated butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers,</b> suggesting toxic effects {{associated with the use}} of the non-halogenated butyl type. Aqueous extracts of non-halogenated butyl rubber were contaminated with high amounts of various organic compounds including potential bactericides such as benzyltoluenes and phenylalkanes. Comparably small amounts of organic contaminants were liberated from the halogenated butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> but only two halogenated stopper types were found that did not seem to leach any organics into the incubation medium. Furthermore, the non-halogenated and two types of the halogenated butyl elastomers additionally leached comparably high amounts of zinc. While the source of the apparent toxicity with the use of the non-halogenated <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> remains elusive, our results indicate that leaching of contaminants from some butyl <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> can severely interfere with the activity of MOx communities, highlighting the importance of testing <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> for their respective contamination potential. The impact of leachates from butyl rubber on the assessment of biogeochemical reaction rates other than MOx seems likely but needs to be verified...|$|R
2500|$|Non-traditional didgeridoos {{can also}} be made from PVC piping, {{non-native}} hard woods (typically split, hollowed and rejoined), glass, fiberglass, metal, agave, clay, hemp (in {{the form of a}} bioplastic named zelfo), and even carbon fibre. These didges typically have an upper inside diameter of around 1.25" [...] down to a bell end of anywhere between two and eight inches and have a length corresponding to the desired key. The mouthpiece can be constructed of beeswax, hardwood or simply sanded and sized by the craftsman. In PVC, an appropriately sized <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> with a hole cut into it is equally acceptable, or to finely sand and buff the end of the pipe to create a comfortable mouthpiece.|$|E
2500|$|Metabolic chambers: Chambers may be {{glass jars}} with rubber {{stoppers}} for lids; syringe barrels for small animals and insects; or constructed from Plexiglas. Ideally, chambers should be constructed from inert materials; for example, the acrylic plastics can absorb O2 {{and may be}} a poor choice for respirometry with very small insects. Chambers need to be constructed {{in a manner that}} yields rapid mixing of gases within the chamber. [...] The simplest metabolic chamber for a small vertebrate might be a glass jar with a stopper. [...] The stoppers are fitted with two ports: short extensions of Teflon tubing are provided for line connections. Teflon tube extensions are pushed through the bulkhead and the line connection is finished by attaching a small hose clip {{to the base of the}} Teflon tube extension. Additionally, an extension to the inlet port inside the jar should be provided—this ensures that the animal's expiratory gases are not washed away by the in flow stream. The animal is sealed inside and the <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> is held in place with Velcro straps. If an upstream system is used, any metabolic chamber leak will result in loss of animal air and, therefore, an underestimate of the animal's metabolic rate. When you close an animal inside a metabolic chamber, attention must be paid to the seal. To ensure tight seals before closing the lid, firmly work the stopper into the jar and make sure that it is even. Use 1-2 straps (2 are better) and pull tightly. Acrylic (Plexiglas) chambers will be constructed for some uses, but precise engineering will be needed to ensure proper seating; gaskets will help, and judicious use of tight-fitting clamps will minimize leaks.|$|E
50|$|Generally, in laboratory, {{the sizes}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> can be varied up to {{approximately}} 16 sizes and each of it is specific to certain type of container. As the <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> is used in many experiment, some specific experiment requires a specific material. For example, the M35 Green Neoprene is for chemical resistance. For food fermentation, M18 white natural gum is preferred. For high temperature application, red or white silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>stopper</b> should be used.|$|E
50|$|Septa (singular: septum) are <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> which seal flasks or bottles. They give an {{air-tight}} seal, {{preventing the}} ingress of the atmosphere, but {{are able to}} be pierced by sharp needles or cannulae.|$|R

50|$|The pan flute's {{tubes are}} stopped at one end, {{at which the}} {{standing}} wave is reflected giving a note an octave lower than that produced by an open pipe of equal length. In the traditional South American style, pipes are fine-tuned to correct pitch by placing small pebbles or dry corn kernels {{into the bottom of}} the pipes. Contemporary makers of curved Romanian-style panpipes use wax (commonly beeswax) to tune new instruments. Special tools are used to place or remove the wax. Corks and <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> are also used, and are easier to quickly tune pipes.|$|R
40|$|A double-closured method {{introduced}} for Hungate tubes eliminates clamps {{or special}} racks {{to hold the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> in place while the tubes are being processed. The system prevents stoppers from being dislodged by gas-producing anaerobes and keeps the stoppers sterile so that the closed system of transfer can be conveniently utilized. Open and closed systems for handling a gas-producing anaerobe were compared. Ten tubes containing Clostridium perfringens were opened; the organism was detected in the air by use of an impingement collector. The gloved hand of the operator also revealed the test organism. A similar trial with culture material removed by the closed system (syringe transfer) resulted in no detectable contamination of the environment...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{conclusion}} of fermentation, the beer is carbonated {{before it is}} consumed. This is typically done {{in one of two}} ways; force carbonation in a keg using compressed carbon dioxide, or bottle carbonation with priming sugar. Any bottle that is able to withstand the pressure of carbonation can be used, such as used beer bottles, flip-top bottles with <b>rubber</b> <b>stoppers</b> such as Grolsch, or even plastic bottles such as soda bottles, provided they are properly sanitized. Priming briefly reactivates the yeast that remains in the bottle, carbonating the brew. Homebrewed beers (filtering improves visual appearance of the product, but complicates carbonation). Bottled beer becomes clear quicker than kegged beer, since the yeast does not have as far to descend.|$|R
