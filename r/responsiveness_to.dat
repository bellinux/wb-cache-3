Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> handling and feeding; {{and the relative}} ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E

The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E

40|$|Price <b>responsiveness</b> {{is argued}} <b>to</b> be one {{important}} factor determining {{the possibility for}} a natural monopoly such as a district heating company to exercise its monopoly power. Increased price responsiveness, measured, for example, by the own price elasticity, reduces monopoly power, as consumers increasingly reduce demand {{as a response to}} a price increase. However, consumers in single houses having individual metering have presumably higher price <b>responsiveness</b> compared <b>to</b> consumers in residential buildings using collective metering. One major question raised in this paper is thus whether single houses show larger price <b>responsiveness</b> compared <b>to</b> residential buildings. Using cross-sectional data for 187 networks in Sweden for the year 2007 indicates that even if single houses have higher price responsiveness, district heating reveals in general a very inelastic behavior...|$|R

In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{improving}} the UN's effectiveness and <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> international security threats often include {{reform of the}} UNSC veto.

Any reform of the veto will be very difficult. Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

5|$|Individuals with AS {{often have}} {{excellent}} auditory and visual perception. Children with ASD often demonstrate enhanced perception of {{small changes in}} patterns such as arrangements of objects or well-known images; typically this is domain-specific and involves processing of fine-grained features. Conversely, compared with individuals with high-functioning autism, individuals with AS have deficits in some tasks involving visual-spatial perception, auditory perception, or visual memory. Many accounts of individuals with AS and ASD report other unusual sensory and perceptual skills and experiences. They may be unusually sensitive or insensitive to sound, light, and other stimuli; these sensory responses are found in other developmental disorders and are not specific to AS or to ASD. There is little support for increased fight-or-flight response or failure of habituation in autism; there is more evidence of decreased <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> sensory stimuli, although several studies show no differences.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> serotonin.|$|E

He advocated a comprehensive workmen's compensation law, but the law that was passed in the 1914 General Assembly was later declared unconstitutional. He also recommended a requirement for full disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, {{but the majority of}} legislators in the House of Representatives voted to send it back to the Suffrage and Elections Committee, from whence it was never recalled. Although they did not pass a law regulating lobbying at the capitol – a law that McCreary supported – legislators showed <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> McCreary's desire for this reform by putting stricter regulations on who could be in the legislative chambers while the legislature was in session. Some reforms were made in the area of education. The school year was lengthened, school attendance for children was mandated, and the legislature created a Text Book Commission to assist local school boards in adopting textbooks. Public schools expenditures were increased by 25 percent.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present an}} {{implementation}} of the signal theory-based approach for detection of novel types of DNA similarity {{which are based on}} physical properties of DNA. Systematic study of the sensitivity of the new similarity measure revealed qualitative differences to letter-based similarity. A variety of physical parameters of DNA double strands, which in a straightforward way reflect different kinds of information hidden behind the primary structure of DNA, showed a wide range of recognition power of the signal similarity measure. We applied the novel DNA similarity measure for the analysis of promoters of E. coli genes. We found that promoter similarities revealed by our approach correlate with their transcription regulatory <b>responsivenesses</b> <b>to</b> different antibiotic and osmotic treatments.

25|$|Habituation {{involves}} decreased {{levels of}} attention and <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> a stimulus {{that is no longer}} perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, habituation refers to a decrease in <b>responsiveness</b> <b>to</b> an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the olfactory system. Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the olfactory system adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to play a very important role in the habituation of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to {{have an effect on the}} functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their responsiveness. Acetylcholine is also regarded as an important neurotransmitter involved in the habituation of olfactory stimulus, though the exact means through which it operates are not yet clear.|$|E

30|$|Qualitatively, these {{findings}} suggest that it is primarily the effect of the CRISIS that induces a greater responsiveness of the unemployment to vacancy developments relative to a decline in the EPL or the increase in the REFORMS index. Nevertheless, a lower EPL or a higher value of the REFORMS index is in fact reducing the <b>responsiveness</b> of unemployment <b>to</b> vacancy developments. Alternatively put, it is structural reforms at times of economic crisis that induce the greater <b>responsiveness</b> of unemployment <b>to</b> vacancy developments rather than reforms at regular economic times.|$|R

The development of a set of hypotheses supported by an online questionnaire to a valid sample of 755 participants, demonstrates that there is a relationship between factors such as expanded knowledge of the technology, and Bluetooth marketing receptivity.
