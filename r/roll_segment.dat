40|$|In {{three-roll}} planetary rolling process, {{there is}} secondary torsion phenomenon {{that may lead}} to rolling instability. This article proposed a new idea to alleviate the secondary torsion phenomenon by dividing the secondary torsion segment out of the roll as an independent and passive one. To study the performance of the <b>roll</b> with passive <b>segment,</b> the three-dimensional finite element models of planetary rolling process using actual roll or new <b>roll</b> with passive <b>segment</b> involving elastic–plastic and thermal–mechanical coupling were established by the software ABAQUS/Explicit, and a series of analysis had been done successfully. The rolling temperature and rolling force of planetary mill were in good agreement with the measured results, which indicated that the finite element method would supply important reference merit for three-dimensional thermo-mechanical simulation of the three-roll planetary rolling process. Comparing the simulation results of the two models, the results indicated that the change in the roll structure had just a little influence on the metal deformation, temperature, and rolling force, but it lessened the secondary torsion deformation effectively and improved the outside roundness of the rolled tube slightly. The research provided a new idea for the roll design of three-roll planetary mill (PSW) ...|$|R

40|$|An excised tissue system {{consisting}} of corolla rib segments {{was developed to}} study the relationship between senescence and ethylene production in morning-glory flowers (Ipomoea tricolor). Such segments, isolated 1 or 2 days (day − 1 or day − 2) before flower opening (day 0) passed through the same developmental phases as did the corresponding tissues of the intact organ.

40|$|In a {{prospective}} study, 218 cardiothoracic patients, in whom 'Abbocath-T' cannulae had been inserted preoperatively into the internal jugular vein, were randomized to receive skin {{preparation of the}} insertion site with tincture of iodine (108 controls) or tincture of iodine followed by application of sterile 2 % calcium mupirocin ointment (110 test patients). Cannulae were usually removed within 48 h of the operation. Patients receiving mupirocin {{were less likely to}} develop significant colonization of one or more of their cannulae as judged by Maki's criterion of a yield of greater than 15 colony forming units (cfu) from a cannula <b>segment</b> <b>rolled</b> on an agar plate (17 % of mupirocin treated patients compared with 54 % of the controls, P less than 0. 001). Coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, or both, were the commonest isolates and were cultured from 70 % of the 186 control cannulae compared with 24 % of 172 cannulae inserted through mupirocin-treated skin (P less than 0. 001). A count of more than 15 cfu was found on the tips of 25 % control cannulae compared with 5 % of the cannulae from mupirocin-treated patients, an effect which was independent of in-situ time (P less than 0. 001). For cannulae with colonized tips, the same species was isolated from the skin of the insertion site in 67 %, from the exterior of the hub in 61 % and from the lumen in only 15 %. There were no side effects attributed to mupirocin or superinfection with resistant organisms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to examine vestibular contributions at specific times during the initiation of walking in human subjects. Subjects began walking forward {{at the sound of}} an auditory tone, with vision present or occluded. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was delivered with the anode electrode on the right or left side at either: (1) onset of the anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), (2) toe-off of the first swing limb (TO) or (3) heel contact of the first swing limb (HC). Ground reaction forces and kinematic data were collected. Upper body (roll angles from head, trunk and pelvis) and lower body (foot placement) data were analysed to determine whether the timing and magnitude of the response to GVS, and therefore the level of vestibular contribution, was modulated at different points during the initiation of gait. With vision present and occluded, the magnitude of the lower body response varied depending on the event in the gait cycle at which the stimulation was delivered. These novel results demonstrate evidence that vestibular weighting during gait initiation is dependent upon the specific gait initiation events. Upper body roll also exhibited magnitude differences between events. However, these changes are proposed to occur due to the transition from a stationary position into a dynamic state, prompting the increased weighting of vestibular information. With vision present no significant changes were seen in the <b>segment</b> <b>roll</b> response. The observations suggest a distinction in vestibular regulation of upper body roll versus foot placement for successful completion of the gait initiation task. Changes in upper body roll are influenced by the dynamic nature of the task, whereas foot placement changes are modulated based on the event during gait initiation at which GVS is delivered...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} interaction between visual and vestibular information during the transition from quiet standing to the completion of a forward step. Six subjects were asked to take one step forward at the sound of an audio tone, with their eyes open or closed, and terminate the step in a standing position. During stimulation trials, galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) was delivered 1500 ms before the auditory cue. GVS was delivered at an intensity three-fold that of each subject 2 ̆ 7 s quiet stance threshold with either stimulus right, left or no stimulation. Force data were collected from three forceplates for the calculation of centre of pressure (CoP), and kinematic data were used to calculate centre of mass (CoM) and body trajectories. In quiet stance all subjects responded to the GVS perturbation by demonstrating upper body <b>segment</b> <b>roll</b> and whole body sway towards the anode electrode. Unexpectedly, in the presence of vision during quiet stance, the upper body roll response was not attenuated, even though the CoP sway patterns were reduced when vision was available. During the initiation phase of the step, despite ongoing GVS stimulation, there were no significant effects seen in CoM, CoP or upper body roll responses. During step execution, however, both CoM displacement and upper body roll demonstrated significant effects and both responses were significantly reduced when subjects 2 ̆ 7 eyes were open. Analysis of the medio-lateral CoP integrals also indicated a strong stimulation effect between conditions late in the execution phase, which were largely attenuated with vision. The results suggest that the importance of visual and vestibular information varies depending on the phase of the task. In addition, the different integration between visual and vestibular input during quiet standing suggests a dual role for vestibular information. We propose that vestibular information in quiet standing has a role in maintaining whole body postural stability, as well as playing an integral role in the alignment of the body segments in preparation for proper movement execution. Vision was demonstrated to differentially attenuate these responses based on the phase of the task. Thus, visual and vestibular information appear to be integrated differently across the different phases of a forward-stepping task...|$|R
40|$|Part I The forced Korteweg-de Vries {{model has}} been found {{satisfactory}} in predicting the periodic generation of upstream-advancing solitary waves by a bottom topography moving in a layer of shallow water with a steady transcritical velocity. It is also known that with certain characteristic forcing distributions, there exist waves, according to the fKdV model, which can remain steady in accompanying the characteristic forcing, provided such a wave exists initially, whereas for a different initial condition the phenomenon of periodic generation can still manifest itself. The stability of two such transcritically forced steady solitary waves is investigated, with their bifurcation diagrams determined {{with respect to the}} velocity and the amplitude of the forcing as parameters. The linear stability analysis is first carried out; it involves solving a singular, non-self-adjoint eigenvalue problem, which is examined by applying techniques of matched asymptotic expansions with suitable multiscales for singular perturbations, about the isolated bifurcation points of the parameters. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the full range of the parameters are then obtained by numerically summing a power series expansion for the solution. The numerical results, which accurately match with the local analysis, show that the eigenvalues have only four branches σ = ±σ r ±iσ i. The real part σ r is nonvanishing for the velocity less than a certain supercritical value and for the amplitude greater than a certain marginal bound except at a single point in the parametric plane at which the external forcings vanish, reducing the forced waves to the classical free solitary wave. Within this parametric range, the real part of the four eigenvalues is algebraically two to five orders smaller than the imaginary part σ i, wherever σ i exists; such a small σ r indicates physically a weak exponential growth rate of perturbed solutions and mathematically the need of a very accurate numerical method for its determination. Beyond this parametric range, linear stability theory appears to fail because no eigenvalues can there be found to exist. In this latter case a non linear analysis based on the functional Hamiltonian formulation is found to prevail, and our analysis predicts stability. Finally, extensive numerical simulations using various finite difference schemes are pursued, with results providing full confirmation to the predictions made in various regimes by the analysis. We consider the Korteweg-de Vries equation in the semi-infinite real line with a boundary condition at the origin. The numerical investigations of Chu et al. [2], are revisited and different new forms for the boundary forcing are assumed. In order to provide some qualitative description for the numerical simulations we develop a simple model based on the IST formalism. It is found that the model is also able to provide some quantitative predictions in agreement with the numerical results. Part II There has been considerable interest recently on chaotic advection, for the first time explored in the context of Rayleigh-Benard roll (2 D) convection by the experimental work of J. Gollub and collaborators. When the Rayleigh number increases across a (supercritical) value, depending on the wavelength of the rolls, an oscillatory instability sets in. The flow near the onset of the instability can still be modelled by a stream function, which can be split into a time independent part plus a small time dependent perturbation. The motion of fluid particles can therefore be regarded as the flow for a near integrable, "one-and a half" degree of freedom Hamiltonian vector field, with the phase space corresponding to the physical domain. In absence of molecular diffusivity, the evolution of a certain region of phase space can thus be viewed as the motion of a dyed part of fluid, when the tracer is perfectly passive. The most important objects for a theory of transport are the invariant manifolds for the Poincare map of the flow homoclinic to fixed points, which physically correspond to the stagnation points. As fluid particles cannot cross invariant lines, these curves constitute a sort of "template" for their motion. For the time independent flow, the invariant manifolds connect the stagnation points and define the roll boundaries. Thus, no transport from roll to roll can occur in this case. Switching the perturbation on, these connections are broken and the manifolds are free to wander along the array of <b>rolls.</b> We use <b>segments</b> of stable and unstable manifold to define the time dependent analogue of the roll boundaries. Transport of fluid across a boundary can then be attributed to the way a region bounded by segments of stable and unstable manifold, or "lobe," is evolving under map iterations. This allows us to write explicit formulae for describing the fluid transport in terms of a few of these lobes, for a general cross section defining the Poincare map. Using the symmetries of special cross sections, we are able to further reduce the number of necessary lobes to just one. Furthermore, these symmetries allow us to derive analytically a lower and upper bound for the first time tracer invades a roll, and a lower bound on the stretching of the interface between dyed and clear fluid. These results are independent {{of the fact that the}} perturbation is small. When this is the case however, the analytical tools of the Melnikov and subharmonic Melnikov functions are available, so that an approximation to the lobe areas and location and size of the island bands can be determined analytically. It turns out that in our case these approximations are quite good, even for relatively large perturbations. The results we have produced regarding the strong dependence of transport on the period of the oscillation suggest an effect for which no experimental verification is currently available. The presence of molecular diffusivity introduces a (long) time scale into the problem. We discuss the applicability of the theory in this situation, by introducing a simple rule for determining when the effects of diffusivity are negligible, and perform numerical simulations of the flow in this case to provide an example. </p...|$|R
