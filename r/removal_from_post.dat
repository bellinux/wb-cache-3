40|$|International audienceMembrane gas {{absorption}} {{technology is}} a promising alternative for carbon dioxide (CO 2) <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>post</b> combustion coal-fired flue gases. This study examines an alternative which consists in absorbing CO 2 by ammonia aqueous solution in a membrane contactor to improve the capture processes and to intensify the gas-liquid transfer. Absorption measurements through a membrane contactor have been made. The influence of the material nature constituting the membrane and operating parameters on the capture efficiency has been studied. The results have shown {{that it is possible}} to capture CO 2 from ammonia through a membrane with capture efficiency greater than 90 %. The membrane limits ammonia losses but does not eliminate it...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of an active application of liquid etching, compared with the standard gel formulation on smear layer <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>post</b> space walls and push-out bond strength of luted fibre posts. METHODOLOGY: Human extracted teeth were collected and root filled. After post space preparation and cleaning with 10 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for 30 s, teeth were assigned to four groups (n = 11) according to etching procedure: (i) 37 % phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) gel; (ii) 37 % H 3 PO 4 liquid applied with an endodontic needle; (iii) 37 % H 3 PO 4 liquid applied with an Endovac; (iv) no etching procedure (control group). Three teeth per group were sectioned longitudinally and prepared for SEM examination to evaluate the presence of smear layer, debris, sealer/gutta-percha remnants, {{and the number of}} open tubules. Eight teeth per group were bonded with an etch-and-rinse adhesive, and fibre posts were luted with a resin-based cement. After cutting, specimens were prepared for a push-out test. Data were analysed by anova and post hoc tests (P < 0. 05). RESULTS: Improved smear layer removal was obtained in Group 2, followed by Group 1, Group 3, and the control group (P < 0. 05). The mean values for the bond strength of the push-out test were: Group 1, 8. 3 ± 2. 9 MPa (coronal); 7. 7 ± 3. 0 (middle); 3. 3 ± 1. 9 MPa (apical); Group 2, 7. 8 ± 2. 1 MPa (coronal); 6. 9 ± 3. 9 MPa (middle); 3. 7 ± 1. 3 MPa (apical); Group 3, 9. 7 ± 2. 8 MPa (coronal); 8. 6 ± 2. 1 MPa (middle); 6. 9 ± 2. 3 MPa (apical); and Group 4, 2. 9 ± 3. 0 MPa (coronal); 2. 6 ± 2. 0 MPa (middle); 1. 1 ± 2. 0 MPa (apical). CONCLUSIONS: Liquid phosphoric acid applied with an endodontic needle yielded better canal wall smear layer removal and higher bond strength values when an etch-and-rinse system was used...|$|E
