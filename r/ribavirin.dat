5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug <b>ribavirin</b> combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with <b>ribavirin,</b> a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E
25|$|Experimental data {{indicate}} that <b>ribavirin</b> may have useful activity against canine distemper. <b>Ribavirin</b> has also {{been used as a}} treatment for herpes simplex virus. One small study found that <b>ribavirin</b> treatment reduced the severity of herpes outbreaks and promoted recovery, as compared with placebo treatment. Another study found that <b>ribavirin</b> potentiated the antiviral effect of acyclovir.|$|E
25|$|The most {{successful}} <b>ribavirin</b> derivative {{to date is}} the 3-carboxamidine derivative of the parent 3-carboxamide, first reported in 1973 by J.T.Witkowski et al., and now called taribavirin (former names viramidine and ribamidine). This drug shows a similar spectrum of antiviral activity to <b>ribavirin,</b> which is not surprising {{as it is now}} known to be a pro-drug for <b>ribavirin.</b> Viramidine, however, has useful properties of less erythrocyte-trapping and better liver-targeting than <b>ribavirin.</b> The first property is due to viramidine's basic amidine group which inhibits drug entry into RBCs, and the second property is probably due to increased concentration of the enzymes which convert amidine to amide, in liver tissue. Viramidine is in phase III human trials and may one day be used in place of <b>ribavirin,</b> at least against certain kinds of viral hepatitis. Viramidine's slightly superior toxicological properties may eventually cause it to replace <b>ribavirin</b> in all uses of <b>ribavirin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of {{treatment}} with <b>ribavirin,</b> fatality rates {{are continuing to}} decline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin,</b> {{also known}} as tribavirin, is an {{antiviral}} medication used to treat RSV infection, hepatitis C, and viral hemorrhagic fever. For hepatitis C it is used with other medications such as simeprevir, sofosbuvir, peginterferon alfa-2b or peginterferon alfa-2a. Among the viral hemorrhagic fevers it is used for Lassa fever, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection but not Ebola or Marburg. <b>Ribavirin</b> is taken by mouth or inhaled.|$|E
25|$|Neither the {{combination}} of antivirals and interferons (<b>ribavirin</b> + interferon alfa-2a or interferon alfa-2b) nor corticosteroids improved outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> is {{also known}} to be {{ineffective}} against ebolaviruses despite its effectiveness against other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Lassa fever.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> is the INN and USAN, whereas tribavirin is the BAN. Brand {{names of}} generic forms include Copegus, Ribasphere, Rebetol.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that <b>ribavirin</b> was active against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses in culture and in animals, without undue toxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> {{was first}} made in 1972. This {{was done by}} {{researchers}} from International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation including Joseph T. Witkovski and Roland K. Robins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> {{should not}} be given with {{zidovudine}} because of the increased risk of anemia; concurrent use with didanosine should likewise be avoided because of {{an increased risk of}} mitochondrial toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of HCV therapy is permanent eradication of the virus. The secondary potential benefit of eradication is {{a reduction in}} the risk of liver failure and liver cancer. Currently, peginterferon alfa-2a plus <b>ribavirin</b> is the only FDA approved treatment for HIV–HCV co-infected patients. Interferons bind to specific cell surface receptors of virus-infected cells, which induces a complex cascade of protein-protein interactions and a rapid activation of gene transcription. The antiviral effects of interferons are mediated through inhibition of viral penetration or uncoating, inhibiting viral replication or translation of viral proteins, and/or viral assembly and release. The difference between peginterferon and interferon is the addition of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer. The addition of PEG decreases plasma clearance considerably, protects the molecule from proteolytic degradation and reduces its immunogenicity. Peak concentrations are approximately 1.5-2 fold higher than trough concentrations and the half-life is 80 hours (compared to 5.1 hours for interferon alpha-2a). <b>Ribavirin</b> is a synthetic nucleoside analogue, but its mechanism of action is not clearly established. <b>Ribavirin</b> inhibits the replication {{of a wide range of}} RNA and DNA viruses. Pharmacokinetics are similar in patients with HIV co-infection compared with HCV mono-infection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> is a purine {{nucleoside}} analogue that is generally {{used as an}} anti-viral medication. However, {{it has also been}} shown to decrease the amount of reactive astrocytes. Daily administration for at least five days following brain trauma was shown to significantly decrease the number of reactive astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|When rhesus macaques {{were given}} interferon-α2b and <b>ribavirin</b> and exposed to MERS, they {{developed}} less pneumonia than control animals. Five critically ill people with MERS in Saudi Arabia with ARDS and on ventilators were given interferon-α2b and <b>ribavirin</b> but all ended up dying of the disease. The treatment was started late in their disease (a mean of 19 days after hospital admission) {{and they had}} already failed trials of steroids so {{it remains to be}} seen whether it may have benefit earlier in the course of disease. Another proposed therapy is inhibition of viral protease or kinase enzymes. Researchers are investigating a number of ways to combat the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, including using interferon, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir, as well as other agents such as mycophenolic acid and camostat.|$|E
25|$|There is no vaccine. Prevention {{requires}} isolating {{those who}} are infected and decreasing contact with the rats. Efforts include having a cat to hunt vermin, and storing food in sealed containers. Treatment is directed at addressing dehydration and improving symptoms. The antiviral medication, <b>ribavirin</b> may be useful when given early. These measures improve outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> was {{patented}} in 1971 {{and approved}} {{for medical use}} in 1986. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States a course of treatment costs more than $USD 200.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{of these}} {{mechanisms}} explains ribavirin's effect on many DNA viruses, {{which is more}} of a mystery, especially given the complete inactivity of ribavirin's 2' deoxyribose analogue, which suggests that the drug functions only as an RNA nucleoside mimic, and never a DNA nucleoside mimic. <b>Ribavirin</b> 5'-monophosphate inhibits cellular inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, thereby depleting intracellular pools of GTP.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{guanosine}} (ribonucleic) analog used to stop viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping, thus, it is a nucleoside inhibitor. <b>Ribavirin</b> is a prodrug, which when metabolized resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this form, it {{interferes with}} RNA metabolism required for viral replication. Over five {{direct and indirect}} mechanisms have been proposed for its mechanism of action.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include feeling tired, headache, nausea, fever, muscle pains, and an {{irritable}} mood. Serious side effects include {{red blood cell}} breakdown, liver problems, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy results in harm to the baby. Effective birth control is recommended {{for both males and}} females for 7 months after use. The mechanism of action of <b>ribavirin</b> is not entirely clear.|$|E
25|$|Ribavirin's carboxamide {{group can}} make the native {{nucleoside}} drug resemble adenosine or guanosine, depending on its rotation. For this reason, when <b>ribavirin</b> is incorporated into RNA, as a base analog of either adenine or guanine, it pairs equally well with either uracil or cytosine, inducing mutations in RNA-dependent replication in RNA viruses. Such hypermutation can be lethal to RNA viruses.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} treatment or vaccine {{is available for}} thogotoviruses, as of February 2015. The antiviral drug <b>ribavirin,</b> which has {{a broad spectrum of}} activity that includes some other orthomyxoviruses, has been shown to inhibit DHOV replication in vitro in a single study. Supportive therapy is used for THOV disease, and has been recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for infection with Bourbon virus. As with other arboviruses, avoidance of contact with the vector is central to prevention.|$|E
25|$|In {{the trials}} {{described}} above, the only common predictor of SVR among all three was {{the treatment of}} HCV other than type 1.6-8 In the trial by Chung et al., patient characteristics that predicted an SVR were treatment with peginterferon and <b>ribavirin,</b> absence of prior drug abuse, a detectable level of HIV-1 RNA, and a Karnofsky score of 100. The Karnofsky score is a subjective measure of how well the patient is doing. A score of 100 indicates that the patient has no complaints or evidence of disease, a score of 50 indicates that the patient requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care, and a score of 0 indicates that the patient is dead. In the study by Carrat et al., no protease inhibitor therapy, an age of 40 years or younger, or a baseline alanine aminotransferase greater {{than three times the}} upper limit of normal predicted a sustained virological response. In the study by Torrani et al., SVR was predicted by HCV genotype other than 1 and a baseline HCV RNA level of 800,000 IU or less per milliliter.|$|E

On 17 March 2004, Conteh was {{infected with the}} Lassa virus when he received a needlestick injury while drawing blood from a young pregnant nurse suffering from the disease. The nurse died the next day, and Conteh himself became ill on 23 March. As his condition worsened, he was treated with intravenous <b>ribavirin.</b> Conteh initially survived the critical stage of Lassa fever, but died on 4 April from renal failure—18 days after first becoming infected with the Lassa virus.

2500|$|In the hamster {{model of}} yellow fever, early {{administration}} of the antiviral <b>ribavirin</b> is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease. <b>Ribavirin</b> treatment during the first five days after virus infection improved survival rates, reduced tissue damage in the liver and spleen, prevented hepatocellular steatosis, and normalised levels of alanine aminotransferase, a liver damage marker. The mechanism of action of <b>ribavirin</b> in reducing liver pathology in yellow fever virus infection may be similar to its activity in treatment of hepatitis C, a related virus. Because <b>ribavirin</b> had failed to improve survival in a virulent rhesus model of yellow fever infection, it had been previously discounted as a possible therapy.|$|E
2500|$|... {{clinically}} significant pancreatitis {{occurred in a}} patient who was receiving didanosine. In the last study, {{about the same number}} of patients dropped out of the study due to lab abnormalities, but the patients who dropped out from adverse reactions varied. Overall, most patients withdrew from the interferon plus <b>ribavirin</b> arm and the least from the peginterferon plus <b>ribavirin</b> arm.|$|E
2500|$|Early and {{aggressive}} treatment using <b>ribavirin</b> was pioneered by Joe McCormick in 1979. After extensive testing, [...] early administration {{was determined to}} be critical to success. Additionally, <b>ribavirin</b> is almost twice as effective when given intravenously as when taken by mouth. <b>Ribavirin</b> is a prodrug which appears to interfere with viral replication by inhibiting RNA-dependent nucleic acid synthesis, although the precise mechanism of action is disputed. The drug is relatively inexpensive, but the cost of the drug is still very high for many of those in West African states. Fluid replacement, blood transfusion, and fighting hypotension are usually required. Intravenous interferon therapy has also been used.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> is used {{primarily}} to treat hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fevers (which is an orphan indication in most countries). In this former indication the oral (capsule or tablet) form of <b>ribavirin</b> {{is used in}} combination with pegylated interferon alfa. Including in people coinfected with hepatitis B, HIV and in the pediatric population. Statins may improve this combination's efficacy in treating hepatitis C. <b>Ribavirin</b> is the only known treatment {{for a variety of}} viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection, although data regarding these infections are scarce and the drug might be effective only in early stages. It is noted by the USAMRIID that [...] "Ribavirin has poor in vitro and in vivo activity against the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and the flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, and Kyasanur forest disease)" [...] The aerosol form has been used in the past to treat respiratory syncytial virus-related diseases in children, although the evidence to support this is rather weak.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ribavirin</b> is {{possibly}} best {{viewed as a}} ribosyl purine analogue with an incomplete purine 6-membered ring. This structural resemblance historically prompted replacement of the 2' nitrogen of the triazole with a carbon (which becomes the 5' carbon in an imidazole), {{in an attempt to}} partly [...] "fill out" [...] the second ring--- but to no great effect. Such 5' imidazole riboside derivatives show antiviral activity with 5' hydrogen or halide, but the larger the substituent, the smaller the activity, and all proved less active than <b>ribavirin.</b> Note that two natural products were already known with this imidazole riboside structure: substitution at the 5' carbon with OH results in pyrazomycin/pyrazofurin, an antibiotic with antiviral properties but unacceptable toxicity, and replacement with an amino group results in the natural purine synthetic precursor 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), which has only modest antiviral properties.|$|E
2500|$|As {{for other}} flavivirus infections, [...] no cure {{is known for}} yellow fever. Hospitalization is {{advisable}} and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. Different methods for acute treatment of the disease have been shown not to be very successful; passive immunisation after emergence of symptoms is probably without effect. <b>Ribavirin</b> and other antiviral drugs, as well as treatment with interferons, {{do not have a}} positive effect in patients.|$|E
2500|$|Sofosbuvir for {{use against}} chronic {{hepatitis}} C infection {{was approved by}} the FDA December 6, 2013.

2500|$|This was a randomized, phase 3, open-label, {{parallel}} group study. Four hundred sixteen treatment naïve {{patients were}} assigned to 1.5µg/kg peginterferon alfa-2b once weekly plus <b>ribavirin</b> 800mg daily or 3 million units of standard interferon alfa-2a plus <b>ribavirin</b> 800mg daily for 48 weeks. [...] 6 Patients were evaluated at weeks 2 and 4, then every 4 weeks after treatment and then at weeks 4, 12, and 24 post-treatment until week 72 was reached. The primary end-point was a sustained viral response (SVR), defined as undetectable serum HCV-RNA at week 72. The secondary endpoint was histological improvement. In the standard interferon group, 20% of the 207 patients obtained an SVR, and in the peginterferon group 27% of the 205 patients (p=0.047) obtained an SVR. At week 24, undectable HCV RNA levels were achieved in 28% and 40% of patients, respectively (p=0.004), respectively. At 48 weeks, the end of treatment virologic responses were 21% and 35% of their respective groups (p=0.001). In patients who had genotype 1 or 4, peginterferon achieved {{a higher rate of}} SVR (17%) than interferon (6%) p=0.006. However, in genotypes 2, 3 or 5, the rates of SVR were similar. The withdrawal and adverse event rates were similar.|$|E
2500|$|A {{range of}} {{laboratory}} investigations are performed, where possible, to diagnose {{the disease and}} assess its course and complications. An ELISA test for antigen and IgM antibodies give 88% sensitivity and 90% specificity {{for the presence of}} the infection. Other laboratory findings in Lassa fever include lymphopenia (low white blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelets), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase [...] levels in the blood. Lassa fever virus can also be found in cerebrospinal fluid. In West Africa, where Lassa is most prevalent, it is difficult for doctors to diagnose due to the absence of proper equipment to perform tests. In cases with abdominal pain, in countries where Lassa is common, Lassa fever is often misdiagnosed for example as appendicitis and intussusception which delays treatment with the antiviral <b>ribavirin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|These {{drugs are}} used in various combinations, {{sometimes}} combined with <b>ribavirin,</b> based on the patient's genotype (delineated as genotypes 1-6). Genotype 1 (GT1), {{which is the most}} prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen. First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks. Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV) [...] has been estimated at US$94,500.|$|E
