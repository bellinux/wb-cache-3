2500|$|Some dancers {{themselves}} {{make this}} historical connection. [...] "When I do the dances, it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> younger years when I was doing similar dances during the Cultural Revolution," [...] a retired driver in her mid-60s told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. [...] "I {{feel the same}} kind of spirit and emotions." [...] Another woman, whose troupe used the [...] "red songs" [...] written during that era, was more political. [...] "The can always remind us what the Chinese leaders did for us to have a good life today and how they fought hard for the ordinary people in China." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
2500|$|The track [...] "Riding the Crest", {{named by}} Paul Waaktaar-Savoy as [...] "an electro-blues", is heavily {{inspired}} by Arcade Fire and their album Neon Bible. Being the principal songwriter on the album, Waaktaar-Savoy also got {{inspired by his}} changing surroundings, dividing his time between New York City and Oslo. [...] "“Shadowside“ feels quite Norwegian in the melody, the chords and the mood. [...] "The Bandstand" [...] <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> first trip to New York City in the early '80s, before A-ha were famous. Songs are like a photo-album – they can really send you back. And this one reminds me of arriving at Port Authority with [...] in my pocket, sporting really high, yellow, almost see-through synthesizer-hair, wearing a tiger-shirt and a brown suit, looking like an alien!" [...] The title track, [...] "Foot of the Mountain" [...] – examines {{one of the fundamental}} conflicts of modern life, the pull between nature and big-city civilization: for Paul, the buzz of New York City versus the beauty and isolation of Norway: [...] "It's the dilemma of loving a city life, yet secretly wondering if we'd be happier being surrounded by open fields and sweeping mountains." [...] "Real Meaning" [...] is inspired by Waaktaar-Savoy calling home only to be greeted by his answering machine. The idea behind [...] "Start the Simulator" [...] was to make a heartfelt song using technical language: [...] "The basic idea was to make a song using only technical terms and phrases, and still make it very emotional and personal. There is such poetry in the old Apollo manuals: [...] "switch to Omni Bravo" [...] and [...] "the bright ejector blanket." [...] The latter should probably be [...] "ejecta blanket." ...|$|E

60|$|MURRAY. You wrong me terribly. (Then frowning.) And it isn't {{charitable}} to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> job. I {{hoped to}} {{forget all about}} it up here.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you do. You <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> country itself--of the things that wait for me across the ocean." ...|$|R
60|$|LAMB I'm {{not so sure}} of that. She's got a way of {{shutting}} {{her mouth}} that <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "This hint <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mission," [...] Mr. Sharp re joined. [...] "The ladies {{desire to}} know your opinion {{of the state of}} the weather?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly {{that is a}} good {{sight to}} the eyes of a Scotsman," [...] said Heika, gazing with {{interest}} at the place where the fish had disappeared; [...] "it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> native land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The whole road {{has been}} <b>reminding</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> namesake Whittington," [...] said Richard, [...] "and that waggon is the {{finishing}} touch. Halloa! What's the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for <b>reminding</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> oath," [...] said the still resentful Ellen, biting her pretty nether lip with vexation; [...] "I might else have proved forgetful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|CRAMPTON (irritably). I {{advise you}} to get my tooth out and have done <b>reminding</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> wife. Come along, man. (He grips {{the arms of the}} chair and braces himself.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, {{they were}} arrested [...] "two weeks after the inquest." [...] What a home sound that has. That kind of police briskness rather more <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> native land than German journalism does.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I, Robin? I didn't mean to. But as I was saying, I'd like to {{call you}} Robin because it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> little darling {{who is now in}} heaven. Ah! Robin was so gentle, and loving, and tender, and true, and kind. He was a good boy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lenore, I like Mr. Dorn," [...] she said, meditatively. [...] "He has {{an old-fashioned}} manner that <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> boy friends when I was a girl. I mean he's more courteous and dignified than boys are nowadays. A splendid-looking boy, too. Only {{his face is}} so sad. When he smiles he seems another person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{has been}} a day of enjoyment, Mrs Todgers, but still it {{has been a}} day of torture. It has <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> loneliness. What am I in the world?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor do I now, Mr. Griffith; {{but you do}} well to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> former weakness, for the {{recollection}} of its folly and imprudence only adds to my present strength." ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{suppose that}} I am called here {{as an expert}} on education, for that would show a lack of {{foresight}} on your part and a deliberate intention to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shortcomings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like to see}} this," [...] {{continued}} Pathfinder; [...] "the salutes of two red-skins in the woods, Master Cap, {{are like}} the hailing of friendly vessels on the ocean. But speaking of water, it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> young friend, Jasper Western here, who can claim to know something of these matters, seeing that he has passed his days on Ontario." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I {{have been}} down with {{pleurisy}} but now convalesce; {{it was a}} slight attack, but I had a hot fever; pulse 150; and the thing <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> weakness. These miseries tell on me cruelly. But things are not so hopeless as they might be so I am far from despair. Besides I think I may say I have some courage for life.|$|E
6000|$|He always <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> poor Uncle Podger. You {{never saw}} such a commotion {{up and down}} a house, in all your life, as when my Uncle Podger {{undertook}} to do a job. A picture would have come home from the frame-maker’s, and be standing in the dining-room, waiting to be put up; and Aunt Podger would ask what was to be done with it, and Uncle Podger would say: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} must have been about that point that Dayton fled our presence, after some clumsy {{sentence}} that I decided upon reflection was intended to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> duty to my party.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And you, Miss Dacre, <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old friend, the Duchess of Nevers, {{who told}} me one day that {{in the course of}} her {{experience}} she had only met one man who was her rival in repartee.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Curious," [...] he thought. [...] "That dandified little clergyman has {{certainly}} <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> discussion with Emily, {{more than two}} months since. Was it his flowing hair, I wonder? or his splendid beard? Good God! suppose it should turn out--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “This {{discovery}} is too thundering bad for mere words,” {{he said with}} feeling; “but Miss Travers—Mildred—must know we’re all as sorry as she is. She {{was right about the}} laces, but the laces are all wrong. This sad exhibit <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own perverse mortgages, and my mortgages remind me of something else. Mildred,” he added, turning to the girl in a dogged and rather shamefaced way, “I’m going to hold a private conversation with you right here before our good friends, for I know every one of them will back me up. Eh?” he questioned, glancing around the group.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! my Laura (replied she hastily {{withdrawing}} her Eyes from {{a momentary}} {{glance at the}} sky) do not thus distress me by calling my Attention to an object which so cruelly <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Augustus's blue sattin waistcoat striped in white! In pity to your unhappy freind avoid a subject so distressing." [...] What could I do? The feelings of Sophia were at that time so exquisite, and the tenderness she felt for Augustus so poignant that I had not power to start any other topic, justly fearing that it might in some unforseen manner again awaken all her sensibility by directing her thoughts to her Husband. Yet to be silent would be cruel; she had intreated me to talk.|$|E
6000|$|Your {{enjoyment}} of England <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feelings {{on my first}} [...] visit there forty years ago nearly, when I landed in Devonshire in [...] the month of May or June and was so intoxicated with the roads and [...] lanes and hedges and fields and cottages and castles and inns that [...] I thought I should fairly expire with delight. You can't expatiate [...] too much for our entertainment on your impressions, though you make [...] us want consumedly {{to go over and}} follow in your footsteps. Wilky [...] has been at home now for 2 or 3 days and is very philosophic and [...] enthusiastic over your letters. I hoped to remember some of his [...] turns of speech for you, but one chases another out of my memory [...] and it is now all a blank. I will consult Alice's livelier one [...] before I close.|$|E
6000|$|... "She tied {{me to the}} bed-post with a long string, so that I {{could not}} {{go out of the}} room, and there I stayed all day with the little {{worn-out}} shoes hanging up before <b>me</b> to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{sound of}} soft steps somewhere near distracted <b>my</b> attention, <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> peril, and now, what counted more with me, made clear the {{probability}} of being discovered in Sally's room. [...] "I'll {{have to get out}} of here," [...] I whispered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I do {{anything}} more? Would {{you like my}} nosegay left in the room?--the flowers smell so fresh! I can easily get another. Look at the roses, my favourite white roses, that always <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own garden at the dear old Park!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own boyhood," [...] {{the general}} said. [...] "I like his looks, {{and it seems}} to me that he has the making of a good officer. All the {{officers}} of the regiment are men of good Scottish families, and as such can serve in any capacity. I have often need of a young officer who can carry my messages on a field of battle, and can be trusted to understand their import and deliver them faithfully. Now, Campbell," [...] he said, turning to the lad, who was standing with flushed face and eyes beaming with delight and gratitude, [...] "I will give you the choice. I will either appoint you a volunteer for a year, in which time, if your conduct is satisfactory, I will name you lieutenant, or I will take you directly into my own household. My object in either case would be to produce an officer likely to be useful to his Majesty.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{it comes}} back to the same thing," [...] she said. [...] "You must deceive the honest people, or you can do nothing for me. Amelius had better have left me where I was! I disgraced nobody, I was a burden to nobody, there. Cold and hunger and ill-treatment can {{sometimes}} be merciful friends, in their way. If I had been left to them, they would have laid me at rest by this time." [...] She turned to Rufus, before he could speak to her. [...] "I'm not ungrateful, sir; I'll think of it, as you say; and I'll do all that a poor foolish creature can do, to be worthy of the interest you take in me." [...] She lifted her hand to her head, with a momentary expression of pain. [...] "I've got a dull kind of aching here," [...] she said; [...] "it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old life, when I was sometimes beaten on the head. May I go and lie down a little, by myself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Beds {{were made}} {{ready for the}} two women, clothes of very various sizes for the Doctor and Jean-Marie; and for the {{remainder}} of the night, while madame dozed in and out on the borderland of hysterics, her husband sat beside the fire and held forth to the admiring neighbours. He showed them, at length, the causes of the accident; for years, he explained, the fall had been impending; one sign had followed another, the joints had opened, the plaster had cracked, the old walls bowed inward; last, not three weeks ago, the cellar door had begun to work with difficulty in its grooves. 'The cellar!' he said, gravely shaking his head over a glass of mulled wine. 'That <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> poor vintages. By a manifest providence the Hermitage was nearly at an end. One bottle--I lose but one bottle of that incomparable wine. It had been set apart against Jean- Marie's wedding. Well, I must lay down some more; it will be an interest in life. I am, however, a man somewhat advanced in years. My great work is now buried in the fall of my humble roof; it will never be completed--my name will have been writ in water. And yet you find me calm--I would say cheerful. Can your priest do more?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In God's name," [...] Roderick cried, [...] "don't <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> obligations! It 's {{intolerable}} to me, and I don't {{believe it}} 's pleasant to Mallet. I know they 're tremendous--I know I shall never repay them. I 'm bankrupt! Do {{you know what}} that means?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou <b>remindest</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> folly, good Gino. In aiding {{me on this}} occasion, thou wilt have thy own {{fortune in}} view, as thy efforts, like those of thy fellows, will be made in behalf of the lady to whom I have just plighted a husband's vows." ...|$|R
6000|$|But here Randolph, {{to evade}} further {{personal}} allusions, continued laughingly: [...] "And as I've LOST my 'trust,' I haven't even that {{to show in}} defense. Indeed, when you all are gone I shall have nothing to <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kind benefactor. It will seem like a dream." ...|$|R
