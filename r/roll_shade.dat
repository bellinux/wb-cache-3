50|$|The rear of {{the house}} faces a garden {{adjacent}} to a wooded public park. It has four large single-pane windows arranged in pairs, one window directly above the other, one window per floor. One pair serves the two-story living room and the other serves the space with the dining room downstairs and the bedroom upstairs. Each pair creates a nearly uninterrupted expanse of glass reaching {{from the bottom of the}} house to the top. These windows cannot be opened. They are provided with cloth <b>roll</b> <b>shades</b> for protection against the sun.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} several decades, shading devices such as blinds, louvers, <b>roll</b> <b>shades,</b> etc., have {{received}} much attention due to their roles as indoor environmental controllers (preventing glare, blocking shortwave radiation, and contributing to thermal comfort). In order to allow the aforementioned systems to act as true optimal controllers, a fast and accurate mathematical model that is able to predict the dynamic behavior {{of the system is}} necessary. This paper describes the development of a lumped simulation model of an indoor blind system adjacent to double glazing (6 mm clear+ 12 mm air + 6 mm low-e). This is typical of office building shading systems in Korea. Rather than attempting to develop the most detailed and accurate model of the system, the approach described in this paper is based on the postulated minimalistic model augmented with a parameter estimation technique. The lumped simulation model was validated with measurements obtained from an in-situ, full-scale experimental facility mounted on the south-facing façade. It was found that the calibration method delivers accurate results for the unknown parameters (convective heat transfer coefficients and air permeability of the shading device), allowing the calibrated lumped model to be used in ensuing optimal control and performance studies.

Jerry clips the hanger in Tom's jacket to a window-shade, then kicks Tom in the eye. Tom angrily pursues the fleeing mouse, but the <b>shade</b> <b>rolls</b> back taking Tom with it.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{watermark}} {{is called}} the cylinder mould watermark. It is a shaded watermark first used in 1848 that incorporates tonal depth and creates a greyscale image. Instead of using a wire covering for the dandy <b>roll,</b> the <b>shaded</b> watermark is created by areas of relief on the roll's own surface. Once dry, the paper may then be rolled again to produce a watermark of even thickness but with varying density. The resulting watermark is generally much clearer and more detailed than those made by the Dandy Roll process, and as such Cylinder Mould Watermark Paper is the preferred type of watermarked paper for banknotes, passports, motor vehicle titles, and other documents where {{it is an important}} anti-counterfeiting measure.|$|R

25|$|On a {{flatbed lorry}} driven {{in the streets}} of London, a {{motorcar}} is under a grey cover with the initials RR. The Rolls Royce is first purchased by Charles, Marquess of Frinton (Rex Harrison) as a 10th wedding anniversary present for his French wife, Eloise (Jeanne Moreau). Frinton is Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office. The marquess is a longtime horse owner who has his heart set on winning the Ascot Gold Cup. This year his horse, named 10 June (his wedding anniversary date; also the writer Terence Rattigan's birthday) is the favourite and does indeed win. Lord Frinton is presented the Gold Cup by King George V. However, his elation is blighted when he finds his wife with her lover, his underling John Fane (Edmund Purdom), {{in the back of the}} <b>Rolls</b> with the <b>shades</b> drawn. For appearance's sake, Lord Frinton will not divorce his wife, but he returns the car.|$|R
2500|$|... 20,023 miles later, Genoa, Italy — The Rolls, {{according}} to G. Bomba, {{owner of the}} Genova Auto Salon was “owned by a Maharajah, who lost his money at the San Remo Casino.” The Rolls is purchased by American gangster Paolo Maltese (George C. Scott). He is touring the sights of Italy with his bored fiancée Mae Jenkins (Shirley MacLaine) and his right-hand man Joey Friedlander (Art Carney). When Maltese returns to Miami {{to take care of}} some unsavory business, he leaves Friedlander to chaperone Jenkins. Friedlander turns a blind eye when she falls in love with Stefano (Alain Delon), a handsome young street photographer she had met while still with Maltese. Upon finding Jenkins and Stefano {{in the back of the}} <b>Rolls</b> with the <b>shades</b> drawn, Friedlander walks away. But he later shows Jenkins an eight-day-old American newspaper headline, Bugs O’ Leary Slain—Police Claim Gang Warfare, that was Maltese's business in the United States. Although in love with Stefano, Jenkins reluctantly leaves him, telling him that it was just a fling, to protect both of them from possible reprisal from her lethal boyfriend Maltese.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, issues {{regarding}} building stock are highly {{important in the}} quest to reduce overall UK energy consumption and finding prime targets for cuts in carbon emissions. Of all the main consumers of energy, the fact how occupants use and operate the building plays a crucial role. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have a thorough understanding of the occupant response to environmental controlling systems in buildings because the building should be designed not only to satisfy comfort requirements but also to be used with a low input of energy. This research can be seen as an attempt to explore such issues. It examines various environmental issues such as motivating forces and influential effects related to the occupant control behaviour with special attention to the usage of those simple, easy-to-use and robust means that the occupant is able to see and almost immediately experience the results of the actions. Two naturally ventilated buildings in Sheffield were selected as the study cases. Their architectural features were examined, including environmental situation, occupant identification and architectural speciality. Both buildings' blinds (<b>shading</b> <b>rolls)</b> and windows were recorded by photograph twice a day for 16 months continuously. At the same time, the outside hourly weather parameters and inside physical parameters were collected. A questionnaire survey and a face-to-face interview were also carried out in order to investigate the thermal, visual and acoustic comfort sensation and an indication of the motivating forces for manual control obtained. From a sustainability perspective, the study has provided knowledge that enables designers to anticipate how a design encourages that the sustainable interaction between the occupant operation behaviour, building components and/or systems, and conversely, avoid built conditions where occupant interaction may cause sustainable penalties. This understanding may well lead to the building using less energy to maintain comfort. The study could also provide opportunities for decision makers to understand the current situations of the buildings that were selected as case studies. The result of this research may be used as a work-base for successful improvement and give confidence to embark on the design of naturally ventilated buildings...|$|R
