FBU {{may be viewed as}} a regulatory response to widespread perceptions of a need to enhance corporate reporting, particularly as accounting and auditing continue to be subject to critical scrutiny in the aftermath of financial and economic crisis. FBU also specifically reflects the growing importance of narrative corporate reporting as, for example, in the issue of an International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) practice statement on management commentary and a trend of an increasing volume of narrative content in the annual reports of major companies. At the same time, academic research suggests that investors and other users are interested in assurance on the ‘front-half’ 1 of the annual report...|$|R

General business exceptions are cases that deviate from the normal behavior in a business process {{and need to be}} cared for in a unique manner, typically by human intervention. Their cause might include: process deviation, infrastructure or connectivity issues, external deviation, poor quality business rules, malformed data, etc. Management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> here is the practice of investigating, resolving and handling such occurrences by using skilled staff and software tools. Good management can contribute to efficiency of business processes. Often in these cases the process will be called exception management, as exceptional cases are not the sole focus of the managerial policy, and exception management (as opposed to management <b>by</b> <b>exception)</b> denotes a more moderate application of the process.|$|R

50|$|Management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (MBE), {{when applied}} to {{business}} is a style of management that gives employees the responsibility to take decisions and to fulfill their work or projects by themselves. It consists of focus and analysis of statistically relevant anomalies in the data. If an unusual situation or deviation in the recorded data appears, which could cause difficulties for the business and can’t be managed by the employee at his level, the employee should pass the decision {{on to the next}} higher level. For example, if all products are selling at their expected volumes for the quarter, except one particular product which is underperforming or overperforming at a statistically relevant margin, only the data for that product will be presented to the managers for further investigation and discovery of the root cause. Management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> can bring forward business errors and oversights, ineffective strategies that need to be improved, changes in competition and business opportunities. Management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is intended to reduce the managerial load and enable managers to spend their time more effectively in areas where it will have the most impact.|$|R

Both of these concepts {{were based on}} the philosophy of providing information that {{is directly related to the}} pilot's task. Both concepts used a normalized thrust display. In addition, EMACS used column deviation indicators; i. e., the difference between the actual parameter value and the value predicted by an engine model, for engine health monitoring; while the Display <b>by</b> <b>Exception</b> displayed the engine parameters if the automated system detected a difference between the actual and the predicted values. The results showed that the advanced display concepts had shorter detection and response times. There were no differences in any of the results between manual and auto throttles. There were no effects upon perceived workload or performance on the primary flight task. The majority of pilots preferred the advanced displays and thought they were operationally acceptable. Certification of these concepts depends on the validation of the engine model. Recommendations are made to improve both the EMACS and the display <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> display formats...|$|R

50|$|Coding <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> is an {{accidental}} complexity in a software {{system in which}} the program handles specific errors that arise with unique exceptions. When an issue arises in a software system, an error is raised tracing the issue back to where it was caught and then where that problem came from, if applicable. Exceptions can be used to handle the error while the program is running and avoid crashing the system. Exceptions should be generalized and cover numerous errors that arise. Using these exceptions to handle specific errors that arise to continue the program is called coding <b>by</b> <b>exception.</b> This anti-pattern can quickly degrade software in performance and maintainability. Executing code even after the exception is raised resembles the goto method in many software languages, which is also considered poor practice.|$|R

Information is still lacking {{on the influence of}} expatriate managers leadership styles on employees’ job satisfaction in Malaysian 5 -star hotels. The purpose of this paper was twofold, to shed light on employees’ job satisfaction under the leadership of expatriate managers as well as the differences in leadership styles of local and expatriate managers. Results showed that transformational leadership styles such as; idealized influence (behavior), intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation had a significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. Even transactional leadership styles of expatriates such as contingent reward produced significant positive effect on employees job satisfaction. However transactional leadership of management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive) of expatriate managers had a significant negative effect on job satisfaction. The combination of five leadership styles of expatriate managers, was able to produce 92. 2 % of employees’ job satisfaction.

Results further revealed that expatriate managers have different leadership styles, with higher individual consideration, and contingent reward score, but lower management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> (passive) score compared to local managers. The difference in leadership styles enabled expatriate managers to achieve higher job satisfaction scores compared to local managers...|$|R

Several automation approaches have been proposed to lower these costs. However, most of these approaches are not flexible enough in the operations processes and levels of automation that they support. This paper presents a concept called the Virtual Mission Operations Center (VMOC) that provides highly flexible support for dynamic spacecraft management processes and automation. In a VMOC, operations personnel can be shared among missions, the operations team can change personnel and their locations, and automation can be added and removed as appropriate. The VMOC employs a form of on-demand supervisory control called management <b>by</b> <b>exception</b> to free operators from having to actively monitor their system.
