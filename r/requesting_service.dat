50|$|Since May 2007, USF {{has started}} Rural Telecom {{services}} projects in 7 different areas (called “Lots”), for which contracts have been signed with major telecom service providers {{in the country}} - Telenor, Mobilink, Warid and PTCL. The main aim of this programme is to bring the focus of telecom operators from urban towards rural population. Access to services shall be offered by operators, both through shared access points as appropriate, and to all customers <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> in the areas covered through {{the support of the}} USF, at published national tariffs.|$|E
50|$|Windows NT {{processor}} scheduling {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} Windows NT determines which job (task) should be run on the computer processor at which time. Without scheduling, the processor would give attention to jobs based on when they arrived in the queue, which is usually not optimal. As part of the scheduling, the processor gives a priority level to different processes running on the machine. When two processes are <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> at the same time, the processor performs the jobs for the one with the higher priority.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} a {{different}} kind would be where one software component provides service to another. The incompatibility could be as simple as a change in the order of parameters between the software component <b>requesting</b> <b>service,</b> and the component providing the service. This would be a kind of interface incompatibility. This might be considered a bug, but could be very hard to detect in some systems. Some interface incompatibilities can easily be detected during the build stage, particularly for strongly typed systems, others may be hard to find and may only be detected at run time, while others may be almost impossible to detect without a detailed program analysis.|$|E

50|$|The mSign {{consortium}} {{created the}} standards {{on the assumption}} that a WAP phone with a WAP 1.2 implementation and digital keys stored on the SIM card (i.e. WIM) would be used to generate a mobile (digital) signature. During the standardization process, room was given also to other mechanisms for authenticating the mobile phone subscriber such as the sending of a password via SMS or Dialtone communication and voice identification. The specification also allowed for server-based digital signatures. In other words, digital signatures not generated in the mobile phone but on a central server that would then communicate with the signature <b>requesting</b> <b>Service</b> Providers via the mSign interface.|$|E
50|$|Eighteen {{white and}} African American persons {{went to a}} {{restaurant}} in Shell's Department Store in Miami, Florida. Consistent with the restaurant's policy of refusing service to blacks, the restaurant manager requested the persons to leave. When they refused, they were arrested for violation of a statute allowing a restaurant to {{have a right to}} remove any person that it considered detrimental to serve. At trial the defendants their arrest, prosecution, and conviction by the state for <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> at a restaurant that refused service to African Americans would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court stayed the adjudication of guilt and, consistent with state law, placed them on probation. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed, holding that the statute under which the convictions were made was nondiscriminatory and thus did not violate equal protection.|$|E
50|$|Five African American college {{students}} {{went to a}} department store in Columbia, South Carolina, {{and sat down at}} its lunch counter and waited for service. The department store allowed persons of all races to use all facilities except for the lunch counter, which served whites only. The store manager had arranged for police to be present for any sit-in demonstrators, and then, consistent with the restaurant's policy of refusing service to blacks, the restaurant manager requested the persons to leave. When they refused, they were arrested for breach of the peace and criminal trespass. At trial the defendants their arrest, prosecution, and conviction by the state for <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> at a restaurant that refused service to African Americans would violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court convicted the students, and the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed in an unreported decision.|$|E

50|$|The dome {{in the car}} {{was similar}} to the other domes on the train, {{although}} all of its seats were reserved for passengers booked on Dream Cloud. Behind the staircase to the dome was the porter's section, containing a seat and a folding upper berth as well as an annunciator to alert the porter to sleeping car passengers <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> and supplies such as a first aid kit. Behind the porter's section were the car's eight duplex roomettes, consisting of two upper roomettes and two lower roomettes {{on each side of the}} aisle. The lower roomettes were at floor level, while their upper counterparts were two steps above. The roomettes each featured a seat, a small one-person sofa, a sanitary column with hopper like the ones in the compartments, and one berth. Upper berths were slightly larger than lower berths, and the former had berths that folded out of the wall while the latter had pull-out sliding berths that were stored under the adjacent upper roomette. At the end of the car were two lockers that held clean linen and soiled linen as well as folding chairs and tables.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{predictors of}} misidentification of organic mental disorders and delirium in patients undergoing psychiatric liaison consultation. Methods: Data were collected at Santa Casa de São Paulo between July of 2009 and March of 2013. We {{included in our}} analysis all inpatients for whom the <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> judged that a psychiatric consultation was required for a possible mental health condition. Outcomes of interest were the instances of misidentification where a condition was initially deemed to be of a psychiatric nature, whereas the final diagnosis by the liaison psychiatric team was of an organic disease or delirium. Our predictors were the clinical specialty of the <b>requesting</b> <b>service,</b> requester and patient characteristics. A series of generalised linear models were used to evaluate misidentification risks. Results: A total of 947 subjects met our inclusion criteria, 14. 6 % having a final liaison diagnosis of organic mental disorder and 8. 1 % of delirium. Older patients {{were significantly associated with}} increased risk of misidentification for both organic conditions (OR 3. 01 - 95 % CI 2. 01, 4. 5) and delirium (OR 3. 92 - 2. 4, 6. 39).

Accordingly, the defense framework employs attack avoidance methods, attack prevention model and attack detection strategies to be deployed in each autonomous system (AS). A way of avoiding attacks is to ensure that attacks may not exploit the vulnerabilities. This is achieved in this work through enhanced anti-spoofing techniques that resolve insider attacks, and a differentiated routing based on traffic classification...|$|E

This paper presents an approach to adaptive coordination between customers <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> via an SLA, and the provider who owns and provisions network resources. We deploy a set of software agents capable of automating negotiation between these parties, while applying provider policy and controlling admission of service requests onto the underlying network infrastructure. An architecture supporting this approach is described, as is a prototype of the full system deployed on a network simulator...|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{consider}} {{a selection of}} performance metrics based on [40]. To represent the clients <b>requesting</b> <b>service,</b> {{we consider}} a queuing system M/M/ 1 /K, meaning that the arrival process is a Poisson process with rate λ (M), the service time is independent and exponentially distributed with parameter μ (M), {{there is only a}} single server to process the requests (1), and the capacity of the system is limited (K). This queue configuration allows the evaluation of relevant aspects of the system, such as the impact of different arrival times and different queue capacities [41]; it is commonly used to represent cloud requests ([42 – 46]).|$|E

30|$|OCSO PaaS {{optimization}} implements optimized {{monitor and}} scaling control which can implement scaling activities {{more effectively than}} official dynamic scaling solutions. With the proposed monitor and scaling control algorithms, OCSO calculates the optimal number of VMs to provision and performs the modification by requesting to add/remove VMs at the best scaling timing. In order to do so, OCSO PaaS optimization disables the applications’ native automatic scaling functions and modifies the environments by <b>requesting</b> <b>service</b> environment updates with API requests on-the-fly. In case of only one VM {{is presented in the}} environment, OCSO would continue to scale in by downsizing the single VM, provided that the workload continued to drop. Consequently, OCSO achieves PaaS service resource utilization efficiency since the effective scaling controls would save considerable VM hours while managing varied workloads.|$|E
