40|$|Research PaperPresent {{resource}} <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> Norway's fisheries {{were compared}} for different fleet structures. Alternative values of TACs were assumed, {{which is consistent}} with how most fisheries in Norwegian waters are managed. Total allowable catches (TACs) are set on the basis of advice by fisheries biologists where the economics of the industry plays a minor role. The TAC is then shared between the nations sharing the fish stocks, according to agreed formulas. A model of the fisheries was implemented in GAMS. The basis for the model is fleet categorization used in the annual cost and earnings studies. Rents were maximized using an LP-approach, under various constraints regarding divisions of the total catches between different fleet categories. Currently the resource <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> Norway's fisheries is small and possibly even negative, depending on assumptions made with regard to capital costs and other uncertain factors. The potential rent is quite high and could be up to one half of the landed value, depending on constraints with regard to reallocation of fish catches between different categories of boats, and also on assumptions about capital costs and other uncertain factors. In some fisheries in Norway it is now permitted to trade <b>in</b> fish <b>quotas</b> through trading <b>in</b> fishing vessels. Vessels can be removed from the fishery and stripped of their quotas, which then are transferred to other vessels. As the fleet categories involved have undergone downsizing their profitability has increased and the value of the fish quotas has gone up. Data from the cost and earnings studies were used to estimate the value of fish quotas and to study whether they reflect resource <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> the fishery. Transaction value of these fish <b>quotas</b> <b>in</b> many cases seem to overestimate the resource <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> the fishery, probably due to excess capacity in the existing fleet...|$|R
40|$|Aziz Elbehri and Ken Pearson {{supplied}} {{an approach}} to implement tariff-rate <b>quotas</b> <b>in</b> the general equilibrium model of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). For each traded good a tariff-rate quota can be introduced whereby good refers to a sector of the GTAP data base. If a sector contains several tariff lines, which may have their own tariff-rate quota regimes, an aggregation is needed leading to a sector-wide tariff-rate <b>quota.</b> <b>In</b> the paper two alternative aggregation methods are suggested considering either magnitude of tariffs or sector-wide <b>quota</b> <b>rent.</b> <b>In</b> an example both aggregation methods are applied to show the impact on model results.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} various equilibria {{associated with}} intervention in {{trade in the}} context of noncooperative policy games with endogenous timing. It is shown that, while the subgame perfect equilibria <b>in</b> <b>quota</b> games always involve sequential play, that is not necessarily the case in tariff games. One implication of the analysis is that, in contrast to existing theory, trade is not eliminated <b>in</b> <b>quota</b> games. Another implication is that quotas are not necessarily inferior to tariffs. The paper also examines the ways policy leaders and followers differ in their preferences over instruments and allows the choice over instruments to be determined endogenously.

40|$|The {{object of}} the article are the questions: 1) {{what is the role}} of <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> {{financing}} housing economy in Poland and 2) which are the arguments pro and contra applying economically justified <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> Poland. In Poland there is a two-level system of <b>rents.</b> <b>In</b> state-owned and privately owned houses rents are low. Much higher rents are paid by members of co-operative building societies. This results in economic differentiation of the population depending on whether they live in state-owned or privately owned houses on the one hand and in co-operative houses on the other. In consequence of the low <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> state-owned and privately owned houses it is necessary to cover part of the cost of housing management from the state funds. The authoress considers the advisability and possibility of applying the present rents to the requirements of financing upkeep costs, repairs and housing investments.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the factors that}} drive livestock rental market participation by using farm household data. Furthermore, it assessed if there exits any association between livestock and land rental markets. Double hurdle models were applied {{on both sides of}} the livestock rental markets separately. Results show that low caste households are more likely to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> livestock as compared to high caste; and this is similar for male headed households and households with more male labor. Caste however, does not affect the likelihood to rent out livestock. The larger the owned livestock the less is the probability to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> livestock and the amount to <b>rent</b> <b>in.</b> Owned livestock holding only affected the amount to rent out but not the likelihood. Owned land holding increased the amount of livestock to rent out. Households with migrated members are less likely to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> and more likely to rent out livestock. Migration reduced the amount of livestock <b>rented</b> <b>in</b> and increased the amount rented out. This indicates that livestock renting is partly driven by land poverty and partly by Maoist war. A bivariate ordered probit model showed a significant positive association between the decision to participate in livestock and land rental markets.
