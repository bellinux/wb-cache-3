50|$|Investors’ money {{enters a}} queue to be lent {{in one of}} three products, which vary {{according}} to the risk, returns and accessibility they offer. Once the money reaches the front of the queue, it is split into micro-loans (typically of £10-20 each) that go to multiple borrowers. Investors then receive monthly repayments of interest and capital, which they can <b>relend</b> to compound the interest.|$|E
50|$|Securitization {{allows the}} banks to quickly <b>relend</b> {{the money to}} other borrowers (including {{in the form of}} {{mortgages}}) and thereby to create more mortgages than the banks could with the amount they have on deposit. This in turn allows the public to use these mortgages to purchase homes, something the government wishes to encourage. Investors in conforming loans, meanwhile, gain low-risk income at a higher interest rate (essentially the mortgage rate, minus the cuts of the bank and GSE) than they could gain from most other bonds. Securitization has grown rapidly in the last 10 years {{as a result of the}} wider dissemination of technology in the mortgage lending world. For borrowers with superior credit, government loans and ideal profiles, this securitization keeps rates almost artificially low, since the pools of funds used to create new loans can be refreshed more quickly than in years past, allowing for more rapid outflow of capital from investors to borrowers without as many personal business ties as in the past.|$|E
40|$|A {{financial}} institution involved in commercial lending makes a short-term loan (for example, 90 days) to a borrower under a long-term credit commitment (for example, 5 years). The {{financial institution}} transfers the short-term loan, without recourse, to a third-party purchaser {{for the remaining}} term of the loan. The risk of loss relating to the short-term loan is legally transferred to the purchaser, and the financial institution has no contractual obligation to repurchase the shortterm loan. Under the long-term credit commitment, the financial institution may, at the maturity of the short-term loan, <b>relend</b> to the borrower. However, the financial institution may refuse to <b>relend</b> to the borrower based on a current credit evaluation or if any covenant under the long-term commitment is not satisfied. The issue is whether {{the transfer of the}} short-term loan should be accounted for as a sale or as a financing. Copyright © 2010, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistributio...|$|E

An analogous table is used in the theory of money creation under fractional-reserve banking by <b>relending</b> of deposits, leading to the money multiplier.|$|R
50|$|In circuitism, as {{in other}} {{theories}} of credit money, credit money is created by a loan being extended. Crucially, this loan need not (in principle) be backed by any central bank money: the money is created from the promise (credit) embodied in the loan, not from the lending or <b>relending</b> of central bank money: credit is prior to reserves.|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to restructure}} the South Korean economy via {{financial}} sector reform and privately engineered "big deals" among the chaebol, the large conglomerate firms that dominate the South Korean economy, have not yet delivered the desired result of restoring the economy to health. South Korea should consider more radical approaches. One successful model that might be followed {{is that of the}} Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). This was a state-owned enterprise created to resolve the crisis in the United States created in the late 1980 s by the failure of significant numbers of savings and loan associations (S&Ls). S&Ls were a type of bank created to take long-term savings deposits from households and <b>relend</b> these mostly as residential mortgages. These banks, during the 1980 s, were deregulated so as to allow them to hold more diverse assets and to remove interest rate ceilings that had been imposed during earlier times. As a result, many of them restructured their asset portfolios away from low return (but low risk) mortgages to higher return (but higher risk) assets such as so-called "junk bonds. "...|$|E

40|$|A game-theoretic {{model of}} lending with banks {{heterogeneous}} by size is introduced in which atomistic small banks free {{ride on the}} <b>relending</b> efforts of a large bank. An empirically-testable corollary conclusion suggests that "news" concerning the underlying economic condition of the debtor nation will have {{a greater impact on}} the large bank. This empirical prediction is validated for the Latin American Crisis period using evidence from long-term bond spread data. Poolings of cross-sectional time-series data reveal that the equity values of large banks are relatively more sensitive to adverse "news" concerning the quality of Latin American loans.

40|$|The author's {{dynamic model}} of {{international}} borrowing subject to credit constraint {{was developed for}} an economy with increasing returns to physical capital. Increases in the capital stock within the nonconvex range increase debtor borrowing opportunities. Conversely, a temporary liquidity shock may permanently lower the economy's growth path. Introducing aggregate nonconvexities also has different implications for policy on debt overhangs. In particular, the model allows for rational <b>relending</b> by creditors. It also predicts that new money (or interest capitalization) {{is in the interest}} of creditors and will be part of a debt restructuring strategy - as it was recently for Mexico and the Philippines.

2500|$|In August 2009, Roubini {{predicted}} that the global economy would begin recovering {{near the end of}} 2009, but the U.S. economy is likely to grow only about one percent annually during the next two years, which is less than the three percent normal [...] "trend."

50|$|Goldsmiths in England {{had been}} craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers and money lenders since the 16th century. But {{they were not}} the first to act as {{financial}} intermediates; in the early 17th century, the scriveners were the first to keep deposits {{for the express purpose of}} <b>relending</b> them. Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the Royal Mint for storage. In 1640 King Charles I seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e. in trust). These receipts could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of <b>relending</b> on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith, i.e. the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including advances to his customers. The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay. Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts. Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit.|$|R
40|$|Banking {{is based}} on two {{fundamentally}} irreconcilable functions: safekeeping of deposits and <b>relending</b> of deposits. Safekeeping {{is meant to be}} a risk-free function, but using deposits to fund loans inevitably poses risk to deposits, thereby undermining the safekeeping function. The expensive, inefficient, and unreliable apparatus of bank regulation is an attempt to square the circle between safekeeping and lending: government liquidity and deposit insurance facilities, capital and reserve requirements, investment restrictions, and supervisory examinations are all aimed at keeping the risks of the lending function in check so as {{to ensure the safety of}} deposits. This Article argues for splitting the lending function from the safekeeping function in both traditional and shadow-banking markets through what it terms “Pure Reserve Banking. ” In a Pure Reserve Banking regime, “safe banks” would offer safekeeping and payment services, and nothing else. Loans would be a function solely of capital markets, which would operate without government facilitation of shadow-banking deposit substitutes. Historically, a separation between deposits and lending was not possible, but it is now feasible with today’s deep and efficient capital markets, which already provide the funding for much of the borrowing in the economy...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{international}} loans by commercial banks are denominated in the home currency of the lending bank or a transaction currency like the US dollar. The focus of this dissertation is to provide an explanation for this empirical observation {{and to develop a}} model to determine whether or when an optimal currency choice may exist for the bank^ A model is developed to analyze the choice of currency in contracting international loans by commercial banks, where given the size of the loan, the bank chooses the rate of interest and the proportion of the loan to be denominated in its home currency. The bank maximizes the home currency value of the loan subject to a profit condition and a no-default condition by the borrower. The analysis is carried out for conditions of certainty as well as uncertainty and distinction is made between borrowers which are sovereign countries and individual firms borrowing internationally. ^ A major result obtained is that no unique optimum currency denomination exists for the bank. If, however, the expectation of exchange rate movement is asymmetric, then a particular currency is preferred to another. Also in the presence of institutional ceilings on the interest rate and moral hazard problems, home currency denomination of the loan is optimal for the bank. If the bank is risk averse, home currency denomination is preferred. ^ In the case of an involuntary default caused by temporary shortfall of the earnings of the borrower, a lending rule is derived for the bank which indicates that <b>relending</b> to the borrower {{is in the interest of}} the bank if the new loan and the accumulated arrears on past loans do not exceed the borrower 2 ̆ 7 s penalty from a default. If the loan repayment exceeds the penalty amount, the excess debt, it is concluded, must be forgiven. ...|$|R
