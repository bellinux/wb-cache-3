In most experiments mixture of samples of T. tritici and T. laevis from different locations was applied for inoculation. In 1995 samples of above mentioned species were used separately. Of the older <b>Czech</b> and Slovak <b>cultivars</b> Roxana, Dobrovická přesívka, Hela, Mara and Vala showed high to medium resistance. Of the registered cultivars the highest resistance was displayed by the German cv. Globus and Danish cv. Bill, followed by the Czech cv. Niagara. Ranking of cultivars tested in 2004 and 2005 varied, except the most resistant cultivars Globus, Bill and Niagara...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{nature of}} {{axillary}} production along shoots {{is one of}} the main factors influencing both vegetative and reproductive growth in apricot. This study aimed at analyzing the morphology and branching pattern of one-year-old shoots of 'Velkopavlovicka' cultivar in comparison with 'Bergeron'. 'Velkopavlovicka' is a classical, medium vigor, <b>Czech</b> <b>cultivar</b> which has naturally a spherical crown. In twelve-year-old trees grafted on apricot seedlings and pruned to an open vase, lateral branches were described from the second to the fourth orders. Each shoot was described as a sequence of metamers, and for each metamer the fate (latent, vegetative or floral) of the central bud as well as the number of associated flowers were noted. The presence or absence of development of axillary shoots from vegetative buds was also considered. A hidden semi-Markov chain was built for each cultivar on the basis of the sample of bivariate sequences corresponding to the two observed categorical variables, pooling all one-year-old annual shoots whatever the year. Both cultivars could be characterized by a similar organization in zones, but with different probabilities of occurrence of the median flower bud zone as well as by different mean number of central and associated flowers within this zone. Cultivar 'Bergeron' proved to be more floribund than 'Velkopavlovicka'. Moreover, they revealed biennial bearing in Central European conditions, but different reasons could be responsible for this behavior depending on the cultivar...|$|R

We are focused on molecular breeding of barley and wheat lines for disease resistance and some important quality traits. As acceptors of interesting genes we use especially elite Slovak and <b>Czech</b> <b>cultivars</b> and lines. After five backcross generations {{with the help of}} MAS new created lines carrying markers linked to desired genes undergo resistance, agronomic and technological tests. In breeding of winter barley for resistance to BaYMV/BaMMV viruses we use codominant STS and SSR markers linked to rym 4 and rym 11 resistance genes. Cultivar Romanze {{has been used as a}} donor of rym 4 gene and landrace Russia 57 as gene rym 11 donor. In spring barley we are focused on transfer of Yd 2 gene from landraces Shannon and Sutter resistant to BYDV by use of dominant ASPCR marker. We are also working on transfer of effective leaf rust resistance genes Lr 19, Lr 24 derived from Thinopyrum ponticum and gene Lr 35 from Aegilops speltoides into hexaploid wheat by use of dominant STS and SCAR markers. Near isogenic lines with these genes are used in gene pyramiding to develop a single line with all three genes. By use of protein markers we develop near isogenic wheat lines for higher sedimentation values, higher dough strength and better breadmaking quality. These are lines with new combination of HMW glutenin subunits (21 *, 7 + 8, 5 + 10) as well as wheat lines with new unknown HMW-GS and with new HMW-GS pair...|$|R
40|$|In {{functional}} food field {{the research of}} nutraceutical compounds plays a very important role. Among the nutraceuticals, phytoestrogens {{are one of the}} most interesting categories. They are able to bond the animal and human estrogen receptor acting similarly to endogen hormone and consequently influencing the hormone related diseases. Alfalfa is rich in compounds which act as phytoestrogens. These compounds belong to the category of isoflavonoids. In this study we aim at indentifying and quantifying the flavonoids and isoflavonoids in 15 <b>Czech</b> <b>cultivars</b> grown in three experimental fields. Moreover, this work finds out the correlation between phenolics compounds content and characteristics of the plants such as the stems features and the cultivars or the field influence. An High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a Diode array detector (DAD) method has been developed in order to succeed in the quantification and a first identification of these compounds. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) set up for the identification of 54 phenolic compound has been performed in order confirm the previous results. Coumestrol and Apigenin resulted as the isoflavonoid and the flavone, respectively, with the major concentration among their classes. The quantification focused on six selected peaks that were characteristic of all the samples. A statistical analysis of the data led us to identify Morava as the variety with the highest content of coumestrol followed by Zuzana and Litava, while the variety Jarka has the lower concentration, in the range of 15. 5 µg/g to 52. 2 µg/g. The apigenin content was relatively higher if compared with the coumestrol content. It ranged from of ZE XLII to 94. 0 µg/g of Holyna, Morava and Zuzana. Thus, Morava and Zuzana results as the varieties with the highest concentration of both the compounds. Statistical analysis showed also the influence of the original field where the plants were grown on the concentration of the selected compounds. The field C seems to enhance the concentration of Apigenin this is probably due to particular environmental condition. Analyzing the obtained data there is no correlation between apigenin and coumestrol content neither between coumestrol content and stem features...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the period}} of 2010 – 2011, a set of 14 <b>Czech</b> alfalfa <b>cultivars</b> was {{evaluated}} in the research locality Troubsko. On small plots {{and also in the}} individual plantations altogether 51 descriptors were evaluated. Statistical differences existing among cultivars in individual trait sunder study were analysed using the method of point and interval estimations of average values. Intraspecific variability was studied on the base of estimation of variation coefficients. A high degree of intraspecific uniformity was found in cultivars ‘Jarka’ and ‘Holyna’ while the lowest one was registered in the cultivar ‘Litava’. Green matter yields ranged from 66. 3 t. ha− 1 (‘Jitka’) to 77. 2 t. ha− 1 (‘Holyna’), hay yields from 11. 71 t. ha− 1 (‘Jitka’) to 15. 43 t. ha− 1 (‘Jarka’), and yields of seed from 0. 19 t. ha− 1 (‘Jitka’) to 0. 35 t. ha− 1 (‘Kamila’). As far as the descriptor “Alfalfa tuft dry matter” was concerned, cultivars ‘Oslava’ and ‘Holyna’ were statistically highly significantly (P < 0. 01) better than than cultivars ‘Jitka’ and ‘Vlasta’. As far as the descriptor “Width of the terminal leaflet” was concerned, the cultivar ‘Palava’ was statistically highly significantly better (P < 0. 01) than cultivars ‘Vlasta’, ‘Litava’, and ‘Denisa’. The existence of similarity of cultivars under study was determined by means of cluster analysis. It was found out that the highest degree of similarity existed between cultivars ‘Morava’ and ‘Niva’...|$|R
40|$|Topaz’ is {{a modern}} <b>Czech</b> apple <b>cultivar</b> well {{accepted}} by consumers and scab-resistant, providing reasons for the significant spreadof cv. ‘Topaz’ in European orchards, especially in the organic fruit production industry. Growing the apple trees on their own rootsprovides some advantages in comparison with grafted trees. Micropropagation is the method of choice for plantlet production for thispurpose {{as well as for}} the establishment of healthy mother stock trees as a source of scions. The efficiency of axillary shoot proliferationwas examined on four media differing in plant growth regulators and their concentrations, and from three explant types: intact ordecapitated and defoliated microshoots placed vertically and one-nodal segments placed horizontally. All media consisted of Quoirin andLepoivre (QL) macroelements and Murashige and Skoog (MS) microelements. Furthermore, rooting efficiency on six different media/treatments was analyzed. Media with 1 mg/L 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA) or BA (0. 5 mg/L) + 1. 5 mg/L kinetin (Kin) produced similarnumber of microshoots per inoculated one (2. 5 and 2. 4, respectively). Medium with 1 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ) produced significantlyhigher number of shoots (3. 6) but they were fasciated. Three different explant types also produced similar numbers of microshoots. High rooting efficiency (68. 7 %), a high number of roots per shoot (6. 6) and the best quality of shoots were obtained in rooting mediumcontaining 2 mg/L of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA). An efficient method of shoot proliferation was established, and, since rooting was themost critical step, an efficient procedure for rooting apple cv. ‘Topaz’ was established...|$|R

40|$|Interest in hemp as a {{multi-purpose}} crop {{is growing}} worldwide {{and for the}} first time in 2015 it was cultivated in Europe on more than 20. 000 ha as a dual-purpose crop, for the seeds and for the fibre. In the present study, fibre and seed productivity of 14 commercial cultivars were tested in four contrasting European environments (Latvia, the Czech Republic, France, Italy). At full flowering, the stem yield ranged from 3. 7 Mg ha - 1 to 22. 7 Mg ha - 1, the bast fibre content ranged from 21 % to 43 %, and the bast fibre yield ranged from 1. 3 Mg ha - 1 to 7. 4 Mg ha - 1. When harvesting was postponed from full flowering until seed maturity, the stem yield of monoecious cultivars significantly increased but in dioecious cultivars it decreased at all tested sites, except for Italy. Only the early cultivars Fedora 17 and Markant produced seed in the most northern location Latvia. The seed yield ranged from 0. 3 Mg ha - 1 to 2. 4 Mg ha - 1 in Italy, France and the <b>Czech</b> Republic. The <b>cultivar</b> effect on stem and seed yield was mainly determined by the genetic variation in time of flowering. Stem yield at full flowering was strictly related to the duration of the vegetative phase while seed yield was lowest in the late flowering cultivar. The late cultivar CS is suitable for stem and fibre production as it had the highest stem yield at full flowering in all locations. Both Fedora 17 and Futura 75 are candidate cultivars for dual-purpose production in Italy, France and the Czech Republic, with Fedora 17 being more suitable for seed production and Futura 75 for fibre production. The application of modelling to design production strategies for dual-purpose hemp is promising. However, accurate parameterisation is needed based on large data sets and diverse genetic background. </p...|$|R
