5|$|The {{story of}} Riven is set {{immediately}} after the events of Myst. Having been <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> efforts of his sons, the main non-player protagonist Atrus enlists {{the help of the}} player character to free his wife from his power-hungry father, Gehn. Unlike Myst, which took place on several worlds known as Ages linked together by special books, Riven takes place almost entirely on the Age of Riven, a world slowly falling apart due to Gehn's destructive rule.|$|E
5|$|Around midday on 24 July 2013, Astrid ran aground on Quay Rock at Ballymacus Point, {{near the}} Sovereign Islands in {{southern}} Ireland, {{while attempting to}} enter the harbour near Kinsale, County Cork. The ship's engine failure prevented her from pulling herself off the rocks. The thirty crew members were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tall ship, with 18 being rescued by a RNLI lifeboat and the other 12 by another tall ship. Four RNLI lifeboats and two Irish Coast Guard helicopters {{were involved in the}} rescue. The incident was filmed by the Irish Coast Guard. None of the crew suffered any injuries.|$|E

5|$|Bertha's broad {{circulation}} produced high waves {{which were}} reported along the southeastern {{coast of the}} United States, in North Carolina, the storm produced waves of 25–50ft (7.6-15.2m). The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200other swimmers were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced warm air and blocked sea breezes from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale. The extreme heat also shattered numerous sliding glass doors and exhausted several air conditioners.|$|E
5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, {{eight people}} were injured on the U.S. Naval ship Kirk when a large wave crashed over the bow. Another boat, USB Oldendorf, {{sustained}} significant damage due to the heavy seas, and 22of its occupants required rescue. Many of the rescued received minor injuries. A total of 13people were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> imperiled ship Offshore Patrick. Following the passage of Typhoon Hal in the Philippines, 4,000bags of food, 200bags of clothes, and 400bags of medicine were provided via airlift. A few days after Hal, the nation was later affected by Typhoon Irma.|$|E

5|$|On 10 May, Esk, Express, Intrepid and Princess Victoria laid 236 mines off Bergen, North Holland, and on 15 May, {{she joined}} with Express and Ivanhoe to lay 164 mines off the Hook of Holland. Three German minesweepers, , , and , were sunk by this {{minefield}} on 26 July. The ship joined {{the evacuation of}} Allied troops from Dunkirk on 29 May. Esk evacuated 3904 troops between 29 May and 3 June, including over 1,000 French troops <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> , which was sinking after German air attacks. After repairs to the minor damage suffered by the ship during the evacuation, she resumed her previous duties.|$|E
5|$|The Inspector General of Police (IGP) {{reported}} that from 3 July until 11 July, 1,096 people, 628 men, 465 women, and 3 children left or were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> complex. The IGP also confirmed that 102 {{people were killed}} during the operation: 91 militants, 10 SSG commandos, and 1 Ranger. This includes the sixteen dead on 10 July. A total of 248 people were injured, including 204 civilians, 41 army soldiers, and 3 Rangers. Seventy-five bodies were recovered from the premises after the operation. Securing Lal Masjid brought an end to nine days of high tension in Islamabad, normally a tranquil city that had been immune to the violence experienced in the tribal areas of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{remained}} {{much the}} same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop {{in the country at}} the time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the topmast of the , one of the first iron ships, was <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} {{about his past}} life, Harsha is <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lake by a fisherman named Solomon (who is the reincarnation of Sher Khan) and, with Soloman's help, visits Udayghad. He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of the past are not revived within the day they can never be revived, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha. Harsha fights Raghuveer, {{and with the help}} of Solomon, manages to kill him.|$|E
5|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Hergé {{learned that there}} had actually been an Admiral Haddock who {{had served in the}} British Royal Navy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: Sir Richard Haddock (1629–1715). Richard Haddock {{was in charge of the}} Royal James, the flagship of the Earl of Sandwich during the Battle of Solebay of 1672, the first naval battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. During the fighting, the Royal James was set alight and Haddock escaped but had to be <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea, following which his bravery was recognised by the British monarch, King Charles II. He subsequently took command of another ship, the Royal Charles, before becoming a naval administrator in later life. Admiral Haddock's grandfather, also named Richard, commanded the ship of the line HMS Unicorn during the reign of King Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} {{came in for}} discussion during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were not suitable for ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available by the spring, 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had rescued 1,684 aircrew out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 aircrew and 60 other personnel were rescued. During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal Command. In all, 10,663 persons were rescued by Coastal Command in ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied aircrew, 277 enemy aircrew, and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E

5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|Becky first {{appears in}} Coronation Street {{as a friend}} of local factory worker Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu), whom she frames for theft at the Underworld {{lingerie}} factory. After betraying Kelly, she leaves the area for several months, returning later in the year when she meets former workmate Hayley Cropper, who is teaching an ex-offenders literacy class. Becky promises Hayley she will reform, and is offered a job at Roy's Rolls, the cafe owned and run by Hayley's partner, Roy. She doesn't change as promised and soon begins breaking the Croppers' property, threatening customers and stealing money from the till. Slug, a former acquaintance of Becky's, arrives in Weatherfield and the two joyride in the Croppers' newly acquired Morris Minor. Becky loses the couple's trust and her job. Hayley refuses Becky's apologies and when the cafe catches fire and Becky is <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> burning building, the Croppers assume she was responsible. Hayley apologises to Becky on learning that the fire was caused by an electrical fault and the two resume their friendship, with Becky re-employed at Roy's Rolls.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Wall, Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and Meera Reed (Ellie Kendrick) are <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> White Walkers by Benjen Stark (Joseph Mawle). Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) {{returns to}} his family's home in Horn Hill, {{accompanied}} by Gilly (Hannah Murray) and little Sam, intending to leave them there, but changes his mind after reuniting with his cruel father. In King's Landing, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) attempts to rescue the Queen, Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer), but learns that King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman) has united the faith and the crown. Across the Narrow Sea, in Braavos, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) refuses to kill the actress she was assigned to poison by the Faceless Men, and in the Dothraki Sea, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) rides on Drogon and emboldens her newly acquired khalasar.|$|E

5|$|Bond survives {{attacks by}} Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival {{and on the}} Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rubble by Dolly, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid {{indigenous}} to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River while under attack from Drax's forces; he eventually finds Drax's base near Iguazu Falls. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{had four}} major seats, Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire, and Cardiff Castle in South Wales, with his London townhouse on Campden Hill in Kensington. Bute {{preferred}} {{to live in}} Mount Stuart House; he disliked London and only spent a few weeks in Cardiff Castle each year. Twice each year he would travel from Mount Stuart House through Ayrshire to Edinburgh, down through northern England to London, and on to Cardiff and his South Wales estates. In November 1843, a fire swept through Luton Hoo House, destroying the interior; the house's historic library survived, however, {{and most of its}} famous collection of paintings were <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blaze; it was subsequently sold off by Bute.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, the West Pier Trust {{remained}} {{adamant that}} they would soon begin full restoration work. Retired boxer Chris Eubank criticised the delays in restoring the pier, saying he could raise the money himself in six months. In December 2004, the Trust confirmed the restoration would not be going ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The pier was partially demolished in February 2010, partly {{to make way for}} the planned i360 observation tower. In February 2014, due to stormy weather, the pier split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea. Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton, which remained after the 2003 fire. A selection of artefacts <b>rescued</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pier is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum. A further section of the pier collapsed in 2016.|$|E
