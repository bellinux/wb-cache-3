50|$|While touring Britain {{to promote}} the film, Chaplin learned {{that he had been}} refused a <b>re-entry</b> <b>visa</b> to the United States because of his alleged {{communist}} sympathies, and many American theaters refused to play Limelight. Outside of cinemas in several East Coast cities, the film was not seen by the American moviegoing public. It was not until 1972 that the film was finally seen in wide American release. Limelight currently holds an excellent 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was massively popular in Japan. It was enormously successful in Europe and around the world. However, in the US it was a relative disappointment, only taking in $1 million.|$|E

O'Neill (an FBI agent and al-Qaeda expert) came into a personal conflict with Bodine over different perspectives on Yemen. When O'Neill briefly traveled back to New York for Thanksgiving, Bodine denied his <b>re-entry</b> <b>visa,</b> blocking O'Neill from returning to Yemen to continue the investigation on the USS Cole bombing.

50|$|As {{a result}} of rising {{tensions}} in society due to the volume of cross border parallel traders causing disruption to stores, transport, and {{the way of life}} more generally. Although the government said that it had put in place certain measures, such as blocking some 25,000 suspected parallel traders from entering Hong Kong, inspection of industrial buildings for use in violations of leases, the prosecution of cross-border visitors carrying an excess of the permitted quantity of milk powder, the problem of their disruption of daily life {{in the northern part of}} Hong Kong persists. Radical localist groups such as Civic Passion and Hong Kong Indigenous initiated direct action against the unlimited multiple <b>re-entry</b> <b>visa</b> within the Individual Visit Scheme for PRC residents over three successive Sundays starting on 8 February 2015 in the most affected parts of the city. These protests brought worldwide media attention to the locals' grievances.|$|E
50|$|A {{prolific}} {{patron of}} the Cubists, Reber's fortune suffered following the stockmarket crash in 1929, and from the 'thirties {{he was forced to}} sell many of his artworks. During this period he worked in conjunction with Walter Hofer, Hofer beginning as his gallery assistant. Reber met Walter Andreas Hofer in 1929 through Hofer's brother-in-law Kurt Walter Bachstitz, a (formerly Jewish) artist, collector, dealer and gallerist. Hofer became associated with Reichsmarschal Goering from 1938, and was made director of Goering's Art Purchasing Commission around 1940. In this capacity, he commissioned Reber to Italy on 23 March 1941 to purchase artworks for Goering. Reber duly set up in Florence until 1944, in partnership with Dr Ingeborg Eichmann (later Ingeborg Pudelko-Eichmann), a Czech art dealer who too had removed from Switzerland. Although believed to be a Nazi sympathizer, on 12 March 1943 Reber's German citizenship was revoked, mainly for his high-ranking activity in German Freemasonry, which he refused to relinquish, but also (he claimed) for speaking out against the treatment of French Jews, and for his proclivity for collecting the radical modernists. By early 1945, he was expelled from Florence and under house arrest at Avellino, under orders of the Questura at Naples, his <b>re-entry</b> <b>visa</b> to Switzerland having been refused by the Swiss authorities. On being questioned by an Allied Field Security officer in 1945, Reber claimed that the most important deal he arranged in Florence, via Hofer, was approximately twenty million lire-worth of Conte Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi's paintings.|$|E
