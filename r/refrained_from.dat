50|$|Five {{types of}} self-restraints are {{considered}} essential for {{a moral and}} ethical life in Hindu philosophy: one must <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> any violence that causes injury to others, <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> starting or propagating deceit and falsehood, <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> theft of other's property, <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> sexually cheating on one's partner, and <b>refrain</b> <b>from</b> avarice. The scope of self-restraint includes one's action, the words one speaks or writes, and in one's thoughts. The necessity for temperance is explained as preventing bad karma which sooner or later haunts {{and returns to the}} unrestrained. The theological need for self-restraint is also explained as reigning in the damaging effect of one's action on others, as hurting another is hurting oneself because all life is one.|$|R

5|$|A {{study on}} the {{carpenter}} ant Camponotus floridanus found a special surface hydrocarbon on queen-laid eggs. Workers in the colony with the queen's eggs <b>refrained</b> <b>from</b> egg-laying, whereas other groups {{that did not have}} queen-laid eggs showed worker reproduction. Thus, the hydrocarbon could act as a signal to alert workers to halt reproduction. More generally, however, the authors concluded that the hydrocarbons were a fertility signal.
