25|$|At common law, as for {{all forms}} of misrepresentation, {{innocent}} misrepresentation {{gave rise to the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> a contract. It was not possible to get damages, but so long as one was not confronted by a bar to rescission, the misrepresentee had a right to escape the contract. When the Misrepresentation Act 1967 was passed, it was decided that this right to rescission could be used {{in a way that was}} unfair on a misrepresentor. So section 2(2) gives the court a discretion about whether it will allow rescission of a contract, or substitute an appropriate award of damages in lieu (instead). In William Sindall plc v Cambridgeshire CC William Sindall plc claimed rescission of a land purchase from Cambridgeshire County Council on the ground that the council falsely (but innocently) stated there were no sewage pipes on the property. This would have cost £18,000 to remove, and the land had been bought for £5m. The real reason that William Sindall wanted to escape from the contract was that land prices had just crashed. The court held that in fact the contract had made the buyer assume any risk of such representations and there was no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind.</b> But if there had been, it would have exercised its discretion under s 2(2) to award a small sum of damages.|$|E

2500|$|A misrepresentee {{does not}} have to {{exercise}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> a contract, and have it declared void.

2500|$|Depending {{on how a}} court construes negotiations, a {{representation}} could become a term of the contract, {{as well as one}} giving rise to the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind.</b> A misrepresentation that is a term, will entitle the misrepresentee to a simple breach of contract claim, with [...] "expectation damages" [...] for loss of potential profits (subject to remoteness and the duty to mitigate). If the misrepresentation is not a term, then damages may also be available, but only [...] "reliance damages" [...] for losses that have been incurred. Until 1963, the general rule was that only for fraud (i.e. an intentional or reckless misrepresentation) were damages available. For fraud, damages are available for all losses that flow directly from the misrepresentation. However, in its Tenth Report the Law Reform Committee recommended that damages should also be available for negligent misrepresentations. This led to the drafting of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, and just before the Act was passed, the House of Lords also decided in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd there should be a new claim for negligent misrepresentation at common law. While Hedley Byrne remains an important case for an independent action in tort, MA 1967 section 2(1) was instantly more generous than the common law. It allows damages if the claimant shows a defendant has made a false representation, and then the defendant cannot prove that they had reasonable grounds for making a statement and honestly believed it was true. So while the common law would put the burden of proof on a claimant to show a defendant made a negligent misstatement, MA 1967 s 2(1) shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. The measure of damages is also more generous under the Act than at common law, because just as the Law Reform Report was drafted, the House of Lords was introducing a limit on the quantum of damages for negligence to losses that are reasonably foreseeable. MA 1967 section 2(1), however, was drafted by reference to state the same damages were available as for fraud. So in Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson, the Court of Appeal held that even where {{a representation}} is negligent, and not fraud, the same quantum of damages is available as for fraud. This is controversial among academics who argue that fraud is more morally culpable than negligent behaviour, and should therefore deserve a more severe limit on compensation, though it is not entirely resolved what the proper circumstances for remoteness ought to be. Under section 2(2) the court has the discretion to substitute the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> a contract for a small misrepresentation with an award of damages. Under section 3, a court has the power to strike down clauses excluding remedies for misrepresentation if they fail the reasonableness test in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|E
2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older line of authority which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, because they never had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, {{and it turns out that}} that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire good title and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and most of the rest of the world.|$|E

50|$|If the {{supplier}} has provided {{all the information}} to be communicated before contract formation, the consumer has an automatic <b>right</b> <b>to</b> cancel and <b>rescind</b> a contract at any time from its formation until seven working days after the goods are delivered; or for service contracts, seven working days after the contract is formed (which might be before the service {{was to have been}} performed).

2500|$|Hence, in {{the general}} law of contract, {{negotiating}} parties {{have a duty to}} not make false statements of fact or law, or misrepresent themselves through conduct. Statements of opinion, [...] "mere puff" [...] or vague [...] "sales talk" [...] (e.g. [...] "this washing powder will make your clothes whiter than white!"), are generally not considered factual. However representations of people who profess special skill or knowledge {{are more likely to be}} actionable, as they warrant their opinions are based on concrete facts. So in Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon Lord Denning MR held that Esso's expert opinion that a petrol station would have 200,000 gallons worth of business was an actionable misrepresentation. If someone is induced to enter a contract by any misrepresentation, whether fraudulent, negligent or innocent, they are entitled to rescind the contract and get back the property they have conveyed. As a remedy originating in the courts of equity, this <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>rescind</b> could be lost, in four situations that courts regard as unfair to allow a claim. First, if a claimant takes too long to claim, the lapse of time (or [...] "laches") will create a bar to rescission. Second, if a claimant affirms a contract by expressly showing they still consent to a deal even though they are aware of a misrepresentation, rescission is barred. Third, if a third party's rights have intervened, when that third party is a bona fide purchaser rescission will be barred to the extent that property cannot be recovered from the third party (although a claim in damages can still exist against the misrepresentor). Fourth, and important in practice to prevent unjust enrichment is that counter-restitution must be possible. There is confusion over whether in cases at law, rather than in equity, counter-restitution must be precise (i.e. a thing received must be given back [...] ) or whether, as in Erlanger, substantial counter-restitution may be in money.|$|E
