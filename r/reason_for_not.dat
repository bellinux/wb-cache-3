5|$|On June 22 the FIA {{produced}} {{a press release}} from Max Mosley, {{in the form of}} a question-and-answer session, in an effort to clarify the FIA's stand on the controversy. In it Mosley drew an analogy to a hypothetical situation where the engines from one manufacturer had oil starvation problems due to high lateral loading in one corner, and pointed out that those cars would simply have been forced to run slower as a result. He reiterated that the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He pointed out that the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which is several hundred miles further south and more distant from the two schools, could attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding {{to the problem of}} selling tickets was the 2008 economic crisis, which many fans cited as a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were questions about how many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for a quicker sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were abysmal, however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean, to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> coming to aid of the Athenians.|$|E

5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for a Presidential campaign. Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

25|$|CBC abstained {{from joining}} the Free Education Scheme {{introduced}} by Donagh O'Malley in 1969.

25|$|Abiding by {{traditions and}} {{cultural}} norms {{is a more}} popular <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> smoking than that of health related concerns, religion, personal conviction, or economic reasons.

However, this development also brings about a new target group for tobacco companies and furthers the potential for the spread of the tobacco epidemic.|$|E

25|$|The UK's {{reluctance}} {{to join the}} Schengen Area, through concerns over loss of independent border controls, is usually cited as the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> joining. Britain argued that, for an island, frontier controls are a better and less intrusive way to prevent illegal immigration than other measures, such as identity cards, residence permits, and registration with the police. Consequent difficulties for Ireland, given its location and shared border with the United Kingdom (at which border points {{would have to be}} set up), would then make it very difficult for Ireland to join without the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|A {{publication}} {{posted on}} Statistics Canada {{reported that in}} 2009, {{only a small portion}} of crimes that happen are reported to the police (31% of all crimes), and this figure has been lowering from 1999 (37%) and 2004 (34%). Only 54% of break and enters, 43% of robberies, and 34% of assaults are reported to the police. The most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> reporting a crime was the victim thought it was not important enough (68%). Other common reasons include; they think the police cannot do anything about it (59%), or they dealt with it another way (42%). Keep in mind people can give multiple reasons, thus why the percentages equal well over 100%.|$|E
25|$|However, nations vary {{in their}} {{dedication}} to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labour. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the Commando Order. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in {{controversial}} circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied {{what seemed a}} fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> awarding the try {{was that he did}} not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Exploring {{determinants}} influencing vulnerable groups regarding (non-) {{participation in}} the Dutch two-stage cardiometabolic health check, comprising a health risk assessment (HRA) and prevention consultations (PCs) for high-risk individuals. METHODS: Qualitative study comprising 21 focus groups with non-Western (Surinamese, Turkish, Moroccan) immigrants aged 45 - 70, adult children from one of these descents, native Dutch with a lower socioeconomic status, and healthcare professionals working with these groups. RESULTS: <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> completing the HRA included (flawed) risk perceptions, health negligence, (health) illiteracy, and language barriers. A face-to-face invitation from a reliable source and community outreach to raise awareness were perceived as facilitating participation. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> attending the PCs overlapped with completing the HRA but additionally included risk denial, fear about the outcome, its potential consequences (lifestyle changes and medication prescription), and disease-related stigma. CONCLUSION: <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> completing the HRA were mainly cognitive, whereas <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>not</b> attending the PCs were also affective. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: When designing a two-stage health check, choice of invitation method seems important, as does training healthcare professionals in techniques to effectively handle patients' (flawed) risk perceptions and attitudinal ambivalence. Focus should be on promoting informed choices by providing accurate information...|$|R
