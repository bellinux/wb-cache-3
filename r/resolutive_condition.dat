40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{admissibility}} of conditional declarations of intent made in order to exercise the rights to alter unilaterally the legal relationships. In regard to such declarations of intent it is commonly assumed that their nature bears no uncertainty and therefore it is not allowed to make these declarations on a condition (see Article 89 of the Civil Code). The party which executes such right is empowered to modify the legal relation unilaterally, without participation of the recipient of such declaration of intent; therefore the uncertainty caused by the condition is deemed to violate the interests of the recipient of this declaration. The author argues {{that it is not the}} uncertainty of legal relations of the recipient, but the unilateral interference in the recipient’s legal positon that may render the conditionality of such declaration of intent inadmissible. The author analyzes the most frequently used rights to alter unilaterally the legal relationships, such as i. a. : right to set-off the mutual claims, rescission right, right to terminate the obligation, right to evade the legal consequences of a defective declaration of intent, right of repurchase, right of pre-emption, as well as right to revoke the donation in case of a glaring ingratitude of the recipient, and attempts to indicate the cases, in which the conditional execution of these rights should be allowed, as it would cause no unbearable harm to the legal interest of the recipient. This is very often the case, if the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future uncertain event depends on the recipient himself. Furthermore, certain rights to modify the legal relation are time-limited, for they may be executed only within a specific period of time. In these cases the conditional execution of a right does not increase the uncertainty of the legal position of the recipient, if the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the condition also occurs within this period of time. Moreover, in regard to each of the discussed rights to alter the legal relationship the paper analyzes the scope of admissibility of <b>resolutive</b> <b>conditions</b> as well as the stipulations of the retroactive effect of the fulfillment of the condition. At the end the author presents an analysis of the issue of admissibility of conditional declarations of intent altering unilaterally the legal relation in cases, in which these declarations are made by a participant to a civil proceedings in order to defend ones rights in these proceedings, and discusses the legal significance of the so-called precautionary declarations of intent that are very commonly used during the civil proceedings...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The use of {{temporary}} employment {{services as a}} means to achieve flexibility in die labour market led to various complications {{due to a lack of}} proper regulation. The atypical formation of the triangular employment relationship, limited rights and less favourable employment conditions of the temporary employees, multiple authority figures and their liabilities under various circumstances and the impact thereof on such employee’ collective bargaining rights caused legal uncertainty in the absence of sufficient legislation to govern it. Temporary employment agencies developed certain methods in order to evade the restrictive labour legislation and employer duties imposed on them, namely by making use of automatic termination clauses (<b>resolutive</b> <b>conditions)</b> and by categorising the temporary employee as an independent contractor. Last mentioned would effectively exclude the temporary employee from labour legislation and the protection it provides. In reaction to abovementioned problems, trade unions have been objecting to the use {{of temporary}} employment agencies and went as far as demanding the total ban thereof. This raised the question in the South African Government whether said agencies should indeed be banned. The other option is a less restrictive approach and entails the attempt to regulate these agencies by amending the current labour legislation in order to accommodate temporary employment services. In light of the fact that various proposals to amend the current South African labour legislation (especially with regard to temporary employment services) have been published in the Government Gazette, it can be deduced that the social partners ultimately chose to regulate temporary employment agencies rather than ban them altogether. From an early stage the International Labour Organisation (ILO) provided rules and regulations for the management of employment agencies in general by way of conventions and recommendations. In 1997, in order to give effect to the labour standards identified by it, the ILO brought the Private Employment Agencies Convention into existence. This document could be applied to all temporary employment agencies on an international level. This document provides for administrative regulations, the duties of the agency and the client as well as the rights of the temporary employees concerned. The ILO recommends that all of its member states incorporate the principles contained within this document in their own legislation. Temporary employment services are also used in other legal systems. For purposes of this study, the English law (United Kingdom (UK)) and the Namibian law will be scrutinised. Similar issues to those recognised in the South African law have been identified in these countries. However, each has approached said problems in different ways. The Namibian Government banned the conducting and provision of these services by way of legislation in 2007. The constitutionality of the ban has however been questioned by the Supreme Court of Namibia, after which it had been found to infringe upon the fundamental freedom to carry on any business, trade or occupation. The ban was struck down as unconstitutional. The Namibian Government has since promulgated new legislation in which it removed the ban and replaced it with numerous amendments providing for the regulation of temporary employment services. Since 1973 the UK has been promulgating various instruments for the thorough regulation of temporary employment agencies. These instruments provide for the management of temporary employment agencies and the rights of the employees involved. The relevant legislative instruments have been updated regularly with the purpose of ensuring that the needs of all the parties concerned are met. The UK, as a member state of the European Union (EU), (which has also been providing for the regulation of temporary employment services in various directives), promulgated legislation specifically with the aim to give effect to the principles in the mentioned directives. By way of doctrines and the creation of a third category ―worker‖ the UK has been attempting to prevent any loopholes in their legal system with regard to temporary employment services and the rights of the employees involved. The aim of this study is to investigate all the important complications experienced with temporary employment agencies in order to indicate the impact the atypical circumstances have on the rights of the temporary employees. The degree to which, if at all, the South African law complies with the preferred labour standards identified by the ILO will be pointed out. A comparative study will be conducted, first by ascertaining in detail how the comparable issues in the UK and Namibian law are dealt with, and second by identifying which aspects in these legal systems could be of value to the South African law. Finally the potential effectiveness of the proposed amendments to the South African labour legislation will be analysed, during which recommendations for the unresolved issues will be provided. The recommendations are mainly aimed at achieving sufficient rights and legal certainty for the temporary employees associated with temporary employment agencies. Doctora...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} Book VIII Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR) regarding acquisition {{and loss of}} ownership of movable property and consists of fifteen questions encountered when studying the rules of this book. The aim is to provide an ‘internal’ assessment of the provisions by establishing their completeness, consistency with other provisions, fairness, and practicability, without trying to determine to what extent they fit into the current European legal systems. The topics addressed in these questions are exclusivity of ownership and rights of others (Article 1 : 202), retention of ownership (Articles 1 : 204 and 2 : 307), ownership and the limited right to use (Articles 1 : 202 and 1 : 204), the ‘right or authority’ to transfer ownership (Chapters 2 and 3), the agreement as to the time ownership is to pass (Article 2 : 101 (1) (e)), ratification of an invalid transfer (Article 2 : 102), the legal nature of delivery (Article 2 : 104 (1)), the possibility to transfer ownership of stolen goods, transfer of goods {{by means of a}} document (Article 2 : 105 (4)), transfer subject to a <b>resolutive</b> or suspensive <b>condition</b> (Article 2 : 203), the burden of proof on the transferee in case of good faith acquisition (Article 3 : 101), acquisitive prescription of cultural objects (Article 4 : 102), acquisitive prescription and acknowledgement of the owner’s rights by a possession-agent (Article 4 : 205), acquisition of ownership by the producer in the case of production {{for the benefit of the}} owner of the materials (Article 5 : 201) ...|$|R
50|$|There {{is another}} view: {{that these are}} sales subject to a <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition.</b> On this view, the sale {{transaction}} is carried out completely, and the client is charged. If, however, the client feels that the merchandise is no good, he is entitled to return the item to the seller, and the transaction is reversed. In modern-day consumer contracts, {{this seems to be}} the better view.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition</b> {{is where}} there is an {{existing}} debt which is destroyed on the occurrence of an event. For example: [...] "When X reaches the age of 25, he {{no longer has the}} right to live in Y" [...] (the fact that it is incertain whether or not he will reach this age makes this a conditio and not a dies as dies incertus pro conditio habetur.|$|E
50|$|A <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition,</b> then, is {{one that}} {{discharges}} an existing obligation the moment the condition is fulfilled. Prior to the fulfilment of the condition attached to the contract, the contract has full legal effect, and either party may claim performance by the other of his obligations. Upon the fulfilment of the condition, the contract is terminated and is regarded {{as if it had}} never existed. The consequence is that each party may claim to be restored to his original position. For example, if Jess fails her exams, she must restore the car to Rodney.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the parties agree}} that the {{obligations}} under a contract should operate in full, but {{comes to an end}} if an uncertain future event either does or does not happen, they are said to have agreed to a <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition</b> (or condition subsequent). The continued existence of the contract depends on the event happening or not happening, as the case may be: for example, [...] "I shall buy and give you a car on the condition that, if you fail your exams, I will take the car back." [...] Another example would be a contract of sale whereby one sells a car on the condition that, if the buyer fails to pay the price by a certain date, it will be repossessed.|$|E
5000|$|The home arena [...] "Ischelandhalle" [...] has a {{capacity}} of 1,800. The minimum capacity requirement for the BBL is 3,000. A refurbishment and enlargement to {{a capacity}} of 3,000 of the current building is planned for the 2009-10 season. Therefore, an alternative location is required for that period. Three options were considered by Phoenix Hagen: a tent solution in Hagen with {{a capacity of}} 3,500, an alternative gym in Hagen or a location near Hagen. On 23 April 2009 the BBL refused the application of Phoenix Hagen for a license {{to play in the}} BBL. In the application the tent solution was proposed, which has been the reason for the rejection. Within a week after the rejection Phoenix Hagen had the right to appeal against the decision. Phoenix Hagen evaluated the feasibility of converting a building, which is located in Hagen and is currently hosting badminton and tennis courts. As an alternative solution outside of Hagen, the gym [...] "Uni Sporthalle" [...] of the University of Wuppertal was considered. The appeal to the BBL was staged with the plans and contracts for the Hagen solution. On Tuesday 02/05/09 the responsible board of the BBL decided to send a delegation to the proposed location in Hagen to inspect the site before making a final decision on the licence. On Friday 08/05/09 the BBL canceled their previous decision and granted a licence with <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition.</b> Phoenix Hagen is eligible to maintain the licence, if progress requirements for the setup of the basketball arena will be fulfilled. The temporary arena is planned to have a capacity of 3,035. On Monday 06/07/09 the BBL announced that Phoenix Hagen has fulfilled the requirements regarding its economic performance. Phoenix Hagen will have to present the arena converted and ready for match operation by 31 July 2009, which forms the final hurdle towards the 2009-10 BBL licence. In the 08/05/09 press release the BBL already stated that it expects Phoenix Hagen also to meet these requirements.|$|E
40|$|When {{the parties}} to a {{contract}} base their consensus on a commonly held belief which is fundamental to their motivation in contracting, we say that they contract {{on the basis of}} a supposition. Should the supposition prove false, the contract will be void. While South African courts have accepted this proposition where the supposition relates to a past or present fact, the status of a supposition relating to the future has had a far more controversial history. The CPD accepted the validity of the supposition in futuro in Williams v Evans, but this decision was overruled by the SCA in recent history. This article addresses the concept of a supposition relating to a future fact, in the light of the original finding in the Williams case and the relevant case law since. The currently prevailing view is that a supposition in futuro is indistinguishable from a <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition,</b> and this article aims to reconcile this position with the finding in Williams through the medium of equating the supposition in futuro with a tacit <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition.</b> If a supposition is merely a type of tacit term, then, asks the author, why is there so much controversy about the Williams case...|$|E
40|$|The sales {{contract}} with buyback agreement has {{existed in the}} Romanian legislation {{as it has been}} instituted by means of the original form of the Civil Code in force. The legislative evolution of the lastcentury has abrogated the provisions referring to this field and has eventually led to a legislative void in this matter. This situation has entailed the validation of all legal deeds in the form of {{sales contract}} with buyback agreement, form which used to be prohibited in the past, in certain situations. Noticing such situation andunderstanding the need to reinstate the legal framework for the regulation of social relationships with respect to the sales contract with buyback agreements, the Romanian lawgiver has dedicated it a subsection in the new Civil Code. The future civil regulation resumes {{a major part of the}} contents and meanings of the provisions of articles 1371 - 1387 of the Civil Code, currently abrogated. The different element lies in the institution of the express prohibition of sales with buyback option where the difference between the pricereceived and the price paid exceeds the level of interests set by the specific legislation. In addition, the sales where the seller has the obligation to buy back the good sold without setting the price of the good at the time of undertaking such obligation are also prohibited. Following the entry into force of the new Civil Code, the sale with buyback option shall fit the category of legal deeds affected by a <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition,</b> which shall also affect possible rights transmitted by concluding the contract. Such agreements shall be fully valid as long as the general validity conditions of the legal deeds are complied with and the legal norms passed in the interest matter are not infringed...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. Chapter 1 {{investigates the}} {{requirement}} of praedia utilitas. The continuing existence of this requirement is considered desirable and therefore the broad interpretation thereof by van Oven and others is rejected. Their approach involves a disregard of the benefit requirement. Attention is drawn {{to the fact that}} in South African law (unlike Roman law), not only is the natural condition of the dominant tenement taken into account, but also its arrangement. in deciding whether the benefit requirement is complied with. Several criteria for the benefit requirement (from common law, Dutch and South African authors and cases) are discussed. The conclusion is reached that no decisive criterium has yet been found nor is it probable that one will be found. The different criteria have to be weighed up against each other. One has to accept that economic, social and historical considerations, apart from these criteria. can play a part in the decision whether or not an alleged praedial servitude satisfies the benefit requirement. Some of these are briefly discussed. In a supplement Dutch cases on {{the requirement of}} praedia utilitas are discussed. Chapter 2 investigates the requirement of perpetua causa. Three different aspects of this requirement are considered. Some authors deduct from the first part of D 8 2 28 the principle that the possibility of exercising a praedial servitude may not be dependent on an act by the owner or user of the servient tenement. This aspect of the requirement is rejected as there is almost no authority for it in South African law and because it is undesirable in terms of legal policy. The second aspect of the requirement demands the eternal capability of the servient tenement to provide a benefit to the dominant tenement, whilst the dominant tenement must have a corresponding eternal need in this regard. Different author's views on the relationship between this aspect of the requirement of perpetua causa and the requirement of praedia utilitas, are discussed. The confusion of others concerning the difference between a causa perpetua and a causa continuam is indicated. It is pointed out that the requirement of perpetua causa is not properly founded in common law. In Roman law a causa perpetua was only required for servitudes concerning water, which had to be aqua viva to satisfy this requirement. In South African law aqua viva is not required and therefore the requirement of perpetua causa became obsolete. The position in modern Dutch law is researched. On grounds of legal policy the perpetua causa-requirement is considered undesirable, as it constitutes an arbitrary restriction on socially beneficial real burdens. The abolishment of the requirement will be in accordance with the recent attempts by South African jurists to adopt a more social definition of the concept of ownership. The third aspect of the requirement (that a praedial servitude may not be constituted under a <b>resolutive</b> <b>condition</b> or period fixture), has been abolished long ago. Chapter 3 investigates the requirement of vicinitas. The view is taken that a great distance between the dominant and servient tenements is not per se in conflict with this requirement. The requirement is seen merely as a manifestation of the utilitas-requirement with regard to the distance between the tenements. Support for this viewpoint is found in common law, modern Dutch, English and South African law. The dominant and servient tenements may be any distance apart, provided the servient tenement can properly benefit the dominant tenement. According to D 8 3 7 1, de a 1 i ng with rura 1 servitudes, an intermediate tenement must be subject to an appropriate servitude. The validity of this rule in common law, modern Dutch and South African law is investigated. The position of the owner of the dominant tenement who has the competence to use the intermediate tenement precario, is discussed with reference to English and Dutch cases. The conclusion is reached, on authority and grounds of policy, that the rule in Q 8 3 7 1 should not be followed in South African law. The existence of a praedial servitude is admissible if the servitude, having regard to the factual situation, will probably benefit the dominant tenement, notwithstanding the presence of any unburdened intermediate tenements...|$|E
