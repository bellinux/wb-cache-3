40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Computing and Information SciencesJohn HatcliffMedical {{devices are}} safety-critical systems whose failure may put human life in danger. They are {{becoming}} more advanced and thus more complex. This leads to bigger and more complicated code-bases {{that are hard to}} maintain and verify. Model-driven development provides high-level and abstract description of the system in the form of models that omit details, which are not relevant during the design phase. This allows for certain types of verification and hazard analysis to be performed on the models. These models can then be translated into code. However, errors that do not exist in the models may be introduced during the implementation phase. Automated translation from verified models to code may prevent to some extent. This thesis proposes approach for model-driven development and verification of medical devices. Models are created in AADL (Architecture Analysis & Design Language), a language for software and hardware architecture modeling. AADL models are translated to SPARK Ada, contract-based programming language, which is suitable for software verification. Generated code base is further extended by developers to implement internals of specific devices. Created programs can be verified using <b>SPARK</b> <b>tools.</b> A PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) pump medical device is used to illustrate the primary artifacts and process steps.

40|$|The use of {{nontoxic}} propellants {{in future}} exploration vehicles would enable safer, more cost-effective mission scenarios. One promising green alternative to existing hypergols is liquid methane (LCH 4) with liquid oxygen (LO 2). A 100 lbf LO 2 /LCH 4 engine was developed under the NASA Propulsion and Cryogenic Advanced Development project and tested at the NASA Glenn Research Center Altitude Combustion Stand {{in a low}} pressure environment. High ignition energy is a perceived drawback of this propellant combination; so this ignition margin test program examined ignition performance versus delivered spark energy. Sensitivity of ignition to spark timing and repetition rate was also explored. Three different exciter units were used with the engine s augmented (torch) igniter. Captured waveforms indicated spark behavior in hot fire conditions was inconsistent compared to the well-behaved dry sparks. This suggests that rising pressure and flow rate increase spark impedance and may at some point compromise an exciter s ability to complete each <b>spark.</b> The <b>reduced</b> <b>spark</b> energies of such quenched deliveries resulted in more erratic ignitions, decreasing ignition probability. The timing of the sparks relative to the pressure/flow conditions also impacted the probability of ignition.

40|$|In cardiac myocytes, β-adrenergic {{stimulation}} enhances Ca(2 +) cycling {{through an}} integrated signalling cascade modulating L-type Ca(2 +) channels (LTCC), phospholamban, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). CaMKII and {{nitric oxide synthase}} 1 (NOS 1) are proposed as prime mediators for increasing RyR open probability. We investigate whether this pathway is confined to the high Ca(2 +) microdomain of the dyadic cleft and thus to coupled RyRs. Pig ventricular myocytes are studied under whole-cell voltage-clamp and confocal line-scan imaging with Fluo- 4 as a [Ca(2 +) ]i indicator. Following conditioning depolarizing pulses, spontaneous RyR activity is recorded as Ca(2 +) sparks, which are assigned to coupled and non-coupled RyR clusters. ISO (10  nM) increases Ca(2 +) spark frequency in both populations of RyRs. However, CaMKII inhibition <b>reduces</b> <b>spark</b> frequency in coupled RyRs only; NOS 1 inhibition mimics the effect of CaMKII inhibition. Moreover, ISO induces the repetitive activation of coupled RyR clusters through CaMKII activation. Immunostaining shows high levels of CaMKII phosphorylation at the dyadic cleft. CaMKII inhibition reduces ICaL and local Ca(2 +) transients during depolarizing steps but has only modest effects on amplitude or relaxation of the global Ca(2 +) transient. In contrast, PKA inhibition <b>reduces</b> <b>spark</b> frequency in all RyRs concurrently with a reduction of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2 +) content, Ca(2 +) transient amplitude and relaxation. In conclusion, CaMKII activation during β-adrenergic stimulation is restricted to the dyadic cleft microdomain, enhancing LTCC-triggered local Ca(2 +) release as well as spontaneous diastolic Ca(2 +) release whilst PKA is the major pathway increasing global Ca(2 +) cycling. Selective CaMKII inhibition may reduce potentially arrhythmogenic release without negative inotropy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Calcium sparks are ryanodine {{receptor}} mediated transient calcium {{signals that}} {{have been shown to}} hyperpolarize the membrane potential by activating large conductance calcium activated potassium (BK) channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. Along with voltage-dependent calcium channels, they form a signaling unit that has a vasodilatory influence on vascular diameter and regulation of myogenic tone. The existence and role of calcium sparks has hitherto been unexplored in the spiral modiolar artery, the end artery that controls blood flow to the cochlea. The goal {{of the present study was}} to determine the presence and properties of calcium sparks in the intact gerbil spiral modiolar artery. Results Calcium sparks were recorded from smooth muscle cells of intact arteries loaded with fluo- 4 AM. Calcium sparks occurred with a frequency of 2. 6 Hz, a rise time of 17 ms and a time to half-decay of 20 ms. Ryanodine <b>reduced</b> <b>spark</b> frequency within 3 min from 2. 6 to 0. 6 Hz. Caffeine (1 mM) increased spark frequency from 2. 3 to 3. 3 Hz and prolonged rise and half-decay times from 17 to 19 ms and from 20 to 23 ms, respectively. Elevation of potassium (3. 6 to 37. 5 mM), presumably via depolarization, increased spark frequency from 2. 4 to 3. 2 Hz. Neither ryanodine nor depolarization changed rise or decay times. Conclusions This is the first characterization of calcium sparks in smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar artery. The results suggest that calcium sparks may regulate the diameter of the spiral modiolar artery and cochlear blood flow. </p...|$|R
40|$|Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (CPVT) {{is linked to}} mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR 2) or calsequestrin. We recently found that the drug flecainide inhibits RyR 2 channels and prevents CPVT in mice and humans. Here we compared the effects of flecainide and tetracaine, a known RyR 2 inhibitor ineffective in CPVT myocytes, on arrhythmogenic Ca²⁺ waves and elementary sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ release events, Ca²⁺ sparks. In ventricular myocytes isolated from a CPVT mouse model, flecainide significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>spark</b> amplitude and spark width, resulting in a 40 % reduction in spark mass. Surprisingly, flecainide significantly increased spark frequency. As a result, flecainide had no significant effect on spark-mediated SR Ca²⁺ leak or SR Ca²⁺ content. In contrast, tetracaine decreased spark frequency and spark-mediated SR Ca²⁺ leak, resulting in a significantly increased SR Ca²⁺ content. Measurements in permeabilized rat ventricular myocytes confirmed the different effects of flecainide and tetracaine on spark frequency and Ca²⁺ waves. In lipid bilayers, flecainide inhibited RyR 2 channels by open state block, whereas tetracaine primarily prolonged RyR 2 closed times. The differential effects of flecainide and tetracaine on sparks and RyR 2 gating can explain why flecainide, unlike tetracaine, {{does not change the}} balance of SR Ca²⁺ fluxes. We suggest that the smaller spark mass contributes to flecainide's antiarrhythmic action by reducing the probability of saltatory wave propagation between adjacent Ca²⁺ release units. Our results indicate that inhibition of the RyR 2 open state provides a new therapeutic strategy to prevent diastolic Ca²⁺ waves resulting in triggered arrhythmias, such as CPVT...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} recent years’ {{exploding}} data generation in life sciences, increasing downstream analysis capabilities is paramount {{to address the}} asymmetry of innovation in data creation contra processing capacities. Many contemporaneously used tools are sequential programs, ofttimes including convoluted dependencies leading to workflows crashing due to misconfiguration, detrimental to both development efforts and production, also inducing duplicate work upon re-execution. This thesis proposes a distributed and easy-to-use general framework for work- flow creation and ad hoc parallelization of existing serial programs. In furtherance of reducing wall-clock time consumed by big data processing pipelines, its processing is horizontally scaled out, whilst supporting recovery and tool validation. COMBUSTI/O is a cloud and hpc ready framework for pipelined execution of unmodified third-party program binaries on <b>Spark.</b> It supports <b>tool</b> requirements of named input and output files, usage and redirection of standard streams, and combinations of these, as well as both coarse and fine granularity state recovery.

40|$|AimsCa 2 + {{waves are}} thought to be {{important}} in the aetiology of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. There have been conflicting results regarding whether flecainide reduces Ca 2 + waves in isolated cardiomyocytes. We sought to confirm whether flecainide inhibits waves in the intact cardiomyocyte and to elucidate the mechanism. Methods and resultsWe imaged spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + release events in healthy adult rat cardiomyocytes. Variation in stimulation frequency was used to produce Ca 2 + sparks or waves. Spark frequency, wave frequency, and wave velocity were reduced by flecainide {{in the absence of a}} reduction of SR Ca 2 + content. Inhibition of INa via alternative pharmacological agents (tetrodotoxin, propafenone, or lidocaine) produced similar changes. To assess the contribution of INa to spark and wave production, voltage clamping was used to activate contraction from holding potentials of- 80 or- 40 mV. This confirmed that reducing Na+ influx during myocyte stimulation is sufficient to reduce waves and that flecainide only causes Ca 2 + wave reduction when INa is active. It was found that Na+/Ca 2 +-exchanger (NCX) -mediated Ca 2 + efflux was significantly enhanced by flecainide and that the effects of flecainide on wave frequency could be reversed by reducing [Na +]o, suggesting an important downstream role for NCX function. ConclusionFlecainide <b>reduces</b> <b>spark</b> and wave frequency in the intact rat cardiomyocyte at therapeutically relevant concentrations but the mechanism involves INa reduction rather than direct ryanodine receptor (RyR 2) inhibition.
