40|$|Known {{handling}} {{units are}} designed as headers which travel on a gantry crane for the filling process. The filling nozzle and the filling tube {{are attached to}} the header, the filling tube is pulled out of the header for filling and inserted in the fuel tank <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> If the vehicle moves while the filling tube is approached and inserted, there is a risk that the filling tube no longer enters into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> In order to introduce the filling tube easily into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> of the vehicle, the handling unit is fitted with a docking element to which a position detector is assigned; the position detector is connected to a control unit on the handling unit. Before inserting the filling tube into the <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> the docking element is docked onto the fuel tank cap. The docking element can be guided precisely to the tank cap and attached to it by means of the position detector. The handling unit is also suitable if there are relative movements between the vehicle and the unit while t he filling tube is approached...|$|R

The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> or access panel, and is secured by means of metal buttons or snaps inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprops use bladder tanks. One major down-side to this type of tank is the tendency for materials to work harden through extensive use making them brittle causing cracks. One major plus side is the ability to utilise as much of the aircraft as possible to store fuel.|$|R

Since the main components for automatic filling are easily accessible, there is the danger {{that they can be}} willfully or accidentally damaged. In order to protect the main components from accidental or willful damage, the handling unit is designed as a tank robot which is housed inside the tank island. The tank robot can reliably grab the filler nozzle by means of its grippers and easily guide it to the <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> of any motor vehicle. The filling device is not only suitable for conveying fluid fuels but also for pressurized gases...|$|R
50|$|The Typ 87 is a 2-door offroad sedan. The visual {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} the KdF-Wagen because the KdF-Wagen body was also used for the Typ 87. Due to the 5¼-16 offroad tyres, the wings had to be increased in size with an additional metal strip next to the bonnet and boot. The step strips were also increased in width. While the boot of the KdF-Wagen holds a spare wheel in front of the fuel tank, the Typ 87 has an additional 20 l fuel canister instead at the same place. The spare wheel is located on the 40 l fuel tank which has a modified <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> Chassis and body are connected with screws. By default, the Kommandeurswagen has a sunroof.|$|R
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|R
50|$|A body lift is {{a common}} and {{affordable}} method to run larger tires on a vehicle.(For body lift involving flight, such as airships or missiles, see Aerodynamic lift)It involves installing spacers where the body mounts to the frame {{in order to increase}} the clearance between tires and the body. This is often used to allow the placement of a larger motor for an engine swap. Body lifts can be built at home from components, or they can be purchased as kits from manufacturers. Properly installed kits are not easily noticed, while home built kits often look incomplete. Complete kits include brackets to realign the bumpers to match the body, and gap guards are purchased to cover the frame. Depending on the model of vehicle, they may also include steering shaft extensions and extensions for fuel <b>filler</b> <b>necks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nozzle Based Technologies : In this system, the {{fuelling}} nozzle has a reader mounted on it which, when {{inserted into the}} vehicles <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> reads the vehicles ID using near field or RFID technology. Once plagued by the breakage of wires running down the outside or inside of the hose from the reader to the FM Terminal, the latest generation use a radio link to pass the data making their use in a commercial environment a viable option. The advantage {{of this type of}} system is that the {{fuelling nozzle}} must be fully inserted into the vehicle before fuel starts to flow, and fuelling stops if the nozzle is removed, making on-site fuel theft into containers much more difficult. Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop off-site fuel theft and so should be coupled with anti syphoning technologies to complete the system.|$|R
50|$|Also after 747 EUS had {{finished}} demonstrating it entered service with the Preston-area independent Bamber Bridge Motor Services and retained its Albion Grille badge. During its demonstration it spent long spells on loan to Glasgow Corporation Transport (fully one year) and Edinburgh Corporation Transport. Neither were likely customers for the Lowlander, having bought high-capacity single deckers (respectively 30 Leyland Royal Tiger Worldmaster and 100 Leyland Tiger Cub) from 1956 to 1961 for their height-restricted routes. Glasgow had previously announced a large order for Atlanteans and Edinburgh were mainly committed to Titans but dithering between body layouts, lengths and braking systems. It {{is interesting that}} Edinburgh ordered an example but perhaps it was not bodied because any coachbuilder would have had trouble providing adequate nearside visibility for the driver had it been fitted with the Leyland/BMMO full-width bonnet assembly standard at Edinburgh. With {{a full complement of}} badges a Lowlander, regardless to whom it was delivered, would have carried an enamelled Albion saltire shield on the flap concealing the <b>radiator</b> <b>filler,</b> either Leyland or Albion in stylised chrome-plated lettering across the fourth slat down on the radiator grille and a Lowlander badge in chrome finish and Leyland-style script, on the nearside {{at the foot of the}} grille panel, just by the nearside end of the registration number plate.|$|R

The front fenders were enlarged, new front turn signals (identical to the ones on American spec Beetles) were added, and round, enlarged taillights were introduced, one year after their appearance on German Beetles (except the 1973 VW 1200). The engine cover remained unchanged, except it no longer had an emblem. Inside, the front seats were re-designed, and the interior colour was changed from gray to black. Also, the front hood release lever was relocated inside the glovebox, as on 1969 and later German Beetles.|$|R
2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up.

50|$|Saurer F007: Simultaneously {{with the}} Saurer F006 the Saurer F007 was {{introduced}} in 1980 as a Pinzgauer High-Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle with similar versions available to the public. The F007 uses the same chassis and the same drive unit as the F006, however, unlike the F006 {{it does not have}} the cab behind the engine, but instead the engine compartment is internally located (as with many vans). It is therefore called a cab. Unlike the F006 the F007 has three windshield wiper blades instead of two, four headlights instead of two, and the front parking lights and turn signals are housed in the same headlamp shell. The gasoline tank <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> is on the left side immediately behind the driver's door, and not as in the F006 on the right side between the rear and the rear wheel. The vehicle has a fixed cab which is open to the rear. The cargo area, passenger space is covered with a plastic sheet, including two plastic windows on each side. Again, this was based on the concept of the cab-over model 260 F by Monteverdi. For Swiss Army procurement, starting from 1982, SUV's in addition to dedicated military vehicles were prepared for testing. Here, too, the Swiss Army examined and appreciated the high-road tested prototypes of the F007, but did not buy the vehicle. The existing Saurer F007's are now privately owned.|$|R

50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R

Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972–73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel <b>filler</b> <b>neck</b> moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972–73 models.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years, vehicle {{emissions}} {{have shown a}} negative impact on environment and human health. A new strategy has been used by automakers to reduce a vehicle’s weight which significantly reduce fuel consumption and C 02 emissions. A very light car consumes very less fuel as it needs to overcome less inertia, decreasing the required power to movie the vehicle. Reducing weight is the easiest way to increase fuel economy and making it by just 10 % can increase its efficiency 6 to 8 percent. For a normal scale 80 % of vehicles weight is shared among chassis, power train and other exterior components. Almost 60 % of the vehicles weight is comprised of steel and the remaining is with cast and extruded aluminum and magnesium alloys. Our main aim is to look for the parts like Fuel tank holder, Fuel <b>filler</b> <b>neck,</b> Turbo inlet assembly, and Brake lines, Dash board frame which are made from steel and replace them with extruded aluminum alloys, to analyze a conventional rear wheel aluminum drive shaft {{and replace it with a}} new design and with a new aluminum alloy. The current project involves dismantling an automobile and looking for feasible steel parts and making samples, analyzing the hardness of the samples. These parts are optimally analyzed using Ansys Finite element analysis tool, these parts are subjected to the constraints such as three-point bending, tensile testing, hydrostatic pressure and also torsional stress action on the drive shaft, the deformation and stress are observed in these parts. The results show the current steel parts can be replaced with 3000 series aluminum alloy and the drive shaft can be replaced with new design with 6061 -T 6 Al-alloy which decreases 25 % of the shaft weight...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{fuel tanks}} can {{decrease}} vehicle weight and incidence of corrosion plastics autos Plastic fuel tanks can decrease vehicle weight and incidence of corrosion Metal fuel tanks, which {{have historically been}} made of terne-coated steel (an 8 % tin-lead coating), are susceptible to interior corrosion from fuel and exterior corrosion from elements such as road chemicals, salt, mud, and gravel. 1, 2 Over time, fuel tanks that experience corrosion can become weak and subsequently wither. A defective fuel tank can pose serious risk of the vehicle burning or exploding. 3 • High-density polyethylene (HDPE) tanks are inert to the corrosive environments {{inside and outside of}} the tank. 2 In addition, the plastic resins that compose plastic fuel tank systems together can help dissipate electrostatic charge to prevent igniting fuel. 4 The structural integrity of plastic tanks can also add to vehicle safety. Rather than welding metal pieces together, plastic tanks are formed by blowing a thick continuous tube of plastic within a mold that determines the final shape of the virtually seamless part, which can include the <b>filler</b> <b>neck.</b> Not only does this seamless construction afford auto manufacturers design flexibility, but it also prevents failure in seam areas, so that plastic tanks can be safer in crashes. 1, 2 Often, plastic tanks are made of up to six layers, which work together to prevent vapor permeability and provide additional structural stability. 5 Plastic tank systems also serve the dual purpose of decreasing the vehicle’s overall weight, as an average plastic tank weighs two-thirds less than an average steel tank. 5, 6 A blow molded fuel tank saved the Audi A 6 up to 20 % in weight, with an efficient utilization of space, but without risk of corrosion. 9 Used with permission...|$|R

The Model 355 was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by Fisher and on the Series 30 by Fleetwood. The bodies on the Series 30 were shared with the Cadillac V-12 and V-16. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. Bumpers were a stylish but ineffective biplane design, mounted against telescoping springs. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was {{a feature of the}} overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and <b>radiator</b> <b>filler</b> cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side panel. Windshields were fixed and steeply sloping; 18 degrees on Fisher bodies, 25 degrees flat or a 29.5 degree V on Fleetwood bodies. Cowl vents opened toward the windshield; one vent on flat windshield bodies, two vents projecting through openings in the hood on V-shaped windshield bodies. Bodies were 2.0 in lower than on previous models. Added passenger space in the front compartment was achieved by moving the hand brake lever {{to the left of the}} driver, under the instrument panel. Rear fenders were airfoil shaped and carried rear lights that matched the headlights. The gas tank filler was on the left side at the rear of the body, on Fleetwood bodies in the left rear fender. All bodies featured beaver tail deck that completely covered the chassis. On Fleetwood bodies the spare was concealed under the rear deck, unless optional fender mounts were specified. Independent front suspension was introduced, called [...] "knee-action". Engine horsepower increased to 120.|$|R
