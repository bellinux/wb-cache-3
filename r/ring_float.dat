In some combinations of design and condition parameters of the rotor bearing system, the dimension of rotor and rings motion trajectory can essentially increase, though it is still limited [1 – 3].

BFRS {{which has a}} thickness of bump (0. 076, 0. 1 and 0. 12 mm) are separately tested for pressure-drops of 3. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0 MPa and rotor-speed up to 24, 800 rpm. The measured data included leakage performance, attitude angle, lock-up eccentric ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping and equivalent whirl frequency ratio to decide the whirling stability of seal were compared with <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal. When the thickness of bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seals is increasing, leakage flow rate somewhat increases. Also, the lock-up eccentric ratio of the bump <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal with large thickness is {{lower than that of}} the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal or small thickness of bump foil. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds in both cases. The direct damping coefficients increase significantly with the increments in bump-foil thickness and hydrostatic pressure-drop, but diminish with the rising rotor-speed. Especially, Coulomb friction damping force between the bump foil and housing surface contributes to the enhancement of direct damping coefficient value. Whirl frequency ratio of the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> seal without bump shows somewhat small in low speed ranges. When bump foil thickness is 0. 074 mm or 0. 1 mm, WFR is insensitive in rotating speed and pressure. But BFRS(0. 12 mm) shows up more stable tendency according to decreasing whirl frequency ratio in high speed ranges. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used to enhance the stability in high pressure and high speed turbomachinery seals...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} common faults, rotor {{imbalance}} in a turbocharger will give rise to the bending vibration, which may cause damage to and even destroy the bearings and impellers. Therefore, it is necessary to detect rotor imbalance as early as possible.

In order to reveal the behaviours of oil film instabilities the model takes into account nonlinear hydrodynamic oil film forces instead of linearization. A two-dimensional elastic collision model is introduced to deal with the rub-impact process between such solid parts as journal, <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> and the bearing. In addition, the change of clearances in <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearing due to temperature increases are also estimated by ignoring the variation of lubricating oil viscosity.

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{models and}} fast {{computational}} programs aim {{to improve the}} design and performance of turbocharger (TC) rotordynamics. Most commercial automotive TCs incorporate <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearings (FRBs) owing to their low cost and reduced power losses. However, persistent subsynchronous motions afflict this type of rotor/bearing system, albeit reaching limit cycles that enable their continuous operation. FRBs comprise two fluid films in series and are prone to show one or two subsynchronous instabilities over extended speed ranges of operation. A flow model for prediction of FRB forced response is detailed here. The model incorporates a lumped-parameter thermal energy balance for estimation of the lubricant viscosity and thermal growth of the rotor, bearing and <b>floating</b> <b>ring.</b> The FRB model, fully integrated into a non-linear rotordynamics computational program, predicts the <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> speed, journal and ring eccentricities, power loss and the rotordynamic force coefficients of {{the inner and outer}} films {{as a function of the}} load applied at a given rotor speed. Knowledge of the actual load conditions, static and dynamic, and the changes in operating clearance and effective lubricant viscosity are most important for accurate estimation of a TC dynamic forced response. Predictions for the exit lubricant temperature, power losses and <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> speeds agree well with measurements obtained in an automotive turbocharger test rig. The rotordynamic stability characteristics of the test TC are also highlighted...|$|R

New <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> capsules were developed using different polymers and were compared for various parameters. The formulation with HPMC and sodium CMC has better floating properties. The effects of polymers concentration on drug release were studies by in vitro release studies. The interaction studies of combined drug with polymers were determined using FT-IR spectroscopy. The entrapped air within the gel barrier and lower densities of HPMC and sodium CMC resulted in better floating behavior. Steady slow gel formations showed prolonged drug release. The in vitro release rates were generally found to be faster with low concentration of carbopol showing release within 2 h, while formulations containing high amount of HPMC showed release in 8 h. In particular, the higher concentration of HPMC formulation shows the best drug release performance. A very low change in peak shift was observed only with sodium alginate formulations.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Turbochargers are commonly used to increase the power output and efficiency of internal combustion automotive engines. Conventional turbocharger rotors are usually supported on <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> journal bearings (FRBs) running with engine oil as lubricant. FRBs are comprised of an inner and outer thin lubricated films in series, and offer lower power losses and also cooler operation conditions than a single-land hydrodynamic journal bearing (Wilcock, 1983). FRBs are also very attractive for turbomachinery because of the inherent high damping characteristics associated to the presence of two fluid films (Orcutt and Ng, 1968). However FRBs can lead to rotordynamic instability, exhibiting subsynchronous rotor whirl in most of their operating range. Nonetheless, FRBs often reach stable limit cycles, thus becoming cost-effective solutions to the rotor support design. The main objective of the research was to identify the fundamental physical parameters that affect the dynamic performance of a rotor supported on a <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearing from measurements of the rotor response to calibrated imbalance masses. Experiments were performed on a test rig to measure the system threshold of instability, amplitude of limit cycle, and range of whirl frequencies as a function of bearing load, rotor imbalance and the rotor speed. Measurements of the rotor response demonstrate that the rotor-FRB system renders an unstable behavior for almost the entire journal speed range and achieves a limit cycle at the maximum running speed (10, 000 rpm). The system non linearity is evidenced by two self-excited subsynchronous vibration components identified from the experiments. The first subsynchronous component is associated with the instability of the inner film and the second component is associated with the instability of the outer film. Localized absence of subsynchronous vibration components is evident for higher supply pressures at specific operating speeds. Full <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> and semi <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> conditions are examined in the study. The semi <b>floating</b> bearing <b>ring</b> is the most unfavorable condition for the rotor bearing system due to the high levels of vibration observed on the test rotor-FRB...|$|R

Three basic groups of rotors are analyzed and some methods of suppressing instability are shown. In the 1 st group are classical elastic rotors sup-ported in hydrodynamic bearings. Practically all high-speed rotors now run in tilt-ing pad bearings, which are inherently stable, but in specific conditions even tiling pad bearings may not ensure rotor stability. The 2 nd group is composed of combus-tion engines turbocharger rotors, which are characteristic by heavy impellers at both overhung ends of elastic shaft. These rotors are in most cases supported in <b>floating</b> <b>ring</b> bearings, which bring special features to rotor behaviour.
