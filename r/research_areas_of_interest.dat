50|$|Most of Heizer’s {{research}} was in prehistoric and historic Native American {{peoples of the}} western United States, particularly in Nevada and California. He conducted numerous analyses of preserved materials from the caves in Nevada, particularly fossil feces or coprolites, which helped determine what the human diet consisted of and dietary changes over time. Heizer also helped {{lay the groundwork for}} scientific applications in archaeology. This research included involvement with radiocarbon dating during the 1950s, and trace elements analysis of obsidian artifacts in the 1960s and 1970s. He was never one to focus exclusively on theory, but was interested in discovering basic facts and methods in <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Heizer also used neuron activation analysis to determine trace elements on samples from his excavations in Mexico, one of the applications of this method. He then used the same idea when he tested petroglyphs.|$|E
50|$|Marilynn Brewer’s {{theory of}} optimal {{distinctiveness}} has been well-accepted {{in the field}} of social psychology and seems to be a prominent contender amongst other theories similar to its nature, as evidenced by the theory’s wide usage in current research. The theory is largely used in research that examines self-stereotyping, stereotypes and prejudice, and self-esteem (Brewer, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2003). Additional examples of current <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> using optimal distinctiveness theory include comparable incomes and effect on life satisfaction in Hong Kong (Cheung & Leung, 2007), mortality salience and effect on women’s group membership (Smith and Walsh, 2005), marketing of tobacco sales to Asian and Pacific Islander populations (Fellows and Rubin, 2006), the relationship between optimal distinctiveness and values as moderated by uncertainty orientation (Sorrentino, Seligman, & Battista, 2007), and many others, all of which are focused on the ways in which social groups influence people’s lives.|$|E

The goals of PhD programs {{are the same as}} fellowship training, though the added time provides an even greater depth in a <b>research</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> in addition to supplemental didactic curriculum. PhD programs generally do not mandate any clinical responsibilities, though the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy piloted the addition of a clinical component for their PhD clinical pharmaceutical scientist program.|$|R

40|$|Make no mistake, as I {{said in my}} article, “The Future of Grounded Theory” (Qualitative Health Research, Nov, 1999) is in {{the hands}} of the {{beginning}} PhD researcher. I said “Unformed researchers embrace grounded theory for dissertation or master’s theses when, in their view, the more preconceived methods do not give relevant answers. Unformed researchers who can choose their own methods do so at the discretion of their advisers. The principal GT users today, mostly students who are doing MA and PhD theses or dissertations, are well into their academic careers and looking for methodologies that will result in data and theories relevant to what is going on in their <b>research</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> This makes grounded theory very appealing on that one point alone — relevance. ...|$|R
30|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) can be {{released}} into the atmosphere via fossil fuel combustion and land-use changes to accelerate the greenhouse gas effect, leading to worldwide extreme weather, sea level rise, and habitation and ecological damage caused by global warming. In 2010, forests covered over 31 % of land area in the world (FAO 2011) and thus {{have an important role}} in the C cycle. Since C is fixed as biomass C and soil organic carbon (SOC) in forest systems and by the end of the 20 th century over 70 % C was sequestrated in soil and peat deposits (Dixon et al. 1994), the role of forest SOC stocks and the possibilities of SOC loss caused by land use have been <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
40|$|The European Clinical Trials Directive (EU 2001; 2001 / 20 /EC) was {{introduced}} to improve the efficiency of commercial and academic clinical trials. Concerns have been raised by interested organizations and institutions regarding the potential for negative impact of the Directive on non-commercial European clinical research. Interested researchers within the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) were surveyed to determine whether researcher experiences confirmed this view. Following a pilot study, an internet-based questionnaire was distributed to individuals in key research positions in the European haemopoietic SCT community. Seventy-one usable questionnaires were returned from participants in different EU member states.

40|$|Today, the intractions of {{the immune}} system {{of the immune}} system, nutrition, and nervous system are one of the main <b>research</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in {{immunology}} and disease treatment. Due to changes in the mood, behavior, and diet of an individual during fasting period, the body's internal homeostasis is affected. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effects of Ramadan fasting on lymphocyte subgroups, which are the main specific immune cells in the body. For this purpose, in years 1999 and 2000, thirty‐eight healthy Muslims (9 females and 29 males), within the age range of 17 to 51 years (mean age= 35. 4 years), were assessed before the start and one day before the end of Ramadan.

30|$|The first <b>research</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{concerns}} {{the treatment of}} computational trust for models of access control and network analysis. This area includes several logical model and algorithmic treatments, {{with an eye on}} applications and it spans several disciplines, including logics, cryptography, network theory, security protocols. Since the Bell-LaPadula Model in access control theory (Bell and LaPadula 1973), trust is intended as a property of agents, as opposed to security as a property of the system: trusted subjects are allowed to violate security constraints and trustworthiness of resources corresponds to prevention of unauthorised change. In more recent resource-based access control models, trustworthiness is either defined by temporal-spatial constraints (Chandran and Joshi 2005), or by user-defined constraints (Chakraborty and Ray 2006; Oleshchuk 2012). In authentication logics, trust is coupled to beliefs with application to distributed settings (Barker and Genovese 2011).|$|R
40|$|In {{hematological}} malignancies, {{there are}} numerous examples of lymphocyte developmental genes {{playing a role in}} cancer formation. In this article, we discuss how processes of fetal organogenesis are also operant in lung tumorigenesis. We first review four pathways important in lung cancer (MYC, Hedgehog, Rb and Wnt) and describe the experimental evidence linking them to lung development. Then, we review genome-wide analysis approaches of both RNA (gene expression profiling) and DNA (copy number alterations) and how they have uncovered links between lung cancer and fetal lung development. Finally, the recent discovery of three closely linked developmental transcription factors, which are co-amplified as cooperating lung oncogenes, is discussed. We suggest that inhibition of the fetal developmental pathways selectively reactivated in cancer cells is a <b>research</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> for novel anti-cancer therapies in light of the presumed low toxicity of such therapies to the nearby normal adult cells...|$|R
