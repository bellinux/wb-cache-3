50|$|A {{mass grave}} {{containing}} upwards of 48 bodies and possibly more than 60 was discovered near {{the lake in}} 2001. The bodies {{were believed to be}} those of Kosovo Albanians killed by Serbian forces during the 1999 conflict, brought to the lake in a refrigerated lorry dumped there during NATO air raids. The burial site was a gravel spit on the north bank of Derventa River, close to its junction with Lake Perucac, 13 km from Bajina Basta and 2 km from the village of Rastiste. It contained parts of a truck <b>refrigerator</b> <b>container</b> that had formerly held the bodies. The bones and clothing retrieved showed isolated evidence of burning; {{there was no evidence that}} this had occurred atthe burial site.|$|E
50|$|All organohypervalent iodine {{reagents}} are solids {{that are}} fairly stable {{at room temperature}} and generally insensitive to atmospheric oxygen and moisture.Most reagents have relatively low toxicity and can be handled easily. IBD and IBTA are stable and commerciallyavailable,or can be prepared by standard procedures. Iodosobenzene can be prepared by hydrolysis of either(dichloroiodo)benzene or IBD and should be stored in a <b>refrigerator</b> in dark <b>containers.</b>|$|R
30|$|P. ovata seeds were {{obtained}} from the local market in March, 2016. The seeds were defatted with petroleum ether (40 – 60  °C) for preparation of lipoidal extract to obtain the fixed oil, and then macerated in distilled water to prepare the aqueous extract to obtain the carbohydrate. The collected extracts were concentrated in the rotary evaporator (at 50  °C) and the dried residue was stored at the <b>refrigerator</b> in tight <b>containers</b> until use.|$|R
5000|$|Marinade is {{prepared}} by the mixture of {{half a cup of}} olive oil, three onions, garlic, half teaspoon saffron, salt and black pepper. One kilogram of lamb is cut into 1 cm thick and 4-5 cm long pieces. It should be marinated overnight in <b>refrigerator,</b> and the <b>container</b> should be covered. The next day, the lamb is threaded on long, thin metal skewers. It is brushed with marinade and is barbecued for 5-10 minutes on each side. Kabab-e Barg ...|$|R
5000|$|They come to {{the show}} {{location}} and another worker tells the kids that Uncle George will be right there. They mistake the Wild Man from Borneo named Bumbo (a man dressed with horns) for the real Uncle George, who is never seen as he was off running an errand. The Wild Man spots Stymie's candy, he shouts [...] "Yumm Yumm Eat-Em-Up, Eat-Em-Up!!!", and chases the kids back to their house. Once there, the wild man asks for more candy, saying “Yumm, yumm, Eat-Em-Up!” and chases the kids throughout the house. The wild man runs after them, messes the house up, eats everything in the <b>refrigerator</b> whole (including <b>containers</b> plus eggs & their shells!), drinks wine, gets drunk and further destroys much of the house while continuing to chase the kids inebriated, wielding a kitchen knife, repeating [...] "Eat-Em-Up, Eat-Em-Up". The Little Rascals themselves fend off the Wild Man in their usual mischievous ways. Stymie is almost done in until Dorothy cracks the ruffian {{over the head with}} a vase. The Kid from Borneo is countervailed by the Rascals, but {{at the expense of the}} destruction of some of the house by the mistaken Uncle George.|$|R
40|$|Dismantling and {{recycling}} of end-of-life {{vessels in the}} so-called environmentally friendly manner {{has been a major}} challenge faced by ship owners, ship dismantling yard owners as well as government agencies worldwide today. On one-hand, this paper intends to provide the knowledge-base needed by individual yard owners for planning their short term and long term activities. On the other hand it is hoped that this paper will serve as {{an essential part of the}} management information system which will help in governance of cluster of ship dismantling yards. The emission factors estimated in this study using field sample survey of 241 ships dismantled during 2011 - 2013 in the cluster at Alang Port could be put to use while predicting the quantities of wastes generated from dismantling of six types of ships (bulk carrier, general cargo, <b>container,</b> <b>refrigerator</b> and passenger) which further can be used in preparing environmental management plan to handle the same. The % ships and % cumulative LDT of ships in a given category could also be predicted for the cluster using the validated results reported in this study. Finally, on the basis of primary data collected from over 100 yards in Alang Port and with the help of face-to-face interactions with several field personnel; a "typical ship dismantling {{and recycling}} procedure" was articulated. It is argued that the in-depth understanding of the prevailing "know-how" alone can help in development and diffusion of cleaner technologies for benefit of this sector and facilitate in instituting the integrated waste management system that will eventually ensure safe and environmentally friendly ship recycling - especially in the context of "Ship Recycling Regulation" recently passed by the European Parliament as well as the draft of "Hong Kong Convention", being negotiated at the International Maritime Organization.

40|$|A design concept, and a {{fabrication}} {{process that would}} implement the design concept, have been proposed for nearly seamless vacuum-insulated boxes {{that could be the}} main structural components of a variety of controlled-temperature containers, including common household <b>refrigerators</b> and insulating <b>containers</b> for shipping foods. In a typical case, a vacuum-insulated box would be shaped like a rectangular parallelepiped conventional refrigerator box having five fully closed sides and a hinged door on the sixth side. Although it is possible to construct the five-closed-side portion of the box as an assembly of five unitary vacuum-insulated panels, it is not desirable to do so because the relatively high thermal conductances of the seams between the panels would contribute significant amounts of heat leakage, relative to the leakage through the panels themselves. In contrast, the proposal would make it possible to reduce heat leakage by constructing the five-closed-side portion of the box plus the stationary portion (if any) of the sixth side as a single, seamless unit; the only remaining seam would be the edge seal around the door. The basic cross-sectional configuration of each side of a vacuum-insulated box according to the proposal would be that of a conventional vacuum-insulated panel: a low-density, porous core material filling a partially evacuated space between face sheets. However, neither the face sheets nor the core would be conventional. The face sheets would be opposite sides of a vacuum bag. The core material would be a flexible polymer-modified silica aerogel of the type described in Silica/Polymer and Silica/Polymer/Fiber Composite Aero - gels (MSC- 23736) in this issue of NASA Tech Briefs. As noted in that article, the stiffness of this core material against compression is greater than that of prior aerogels. This is an important advantage because it translates to greater retention of thickness and, hence, of insulation performance when pressure is applied across the thickness, in particular, when the space between the face sheets is evacuated, causing the core material to be squeezed between the face sheets by atmospheric pressure. Fabrication of a typical vacuum-insulated box according to the proposal would begin with fabrication of a cross-shaped polymer-modified aerogel blanket. The dimensions of the cross would be chosen so that (1) the central rectangular portion of the cross would form the core for the back of the box and (2) the arms of the cross could be folded 90 from the back plane to form the cores of the adjacent four sides of the box. Optionally, the blanket could include tabs for joining the folded sides of the blanket along mating edges and tabs that could serve as hinges for the door. Vacuum bags in the form of similar five-sided boxes would be made of a suitable polymeric film, one bag to fit the outer core surface, the other to fit the inner core surface. By use of commercially available film-sealing equipment, these box-shaped bags would be seamed together to form a single vacuum bag encasing the box-shaped core. Also, a one-way valve would be sealed to the bag. Through this valve, the interior of the bag would be evacuated to a pressure between 1 and 10 torr (approximately between 0. 13 and 1. 3 kPa). The polymer-modified aerogel core material is known to perform well as a thermal insulator in such a partial vacuum...|$|R
