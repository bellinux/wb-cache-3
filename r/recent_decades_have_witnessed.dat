In this paper, we investigate the effect of weight assignment in the hybrid of MD and HC, and find that a new hybrid algorithm of MD and HC with balanced weights will achieve the optimal recommendation results, we name it balanced diffusion (BD) algorithm. Numerical experiments on three benchmark data sets, MovieLens, Netflix and RateYourMusic (RYM), show that the performance of BD algorithm outperforms the existing diffusion-based methods on the three important recommendation metrics, accuracy, diversity and novelty. Specifically, it can not only provide accurately recommendation results, but also yield higher diversity and novelty in recommendations by accurately recommending unpopular objects.

Such proliferation has contributed to seismic social and political movements around the globe, but is yet to make a noticeable imprint in business organisations. While many researchers and practitioners have advocated the transition of social media to the organisational sphere, the actuality of this transition is still deficient, necessitating thorough investigation. Consequently, this study addresses this pressing issue by first, presenting a vantage point on the theoretical and practical underpinnings of social media and the revolutionising role they stand to play in organisations. An empirical case study is then presented highlighting the actual diffusion and utilisation of social media in a regional branch of a global consultancy and audit firm. The findings hold important implications as they identify key drivers contributing to the successful diffusion of social media in organisations, and their corresponding utilisation for enabling an inclusive and innovative environment in the workplace. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The <b>recent</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> <b>witnessed</b> an {{increasing}} popularity of recommendation systems, which help users acquire relevant knowledge, commodities, and services from an overwhelming information ocean on the Internet.

Gibbs sampling is employed to approximate all the probabilities in the two-step process. The experiment results on three real-world data sets MovieLens, Netflix, and Last. fm show that our method exhibits a competitive performance on precision, coverage, and diversity in comparison with the other four typical recommendation methods. Moreover, we present an approximate strategy to reduce the computing complexity of our method with a slight degradation of the performance...|$|R

40|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> <b>witnessed</b> the {{popularity}} of project alliancing and seen the increasing importance of interorganizational cooperation between different organizations in the construction industry. Both scholars and practitioners view alliancing as an alternative project delivery method {{to deal with the}} lack of integration, to improve the efficiency and performance of the construction industry. Despite the fact that alliancing can deliver various benefits at both the project level and the organizational level, there remained some mixed views on cost effectiveness in project alliancing due to its lack of competition nature.
