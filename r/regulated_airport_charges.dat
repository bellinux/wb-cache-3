40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the intensity of}} competition among airports affects their technical efficiency by computing airports’ markets {{on the basis of}} a potential demand approach. We find that the intensity of competition has a negative impact on airports’ efficiency in Italy during the 2005 – 2008 period. This implies that airports belonging to a local air transportation system where competition is strong exploit their inputs less intensively than do airports with local monopoly power. Furthermore, we find that public airports are more efficient than private and mixed ones. Since public airports take into account the positive externalities created by air transportation in the local economy, they are more willing to subsidize airlines in developing the airports’ connections. Hence, policy makers should provide incentives to implement airports’ specialization in local systems where competition is strong. Moreover, when <b>regulating</b> <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> they should take into account the impact of the above externalities. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} factors determining <b>airport</b> <b>charges.</b> Using {{data for}} 100 large airports in Europe, {{we find that}} they charge higher prices when they move more passengers. Additionally, competition from other transport modes and nearby airports imposes some discipline on the pricing behavior of airports. Low-cost car-riers and airlines with a high market share {{seem to have a}} stronger countervailing power. We also find that private <b>airports</b> not <b>regulated</b> <b>charge</b> higher prices than public or <b>regulated</b> <b>airports.</b> Finally, the regulation mechanism does not seem to influence substantially the level of <b>airport</b> <b>charges...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{to estimate the}} average airlines operational costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> per route is important for airlines companies trying to open new routes and for data generation for other purpose such as transport modeling, simulation modeling, investment analyses for airlines and airports, etc. In this paper, a {{mathematical model}} is proposed for calculating airline operations costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> on a certain route by a specific airline. This model {{was set up by}} analyzing the domestic US air transport market. A multi-regression analysis determined the relation between distance, airline operations costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> between origin and destination and market fares. The model calculates the average airlines operations costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> per route by using these costs as parameters to estimates airlines routes fares. Thus, Airlines and airports cost factors are estimated by least square method between real fares data per route and the proposed model estimations. The results have been validated comparing with real airlines operations costs data showing a correlation over 99 %, meaning that the average airlines operational costs and <b>airports</b> <b>charges</b> per route can be estimated by the model using real fares data and also that route fares are mainly determined by airline operations costs and <b>airport</b> <b>charges.</b> Marine & Transport TechnologyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{questions}} of why carriers advocate for higher per-passenger <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> and lower per-flight charges, and whether and when this proposal is welfare-enhancing. Specifically, the paper compares the optimal mix of per-flight and per-passenger based <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> from both a monopoly carriers' and the social viewpoints conditional on airport cost recovery. It focuses on the trade-off between price and frequency (i. e., schedule delays) when time valuations are uniform, or differ, between business and leisure passengers. We identify an easy test {{for the evaluation of}} the mix of per-passenger and per-flight based <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> by policy makers, which is simply to check whether the carrier's preferred per-flight charge is zero. Our analysis suggests that {{there is no need for}} immediate regulatory corrections of the current trend towards the strong use of per-passenger based <b>airport</b> <b>charges...</b>|$|R

The main conclusions are that the CEC proposals will be difficult to enforce because they are vague, implementation is left to the individual member states, and because they allow for a variety of approaches to charging systems which can include substantial cross-subsidisation across aeronautical and non-aeronautical uses at one or more airports. The fact that the Commission will not have significant powers of enforcement further reduces the impact which the proposals can have. <b>airport</b> <b>charging</b> systems marginal cost pricing CEC <b>Airport</b> <b>Charges</b> Directive...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} strategic {{interaction between}} intercontinental airports, {{each of which}} levies <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> paid by airlines and chooses its own capacity under conditions of congestion. Congestion from intercontinental flights is common across the airports since departure and arrival airports are linked one to one, while purely domestic traffic also uses each airport. The paper focuses on five questions. First, if both continents can strategically set separate <b>airport</b> <b>charges</b> for domestic and intercontinental flights, how will the outcome differ from the first-best solution? Second, how {{is the impact of}} strategic airport behavior affected by the extent of market power of the airlines serving the intercontinental market? Third, what happens if one continent has several competing intercontinental airports, each with its own regulator, while the other has a single airport and regulator? Fourth, how effective is a non-discrimination clause for <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> which prevents independent strategic use of the intercontinental charge? Fifth, what is the effect of higher airport operating costs on one continent (a result of security or immigration procedures) on the strategic outcome? The questions are addressed with an algebraic model and results are illustrated numerically. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{allocation}} of international and domestic flights (allocation of services) into multiple airports in a metropolitan area. Through the privatization of airports, there are various types of airport operation.

Moreover, airport operators face the several types of regulations such as on <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> allocation of services, or both: therefore, we examine three types of allocation such as the decentralized decision-making by airport operators on the provision of service, the <b>airport</b> <b>charges,</b> and both.
