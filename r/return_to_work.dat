5|$|Mayor McKune met on July 27 {{with representatives}} of the Brotherhood of Trainmen. Following a meeting of the railway strikers, the firemen and brakemen agreed to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at their {{previous}} wages. Shortly thereafter, the mill workers returned to work, with assurances from W. W. Scranton. The miners, however, denounced the concession and resolved to continue the strike.|$|E
30|$|Second, age and {{education}} {{appear to be}} more important for <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> both with the current employer in an accommodated job and with a new employer than for <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the current employer in a job without accommodations. For example, the coefficient of age over 55  years is - 0.564 in the equations of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the current employer in an accommodated job and - 2.311 in the equations of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a new employer, whereas the coefficient is - 0.149 in the equation of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the current employer without accommodations.|$|R
30|$|Sankar et al. [3] {{found that}} {{patients}} who <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at 1  month had more pain and more functional/work limitations {{than those who}} <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> later. This implies {{that they may have}} <b>returned</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> too early and may have benefitted from a graduated RTW.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, those <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{with their}} current {{employer}} in an accommodated job on average also have significantly lower exit rates than those <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{with a new}} employer. Indeed, workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> their current employer without accommodations also have a significantly lower exit rate than those <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> a new employer; i.e., the coefficient of the variable of new employer (0.592) is significant at a 5 per cent level. Put differently, the sick-listed workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a new employer terminate their employment {{much more quickly than}} those <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with their current employer. This finding supports the hypothesis that the job match between workers with a new employer is of poorer quality than the match between workers remaining with their current employer.|$|R

5|$|On October 16 {{the miners}} held {{a meeting and}} {{unanimously}} voted to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> They did so beginning the next day, having won nothing in concessions.

30|$|Work-related factors impeded {{some of our}} {{patients}} <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Bardgett et al.

40|$|Previous studies {{find that}} {{participation}} in educational measures does not increase sick-listed em-ployees’ chance of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> This is surprising because education is supposed to increase human capital and raise productivity. However, a higher productivity may make the participants raise their reservation wage. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} educational measures increase the chance of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in high pay jobs but reduce the chance of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in low pay jobs. To test this hypothesis, we use panel data of 671 long-term sick-listed employees to estimate a random effects hazards rate model, with <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in high paid jobs and low-medium paid jobs, re-spectively, as the two outcomes. Our findings do not support the reservation wage hypothesis. We find that while participation in education significantly increases the probability of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in medium or low paid jobs, it does not affect the probability of resuming work in high paid jobs. ...|$|R
30|$|This {{likelihood}} is optimized {{with respect}} to the regression parameters in the two logit models for the time until <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and the time until ending the employment after <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and {{with respect to}} the parameters of the discrete mixture distribution of unobserved random effects. By allowing the random effects to be correlated, the model jointly determines the selection <b>to</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (with the current employer in an accommodated job and with a new employer) and the selection out of employment after <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Doing so allows us to take into account potential selection effects because we condition upon them in the model, meaning that the estimates of workplace accommodations and new employer have a causal interpretation.|$|R
5|$|The miners {{denounced the}} {{capitulation}} of the railway workers. Governor John F.

30|$|Workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{with their}} current {{employer}} in an accommodated job {{may differ from}} workers resuming work with their current employer in a job without accommodations. Similarly, workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a new employer may differ from workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with their current employer. If these differences are unobserved and have a bearing on the subsequent employment duration, we cannot immediately identify the causal effect of workplace accommodations and change of employer on the employment duration. To mitigate or correct for possible selection effects, we estimate a distribution of unobserved heterogeneity.|$|R
5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks.

That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> keeping them away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations between strikers and the B were unsuccessful, {{and most}} strikers chose to quit rather than <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at the newly reduced wages.

40|$|The Danish {{policy towards}} work-disabled persons {{comprise}} contradictory forces. The state seeks to enhance labour market integration of work-disabled persons through vocational rehabilitation. However lax job protection legislation {{makes it easy}} for employers to dismiss sick-listed employees. We find that the process of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the old employer is different from the process of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a new employer. Furthermore, we find that separation has only limited direct effect on <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but effectively separates employees with low and high employability. Participation in educational measures seems not significantly to help the sick-listed back <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|Workers {{who become}} work-incapacitated {{may try to}} change {{employer}} or stay with their current employer in an accommodated job.

We simultaneously estimate the duration until <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and the duration of employment using the timing-of-event approach. We find that workplace accommodations increase employment durations with the current employer. We also find that workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a new employer have significantly shorter employment durations than workers <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with the current employer (with or without accommodations).|$|R
