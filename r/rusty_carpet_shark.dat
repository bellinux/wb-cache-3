50|$|Nebrius is a genus of <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> in {{the family}} Ginglymostomatidae.|$|R
50|$|The <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{a diverse}} group of sharks with differing sizes, appearances, diets, and habits. They first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Jurassic; the oldest known orectolobiform genera are Folipistrix (known from Toarcian to Aalenian of Belgium and Germany), Palaeobrachaelurus (Aalenian to Barremian) and Annea (Toarcian to Bajocian of Europe). All species have two dorsal fins and a relatively short, transverse mouth that does not extend behind the eyes. Besides the nostrils are barbels, tactile sensory organs, and grooves known as nasoral grooves connect the nostrils to the mouth. Five short gill slits are {{just in front of the}} origin of the pectoral fin and the fifth slit tends to overlap the fourth one. A spiracle occurs beneath each eye which is used in respiration. The only exception to this rule is the whale shark, the spiracles of which are situated just behind the eyes. <b>Carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> derive their common name from the fact that many species have a mottled appearance with intricate patterns reminiscent of carpet designs. The patterning provides camouflage when the fish is lying on the seabed. The largest <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> is the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) which can grow to a length of 14 m. It is the largest species of fish, but despite its size, is not dangerous, as it is a filter feeder, drawing in water through its wide mouth and sifting out the plankton. The smallest <b>carpet</b> <b>shark,</b> at up to about 30 cm long, is the barbelthroat <b>carpet</b> <b>shark,</b> (Cirrhoscyllium expolitum). Some of the most spectacularly coloured members of the order are the necklace <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> (Parascyllium variolatum), the zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum), and the ornate wobbegong (Orectolobus ornatus). Nurse sharks and whale sharks have a fringe of barbels on their snouts, and barbelthroat <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> (Cirrhoscyllium expolitum) have barbels dangling from their throat regions.|$|R
40|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) and the grey <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> (Chiloscyllium punctatum) are {{commonly found in}} periodically hypoxic environments. The ecophysiological time available for these animals to safely exploit these niches during different seasonal temperatures was examined. The time to loss of righting reflex (T (LRR)) was examined {{in response to an}} open ended anoxic challenge at three seasonal temperatures (23, 25 and 27 A degrees C). Ventilation rates were measured in an open ended anoxic challenge at 23 A degrees C and during 1. 5 h of anoxia followed by 2 h of re-oxygenation at 23 and 25 A degrees C. The mean T (LRR) of epaulette and grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> was inversely proportional to temperature. The T (LRR) was similar between species at 23 A degrees C; however, grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> had significantly reduced T (LRR) at higher temperatures. During the standardised anoxic challenge, {{epaulette shark}}s entered into ventilatory depression significantly earlier at 25 A degrees C. During re-oxygenation, epaulette sharks exposed to anoxia at 23 A degrees C had no significant increase in ventilation rates. However, after anoxic challenge and re-oxygenation at 25 A degrees C, epaulette sharks showed a significant increase in ventilation rates during re-oxygenation. Grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> displayed no evidence of ventilatory depression during anoxia. However, during re-oxygenation, grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> had significantly elevated ventilation rates above pre-experimental levels and control animals. These data demonstrate that the anoxia tolerance times of both species were temperature dependent, with a significant reduction in the T (LRR) occurring at higher temperatures. Epaulette sharks had a significantly greater T (LRR) at higher temperatures than grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks,</b> which did not enter into a ventilatory depression...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> are sharks {{classified}} in {{the order}} Orectolobiformes. Sometimes the common name [...] "carpet shark" [...] (named so because many species resemble ornately patterned carpets) is used interchangeably with [...] "wobbegong", which is the common name of sharks in the family Orectolobidae. <b>Carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> have five gill slits, two spineless dorsal fins, and a small mouth that does not extend past the eyes. Many species have barbels.|$|R
5|$|Orectolobiformes: They are {{commonly}} referred to as the <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks,</b> including zebra sharks, nurse sharks, wobbegongs, and the whale shark.|$|R
500|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} (Nebrius ferrugineus) is a species of <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Ginglymostomatidae, and the only extant member of the genus Nebrius.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are another}} small order of sharks, so called because many members have ornate {{patterns}} reminiscent of carpets. Sometimes the term [...] "carpet shark" [...] is used interchangeably with wobbegong, {{which are a}} subgroup of the order. <b>Carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> have two dorsal fins, without spines, and a small mouth that is forward of the eyes. Many have barbels and small gill slits, with the fifth slit overlapping the fourth. The upper lobe of the caudal fin tends to be mostly {{in line with the}} body, while the lower lobe is poorly developed.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf {{wobbegong}} or banded wobbegong (Orectolobus halei) is {{a species}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Orectolobidae, found in southern Australia between Southport, Queensland and Norwegian Bay, Western Australia.|$|R
5000|$|The Hemiscylliidae are {{a family}} of sharks in the order Orectolobiformes, {{commonly}} known as longtail <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> and sometimes as bamboo sharks. They are found in shallow waters of the tropical Indo-Pacific.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, {{recurring}} shark parthenogenesis {{over several}} years was demonstrated in a captive zebra shark, a type of <b>carpet</b> <b>shark.</b> DNA genotyping demonstrated that individual zebra sharks can switch from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are found}} in all the oceans of the world but {{predominantly}} in tropical and temperate waters. They are most common in the western Indo-Pacific region and are usually found in relatively deep water.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} wobbegong, Orectolobus wardi, is a <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Orectolobidae, found in the western Pacific Ocean around Australia, between latitudes 9° S to 26° S. It reaches a length of 63 cm.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf spotted {{wobbegong}} (Orectolobus parvimaculatus) is a recently described <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> {{in the family}} Orectolobidae. It is found at depths of 9 to 135 m off south-western Australia. It reaches a total length of 88.5 cm.|$|R
50|$|The floral banded {{wobbegong}} (Orectolobus floridus) is {{a recently}} described species of <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> {{found in the}} Indian Ocean off southwestern Australia. With a maximum length of up to 75 cm, it is among the smallest wobbegongs.|$|R

50|$|The Ginglymostomatidae are a {{cosmopolitan}} family of <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks,</b> containing two monotypic genera of nurse sharks. Common in shallow, tropical and subtropical waters, these sharks are sluggish and docile bottom-dwellers. Nurse sharks typically attack humans only if directly threatened.|$|R
50|$|The bamboo sharks (Hemiscylliidae) and {{the zebra}} shark (Stegostomatidae) lay eggs on the bottom, {{while the other}} <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> give live birth. The egg cases are oval and covered with {{adhesive}} fibers that serve to secure them to the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|Bottom-dwelling sharks such as {{catsharks}} and <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> have tails {{with long}} upper lobes and virtually no lower lobe. The upper lobe is {{held at a}} very low angle, which sacrifices speed for maneuverability. These sharks generally swim with eel-like undulations.|$|R
50|$|Akaimia is an extinct genus of <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> which {{existed in}} Ogrodzieniec near Zawiercie, {{southern}} Poland, {{during the middle}} or late Jurassic (Callovian or Oxfordian age). It was first named by Jan Rees in 2010 and the type species is Akaimia altucuspis.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{wobbegong}}, Orectolobus japonicus, is a <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Orectolobidae of the wobbegong family, found in the tropical western Pacific Ocean from Japan and Korea to Viet Nam and the Philippines, between latitudes 43 and 6°N. It reaches a length of 1 m.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> feed on {{the seabed}} in shallow to medium-depth waters, {{detecting}} and picking up molluscs and crustaceans and other small creatures. The wobbegongs tend to be ambush predators, lying hidden on the seabed until prey approaches. One has been observed swallowing a bamboo shark whole.|$|R
50|$|The saddle carpetshark, Cirrhoscyllium japonicum, is a <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> of {{the family}} Parascylliidae found around Japan, between latitudes 35°N and 24°N, at depths between 250 and 290 m. The saddle carpetshark is known {{to grow up to}} 49 cm in length, and it is an oviparous.|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} the hematological responses of wild and captive populations of two closely related sharks to a standardized anoxic challenge and during a 12 hr recovery period in normoxia: the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum, Bonnaterre, 1788) and the grey <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> (Chiloscyllium punctatum, Muller and Henle, 1838). Compared to normoxic controls, {{a significant increase}} in hematocrit (captive 22. 3 %; wild 35. 9 %) coupled with a decline in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration occurred in epaulette sharks indicating erythrocyte swelling in response to anoxia. However, the grey <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> had a significantly increased hematocrit (captive 27. 2 %; wild 29. 3 %), erythrocyte count (captive 37. 6 %; wild 46. 3 %) and hemoglobin concentration (captive 31. 9 %; wild 31. 5 %), suggesting a release of erythrocytes into the circulation and/or hemoconcentration in response to anoxia. Plasma glucose concentrations were maintained in both wild and captive epaulette sharks and in wild grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> during anoxia but increased significantly after 2 hr of reoxygenation (epaulette: captive 55. 8 %; wild 50. 1 %; grey carpet shark: wild 70. 3 %) and remained elevated for 12 hr. Captive grey <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> had an immediate increase in plasma glucose concentrations after anoxia (96. 4 %), which was sustained for 12 hr of re-oxygenation. Lactate concentrations significantly increased in captive and wild animals of both species after anoxia, reaching a peak at 2 hr of re-oxygenation. Both species showed significant, yet divergent, hematological changes in response to anoxia and re-oxygenation, which may not only prolong their survival and assist in recovery but also reflect their respective ecophysiological adaptations to the extreme environments that they inhabit.

50|$|The network {{wobbegong}} (Orectolobus reticulatus) is {{a recently}} described species of <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> found in relatively shallow waters off Kimberley and Darwin in north-western Australia. With a known maximum length of only 52.3 cm, {{it may be}} the smallest species of wobbegong. Until its description in 2008, it had been confused with the northern wobbegong.|$|R
50|$|The Parascylliidae, or {{collared}} <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks,</b> are {{a family}} of sharks only found in shallow waters of the western Pacific. They are relatively small sharks, with the largest species reaching no more than 91 cm (3.0 ft) in adult length. They have elongated, slender bodies, cat-like eyes, and barbels behind their chins. They feed on small fish and invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|The {{elongate}} <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> (Parascyllium elongatum) is {{a species}} of carpetshark in the family Parascylliidae. It is known from a single female specimen 42.1 cm long, recovered from the stomach of a school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) caught from a depth of 50 m off Chatham Island, Western Australia. It was described by P.R. Last and J.D. Stevens in 2008.|$|R
50|$|The grey bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium griseum, is {{a species}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Hemiscylliidae, found in the Indo-West Pacific Oceans from the Arabian Sea to Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Japan, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea, between latitudes 34° N and 10° S, and {{longitude}} 60° E and 150° E. Its length is up to 74 cm.|$|R
5000|$|Orectolobus is a genus of <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> in {{the family}} Orectolobidae. They are {{commonly}} known as wobbegongs, although this name also applies to {{the other members of the}} family. [...] They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean, chiefly around Australia and Indonesia, although one species (the Japanese wobbegong, O. japonicus) occurs as far north as Japan.|$|R
50|$|Orectolobus hutchinsi, {{the western}} wobbegong, is {{a species of}} <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Orectolobidae. Despite having been known for many years (often {{referred}} to as Orectolobus sp. A), it only received its scientific name in 2006. It is found at rocky reefs off Western Australia between Bremer Bay and Coral Bay at depths down to 106 m. It is a medium-large wobbegong with a skin pattern somewhat resembling that of a jaguar and a maximum length of 1.5 m.|$|R
50|$|The cobbler wobbegong, Sutorectus tentaculatus, is a <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Orectolobidae, {{the only member of}} the genus Sutorectus. It is found in the {{subtropical}} eastern Indian Ocean around Western Australia between latitudes 26° S and 35° S. It is frequently found in rocky and coral reef areas. Cobbler wobbegong reaches a length of 92 cm. It has unbranched dermal lobes on the head, rows of warty tubercles along the back and black spots on the body and fins.|$|R
50|$|Wobbegongs {{are well}} camouflaged with a {{symmetrical}} pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet. Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are {{often referred to}} as <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks.</b> The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes surrounding the wobbegong's jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs. Wobbegongs make use of their relative invisibility to hide among rocks and catch smaller fish which swim too close, typical of ambush predators.|$|R
50|$|Opened in April 2010, this {{facility}} has both an outdoor and indoor pool for the Hippos. The indoor hippo pool includes a large glass area where visitors {{can watch the}} hippos underwater. Past the hippo pool and in a shaded room is a 100000 L salt water tank, {{which is the largest}} single fish tank in Poland. The aquarium includes the only sand tiger shark in Poland, as well as other fishes, including Arabian <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks,</b> Zebrasoma species, yellow tang, and other reef species.|$|R
5000|$|Wobbegong is {{the common}} name given to the 12 species of <b>carpet</b> <b>sharks</b> in the family Orectolobidae. They are found in shallow {{temperate}} and tropical waters of the western Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean, chiefly around Australia and Indonesia, although one species (the Japanese wobbegong, Orectolobus japonicus) occurs {{as far north as}} Japan. The word wobbegong is believed to come from an Australian Aboriginal language, meaning [...] "shaggy beard", referring to the growths around the mouth of the shark of the western Pacific.|$|R
500|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} (Eucrossorhinus dasypogon) is {{a species of}} <b>carpet</b> <b>shark</b> in the family Orectolobidae and {{the only member of}} its genus. It inhabits shallow coral reefs off northern Australia, New Guinea, and adjacent islands. Reaching [...] in length, this species has a broad and flattened body and head. Its most distinctive trait is a fringe of branching dermal flaps around its head, which extends onto its chin. The fringe, along with its complex color pattern of small blotches and reticulations, enable it to camouflage itself against the reef environment.|$|R
