40|$|Gravity {{circulation}} loop for the cryopumps {{of the space}} simulator is introduced, and two phase mathematic model of flow heat transfer is analyzed as well. Based on this model, the liquid nitrogen (LN 2) gravity {{circulation loop}} including its equipment and layout is designed and has served as LN 2 feeding system for cryopumps in one large space simulator. With the help of control software and human machine interface, this system can be operated flexibly, simply, and automatically under four conditions. When running this system, {{the results show that}} the cryopumps can be cooled down and maintained under the <b>required</b> <b>temperature,</b> 120 <b>K...</b>|$|R

Significant {{features of the}} thermal environment are a large variation in heliocentric as well as comet distance, very large solar panels for a Solar Electric Propulsion stage, and the comet dust environment. The best cooling is achieved by one central radiative cooler connected by insulated cryogenic heat pipes to the instruments. The conceptual design is of a single-stage rectangular shielded radiator deployed on a boom {{some distance from the}} spacecraft bus and solar panels. Thermal modeling determined sensitivity to solar and comet distance and was used to optimize cooler geometry...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{molecules}} {{have been}} broadly classified into three generations {{dependent on the}} mode of formation and the <b>required</b> formation <b>temperature</b> (100 <b>K).</b> Around massive young stellar objects (MYSOs), icy grain mantles and gas are exposed to increasingly higher temperatures as material accretes from the outer envelope in toward the central hot region. The combination of this temperature profile and the generational chemistry should result in a changing complex molecular composition with radius around MYSOs. We combine IRAM 30 m and Submillimeter Array observations to explore the spatial distribution of organic molecules around the high-mass young stellar object NGC 7538 IRS 9, whose weak complex molecule emission previously escaped detection. We find that emission from N-bearing organics and CH 3 OH present substantial increases in emission around 8000 AU and R...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIsothermal detrapping {{of holes}} after {{electron}} irradiation (using a SEM) in high purity amorphous SiO 2 is evaluated at different temperatures (in the range 300 - 663 K) {{by means of}} the induced and secondary current measurements. In order to single out the hole detrapping, the specific charging conditions (1 keV defocused electron beam of low density) leading to positive charging are adopted. The thermal detrapping, which stems from a single trap, begins at 523 K and is completed at 663 K. After annealing in air at 973 K during 48 h, two detrapping stages are revealed: the former is connected with an additional shallow trap, while the latter <b>requires</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 663 <b>K</b> for a complete detrapping. The first order kinetics describes reasonably well the detrapping process. The frequency factors (near 10 (10) s(- 1)) and the activation energies (about 1. 6 eV) deduced from this analysis could be assigned, respectively, to the relaxation connected to detrapping and to the trap energy level of the charged oxygen vacancy.

40|$|Changes of the {{magnetic}} properties of ferromagnetic Co particles deposited on the √ 31 x √ 31 R± 9 ° reconstructed α-Al 2 O 3 (0001) {{as well as on}} a thin alumina film grown on a NiAl(110) substrate were investigated as a function of thermal annealing. On the thin film changes of {{the magnetic}} response were found above 500 K which correlates with changes in the particle size distribution. Annealing to 870 K leads to a permeation of the metal though the oxide film which causes significant changes in the ferromagnetic resonance response. On the -Al 2 O 3 single crystal sintering of particles <b>requires</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 600 <b>K</b> being about 100 K higher as compared to the thin alumina film. For large clusters intraparticle redistribution takes place already below 600 K a phenomenon not observed for the small clusters.

40|$|We have {{described}} a challenging neural-network hardware implementation that would mate a 64 x 64 -pixel infhred sensor directly on to a 3 -dimensionally packaged set of neural processing chips with parallel input for high speed image processing. We now describe two enhanced schemes. In one the synapse (analog multiply device) resolution has been increased from 7 - to 8 -bit without increasing the silicon area but <b>requiring</b> low <b>temperature</b> (77 <b>K)</b> operation. In other an innovative chip {{is incorporated in}} place of the mated infrared sensor array that permits detachtnent of the IR sensor without compromising the input speed. This permits room temperature operation of the processor for a projected image processing speed of a tera-operations per second (TOPS). We compare the 7 - and 8 -bit synapse architectures and provide the test results of the operation (linearity and speed) both at low and room temperatures. Non linearity effects and range compression issues are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Seven common fuels are {{compared}} for their utility as hydrogen sources for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells used in automotive propulsion. Methanol, natural gas, gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation jet fuel, ethanol, and hydrogen are the fuels considered. Except for the steam reforming of methanol and using pure hydrogen, all processes for generating hydrogen from these fuels <b>require</b> <b>temperatures</b> over 1000 <b>K</b> at some point. With {{the same two}} exceptions, all processes require water-gas shift reactors of significant size. All processes require low-sulfur or zero-sulfur fuels, and this may add cost to some of them. Fuels produced by steam reforming contain {approximately} 70 - 80 % hydrogen, those by partial oxidation {approximately} 35 - 45 %. The lower percentages may adversely affect cell performance. Theoretical input energies do not differ markedly among the various processes for generating hydrogen from organic-chemical fuels. Pure hydrogen has severe distribution and storage problems. As a result, the steam reforming of methanol is the leading candidate process for on-board generation of hydrogen for automotive propulsion. If methanol unavailability or a high price demands an alternative process, steam reforming appears preferable to partial oxidation for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Silicate dust grains in the {{interstellar}} medium {{are known to be}} mostly amorphous, yet crystalline silicate grains have been observed in many long-period comets and in protoplanetary disks. Annealing of amorphous silicate grains into crystalline grains <b>requires</b> <b>temperatures</b> > 1000 <b>K,</b> but exposure of dust grains in comets to such high temperatures is incompatible with the generally low temperatures experienced by comets. This has led to the proposal of models in which dust grains were thermally processed near the protoSun, then underwent considerable radial transport until they reached the gas giant planet region where the long-period comets originated. We hypothesize instead that silicate dust grains were annealed in situ, by shock waves triggered by gravitational instabilities. We assume a shock speed of 5 km/s, a plausible value for shocks driven by gravitational instabilities. We calculate the peak temperatures of micron and submicron amorphous pyroxene grains of chondritic composition under conditions typical in protoplanetary disks at 5 - 10 AU. Our results also apply to chondritic amorphous olivine grains. We show that in situ thermal annealing of submicron and micron-sized silicate dust grains can occur, obviating the need for large-scale radial transport.

5000|$|It {{is often}} invoked in {{theories}} of abiogenesis. [...] In the laboratory, {{it can be}} converted to amino acids. and short dipeptides may have facilitated the formation of complex sugars. For example, L-valyl-L-valine was used as a catalyst to form tetroses from glycolaldehyde. Theoretical calculations have additionally shown the feasibility of dipeptide-catalyzed synthesis of pentoses. This formation showed stereospecific, catalytic synthesis of D-ribose, the only naturally occurring enantiomer of ribose. Since the detection of this organic compound, many theories have been developed related various chemical routes to explain its formation in stellar systems.It was found that UV-irradiation of methanol ices containing CO yielded organic compounds such as glycolaldehyde and methyl formate, the more abundant isomer of glycolaldehyde. The abundances of the products slightly disagree with the observed values found in IRAS 16293-2422, but this can be accounted for by temperature changes. Ethylene Glycol and glycolaldehyde <b>require</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 30 <b>K.</b> The general consensus among the astrochemistry research community is in favor of the grain surface reaction hypothesis. However, some scientists believe the reaction occurs within denser and colder parts of the core. The dense core will not allow for irradiation as stated before. This change will completely alter the reaction forming glycolaldehyde.|$|R
