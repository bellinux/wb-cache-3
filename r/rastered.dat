His goal of creating the large <b>rastered</b> pictures was to create ‘electron paintings’ imitating the form animated television pictures. Gӧtz’s work and theoretical ideas influenced artist like Nam June Paik, a Korean American artist who is considered the founder of video art. It is said that these experiments have led to Gӧtz making the decision to only create abstract works.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is used {{to obtain}} [...] "topographs" [...] - topographic maps - of surfaces. The tip is <b>rastered</b> across a surface and (in constant current mode), a constant current is maintained between the tip and the sample by adjusting {{the height of the}} tip. A plot of the tip height at all measurement positions on the raster provides the topograph. These topographic images can obtain information that is atomically resolved, and images of metal and semiconductor surfaces can be obtained with atomic precision.|$|E

50|$|The campanile probe is {{attached}} to an optical fiber, which both provides a laser excitation of the studied sample and collects the measured signal. The probe is <b>rastered</b> over the sample with a standard scanning probe microscopy scanner, keeping {{the distance to the}} sample surface at a few nanometers. Contrary to the traditional (circular) near-field probes, the campanile probe has no cut-off frequency and is insensitive to the spatial mode of the optical near field. Hence its application is not limited to thin-film samples. Another advantage of the campanile probe is a high signal collection efficiency, which exceeds 90%.|$|E
50|$|Low-energy {{electrons}} {{are produced}} from a tungsten filament, a lanthanum hexaboride crystal cathode or a field emission electron source and accelerated by a positively biased anode plate to 3 to 30 thousand electron volts (keV). The anode plate has central aperture and electrons that pass through it are collimated and focused {{by a series}} of magnetic lenses and apertures. The resulting electron beam (approximately 5 nm to 10 μm diameter) may be <b>rastered</b> across the sample or used in spot mode to produce excitation of various effects in the sample. Among these effects are: phonon excitation (heat), cathodoluminescence (visible light fluorescence), continuum X-ray radiation (bremsstrahlung), characteristic X-ray radiation, secondary electrons (plasmon production), backscattered electron production, and Auger electron production.|$|E
50|$|Scanning SQUID {{microscopy}} is {{a technique}} where a {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) is used to image surface magnetic field strength with micrometre scale resolution. A tiny SQUID is mounted onto a tip which is then <b>rastered</b> near the surface of the sample to be measured. As the SQUID is the most sensitive detector of magnetic fields available and can be constructed at submicrometre widths via lithography, the scanning SQUID microscope allows magnetic fields to be measured with unparalleled resolution and sensitivity. The first scanning SQUID microscope was built in 1992 by Black et al. Since then the technique has been used to confirm unconventional superconductity in several high-temperature superconductors including YBCO and BSCCO compounds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{graphics}} and color <b>rastering</b> using new <b>raster</b> forms {{as well as}} <b>raster</b> combinations in vector anda pixel graphics, with combining both graphics in the same document. The unwanted increase or decrease of color coverage depends most of all on the fringe volume length bordering the <b>raster</b> element. The idea of this research work {{is to find a}} form alters in the least extent the <b>raster</b> element fringe volume in respect to its increase or decrease. The innovation in this research work is not only {{in the fact that the}} <b>raster</b> element's volume is altered in the minimal degree, but also that it does not change at all with the covering capacity increase or decrease. The solution led in the direction of creating such a <b>raster</b> element that has at least two independent shells where one increases in size together with the <b>raster</b> element increase, and the other one decreases when the <b>raster</b> element size increases. We have named this <b>raster</b> form as the ring form due to its similarity with a classical smooth ring...|$|R
30|$|Approaches using <b>raster</b> cells {{present some}} key challenges. Firstly, {{socio-economic}} data {{needs to be}} accurately disaggregated to these <b>raster</b> cells. Spiekermann and Wegner [23] presented one solution. As part of methodology for disaggregating zone systems, they generated probabilities of population and employment for each <b>raster</b> cell based on land-use data available {{at the size of}} the smallest <b>raster</b> cell. Monte-Carlo sampling with these probabilities was then used to allocate socio-economic data to these <b>raster</b> cells.|$|R
50|$|This {{treatment}} only {{assumes the}} light diffracted into the far-field that propagates without any restrictions. NSOM {{makes use of}} evanescent or non propagating fields that exist only near {{the surface of the}} object. These fields carry the high frequency spatial information about the object and have intensities that drop off exponentially with distance from the object. Because of this, the detector must be placed very close to the sample in the near field zone, typically a few nanometers. As a result, near field microscopy remains primarily a surface inspection technique. The detector is then <b>rastered</b> across the sample using a piezoelectric stage. The scanning can either be done at a constant height or with regulated height by using a feedback mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Only the {{primitives}} {{which are}} within the visual volume need to actually be <b>rastered</b> (drawn). This visual volume {{is defined as the}} inside of a frustum, a shape {{in the form of a}} pyramid with a cut off top. Primitives which are completely outside the visual volume are discarded; This is called frustum culling. Further culling methods such as backface culling, which reduce the number of primitives to be considered, can theoretically be executed in any step of the graphics pipeline. Primitives which are only partially inside the cube must be clipped against the cube. The advantage of the previous projection step is that the clipping always takes place against the same cube. Only the - possibly clipped - primitives, which {{are within the}} visual volume, are forwarded to the final step.|$|E
50|$|Staring arrays are {{distinct}} from scanning array and TDI (time-delay integration) imagers {{in that they}} image the desired field of view without scanning. Scanning arrays are constructed from linear arrays (or very narrow 2-D arrays) that are <b>rastered</b> across the desired field of view using a rotating or oscillating mirror to construct a 2-D image over time. A TDI imager operates in similar fashion to a scanning array except that it images perpendicularly to {{the motion of the}} camera. A staring array is analogous to the film in a typical camera; it directly captures a 2-D image projected by the lens at the image plane. A scanning array is analogous to piecing together a 2D image with photos taken through a narrow slit. A TDI imager is analogous to looking through a vertical slit out the side window of a moving car, and building a long, continuous image as the car passes the landscape.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new method and file format which allows to create, store and {{manipulate}} multiresolution <b>raster</b> images. “Classic ” <b>raster</b> images are built up by <b>rasters</b> (pixels) where in the same image each <b>raster</b> (pixel) has the same size. Multiresolution <b>raster</b> image (mri) are unlike the “classic ” <b>raster</b> images. An mri file is a regular text file, conformed xml 1. 0 standard and allows: 1) to store <b>raster</b> based images with different resolution in the same file {{and in the same}} time (i. e., allows to contain <b>rasters</b> with different size in the same image); 2) to export easily any part of the image as a separate <b>raster</b> image and to import an image {{as a part of a}} raster; 3) to define geographical reference for a <b>raster</b> image and use this image as a <b>raster</b> based GIS model; 4) to perform computations (i. e., image manipulation) on the content of the file. It is an important characteristic of the mri format that mathematical operations could be per-formed always in the same resolution as the current resolution of the given part of the image. To confirm this statement we present how to perform a convolution on an mri file...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{sampling}} procedures often begin by obtaining the dark current {{images of the}} sample. Dark current {{is referred to as}} the photocurrent generation created by the OPV in the absence of an illumination source. The cantilever and tip are simply <b>rastered</b> across the sample while topographic and current measurements are obtained. This data can then be used as a reference to determine the impact the illumination process exhibits on the OPV. Short circuit measurements are also commonly performed on the OPV devices. This consists of engaging the illumination source at open current (that is applied potential to the sample is zero). Nguyen and workers noted that a positive photocurrent reading correlated to the conduction of holes, while a negative reading correlated to the conduction of electrons. This alone allowed the authors to make predictions regarding the morphology within the cell. The current density for the forward and reverse bias can calculated as follows:Current density equation: ...|$|E
5000|$|The second {{key feature}} {{is that the}} bins are {{numbered}} serially, rather than being <b>rastered</b> as for an image. The total number of bits required for the bin numbers at level N is 2N + 3, where the three most significant bits are used for the face numbers and the remaining bits are used to number the bins within each face. The faces are numbered from 0 to 5: 0 for the north face, 1 through 4 for the equatorial faces (1 being on the meridian), and 5 for the south. Thus at a binning depth of 10, face 0 has bin numbers 0-1048575, face 1 has numbers 1048576-2097151, and so on. Within each face the bins are numbered serially from one corner (the convention is {{to start at the}} [...] "lower left") to the opposite corner, ordered {{in such a way that}} each pair of bits corresponds to a level of bin resolution. This ordering is in effect a two-dimensional binary tree, which is referred to as the quad-tree. The conversion between bin numbers and coordinates is straightforward: if four-byte integers are used for the bin numbers the maximum practical depth, which uses 31 of the 32 bits and results in a bin size of 0.0922 square arcminutes (7.80 nanosteradians).|$|E
