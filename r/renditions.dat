5|$|In many <b>renditions</b> of the myth, Manasa is {{depicted}} as being quite dependent on Neta (traditionally imagined as a washerwoman) for ideas and moral support. In fact, of the two, Manasa is often the stupider one - a curious instance of anthropomorphism.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{was also}} known as a writer of fiction and {{became one of the first}} American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is {{particularly}} respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive <b>renditions</b> of Poe's work throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The DK Rap {{is remembered}} for its {{negative}} reception. <b>Renditions</b> {{of the song}} later appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Donkey Konga. Over {{a decade after the}} game's release, its composer said that the rap was enjoying a resurgence in popularity despite its initial unpopularity. In 2017, he composed a similar rap for Yooka-Laylee, a platform game made in homage to Rare's oeuvre.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the {{development}} and operation of a now global system of <b>rendition</b> and secret detention. <b>Rendition</b> involves the kidnap of suspects and their illicit transfer to another state and frequently involves torture. It is generally assumed that <b>rendition</b> {{was very much a}} phenomenon of the Bush administration. In fact, it has continued since Obama took office, despite his early executive orders which ruled out some of the other nefarious practices of the Bush administration, such as torture. Situating <b>rendition</b> within the wider framework of US neo-imperial practices, particularly the quest for US hegemony within the global military-industrial complex, the paper provides a detailed account of the development and evolution of the global system of <b>rendition.</b> It analyses the ways in which key moments in US and international politics have impacted on <b>rendition</b> practices, and also shows how <b>rendition</b> constitutes the latest iteration of international state terrorism...|$|R
5|$|In February 2009, MOBA {{announced}} a fundraiser {{to assist the}} Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in Bernard Madoff's investment scheme. Current MOBA curator and balloon artist/musician Michael Frank placed Studies in Digestion—a four-panel piece showing four <b>renditions</b> of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on eBay for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99. It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose <b>renditions.</b> Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble <b>renditions</b> of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
50|$|In rare cases, usually {{involving}} the death penalty, states have refused or delayed <b>rendition.</b> In 1987, this was overturned by Puerto Rico v.

5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} <b>renditions</b> of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E
5|$|Released in six formats {{featuring}} a photograph by JFKK, A Ballads received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for {{including some of}} Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer <b>renditions</b> of the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching {{number one on the}} Oricon Albums Chart, making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements.|$|E
5000|$|In law, <b>rendition</b> is a [...] "surrender" [...] or [...] "handing over" [...] {{of persons}} or property, {{particularly}} from one jurisdiction to another. For criminal suspects, extradition {{is the most}} common type of <b>rendition.</b> <b>Rendition</b> can also be seen as the act of handing over, after the request for extradition has taken place.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a very {{delicate}} subject – the extraordinary <b>rendition.</b> The analysis starts from the <b>rendition</b> to justice as a technique by which a suspected person is forcibly abducted in another State, if {{it is impossible to}} bring this suspect to stand trial by the normal extradition procedure. In these cases, the forcible abduction can be executed unilaterally by the agents of the forum State or with the cooperation of agents of the State where the person is abducted. The <b>rendition</b> in itself is not a judicial procedure because it lacks a judicial warrant and, in reality, is mostly a highly covert police or military operation, with the risk of infringing upon the State sovereignty of other States (depending on the cooperation with that State). Recently, the <b>rendition</b> to justice practice was applied in a systematic way in dealing with the prosecution of piracy in the Somalia-Gulf of Aden area. Several defendants ended up in criminal trials in European States without any extradition procedure at all. The <b>rendition</b> to justice was widened into a <b>rendition</b> to secure policy and in this way the extraordinary <b>rendition</b> was born. Extraordinary <b>rendition</b> is also a special administrative measure, but one that fundamentally changes the meaning of <b>rendition,</b> as the aim is no longer to adjudicate a person, but to keep him/her in secret detention for interrogation. In this context, the paper observes also the way extraordinary <b>rendition</b> is reflected in The Inter-American Court of Human Rights jurisprudence and in European Court of Human Rights standards...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the {{development}} and operation of a now global system of <b>rendition</b> and secret detention in the ‘War on Terror’. The paper offers two corrections to current understandings of <b>rendition.</b> Firstly, while existing scholarship has emphasised the use of <b>rendition</b> as a counter-terrorism tool during the Reagan and Clinton administrations, {{there has been no}} analysis of the role played by <b>rendition</b> in the much longer history of the efforts at the heart of US foreign policy to insulate US hegemony. The paper will show that <b>rendition</b> is the most recent {{in a long line of}} tools that have been developed by US intelligence and defence officials to carve out extra-legal spaces to deal with perceived threats. Secondly, the paper seeks to show that the global <b>rendition</b> system is a system in flux. Various pressures beyond the US government’s control have forced the US Executive and intelligence and defence services to make major changes to the global <b>rendition</b> system in desperate attempts to maintain that extra-legal space that it believes it needs to thwart threats to its interests...|$|R
5|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} A Link Between Worlds excelled at {{making use of}} the console's 3D capabilities. However, the game's art {{direction}} was divisive among critics, with some writers expressing dislike for the graphics, and others calling the visuals gorgeous. The game's music composition was complimented; Ryckert called the game's soundtrack {{one of the best}} in gaming, and Veloria thought it was some of the best in the series, praising both the new compositions and the adapted <b>renditions</b> music from A Link to the Past.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra.

5000|$|<b>Rendition</b> built a {{thorough}} list of supported games by encouraging developers {{large and small}} {{to make use of}} their free APIs. <b>Rendition</b> originally provided developers with Speedy3D, a DOS-based API, as most game development in 1995-96 was still centered on DOS. Later, <b>Rendition</b> released their Win32 version of the API, branded RRedline. Like 3Dfx, <b>Rendition</b> {{was one of the first}} 3D chipset makers to see the value of homebrew programming by releasing a free programming API to the public.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This project asks how extraordinary <b>rendition</b> and secret detention of terror suspects has developed {{and whether they}} are US-led phenomena. Sources will include as yet unanalysed databases of detention facilities and detainees and the case histories of victims of <b>rendition.</b> This will enable the research team {{to provide a more}} robust theoretical basis for this illicit yet widespread phenomenon. The team will explore three key questions: Is the global system of <b>rendition</b> and secret detention US-led, or is it a more diffuse system with distinct and partly autonomous regional sub-systems that serve specific local as well as US interests? Are there any regional differences in the ways in which <b>rendition</b> and secret detention have developed and are operated? Can we identify any specific evolutionary moments or shifts in the development and operation of <b>rendition</b> and secret detention? Research findings may challenge public assumptions about <b>rendition</b> and secret detention as a US response to terrorism. The development of a theoretical model to explain <b>rendition</b> will contribute to scholarly debate on security collaborations and state violence. Project outputs will be of practical use to those agencies involved in the legal representation of victims of <b>rendition</b> and secret detention...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the notion}} of {{extradition}} of fugitive from justice is turned intoextraordinary <b>rendition</b> which is {{carried out by the}} United States (US) government to curbterrorists from the whole world. Extraordinary <b>rendition</b> faced strong critique by human rightsadvocates, the United Nations (UN) and governments of many states.

5|$|Though the Maya Sita motif {{was found}} {{earlier in the}} Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) where Sita's purity is safeguarded, it is the Adhyatma Ramayana (a part of the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century), where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot. The concept of maya (illusion) is an {{integral}} part of the narrative; the best examples being Maya Sita and Maya mriga (illusory deer). Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India, it influenced Malayam (South India) and Oriya (East India) <b>renditions</b> of the Ramayana, but most importantly influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (c.1532–1623).|$|E
