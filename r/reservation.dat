5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the Takelma Indians inhabited the Illinois Valley. Their culture was destroyed when gold {{was discovered in}} the early 1850s, causing the subsequent Rogue River Wars. After an 1853 treaty, most of the Takelmas lived on the Table Rock <b>Reservation.</b> In 1856, after the wars ended, they were moved to the Grand Ronde <b>Reservation</b> and the Siletz <b>Reservation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of the Rogue River Indians {{were removed}} in 1856 to {{reservations}} further north. About 1,400 {{were sent to}} the Coast <b>Reservation,</b> later renamed the Siletz <b>Reservation.</b> To protect 400natives still in danger of attack at Table Rock, Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, ordered their removal, involving a forced march of 33days, to the newly established Grande Ronde <b>Reservation</b> in Yamhill County, Oregon.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} court {{enforcement}} uncertainty hinders economic development using sharp variation in judiciaries across Native American <b>reservations</b> in the United States. Congressional legislation passed in 1953 assigned state courts {{the authority to}} resolve civil disputes on a subset of <b>reservations,</b> while tribal courts retained authority on unaffected <b>reservations.</b> Although affected and unaffected <b>reservations</b> had similar economic conditions when the law passed, <b>reservations</b> under state courts experienced significantly greater long-run growth. When we examine the distribution of incomes across <b>reservations,</b> the average difference in development {{is due to the}} lower incomes of the most impoverished <b>reservations</b> with tribal courts. We show that the relative under-development of <b>reservations</b> with tribal courts is driven by <b>reservations</b> with the most uncertainty in court enforcement...|$|R
50|$|As of May 2015, sixty-two {{states parties}} have entered <b>reservations</b> against {{some part of}} the Convention. Twenty-four states parties have entered {{objections}} to {{at least one of these}} <b>reservations.</b> The most reserved article is Article 29, concerning dispute resolution and interpretation of the Convention, with thirty-nine <b>reservations.</b> Because <b>reservations</b> to Article 29 are expressly allowed by the Convention itself, these <b>reservations</b> were not very controversial. Article 16, concerning the equality of women in marriage and family life is subject to twenty-three <b>reservations.</b> The Committee, in General Recommendation No. 28, specifically stated that <b>reservations</b> to Article 2, concerning general non-discrimination, are impermissible. However, Article 2 has seventeen <b>reservations.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although most of NY37 in {{the town}} of Bombay is {{contained}} within the <b>reservation,</b> a short portion east of Hogansburg and the St. Regis River and west of Tarbell Road is located outside the <b>reservation</b> limits. Within this stretch, NY37 meets both the eastern end of NY37C and the northern terminus of NY95. East of the <b>reservation,</b> NY37 roughly parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Montreal Subdivision northeast to Fort Covington, where NY37 crosses the railroad line and intersects Water Street (unsigned NY970T), a connector to Quebec Route132 on the northern side of the Canadian border.|$|E
5|$|As {{commerce}} and industry flourished {{on the lower}} river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops {{on most of the}} available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and Rogue valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the Oregon state government to remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the Coast Indian <b>Reservation.</b> In 1855, Joel Palmer, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast <b>Reservation</b> that later became the Grande Ronde <b>Reservation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{geographic}} isolation of their homeland, the Hupa had few interactions with early European explorers, although they later came {{in conflict with}} miners looking for gold. Even after California became a US state in 1850, the Hupa continued to live on their traditional lands and were eventually granted a <b>reservation</b> here in 1876. They are the only Native American group in California to retain most of their original territory; today, the Hoopa Valley <b>Reservation</b> is {{the largest and most}} populous in the state.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of <b>reservations</b> in capacity-constrained {{services}} {{with a focus on}} restaurants. Although cus-tomer value <b>reservations,</b> restaurants typically neither charge for them or impose penalties for failing to honor them. However, <b>reservations</b> impose costs on firms offering them. We highlight ways in which <b>reservations</b> can increase a firm’s sales by altering customer behavior. First, when demand is uncertain, <b>reservations</b> induce more customers to patronize the restaurant on slow nights. The firm must then trade off higher sales in a soft market with sales lost to no shows on busy nights. Competition makes <b>reservations</b> more attractive as long as enough customers will consider dining at either restaurant. When there are many firms in the market, it is rarely an equilibrium for none to offer <b>reservations.</b> Second, we show that <b>reservations</b> can increase sales by shifting demand from a popular peak period to a less desirable off-peak time. This is accomplished by informing din-ers that the peak is full. In this setting, competition may make offering <b>reservations</b> less attractive and a market with many firms may have no one offering <b>reservations.</b> Key words: Service management; reservations; restaurants; capacity management. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because the state had not {{lived up to its}} obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new <b>reservation,</b> and buying land for the new <b>reservation</b> from within the old <b>reservation).</b> The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E
5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko <b>Reservation,</b> Wichita, Indian Territory. This fighting is considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the <b>reservation</b> were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the United States Justice Department allowed {{recognized}} Indian Reservations {{to regulate}} cannabis laws within their <b>reservation.</b> The {{laws in the}} reservations are allowed {{to be different from}} state and federal laws.

5|$|Russell Bryan was an {{enrolled}} {{member of}} the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, which is a component band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. He married Helen Charwood in 1957. Helen was an enrolled {{member of the}} Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, which was {{also a part of}} the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. They raised their children on <b>reservation</b> land and lived in a mobile home which they purchased in 1971. The mobile home was located on the Greater Leech Lake Indian <b>Reservation</b> near Squaw Lake in Itasca County, Minnesota. Bryan's mobile home, had it not been on the <b>reservation,</b> would have been subject to taxes from Itasca County. In June 1972, Itasca County notified Bryan that the mobile home was subject to US$147.95 in taxes.
