40|$|Verification of {{compliance}} to formal agreements requires {{the performance of}} inspections for detection of illegal behavior. If the inspections are carried out {{in such a way}} that the gain the inspectee may except from illegal behavior is smaller than the behaving legally, then the inspections may be said to have deterred him from violation. Achieving deterrence is assumed to be the primary objective of the verification regime. In this paper inspection problems characterized additionally by a 'critical time' are considered systematically for the first time. The critical time is the maximum time interval within which illegal activity must be detected in order to meet the objectives of the agreement. Such critically time-dependent inspection problems are modeled here as two-person non-cooperative games between inspector and inspectee. They extend over a <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> in which the inspector performs k inspections and in which the inspectee behaves illegally at most once. The inspections may or may not lead to statistical errors of the first and second kind and the inspectee may or may not be in a position to take advantage of information gained during the <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> Equilibria are investigated and conditions for the existence of deterring inspection strategies are determined.

The proxy was developed from a modern dataset for the <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> 1997 – 2007, which showed a logarithmic relationship between discharge and measured water oxygen isotope ratios (d 18 Ow). To test this relationship for past time intervals, d 18 Oar values were measured in the aragonite of the growth increments of four Unio sp. shells; two from a relatively wet period and two from a very dry time interval (1910 – 1918 and 1969 – 1977, respectively). Shell d 18 Oar records were converted into d 18 Ow values using existing water temperature records. Summer d 18 Ow values, reconstructed from d 18 Oar of 1910 – 1918, showed a similar range as the summer d 18 Ow values for the <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> 1997 – 2007, whilst summer reconstructed d 18 Ow values for the time interval 1969 – 1977 were anomalously high. These high d 18 Ow values suggest that the river Meuse experi-enced severe summer droughts during the latter time interval. d 18 Ow values were then applied to calculate dis-charge values. It was attempted to estimate discharge from the reconstructed d 18 Ow values using the logarithmic relationship between d 18 Ow and discharge. A comparison of the calculated summer discharge results with observed discharge data showed that Meuse low-discharge events below a threshold value of 6 m 3 /s can be detected in the reconstructed d 18 Ow records, but true quantification remains problematic...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} unannounced interim {{inspections}} are analyzed in general, and specifically {{in view of}} the recently defined IAEA/EURATOM Partnership Approach. In particular the following aspects are addressed: A general discussion of the problem of unannounced interim inspections which includes an identification and description of all the types of assumptions which are necessary to be made for a quantitative treatment, an outline of the general methods identified and proposed for the solution of problems of that kind, the identification of two examples for a detailed analysis to be carried out with the general method identified in the previous steps, and lessons learned and reflections aiming at identifying also practical recommendations on the matter of unannounced interim inspections. As a major result, for a specific facility and a given number of inspections per reference time, e. g., one year, optimal inspection strategies are determined. Whereas for the case that inspection are perfect the results can be guessed, this does not hold anymore for imperfect inspections, e. g., limited sample sizes of seals to be checked.

40|$|Objective(s) : Diagnostic nuclear {{medicine}} is being increasingly employed in clinical {{practice with the}} advent of new technologies and radiopharmaceuticals. The report of the prevalence of a certain disease is important for assessing the quality of that article. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the quality of published {{nuclear medicine}} articles and determine the frequency of reporting the prevalence of studied diseases. Methods: We used Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS- 2) checklists for evaluating the quality of articles published in five nuclear medicine journals with the highest impact factors in 2012. The articles were retrieved from Scopus database and were selected and assessed independently by two nuclear medicine physicians. Decision concerning equivocal data was made by consensus between the reviewers. Results: The average STARD score was approximately 17 points, and the highest score was 17. 19 ± 2. 38 obtained by the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine. QUADAS- 2 tool showed that all journals had low bias regarding study population. The Journal of Nuclear Medicine had the highest score in terms of index test, <b>reference</b> standard, and <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> Lack of clarity regarding the index test, <b>reference</b> standard, and <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> was frequently observed in all journals including Clinical Nuclear Medicine, in which 64 % of the studies were unclear regarding the index test. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology had the highest number of articles with appropriate reference standard (83. 3 %), though it had the lowest frequency of reporting disease prevalence (zero reports). All five journals had the same STARD score, while index test, <b>reference</b> standard, and <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> were very unclear according to QUADAS- 2 tool. Unfortunately, data were too limited to determine which journal had the lowest risk of bias. In fact, it is the author’s responsibility to provide details of research methodology so that the reader can assess the quality of research articles. Conclusion: Five nuclear medicine journals with the highest impact factor were comparable in terms of STARD score, although they all showed lack of clarity regarding index test, <b>reference</b> standard, and <b>time</b> <b>interval,</b> according to QUADAS- 2. The current data were too limited to determine the journal with the lowest bias.

This is particularly troublesome {{in the case of}} persistently active volcanoes like Stromboli (Southern Italy), where intense eruptive summit activity (overflows, strong spattering, powerful explosions) has in some cases anticipated a flank eruption. In this context, a new approach for the analysis of displacement data is introduced. Daily displacements of the Stromboli crater terrace measured between January 1, 2010, and August 7, 2014, by a ground-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar system were compared, in retrospect, to displacement predictions provided by an autoregressive integrated moving average-based model. The methodology consisted in assessing when the actual displacements exceeded a fixed probability threshold for the forecasts (* 95 %). Two sets of data were consequently produced: (1) series of residuals between actual displacements and model threshold (‘‘anomalies’’) and (2) series of normalized residuals between actual displacements and model threshold (‘‘normalized anomalies’’). This permitted to statistically identify and quantify the anomalous deformation at the crater terrace over the <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> of the analysis. Anomalies started to occur before each period of intense volcanic activity, highlighting the possibility to discern between background activity and unrest. Moreover, results indicated that the inflation of the crater terrace during the preparatory phase of the 2014 flank eruption was characterized by the greatest amount of anomalous deformation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} general {{framework}} for probabilistic landslide hazard analysis. With respect to other quantitative hazard assessment approaches, this probabilistic landslide hazard analysis {{has the advantage}} to provide hazard curves and maps, and to be applicable to all typologies of landslides, if necessary accounting for both their onset and transit probability. The method quantifies, for a given slope location, the exceedance probability of being affected by a landslide with a specific local intensity within a <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval,</b> i. e. the hazard curve, under the common assumption that landslides behave as a Poisson process. Hazard maps are calculated, reducing the hazard curve to single values by choosing a fixed probability of exceedance following standards or regulation requirements. The method {{is based on the}} assessment of a landslide onset frequency, a runout frequency for long-runout landslides, and the local definition of landslide intensity, which can be expressed through different parameters, according to landslide typology. For long runout landslides, the runout and spatially-varying intensity and uncertainty are considered. Hazard curves and maps play a fundamental role in the design and dimensioning of mitigation structures, in land planning and in the definition of risk and hazard management policies. Starting from the general framework, we apply the methodology for rockfall hazard analysis, and we test it in an area affected by the Christchurch 2011 earthquake, New Zealand, which triggered a large number of rockfalls, killing five people...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the intervalling effect bias within an environment and during a sample period that embraces the evolution of a deep economic crisis and show in particular that its intensity is profoundly magnified. Design/methodology/approach - The Athens Stock Exchange is studied via the market model during the sample period 2007 - 2012 that embraces the Greek debt restructuring. Two portfolios are formed to distinguish between large and small market capitalizations, three reference intervals are considered for measurement of returns (daily, weekly, monthly) and the respective betas are calculated via OLS simple regression. The results are compared to similar studies. The results are further confirmed by using a second proxy for the market portfolio. Findings - The intensity of the intervalling effect bias was very pronounced during this sample period with regard to all aspects of the phenomenon that similar studies have reported and to which the results of this paper are compared. Originality/value - This is the first time that the intervalling effect is examined in conjunction to a deep economic crisis environment. The intensity of the intervalling effect reflects the depth of the inefficiencies of a market for some period. As a consequence, some function measuring this intensity may be devised to serve as a measure of market inefficiencies...|$|E

40|$|The single-storm erosion index, EI, of the USLE and RUSLE models {{may vary}} appreciably with the {{rainfall}} measurement interval, Dt. However, {{the effect of}} Dt on EI has not been investigated in the Mediterranean area. Approximately 700 erosive events and 1. 5 years of rainfall energies measured by a rainfall impact measurement device were {{used to evaluate the}} effect of the rainfall measurement interval (5 min 6 Dt 6 60 min) on the erosivity determinations in the Mediterranean semi-arid area of Sicily. According to both literature and practical considerations, a <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> equal to 15 min was used in this investigation. Hourly rainfall data led to an appreciable underestimation of the mean value of EI (i. e., by also a factor of two, depending on the location). In the range 5 min 6 Dt 6 15 min, the effect of the rainfall measurement interval on the predicted erosivity was negligible (i. e., mean values differing by a maximum factor of 1. 10) as compared with the uncertainties in the soil loss predictions. Two methods were developed for estimating the reference single-storm erosion index, (EI) 15, from hourly rainfall data in Sicily. Method 1 converts the erosion index calculated on a 60 - min measurement interval basis to (EI) 15. Method 2 estimates (EI) 15 by using the storm rainfall depth and the maximum rainfall intensity. Testing the two methods against two independent data sets produced a maximum difference between the estimated and the calculated mean values of (EI) 15 equal to 7 % for method 1 and 11 % for method 2. Both methods may be applied in practice, depending on the available rainfall data.

30|$|First, in {{the case}} of both {{simulation}} and optimisation approaches, multi-level methods for handling the different granularity of factors involved (such as speed control and the timetabling process) need to be further validated. Moreover, data-driven procedures for estimating passenger flows are increasingly taking hold, for instance, by means of e-ticketing and automatic collection fares. However, {{in the case}} of rail systems, it is fundamental to take into account some specific issues due to the intrinsic features of the context addressed. First of all, the flows of concern are related to the number of passengers, rather than the number of vehicles. This gives rise to the first issue to be faced, concerning the kind of passenger flows to be considered, such as flows at turnstiles, boarding or alighting flows, waiting flows and on-board flows. This results in a spatial problem related to ‘where’ to detect passengers. Should counting at turnstiles be selected, the measurement would be affected by an uncertainty concerning trip direction. Alternatively, data could be acquired from a single gate, but, in such circumstances, it might not be possible to know how many passengers are unable to board the train due to overcrowding. Conversely, such information could be obtained by carrying out counts on platforms. In addition to this, a temporal problem should be taken into account which lies in the difficulty of identifying a proper <b>reference</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval,</b> given the fact that rail services are scheduled services. It is this very discontinuity which makes counting at the turnstiles susceptible to a certain degree of uncertainty due to the gap between the time of registering the users’ passage and the moment they reach the platform. Therefore, it appears clear {{that it is necessary to}} design the data acquisition phase appropriately according to the target. As already stated, unlike the sample surveys which are complex and expensive, counts are cheaper to carry out and can be obtained automatically. The use of automatic devices makes the detection task easier and more efficient; however, it is not immune to incidents. First of all, it might happen that, because of a device failure, there could be effects on the entire measurement. A typical situation in which this could happen is if the target is to reconstruct the distribution of the passengers on the platform by carrying out counts at each gate. Indeed, in this case, if a detector at a single gate was damaged, this would also make the counts at the other gates useless, invalidating the measurement for the whole platform. Other issues to be taken into account are the presence of exchange points between two lines and, in some contexts, also the possibility of fare evasion. However, to the best of our knowledge, in the literature, there are no contributions which fully meet such requirements.|$|E

40|$|Hungarian has {{a number}} of {{apparently}} synonymous time adverbs that can measure the duration of <b>time</b> <b>intervals.</b> The paper explores these adverbs in some detail, and argues that contrary to appearances, none ofthem are freely interchangeable. The starting point is a discussion of the property of homogeneity that time adverbs are sensitive to. The paper argues for a specific treatment of homogeneity and a preliminary adverb definition based on that treatment. It is proposed that some, but not all, Hungarian time adverbs share the default definition. The diverging adverbs may (a) contain a covert frequency predicate or (b) not measure the duration of the <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> directly, but by determining an endpoint of the <b>interval.</b> Hungarian <b>time</b> adverbs also differ in the range of <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> they can measure; some, but not all adverbs can measure all available <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> including the event, iterative, habitual and <b>reference</b> <b>time.</b> This variability in time adverb modification is arbitrary and needs to be explicitly determined for each adverb.

On the other, it is necessary to permit explicit, arbitrary constraints on adverbial modification. It is also argued that time adverbs can impose non-local restrictions on the eventuality modified, strengthening the need for a powerful theory of adverbial modification...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{obtain the}} open or closed <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> {{distributions}} ofpatch clamp signals, several workers {{have used a}} half-amplitude minimum <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> criterion. Within this framework, no transition between states of different conductance levels is considered {{to have taken place}} if it leads to a <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> smaller than a certain critical value. This procedure modifies substantially the open or closed <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> distribution oftherandom signal to be analyzed, since <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> well above the time resolution ofthe recording systemmay be interrupted by short gaps thatmay or may not satisfy the minimum <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> criterion. We present here a general theoretical framework by means of which the effect of <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> omission on <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> distributions can be taken into account. Based on the mathematical formalism provided by the Kolmogorov forward equation, special matrix operators are first defined. The general solution to the time omission problem in its integral form is then derived. In view of the poor computational feasibility ofthe resulting solution, a first-order approximation is also presented. This approximation consists essentially in neglecting the contribution of the undetected gaps to the total length of the resulting <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> The exact and approximate solutions are then applied totwo special kinetic schemescommonly found in single-channel studies, namely theO-C and C-O-C models. The applicability of the proposed formalism to the <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> distribution problem ofa damped random signal is finally discussed...|$|R
