40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis {{observational}} study aimed to identify clinical variables and health system characteristics associated with incomplete guideline application in drug treatment {{of patients with}} chronic heart failure (HF) across 15 countries. MethodsThree data sets were used: European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure <b>Registry,</b> <b>Organisation</b> for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Health System Characteristics Survey, and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Health Statistics 2013. Patient and country variables were examined by multilevel, multiple logistic regression. The study population consisted of ambulatory patients with chronic HF and reduced ejection fraction. Inappropriateness of prescription of pharmacological treatments was defined as patients not prescribed {{at least one of}} the two recommended treatments (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers and beta-blockers) or treated with both medications but at suboptimal dosage and in absence of documented contraindication/intolerance. ResultsOf 4605 patients, 1097 (23. 8 %) received inappropriate drug prescriptions with a large variation within and across countries, with 18. 5 % of the total variability accounted for by between-country health structure characteristics. Patient-level characteristics such as having mitral regurgitation (odds ratio 1. 4; 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 – 1. 7) was significantly associated with inappropriate prescription of recommended drugs, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio 0. 7; 95 % confidence interval 0. 5 – 0. 9) was associated with more appropriate prescriptions. Among the country-level variables, incentives or obligation to comply with guidelines increased the probability of prescription appropriateness. ConclusionsCombining clinical variables with health system characteristics is a promising exercise to explain the appropriateness of recommended drug prescriptions. Such an understanding can help decision makers to design more effective policies to improve adherence to guidelines, improve health care outcomes, and potentially reduce costs...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{electronic}} revolution, the tendency of full implementation {{of electronic}} communication {{in the field of}} shipping and transport sector (logistic sector), is a fact that not surprise us at all. Process of replacing hard copy communication with electronic shipping communication has undergone a great expansion. The use of EDI systems in all industrial branches, including transport and shipping industry, create great innovations, and are treated as a major benefit for the international mass and fast transfer of goods. Digitalization in the field of trade, transport and logistic operator’s contributes to reducing paper costs, reducing timeline for transport route, and simplification of analysis and storage of transport and trade documents. Despite these efficiencies and convenience, until recently, electronic documentation in the field of transport was not covered by an international convention. Today, this subject has been covered by many international regulations, but business practice still shows doubt regarding the reliability of electronic transfer of property of the goods. This is especially case {{when it comes to the}} negotiable bill of lading as a document of title in the sea transport. Based on the concept of transfer bill of lading, three systems are created and: SeaDocs Registry Limited (SeaDocs), Bolero - Bill of Lading Electronic <b>Registry</b> <b>Organisation,</b> Global trade system TM. The purpose of this article is to analyze and elaborate each of these systems individually, and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Throught study of these systems, the author’s goal is to prove the justification of bill of lading as electronic transport document in which property rights on the goods are incorporate. More accurately, is there a place for full implementation of electronic bill of lading in the area of maritime transport (hereafter E/B/L). What is the degree of the risk from using E/B/L whit respect to ownership of the goods?! Finally, which of the existing systems of electronic transport can be trusted the most?!...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} {{situation}} and potential success in legal practice of one major invention in the maritime industry, namely, the electronic bill of lading by taking into consideration developments of the relevant regulatory frameworks through time by some few important institutions involved including CMI (Comité Maritime International), Bolero (Bills of Lading Electronic <b>Registry</b> <b>Organisation)</b> and UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law). The thesis focuses on analysing effectiveness of the legal attempts of these actors in supporting the electronic bill to be accepted as fully legally enforceable as in the paper-based case. In doing so, {{emphasis is placed on}} the question of how fundamental legal requirements of the traditional bill can also be met by this paperless replacement. The thesis argues that the trendy bill concerned shall be regarded as the electronic equivalent of the paper bill since, based on some of the recent guidelines and provisions offered, it certainly satisfies such traditional requirements. That is, the electronic bill of lading is, too, a legal document that can be signed and capable of performing all basic traditional functions which include being a receipt for the goods, being evidence of terms in a contract of carriage and, more sophisticatedly, being a negotiable document of title. The thesis points out that the CMI model fails to stay attractive for long as it is associated with a number of problems, while the Bolero system that follows, though imperfect, appears to be a better alternative for the contracting parties wishing to use the bill of lading in electronic form. UNCITRAL not only provides essential legal guidelines like Model Laws on Electronic Commerce and on Electronic Signatures, but also is developing Draft Convention on the Carriage of Goods [Wholly or Partly] [By Sea] purporting in part to build a thorough framework governing and help promoting the use of the electronic bill of lading. This great prospect expected by many to be a dream legal solution for the electronic bill has, however, some room for improvement as suggested in the thesis...|$|E

40|$|Funnel plots are {{graphical}} {{tools to}} assess and compare clinical performance {{of a group of}} care professionals or care institutions on a quality indicator against a benchmark. Incorrect construction of funnel plots may lead to erroneous assessment and incorrect decisions potentially with severe consequences. We provide workflow-based guidance for data analysts on constructing funnel plots for the evaluation of binary quality indicators, expressed as proportions, risk-adjusted rates or standardised rates. Our guidelines assume the following steps: (1) defining policy level input; (2) checking the quality of models used for case-mix correction; (3) examining whether the number of observations per hospital is sufficient; (4) testing for overdispersion of the values of the quality indicator; (5) testing whether the values of quality indicators are associated with institutional characteristics; and (6) specifying how the funnel plot should be constructed. We illustrate our guidelines using data from the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation registry.

50|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, {{instead of a}} central, {{official}} tartan <b>registry,</b> several independent <b>organisations</b> located in Scotland, Canada, and the United States documented and recorded tartans. In the 1960s, a Scottish society called the Scottish Tartans Society (now defunct) was created to record and preserve all known tartan designs. The society's register, the Register of All Publicly Known Tartans (RAPKT), contains about 2,700 different designs of tartan. The society, however, ran into financial troubles in about the year 2000, and folded. Former {{members of the society}} then formed two new Scottish-based organisations—the Scottish Tartans Authority (STA) and the Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR). Both of these societies initially based their databases on the RAPKT. The STA's database, the International Tartan Index (ITI) consists of about 3,500 different tartans (with over 7,000, counting variants), as of 2004. The STWR's self-titled Scottish Tartans World Register database is made up of about 3,000 different designs as of 2004. Both organisations are registered Scottish charities and record new tartans (free in the case of STS and for a fee in the case of STWR) on request. The STA's ITI is larger, in part, because it has absorbed the entries recorded in the TartanArt database formerly maintained by the merged International Association of Tartan Studies and Tartan Educational and Cultural Association (IATS/TECA), based in the United States, and with whom the STA is directly affiliated.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: While {{national}} quality registries (NQRs) {{are suggested}} to {{provide opportunities for}} systematic follow-up and learning opportunities, and thus clinical improvements, features in registries and contexts triggering such processes are not fully known. This study focuses {{on one of the}} world's largest stroke registries, the Swedish NQR Riksstroke, investigating what aspects of the <b>registry</b> and healthcare <b>organisations</b> facilitate or hinder the use of registry data in clinical quality improvement. Methods: Following particular qualitative studies, we performed a quantitative survey in an exploratory sequential design. The survey, including 50 items on context, processes and the registry, was sent to managers, physicians and nurses engaged in Riksstroke in all 72 Swedish stroke units. Altogether, 242 individuals were presented with the survey; 163 responded, representing all but two units. Data were analysed descriptively and through multiple linear regression. Results: A majority (88 %) considered Riksstroke data to facilitate detection of stroke care improvement needs and acknowledged that their data motivated quality improvements (78 %). The use of Riksstroke for quality improvement initiatives was associated (R- 2 = 0. 76) with 'Colleagues' call for local results' (p=< 0. 001), 'Management Request of Registry data' (p=< 0. 001), and it was said to be 'Simple to explain the results to colleagues' (p= 0. 02). Using stepwise regression, 'Colleagues' call for local results' was identified as the most influential factor. Yet, while 73 % reported that managers request registry data, only 39 % reported that their colleagues call for the unit's Riksstroke results. Conclusions: While an NQR like Riksstroke demonstrates improvement needs and motivates stakeholders to make progress, local stroke care staff and managers need to engage to keep the momentum going in terms of applying registry data when planning, performing and evaluating quality initiatives...|$|R

And in turn this will enable land <b>registry</b> and cadastral <b>organisations</b> to use the components of the standard to develop, implement and maintain systems in an even more efficient way. The research objective is to design a Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) for Land Administration System (LAS) development. Such a LADM has to be broadly accepted and it should be adaptable to local situations (Lemmen, 2012). It has to be usable to organise Land Administration data within a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). The design is based on the common pattern of 'people – land' relationships. The model should be as simple as possible, it should cover the basic data related components of Land Administration (legal/administrative, mapping and surveying) and it should satisfy user requirements. The Domain Model in its imple¬mentation is can be distributed over different organisations with different tasks and responsibilities. The research does not focus on the legal, political, economic, institutional or financial aspects of Land Administration and Land Administration organisations; {{at least as far as}} those are not related to user requirements for the model. Taxation, valuation and land use are knowledge fields in itself and are not within the focus of research.

40|$|Majority of RandD {{outcomes}} {{consists of}} data, information and documents {{integrated into a}} category of Grey Literature. From portfolio of these outcomes especially publications, patents, products and innovations are interesting for scientific community and wide range of R and D stakeholders indoors and abroad. Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) are one of key software tools for data collection and access, dissemination of information about scientific activities and their outcomes. The EU standards for these systems, primarily the CERIF data format, are covered by the international association euroCRIS. The aim of providing the Information System about Science, Research and Innovation SK CRIS is to integrate all available research information at the national level. The system was designed on a data structure compatible with the CERIF data format {{and it became a}} member of the CRIS systems family. The SK CRIS contains data about research projects funded by public resources, a registry of researchers, a <b>registry</b> of research <b>organisations</b> and research and development results. Data acquisition and refilling is possible by using integration interface importing data from external systems. It concerns mainly project data imported from systems of grant agencies. Direct data entry made by research subjects by online forms is the second way how to receive data. The SK CRIS integrates also other available external data sources: registries of researchers from universities and Slovak Academy of Sciences and also publications from universities registered in the Central Registry of Publication Activity. The SK CRIS makes contextual data about science and research accessible during their life cycle. It means that a user can see whether some document was created as a result of the project. The information about its authors and originators, persons and organisations is also available, as well as usage of a document and its citations. The SK CRIS is not limited to work only with metadata. It contains also the functionality allowing the integration of collected data with fulltext documents. The benefit of the SK CRIS is mostly its ability to offer aggregated information from entered data and to present their relationship. Main characteristic of the SK CRIS is the CERIF based concept of objects (entities) with attributes, with a data model guaranteeing interoperability and full language variability. The relations and semantics allow to record the objects with relationship and characterise properties and time attributes by roles and time details. However, the system will be used mainly by scientific community but also by research management, decision makers and public. Enlargement of the SK CRIS functionality and integration of the other external data sources is our vision for near future. In the same time we consider the interconnection with other European CRIS systems. The SK CRIS information system was developed within the Activity No 4 of the NISPEZ national project implemented by the Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information: Enlargement of Central Information Portal for Research, Development and Innovation (CIP RDI) with new functionalities complying with EU standards.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study is to show the {{evolution}} of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Spain from 2007 to 2013. Aggregated data and individual patient records were used from participating regional renal disease registries and that National Transplant <b>Organisation</b> <b>registry.</b> The reference population was the official population on January 1 st of each year studied. Data on incidence and prevalence were based on aggregated data, while the survival analysis was calculated from individual patient records. The study period was 2007 – 2013 for prevalence, incidence and transplantation, and survival was analysed for 2004 – 2012. The population covered by the registry was a minimum of 95. 3 – 100 % of the Spanish population for aggregated data. The EU 27 age and gender distributions of the European population for 2005 were used to adjust incidence and prevalence for age and gender. Survival probabilities were calculated for incident patients between the years 2004 and 2013 using the Kaplan–Meier method to calculate unadjusted patient survival probability. The log rank test was applied to compare survival curves according to some risk factors. Cox proportional hazards model was created to study the potential predictors of survival. In 2013, the total number of patients in Spain that started RRT was 5705 for 95. 3 % of the total Spanish population, with an unadjusted rate of 127. 1 PMP. The evolution from 2007 to 2013 showed a gradual decline from 127. 4 PMP in 2007 to 120. 4 PMP in 2012, with a small upturn to 127. 1 in 2013. The adjusted incidence rate for the year 2013 was 121. 5 PMP for the total population, 158. 7 PMP for males and 83. 1 PMP for females. The most frequent cause of primary renal disease in incident was diabetes mellitus: 20. 4 % in 2007, which increased to 24. 6 % in 2013. The percentage of transplant as first RRT increased from 1. 7 % in 2007 to 4. 2 % in 2013. The total number of patients in RRT for 95. 3 % of the population in 2013 was 50, 567, with an unadjusted prevalent rate of 1125. 7 PMP. The adjusted prevalence rate for 2013 was 1087. 5 PMP (1360. 7 PMP for males and 809. 8 PMP for females). The percentage of diabetes mellitus in prevalent patients evolved from 13. 9 % in 2007 to 14. 9 % (168 PMP) in 2013. The percentage of transplanted prevalent patients with functioning grafts evolved from 49. 3 % in 2007 to 51. 5 % in 2013. The number of transplantations performed each year increased from 2211 (48. 9 PMP) in 2007 (6. 2 % living donor transplants) to 2552 (54. 2 PMP) in 2013 (15. 0 % living donor transplants). 40, 394 patients from 12 regions of Spain who began RRT between 2004 and 2012 were included in the survival analysis (87 % Spanish population coverage). Unadjusted patient survival probabilities after one, 2 and 5 years were 91, 81 and 57 %, respectively. In the univariate analysis, better survival was found for non-diabetic patients, women, age below 45, peritoneal dialysis as first RRT and patients who had received at least one transplant...|$|R
