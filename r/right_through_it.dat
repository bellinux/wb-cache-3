25|$|A geologically young land, Iceland {{is located}} on both the Iceland hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs <b>right</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> This {{location}} means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes, notably Hekla, Eldgjá, Herðubreið, and Eldfell. The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed {{nearly a quarter of}} the island's population. In addition, the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterward, and affected climates in other areas.|$|E
500|$|Bird's {{experiments}} with his cell were {{important for the}} new discipline of electrometallurgy. [...] An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. [...] On breaking apart the plaster {{it was found that}} veins of copper were formed running <b>right</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> [...] So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. [...] Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. [...] Bird's experiments sometimes get him credit for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. [...] In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind electrotyping. [...] However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. [...] Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{a version}} of Good Game aimed at spawnlings (younger gamers), though Bajo and Hex have {{stressed}} {{in the past that}} the show is for gamers of all ages. The show is hosted by Bajo, Hex, and a robot named DARREN. Part of the reason for its creation is because [...] "some of the content in the games isn't necessarily appropriate for a younger player". MolksTVTalk1 explains that the show is one of a few on TV that doesn't dumb it down for kids, and is genuinely enjoyable content for all ages. Hex said that they made a conscious effort not to be condescending as the younger gamers see <b>right</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> and get offended by it, and that they are game-savvy anyway. For this reason, only a few minor differences needed to be made, for the format's transition to a younger audience. Bajo explained that it was Janet Carr's idea to do a kids show, and the team was like [...] "yeah, of course we have to". The audience interactivity spreads to Good Game: Spawn Point as well. One of the segments introduced in this spin-off is Ask Good Game, where the hosts answer gaming questions by the viewers. Bajo said [...] "we get something like 3 emails a minute from kids", and Hex said [...] "the letters and mail we get from kids are awesome". Janet Carr said around 50% of Spawn Point's audience are female, and MolksTVTalk1 said the show has given many young female gamers a role model in Hex. Many questions were asked regarding Minecraft that the team put a special F.A.Q. related to the game on the GG: SP website. The show started in 2009, the same year that Hex joined the Good Game team.|$|E

60|$|For many it {{was their}} last earthly cry, since at that moment a sheet of flame burst from the rampart of the camp, {{followed}} by the boom of the cannon, and six pounds of canister swept <b>through</b> the crowd. <b>Right</b> <b>through</b> them <b>it</b> swept, leaving a wide lane of dead and dying; and such a shriek went up to heaven as even that place of torment had never heard.|$|R

60|$|Thoroughly disgusted, I left Alphonse to {{look after}} himself, which he did by {{following}} me like a shadow, and proceeded to join the others by the large entrance.

60|$|Arrived at {{the wall}} of fire, Tancred halted a moment, {{and looked up at}} the visages on its battlements, not without alarm.

Besides, if it do come a very sharp frost, I've got a bear-skin coat that our ship-carpenter made for me one voyage in the arctic regions. It is hot enough inside almost to cook you.

6000|$|... "No, {{they must}} have {{thousands}} of serious cases on hand. I merely fainted from loss of blood. The two wounds in my head cannot be very serious, and Karl has bandaged them up {{as well as a}} surgeon could do. The worst wound is in my leg. The bayonet went <b>right</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> and for a moment pinned it to the saddle. However, it is but a flesh wound, behind the bone about six inches below the knee. It bled very freely at first, but Karl stanched it, and it has not burst out since; so it is evident that no great harm is done." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, at last, {{there came}} a flush that made the soft moon look {{suddenly}} paler, and lighted up the world as if the sun had shot a ray <b>right</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> from the antipodes.

One result was that a fiendish cheer arose from the robbers' camp, filling the night air with discord. Another result was that the happy-go-lucky little boy and his horses came to an almost miraculous halt and remained so for some time, gazing straight before them in a state of abject amazement! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he {{said very}} slowly, [...] "is what I don't quite know. One of them bones is a rocker, and she swings on the other.

6000|$|... "It {{goes in and}} out, {{and where}} there's an {{obstacle}} it winds around. That's {{the difference between a}} white man's and an Indian's nature.

6000|$|After {{they had}} gone a few yards Waboose turned and waved her hand again.
