Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> of the Hubble Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase.</b> Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{estimated}} to be 2.37 million households in Scotland. Of these approximately 1.5 million (62.5 per cent) were owner-occupied homes, 319,000 (12.7 per cent) homes rented from local authorities, 305,000 (11.5 per cent) privately rented homes, and 277,000 (11.5 per cent) homes rented from housing associations. The total number had increased by around 173,000 (7.9 per cent) over the previous ten years, with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> having slowed substantially {{since the start of}} the economic downturn in 2007. The rate of growth in households was affected by falls in new housing supply (which includes new builds, refurbishments and conversions). This fell in each year from 2008–09 to 2010–11, from around 27,600 units in 2007–08 to 17,100 units in 2010–11. The number of households increased after 2010 in every local authority except Clackmannanshire, Inverclyde and West Dunbartonshire. The area with the greatest increase since 2001 in percentage terms was Aberdeenshire with an additional 13,800 households (15.2 per cent). Edinburgh City saw the largest absolute increase of 17,000 households (8.3 per cent). Overall 2.8 per cent of dwellings are vacant and 1.5 per cent are second homes, with the largest proportions in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

Preying interspecifically on eggs of Typhlodromus negevi Swirski and Amitai and the natural prey T. urticae produced higher intrinsic <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> and finite <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> for the predator in comparison to feed on conspecific eggs.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} 20 - year incidence trends for childhood type 1 diabetes in 23 EURODIAB centres and compare <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in the first (1989 – 1998) and second (1999 – 2008) halves of the period. Methods All registers operate in geographically defined regions and are based on a clinical diagnosis. Completeness of registration is assessed by capture–recapture methodology. Twenty-three centres in 19 countries registered 49, 969 new cases of type 1 diabetes in individuals diagnosed before their 15 th birthday during the period studied. Results Ascertainment exceeded 90 % in most registers. During the 20 -year period, all but one register showed statistically significant changes in incidence, with rates universally increasing. When estimated separately for the first and second halves of the period, the median <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> were similar: 3. 4 % per annum and 3. 3 % per annum, respectively. However, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> differed significantly between the first half and the second half for nine of the 21 registers with adequate coverage of both periods; five registers showed significantly higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in the first half, and four significantly higher rates in the second half. Conclusions/interpretation The incidence <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> childhood type 1 diabetes continues to rise across Europe by an average of approximately 3 – 4 % per annum, but the increase is not necessarily uniform, showing periods of less rapid and more rapid increase in incidence in some registers. This pattern of change suggests that important risk exposures differ over time in different European countries. Further time trend analysis and comparison of the patterns in defined regions is warranted...|$|R

25|$|Incremental {{health risk}} is the {{increased}} risk that a receptor (normally {{a human being}} living nearby) will face from (the lack of) a remediation project. The use of incremental health risk is based on carcinogenic and other (e.g., mutagenic, teratogenic) effects and often involves value judgements about the acceptable projected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> in cancer. In some jurisdictions this is 1 in 1,000,000 but in other jurisdictions the acceptable projected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>increase</b> is 1 in 100,000. A relatively small incremental health risk from a single project is not of much comfort if the area already has a relatively high health risk from other operations like incinerators or other emissions, or if other projects exist {{at the same time}} causing a greater cumulative risk or an unacceptably high total risk. An analogy often used by remediators is to compare the risk of the remediation on nearby residents to the risks of death through car accidents or tobacco smoking.|$|E
