25|$|The crystal scintillates in {{response}} to incident gamma radiation. When a gamma photon leaves the patient (who has been injected with a radioactive pharmaceutical), it knocks an electron loose from an iodine atom in the crystal, and a faint flash of light is produced when the dislocated electron again finds a minimal energy state. The initial phenomenon of the excited electron {{is similar to the}} photoelectric effect and (particularly with gamma rays) the Compton effect. After the flash of light is produced, it is detected. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) behind the crystal detect the fluorescent flashes (events) and a computer sums the counts. The computer reconstructs and displays a two dimensional image of the relative spatial count density on a monitor. This <b>reconstructed</b> <b>image</b> reflects the distribution and relative concentration of radioactive tracer elements present in the organs and tissues imaged.|$|E

40|$|Photoacoustic/thermoacoustic {{tomography}} is {{an emerging}} hybrid imaging modality combining optical/microwave imaging with ultrasound imaging. Here, a k-wave MATLAB toolbox {{was used to}} simulate various configurations of excitation pulse shape, width, transducer types, and target object sizes to see their effect on the photoacoustic/thermoacoustic signals. A numerical blood vessel phantom was also used to demonstrate the effect of various excitation pulse waveforms and pulse widths on the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>images.</b> <b>Reconstructed</b> <b>images</b> were blurred due to the broadening of the pressure waves by the excitation pulse width {{as well as by}} the limited transducer bandwidth. The blurring increases with increase in pulse width. A deconvolution approach is presented here with Tikhonov regularization to correct the photoacoustic/thermoacoustic signals, which resulted in improved <b>reconstructed</b> <b>images</b> by reducing the blurring effect. It is observed that the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>images</b> remain unaffected by change in pulse widths or pulse shapes, {{as well as by the}} limited bandwidth of the ultrasound detectors after the use of the deconvolution technique.

30|$|For {{the similar}} bit rate, the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>images</b> {{based on the}} SSIM-based error-resilient video coding can provide a better visual quality due to more image details being {{protected}} from transmission errors.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction from non-uniformly sampled data acquired by echo-planar imaging (EPI) and spiral scan imaging (SSI) techniques. In EPI, mismatches in the timings of the odd and even echoes collected with readout gradients of alternating polarity will result in "N= 2 " ghosting in the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>images.</b> We propose a new method using a calibration data set to correct this mismatch and hence to calculate accurate k-space trajectories. In order to <b>reconstruct</b> <b>images</b> at real-time speeds, we utilize a high speed optoelectronic device to perform two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT). <b>Images</b> <b>reconstructed</b> from EPI data are presented to demonstrate that our method can successfully suppress the "N= 2 " ghosting and provide good contrast at real-time speeds. <b>Image</b> <b>reconstructed</b> from SSI data is also presented to show that our method can provide better sharp features and more details in the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>images.</b> 1.
