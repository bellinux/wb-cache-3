40|$|Reform of Collectivities and Regionalisation in France: A Horizon of Variable Geometry. Initially {{considered}} as a highly profitable solution that best fits the spatial organization of France, the resulted administrative cutting {{gave rise to the}} multiplication of some supra-communal and intra-departmental structures, contrary to the purpose they had been created for: socio-economic efficiency, territorial cohesion, as well as to institutionalisation.

The consequences of decentralization, interpreted by the existence of a multitude of territorial entities between department/county and communes, non-hierarchized, without assuming any responsibility, can and must be corrected by legislative regulations, the reform of territorial collectivities - a regional reform at the same time, left in the hands of Balladur committee, being one of them.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{regional}} demographic trends in France from 1968 to 1990. This study {{is based on}} a concept using zones d'emploi (labour market regions) as regional analysis units instead of régions de programmes or départements as usually done in other studies. The 348 zones d'emploi are functional units based on commuter flows. The study follows two main objectives: (1) Analysis of the main regional migration and population trends over the three census periods from 1968 to 1990. (2) Analysis of the growth trends of different types of regions on the basis of typifying the zones d’emploi (labour market regions) according to economic criteria and settlement structure criteria. The large-scale pattern of the population and population trends. Owing to the stronger growth of the rural zones d'emploi after 1975, the growth figures are rather suggestive of deconcentration trends. In the 80 ies, however, the demographic trends were rather indicative of concentration trends: there has been a disproportionate growth in the <b>regional</b> <b>metropolises</b> and in the area around Paris. Additional indicators such as the employment trend and the business formation rate underline the dominance of concentration trends. That dominance of concentration trends on the inter-regional level in France is in accordance with studies which consider the large agglomeration areas to be the "winners" of the emerging European Union internal market. migration trends seem to be relatively stable in comparison to the massive change in the general economic and political framework in France and Western Europe. For instance, more than 60 % of the zones d'emploi (labour market regions) have steadily shown either migration losses or migration gains over the three census periods. The different region types, however, show more distinct changes. The zones d'emploi (labour market regions) with a tertiary sector specialisation show a higher population growth than mainly industrial regions. Some agricultural regions obtained migration gains. But these influxes are often not linked with a corresponding job displacement. Using settlement structure types gives different results in the migration...|$|R

Linkages are hierarchically or-ganized, and the <b>regional</b> <b>metropolis</b> and higher-level metropolises at the national scale occupy pivotal positions as intermediaries for lower-level metropolises. Al-though national links are important, interurban links that include the <b>regional</b> <b>metropolis</b> and its hinterland cities remain {{a major factor in the}} system of cities even in a society that is often characterized as shifting from a local/regional to a national orientation.

' Most linkages fall into two broad categories. The first includes control and coordination links; these typically involve the exercise of authority and power relations. The bases of differential au-thority and power derive from variable access to economic resources such as capital, specialized business information, and exceptional business skills. Examples of these control and coordination links are the manage-ment ties between corporate headquarters and lower levels of the corpora-tion, the flow of orders between retailers and wholesalers, and the finan-cial ties between banks.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} the Siberian region general crisis of the 1917 spring. The internal and external contradictions of the transformation process of socio-economic and political relations in Siberia are examined in terms of the post-February all- Russian revolutionary crisis development. The understanding of the socio-political Russian crisis in the spring of 1917, emerging after the February political coup, is essential in studying the revolutionary соnversion process of the early twentieth century Russian society, as this crisis has generally become the turning point in the country’s history and objectively led to the October political coup. The Russian revolutionary crisis constituents, its foreign and domestic manifestations require careful investigation in the issue formulation presented in the paper. The development specifics of the revolutionary crisis in the spring of 1917 in the trans-Uralian agricultural colony of the Russian Empire is of scientific interest, as well as the finding of its anti-crisis development scenarios in the paper presented period. The development of the nationwide crisis in Russia in the early twentieth century, due to the complex and contradictory processes of Russian society modernization in completing the industrial civilization and transition to the imperialist development stage, was complicated by the “Siberian historical issues” in the Siberian region. A set of these issues include the incompleteness of the regional peasantry land management, the contradictions between the old peasantry and Stolypin migrants, and also between the peasantry and the privileged regional Cossacks, the agricultural products export problems from Siberia to domestic and foreign markets, or marketing crisis, the contradictions between the <b>regional</b> and <b>metropolis</b> bourgeoisie, or the issue of the Siberians economic inequality, the local industry underdevelopment and the complete dependence of the local population on the factory products supplying from European Russia, or supply crisis, the lack of a country council, or the administrative inequality of Siberia as a colony and metropolis, etc. During the First World War, these problems worsened and led Siberia to a revolutionary situation. Started in Russia in February 1917, the revolution was an attempt to solve the “Siberian historical issues” personally by the regional population, whose social activity ultimately led to an acute socio political crisis of Siberia, which became a part of the national post-February revolutionary crisis...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the impact of}} administrative reforms on the electoral volatility in the Warmia and Mazury voivodeship of Poland. The administrative reforms resulted {{in the formation of}} a new territorial organization of power. Using three large administrative units of Poland as an example, the authors analyse the experience of the formation of a geographic region by merging several politically diverse territories. The merger took place in a changing political environment. It inevitably affected the strategy and tactics of the development of local self-governance. The formation of the region has been going on in such a manner that differences in the electoral preferences and political behaviour of the urban population (the <b>regional</b> <b>metropolis)</b> and the periphery remain unchanged. Having performed the index analysis and a comparative analysis of the electoral data, the authors conclude that the consistency of administrative decisions on the formation of the region and the electoral performance have been weakening over time. During the initial phase, the electoral volatility was mainly due to the sluggishness and inertia of the previous territorial organization. After the phase of stabilization, the electoral volatility indices in different geographical areas changed due to a combination of social and political factors. The authors show that the ‘looseness’ of the Polish party system affect the electoral volatility in the region more than institutional decisions of the administrative reforms. ...|$|E

Doha, the capital of Qatar keeps positioning and re-positioning itself on the map of international architecture with different degrees of expressions of its unique qualities in terms of economy, environment, culture, and global outlook. These expressions {{can be seen as}} cultural aspirations reflected on the public face of architecture. While the pace of development puts the city among those described as instance cities, it is seen as a city with the highest global connectivity. The government is supporting high profile institutional and cultural building projects, the majority of which are designed by name international firms and star architects. Despite the demerits inherited in any swift urban development process and the resulting global architecture, expressions of identity and the creation of responsive environments are observed. In this paper, I select some of these aspirations that can be seen as conscious endeavors of relating an exclusive local context to the global world. The paper involves an investigation into the evolutionary process of urbanity in Doha, classified in recent writings as urbanity of transition, necessity, modernization, stagnation, and globalization, and how such a process influenced the architectural identity of Doha. A city selected a capital of Arab culture, and within the examples discussed, polemics on identity within tradition and modernity are developed to advance the discourse on the cultural role of architecture...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{comprehensive}} coverage of a research project of the National Priority Research Program of the Qatar National Research Fund, entitled ‘Investigating the Qualities of the Urban Environment in Emerging Regional Metropolises’, and carried out between 2011 and 2014 through the joint collaboration of Qatar University and Technische Universität München. Through the shift of global economic forces Gulf cities, such as Qatar’s capital Doha, are developed as central hubs between developed economies in the West and the rising economies of Asia. In the context of international competition between cities new challenges are emerging where cities need {{to find ways to}} sustain and extend their position in a globalizing world. Therefore the research process placed emphasis on the complex interrelationship of knowledge economies and spatial developments in the Gulf region. The work is premised on the assumption that non-physical economic aspects and the qualities of the urban environment are interdependent. It analyses the qualities of the urban environment of Doha as an important <b>regional</b> <b>metropolis</b> through a comprehensive investigation utilizing a set of interdisciplinary research methods that include analysis of historic documents, Delphi interview series, company network analysis, GIS analysis, cognitive mapping, behavioural studies, media surveys, attitude surveys, and space syntax analysis. The outcomes promise important results regarding urban qualities in the city of Doha culminating into various recommendations aimed at potential beneficiaries including public sector organizations, private sector and real estate development companies, and academia...|$|E
40|$|The city of Amsterdam is broadly {{considered}} to be of great cultural and historic value. For centuries, it has played {{a vital role in}} the development of The Netherlands and Western Europe as the centre of the Modern World. Traditionally, the balance between government, freedom and trade is {{considered to}} be of paramount importance for the prosperity of this open society. The fact that the historic structure has escaped many potentially negative consequences of the city’s transition into a poly-centric <b>regional</b> <b>metropolis</b> is a testament to the cultural awareness of its citizens. However, for all the transformations the city has seen throughout the years, the city centre has not remained entirely unaffected, bringing about a process of urban regeneration in which cultural and social interests are often outweighed by economic interests. This graduation project is aimed at regaining the balance between economic, cultural-historic and social interests when making planning and design decisions. An impression is given of what a suitable approach to the issues at hand could potentially look like: by attuning buildings to the ‘human scale’ on which the urban fabric evolved, by densifying the pedestrian network and by increasing the amount of public space suitable for stationary activities in the city-centre, a physical framework is given for a durable balance between economic, cultural and social functions with the same properties that made Amsterdam’s heritage assets so much sought after: identity, diversity, flexibility, ownership and accessibility.
