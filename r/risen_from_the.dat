5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having <b>risen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1st century, a {{distinct}} equestrian group, non-Italian and military in character, became established. This {{was a result}} of the established custom whereby the emperor elevated the primuspilus (chief centurion) of each legion to equestrian rank on completion of his year in office. This resulted in some 30 career soldiers, mostly non-Italian and <b>risen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ranks, joining the aristocracy each year. Far less wealthy than their Italian counterparts, many such equites belonged to families that provided career soldiers for generations. Prominent among them were Romanised Illyrians, the descendants of the Illyrian-speaking tribes that inhabited the Roman provinces of Pannonia (W Hungary/Croatia/Slovenia), Dalmatia (Croatia/Bosnia) and Moesia Superior (Serbia), together with the neighbouring Thracians of Moesia Inferior (N Bulgaria) and Macedonia provinces. From the time of Domitian (ruled 81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian and Thracian provinces became the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what {{proportion}} of the corps commanders had <b>risen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ranks, but {{it is likely to}} have been small as most rankers would be nearing retirement age {{by the time they were}} given command of a regiment and would be promoted no further. In contrast, directly commissioned protectores and tribuni dominated the higher echelons, as they were usually young men when they started. For such men, promotion to corps command could be swift e.g. the future emperor Theodosius I was a dux at age 28. It was also possible for rungs on the rank-ladder to be skipped. Commanders of scholae, who enjoyed direct access to the emperor, often reached the highest rank of magister militum: e.g. the barbarian-born officer Agilo was promoted direct to magister militum from tribunus of a schola in 360, skipping the dux stage.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{a regular}} {{officer who had}} {{commanded}} the 1st Light Horse Brigade upon its formation in 1914 and later the ANZAC Mounted Division, became the first Australian to command a corps, when he took command of the Desert Mounted Corps in 1917. Birdwood was later given command of the Australian Corps on its formation in November 1917. Another Australian, Monash, took over command of the corps on 31 May 1918. Despite being promoted to command the British Fifth Army, Birdwood retained command of the AIF. By this time {{four of the five}} divisional commanders were Australian officers. The vast majority of brigade commands were also held by Australian officers. As a result of the policy of appointing officers exclusively from enlisted personnel that was later adopted in the AIF, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had <b>risen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ranks. A number of British staff officers were attached to the headquarters of the Australian Corps, and its predecessors, due to a shortage of suitably trained Australian officers.|$|E
5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have <b>risen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme {{that had been}} established in 1911, while others had served as volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited and in many cases the quality of the training they had received was also limited. The original intention had been that half the initial intake would consist of soldiers that were currently serving in the Militia, but ultimately this did not come to fruition and while about 8,000 of the original intake had some prior military experience, either through compulsory training or as volunteers, over 6,000 had none at all. In terms of officers, the situation was better. For example, within the 1st Division, of its initial 631 officers, 607 had had previous military experience. This was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. As a result, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had <b>risen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ranks. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had any substantial experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E
