50|$|The Ballinger siege story arc, {{which began}} with the {{introduction}} of the Barnhurst Five, happened when staff and inmates were held hostage by armed mercenaries who broke into the prison to free <b>remand</b> <b>prisoner</b> Ruth Ballinger (Lindy Davies) on the orders of her drug-baron husband. Surrounded by police, the mercenaries took the women and officers Joan Ferguson and Joyce Barry captive and threatened to shoot a hostage every hour until they received safe passage out of the country.

5000|$|While {{on trial}} in Düsseldorf on charges {{relating}} to the June 1990 murder of a British soldier in Dortmund, German authorities announced on 16 November 1992 she was also being charged with attempted murder over the 1989 Osnabrück bombing. On 9 June 1994 Maguire and three other IRA members were acquitted of the Dortmund murder although the judge said it was [...] "clear they {{are members of the}} IRA and trained as IRA volunteers", and also acquitted of involvement in the May 1990 bombing of a British Army base in Hanover. She was remanded into custody to await trial on other charges relating to the 1989 Osnabrück bombing, and in June 1995 received a nine-year prison sentence after being found guilty of attempted murder, explosives offences and spying on British Army bases in Germany with intent to sabotage. Due to the length of time spent in custody on remand—during the trial Maguire became the longest-serving <b>remand</b> <b>prisoner</b> in German legal history—Maguire walked free from court.|$|E
5000|$|The Bea-Joan-Nola {{conflict}} peaked {{shortly after}} Bea {{was returned to}} the prison. Joan and Nola attempted to drive Bea to suicide by evoking {{the memory of her}} dead daughter Debbie, coercing tarot-reading medium and <b>remand</b> <b>prisoner</b> Zara Moonbeam (Ilona Rodgers) to assist them. The plan backfired and it was Nola, not Bea, whose body was removed from Wentworth. A few months later, Joan triumphed over Bea and had her old enemy transferred to Barnhurst. After playing Bea Smith for 400 episodes, Val Lehman had tired of the role and resigned. Actress Sheila Florance left shortly afterwards, leading to the departure of Lizzie Birdsworth, leaving Elspeth Ballantyne (Meg Morris, formerly Jackson) as the sole remaining original cast member. In the 1983 cliffhanger, Lizzie was waiting to hear if she has been paroled and subsequently found a body in the prison yard; new officer David Bridges admitted to the murder and told Lizzie she would [...] "be set free".|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{develop a}} method for {{forecasting}} the NSW remand and sentenced prisoner populations. Method: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with other time series as input variables were employed to estimate and forecast changes in the remand and sentenced prisoner populations. Models were tested by estimating model parameters over the period January 1998 – December 2010 and then comparing model forecasts with actual prison population trends over the period January 2011 – March 2013. Comparison of actual with forecast remand and sentenced prisoner numbers revealed that both models provide fairly reliable predictions of prison population trends over a three year time horizon. Results: Barring any significant change to policing and penal policy, the prison population {{is expected to rise}} {{in the first half of}} 2013 and then to drop steadily over the next three years. Although modelling suggests an uptrend in the <b>remand</b> <b>prisoner</b> population, this should be more than offset by a decrease in the sentenced prisoner population over the next thirty-three months. Conclusion: Although the models developed here provide accurate forecasts in retrospective testing, they should not be used as the sole basis for projecting future prison numbers. Future projections of prisoner numbers should also be based on advice from correctional administrators, police prosecutors, legal policy analysts, and others on the likely effects of any proposed change to policing, bail or sentence policy. Construction of a simulation model may help in quantifying the effects of these changes. Authored by Wai-Yin Wan, Steve Moffatt, Zachary Xie, Simon Corben and Don Weatherburn...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{explain the}} rapid {{rise in the}} NSW prison {{population}} over the five years from 2011 to 2015. Methods: Descriptive analysis of court, police and prison data. Kendall’s tau {{was used to test}} for significant change in trend data. Results: Between June 2011 and September 2015, {{the number of people in}} NSW prisons increased from 10, 000 to 11, 801, a rise of 18 per cent. Both sentenced and <b>remand</b> <b>prisoner</b> populations were affected. As of September 2015, the remand population stood at 3, 597. This is 975 remand prisoners more than were in custody in September 2011. The sentenced prisoner population in September 2015 stood at 8, 204. This is 1, 023 more sentenced prisoners than were in custody in September 2011. The growth in the number of persons entering remand is likely due to four factors: (a) an increase in the number of people proceeded against by police for offences where bail refusal is likely (b) an increase in the number of persons proceeded against by police for breach of bail (c) an increase in the time spent in custody on remand and (d) (possibly) an increase in the likelihood of bail refusal. The cause of the increase in time spent on remand is not known for certain at this stage but it may be related to a growth in the backlog of trial cases in the NSW District Criminal Court. The increase in the sentenced prisoner population is entirely due to an increase in the number of sentenced prisoners received into custody. There is no evidence that non-parole periods are getting longer. The increase in the number of sentenced prisoners is partly due to the fact that the percentage of convicted offenders given a prison sentence has risen for a large number of offences and partly due to the fact that police are more often initiating criminal proceedings against offenders who, if convicted, are likely to be imprisoned. Conclusion: The increase in the prison population is partly a consequence of changes in the way the courts respond to suspected or convicted offenders and partly a consequence of an increase in the number of people charged by police with serious offences...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Older {{prisoners are}} {{the fastest growing}} group of prisoners in most countries. They have high rates of {{physical}} and psychiatric co-morbidity, compared to community dwelling older persons and also compared with other prisoner groups. Very high rates of mental illness {{have been found in}} <b>remand</b> (pre-trial) <b>prisoners</b> when compared with other prisoner groups; however to date there have been no studies examining older male and female <b>remand</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all remands, to a male and a female prison, over a six and half-year period. Demographic data were collected pertaining to psychiatric and medical diagnoses and seriousness of offending. Results: We found rising numbers of older <b>prisoners</b> amongst male <b>remand</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Older <b>remand</b> <b>prisoners</b> had very high rates of affective disorder and alcohol misuse. They had rates of psychotic illnesses and deliberate self-harm comparable to younger <b>remand</b> <b>prisoners.</b> High rates of vulnerability were found among older prisoners and older prisoners had a greater need for general medical and psychiatric services than younger prisoners. We also found comparable offending patterns with younger prisoners and high rates of sexual offending among the older male prisoner group. Conclusions: Given the ageing population of many countries it is likely the numbers of older prisoners will continue to grow and given their high levels of both physical and psychiatric illness this will have implications for future service delivery...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} {{drug and alcohol use}} among newly <b>remanded</b> <b>prisoners,</b> assess the effectiveness of prison reception screening, and examine the clinical management of substance misusers among <b>remand</b> <b>prisoners.</b> DESIGN: A consecutive case study of <b>remand</b> <b>prisoners</b> screened at reception for substance misuse and treatment needs and comparison of findings with those of prison reception screening and treatment provision. SETTING: A large adult male remand prison (Durham). SUBJECTS: 548 men aged 21 and over awaiting trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of substance misuse; treatment needs of substance misusers; effectiveness of prison reception screening for substance misuse; provision of detoxification programmes. RESULTS: Before remand 312 (57 %) men were using illicit drugs and 181 (33 %) met DSM-IV drug misuse or dependence criteria; 177 (32 %) men met misuse or dependence criteria for alcohol. 391 (71 %) men were judged to require help directed at their drug or alcohol use and 197 (36 %) were judged to require a detoxification programme. The prison reception screen identified recent illicit drug use in 131 (24 %) of 536 men and problem drinking in 103 (19 %). Drug use was more likely to be identified by prison screening if an inmate was using multiple substances, using opiates, or had a diagnosis of abuse or dependence. 47 (9 %) of 536 inmates were prescribed treatment to ease the symptoms of substance withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of substance misuse in newly <b>remanded</b> <b>prisoners</b> is high. Prison reception health screening consistently underestimated drug and alcohol use. In many cases in which substance use is identified the quantities and numbers of different substances being used are underestimated. Initial management of inmates identified by prison screening as having problems with dependence producing substances is poor. Few receive a detoxification programme, so that many are left with the option of continuing to use drugs in prison or facing untreated withdrawal...|$|R
