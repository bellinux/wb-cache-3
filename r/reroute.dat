40|$|<b>Rerouting</b> {{has been}} used in traffic {{management}} to perform dynamic load balancing. The aim of <b>rerouting</b> is to reassign path/bandwidth allocations of current traffic trunks in a network in order to minimize the probability of blocking future resource requests. In this work, we are interested in investigating how the effectiveness of <b>rerouting</b> can be affected by the characteristic of the underlying network topology. In order to evaluate the blocking performance achievable by <b>rerouting,</b> we established baseline measures through two resource allocation algorithms: a shortest distance path algorithm (SDP), that represents the best common practice without <b>rerouting,</b> and a global <b>rerouting</b> algorithm that is based on a provably ɛ-optimal algorithm for multi-commodity flow problem. We proposed two <b>rerouting</b> algorithms based on the basic SDP algorithm that selects for <b>rerouting</b> either from traffic trunks with the same source-destination pairs (local <b>rerouting)</b> or from all traffic trunks (global <b>rerouting).</b> Our results show that the effectiveness of <b>rerouting</b> is highly related to the average node degree. As the connectivity of a graph increases, <b>rerouting</b> tends to be more effective. However, <b>rerouting</b> does not always perform better when connectivity is increased. Significant performance improvement only occurs within a relatively small range of connectivities when a <b>rerouting</b> algorithm like SDP-LR is able to find alternative paths and SDP cannot. Furthermore, local reroutng is sufficient to exploit most of the benefits of <b>rerouting</b> and {{it is not necessary to}} utilize much more computationally intensive global <b>rerouting</b> algorithms. Finally, we investigate the <b>rerouting</b> frequency vs. blocking trade-off and show that for local <b>rerouting,</b> the best performance can be achieved by a <b>rerouting</b> frequency of only 30 %.

40|$|Abstract — Most current {{backbone}} networks use Link-State protocol, OSPF or IS-IS, {{as their}} intradomain routing protocol. Link-State protocols perform global routing table update to route around failures. It usually takes seconds. As real-time applications like VoIP emerge in recent years, {{there is a}} requirement for a Fast <b>Rerouting</b> mechanism to route around failures before all routers on the network update their routing tables. In addition, Fast <b>Rerouting</b> is more appropriate than global routing table update when failures are transient. In this paper, we propose such a Fast <b>Rerouting</b> extension for Link-state protocols. In our approach, when a link fails, the affected traffic is <b>rerouted</b> along a pre-computed <b>Rerouting</b> Path. In case <b>rerouting</b> cannot be done locally, the local router will signal minimal number of upstream routers to setup the <b>Rerouting</b> Path for <b>rerouting.</b> We propose algorithms that simplify the <b>rerouting</b> operation and the <b>Rerouting</b> Path setup. With a simple extension to the current Link State protocols, our scheme can route around failures faster and involves minimal number of routers for <b>rerouting.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} <b>rerouting</b> {{phenomena}} {{can be observed}} from the available data and how to derive valuable input to estimate the <b>rerouting</b> models. By <b>rerouting</b> we mean changing the currently chosen path in road network after either receiving some information or observing consequences of an unexpected traffic event. Recently we have proposed Information Comply Model (ICM) to address the <b>rerouting</b> phenomena in Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) [1]. In this paper we focus on estimation framework for the model and verify the assumptions on the <b>rerouting</b> behavior. The paper identifies two datasets where <b>rerouting</b> can be observed: (1) direct - path trajectories; (2) indirect - traffic flows over the cut-set of the network. Proposed method of formal analysis derives from the data the input to estimate the <b>rerouting</b> behavior, namely flow: information spreads (speed and range), drivers observe (how an atypical delay leads to <b>rerouting),</b> drivers decide (utility of <b>rerouting</b> used in discrete-choice model). Indirect estimation method from traffic flows is illustrated with a field-data from Warsaw bridges observed over several consecutive days including day of the event. Central findings are: a) about 20 % of the affected traffic flow <b>reroutes,</b> b) <b>rerouting</b> flows are increasing in time, c) drivers show strategic capabilities, d) and maximize their utility while <b>rerouting.</b> Which were assumed while conceiving the ICM model...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{stochastic}} integer programming model for managing air traffic inbound to an airport when both the airport itself and its approach routes are subject to adverse weather. In the model, ground delay decisions are static, while those on <b>rerouting</b> are dynamic. The decision variables in the model are aggregate number of flights planned to arrive at various capacity constrained resources. The model does not directly assign arrival times to individual flights. Therefore, in context of Collaborative Decision Making, which is the governing philosophy of the air traffic management system of the United States, the solutions from the dynamic <b>rerouting</b> model can be directly fed to some resource allocation algorithm that assigns routes and release times to individual flights or to the airlines who operate them. When adverse weather blocks or severely limits capacity of terminal approach routes, <b>rerouting</b> flights onto other approaches yields substantial benefits by alleviating high ground delays. Our experimental results indicate that making <b>rerouting</b> decisions dynamically results in 10 - 15 % delay cost reduction compared to static <b>rerouting,</b> and about 50 % less delay cost compared to a "pure" ground holding strategy (i. e., no <b>rerouting).</b> In contrast to static <b>rerouting,</b> the dynamic <b>rerouting</b> capability results in making <b>rerouting</b> decisions that are better matched to realized weather conditions. Lower total expected delay cost is achieved by delaying the <b>rerouting</b> decisions for flights until they reach the divergence point between alternative routes, and hence exploiting updated information on weather while making those decisions. In cases where the airport is the main, but not the only, bottleneck, the dynamic <b>rerouting</b> model may assign higher ground delays so that the <b>rerouting</b> decisions can be deferred until more information on en route weather becomes available.

30|$|We {{initially}} {{propose a}} new scheme {{to solve the}} link and node failure problems in a network of switches that avoids conflict on <b>rerouting</b> paths in contrast to protocols in [6, 7]. The new <b>rerouting</b> scheme we present here clearly uses not just one but multiple bridges, and it avoids conflict on <b>rerouting</b> paths. Our strategy uses a flow-splitting technique [22 – 25], extends the results in [7, 8] and can minimize the dimensioning cost of the network. Flow splitting is a method for restoring traffic from a failed link using multiple <b>rerouting</b> paths {{in the case of}} insufficient residual capacity. In this first contribution, we consider only one virtual plane.

40|$|When network {{resources}} are shared between Instantaneous Request (IR) and Book-Ahead (BA) connections, activation of future BA connections may cause preemption of on-going IR connections due to resource scarcity. <b>Rerouting</b> of preempted calls via alternative feasible paths is often considered {{as the final}} option to restore and maintain service continuity. Existing <b>rerouting</b> techniques, however, do not ensure acceptably low service disruption time and suffer from high failure rate and low network utilization. In this work, a new <b>rerouting</b> strategy is proposed that estimates the future resource scarcity, identifies the probable candidate connections for preemption and initiates the <b>rerouting</b> process in advance for those connections. Simulations on a widely used network topology suggest that the proposed <b>rerouting</b> scheme achieves a higher successful <b>rerouting</b> rate with lower service disruption time, while not compromising other network performance metrics like utilization and call blocking rate...|$|R
