The growth from seedling {{is in the}} first three or four months moderately vigorous. Contrarily to Pueraria montana var. lobata, P. phaseoloides does not have a dormant period. Successful growth was observed with a temperature between 22.1 and 27.4 °C, colder environment drastically reducing the development. After the establishment, the plant starts to climb and build tangled mats of over a half meter. It was found that the production of seeds is improved by the possibility to climb. The relatively <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> tolerance of P. phaseoloides can be an explanation of this phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{competition}} for light is a commonly occurring phenomenon in natural and agricultural vegetations. It is typically size-asymmetric, meaning that slightly larger individuals receive {{a disproportionate share}} of the light, leaving a limited amount of light for the initially smaller individuals. As a result, size inequalities of such stands increase with competition intensity. A plant's ability to respond morphologically to the presence of neighbour plants with enhanced shoot elongation, the so-called shade avoidance response, acts against the development of size inequalities. This has been shown experimentally with transgenic plants that cannot sense neighbours and, therefore, show no shade avoidance responses. Stands of such transgenic plants showed a much stronger development of size inequalities at high plant densities than did wild type (WT) stands. However, the transgenic plants used in these experiments displayed severely hampered growth rates and virtually no response to neighbours. In order to more precisely study the impact of this phenotypic plasticity on size inequality development, experiments required plants that have normal growth rates and reduced, but not absent, shade avoidance responses. We made use of an ethylene-insensitive, transgenic tobacco genotype (Tetr) that has wild type growth rates and moderately <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> avoidance responses to neighbours. Here, we show that the development of size inequalities in monocultures of these plants is not affected unambiguously different from wild type monocultures. Plots of Tetr plants developed higher inequalities for stem length than did WT, but monocultures of the two genotypes had identical CV (Coefficient of Variance) values for shoot biomass that increased with plant density. Therefore, even though <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> avoidance capacities led to the expected higher size inequalities for stem length, this does not necessarily lead to increased size inequalities for shoot biomass...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} likely effects on three coexisting species of Australian {{freshwater}} fish of riparian loss, {{we examined the}} temperature, light, and habitat preferences of each species in relation to commonly documented effects of riparian degradation on stream environments.

Xiphophorus helleri, Gambusia holbrooki, and Melanotaenia duboulayi differed significantly in mean swimming depth, preferences for light and habitat, and in their patterns of behavioural change through the day. Values of interspecific spatial overlap (25 – 58 %) indicated that the overall environmental preferences of G. holbrooki, X. helleri, and M. duboulayi were reasonably distinct. Habitat alterations associated with riparian removal are likely to favour the exotic species G. holbrooki over the native species M. duboulayi, but the results for X. helleri suggest that not all poeciliid␣species are strong indicators of degraded conditions...|$|E

30|$|Temperature is an {{important}} factor influencing in-stream processes (Allan and Castillo 2009). Increased solar radiation following harvest to the stream edge often resulted in higher maximum stream temperatures (up to 25 to 30 °C) and diurnal temperature ranges of up to 12 °C in the warmer northern latitudes of New Zealand and where the hydrology was dominated by surface and sub-surface flow (Baillie et al. 2005; Boothroyd et al. 2004; Graynoth 1979; Quinn and Wright-Stow 2008) (Table  1). Streams with cooler base flow temperatures, overhead logging slash cover and inputs from groundwater seepages, mediated the impact of <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> and increased solar radiation on water temperatures after harvest at some sites (Table  1) (Fahey and Stansfield 2006; Pruden et al. 1990). It is likely that, in some streams, temperatures after harvest are exceeding levels and duration periods considered stressful for some sensitive aquatic invertebrates and fish species (≥ 23 °C for aquatic invertebrates and[*]≥[*] 28 °C for indigenous fish) (Olsen et al. 2012; Quinn et al. 1994; Richardson et al. 1994).|$|E
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} {{proximate}} neighbors with {{a suite of}} responses that comprise the shade avoidance syndrome. These phytochrome-mediated responses include hyponasty (i. e. a more vertical orientation of leaves) and enhanced stem and petiole elongation. We showed recently that ethylene-insensitive tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants (Tetr) have reduced responses to neighbors, showing an important role for this gaseous plant hormone in shade avoidance. Here, we investigate interactions between phytochrome signaling and ethylene action in shade avoidance responses. Furthermore, we investigate if ethylene acts in these responses through an interaction with the GA class of hormones. Low red to far-red light ratios (R:FR) enhanced ethylene production in wild-type tobacco, resulting in shade avoidance responses, whereas ethylene-insensitive plants showed <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> avoidance responses. Plants with inhibited GA production showed hardly any shade avoidance responses at all to either a low R:FR or increased ethylene concentrations. Furthermore, low R:FR enhanced the responsiveness of hyponasty and stem elongation in both wild-type and Tetr plants to applied GA 3, with the stem elongation process being more responsive to GA 3 in the wild type than in Tetr. We conclude that phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance responses involve ethylene action, at least partly by modulating GA action...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{growing at}} high densities express shade {{avoidance}} traits {{as a response}} to the presence of neighbours. Enhanced shoot elongation is one of the best researched shade avoidance components and increases light capture in dense stands. We show here that also leaf movements, leading to a more vertical leaf orientation (hyponasty), may be crucial in the early phase of competition. The initiation of shade avoidance responses is classically attributed to the action of phytochrome photoreceptors that sense red:far-red (R:FR) ratios in light reflected by neighbours, but also other signals may be involved. It was recently shown that ethylene-insensitive, transgenic (Tetr) tobacco plants, which are insensitive to the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, have <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> avoidance responses to neighbours. Here, we report that this is not related to a reduced response to low R:FR ratio, but that Tetr tobacco plants are unresponsive to a reduced photon fluence rate of blue light, which normally suppresses growth inhibition in wild-type (WT) plants. In addition to these light signals, ethylene levels in the canopy atmosphere increased to concentrations that could induce shade avoidance responses in WT plants. Together, these data show that neighbour detection signals other than the R:FR ratio are more important than previously anticipated and argue for a particularly important role for ethylene in determining plant responses to neighbours...|$|E

40|$|To {{thrive in}} the forest {{environment}} a species {{must be able to}} pass each of three filters: first it must reach a site (the historical filter), then it must be able to tolerate the physical environment (the physiological filter) and finally it must be able to cope with biotic interactions at the site (the biotic filter). This thesis comprises of two complementary studies that explore the role temperature gradients play in determining a species ability to pass the physiological and biotic filters of a temperate rainforest. These studies were conducted using the seedlings of New Zealand warm- and cool- temperate tree species. The first study addresses how the trade-off in shade tolerance vs. growth rate found throughout closed-canopy forests changes from warm-temperate to cool-temperate environments using a transplant experiment. The second study aims to determine the implications of climate-related variation in xylem anatomy for morphological and physiological traits related to competitive ability. Warm-temperate species were found to be both faster-growing and more shade-tolerant than the cool-temperate species, indicating that cold resistant traits reduce competitive ability in warmer environments. This was supported by findings that the warm-temperate species had more conductive xylem and correspondingly higher levels of leaf area deployed than the cool species, indicating that cold resistance indirectly reduces the leafiness of a species. These cool-temperate species with less leaf surface area are less effective at intercepting light, resulting in lower growth rates and <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> tolerance which are important components of competitive ability in tree species. This may explain their absence from warmer forest environments, and their restriction to colder environments...|$|E
40|$|Australian grasstrees are a {{long-lived}} {{group of}} arborescent, monocotyledonous plants that persist in fire-prone landscapes. Renowned for {{their capacity to}} survive fire, and flower soon after, these species have long {{attracted the attention of}} biologists. A southwestern Australian species, Xanthorrhoea preissii, {{has been the subject of}} several recent studies, including use and verification of the "leafbase banding technique" that prompted my study. This technique, which is used to determine the age and fire history of grasstrees, correlates alternating brown- and cream-coloured, transverse bands along the stem of grasstrees with seasonal growth, and intermittent black bands with the burning of the plant. Combined, this information provides a chronology for the fire events. Fundamental to this interpretation is the assumption that grasstrees grow continually, and this growth varies annually in accordance with changes between the two contrasting seasons of its mediterranean climate. I studied X. preissii in two habitats (jarrah forest and banksia woodland) adjacent to the Perth metropolitan area, in southwestern Australia, focussing on leaf growth and phenology in relation to four factors important to the species lifecycle; climate, fire, reproduction and herbivory. Leaf production monitored for grasstrees in both habitats revealed continuous growth, oscillating between maximum rates (2. 5 - 3. 2 leaves/d) from late-spring (November) to autumn (April/May), to a minimum rate of as low as 0. 5 leaf/d during winter. In additional support of the "leafbase banding technique", annual leaf production was not different from the number of leafbases comprising one cream and one brown band. Synchronised with leaf production, grasstree water potentials cycled annually, with predawn readings commonly measured as 0 MPa during winter-spring and were as low as - 1. 26 MPa during summer, but they never exceeded the turgor loss point (- 1. 85 to - 2. 18 MPa). The fast summer growth was characterised by a fluctuating pattern of leaf production, particularly in banksia woodland, where grasstrees reliably responded to > 18 mm of rainfall. Twenty-four hours after 59 mm of simulated rainfall, grasstrees in banksia woodland showed a significant increase in water potential and increased leaf production by 7. 5 times. Reflecting this result, rainfall was the best climatic variable for predicting banksia woodland grasstree leaf production rate during summer, whereas leaf production of jarrah forest grasstrees was most closely correlated with daylength. Substrate differences between the two habitats can explain this variation in leaf growth patterns. While water appears to have played an important role in the evolution of this species, growth phenology suggests that X. preissii may have retained a mesotherm growth rhythm from the subtropical early Tertiary Period. To distinguish fire-stimulated growth from the underlying growth patterns imposed by season, leaf production and starch reserves of X. preissii were compared between plants from unburnt sites and those burnt in spring and autumn. Immediately following fire, X. preissii responded with accelerated leaf production, regardless of season. Rapid leaf accumulation during the initial flush of growth was partly at the expense of starch reserves in the stem. Although this initial flush was relatively short-lived (12 - 32 weeks), the effect of fire on leaf production was sustained for much longer (up to 19 months). Mean maximum leaf production rate was higher for spring-burnt grasstrees (up to 6. 1 leaves/d) than those burnt in autumn (up to 4. 5 leaves/d), due to optimum growing conditions in late spring/early summer. Similarly, the timing of autumn burns in relation to declining temperatures with the approach of winter appeared to dictate how rapidly grasstrees resprouted. These consequences of fire season may have implications for the reproductive success of X. preissii, reflected in the greater mean spike mass of spring-burnt grasstrees (1. 19 kg) than those burnt in autumn (0. 78 kg). Leaf and spike growth, starch reserves and the effect of restricting light to reproductive plants on spike elongation were assessed. The emergence of the spike from within the plant's apex triggers a reduction in leaf production of up to 4. 6 times that of a vegetative grasstree that is sustained until seed release 4. 5 - 5 months later. Jarrah forest grasstrees experienced the largest trade-off in leaf production (7 % lower leaf production than grasstrees in banksia woodland), and produced the shortest mature inflorescences (50 % of banksia woodland grasstree inflorescences), suggesting a constraint imposed by resource availability in this habitat. During the period from inflorescence elongation to seed release starch reserves were depleted. Experimentation in the banksia woodland revealed that, although the developing spike is itself photosynthetic, it is the daily production of photosynthates by the surrounding foliage that contributes most significantly to its growth. When light was prevented from reaching the leaves the starch stored within the stem was not a sufficient substitute, evidenced by a significant reduction in spike biomass of 41 %. A fire simulation experiment with a factorial design was used to assess three factors considered important for postfire grasstree leaf growth in banksia woodland: water, ash and shade. While results identified that ash and <b>reduced</b> <b>shade</b> significantly affect leaf growth, their effects were small compared with the stimulation derived solely from leaf removal by fire, simulated in this experiment by clipping. Clipping, also used to simulate herbivory, was imposed on a series of grasstrees at different frequencies. X. preissii demonstrated a strong capacity to recover in both jarrah forest and banksia woodland, even after clipping every month for 16 months. Starch reserves were depleted as the result of clipping, providing a cause of the eventual deterioration of grasstree 'health' associated with chronic herbivory. The similarity of growth responses to leaf removal independent of the mechanism (eg. fire or herbivory), provided reason to question the interpretation that grasstrees are essentially adapted to fire, rather than the alternative, that they are adapted to herbivory...|$|E

It {{can be thought of}} as a generalization of multisample antialiasing (MSAA) to support complex and dynamic mappings from visibility to shading samples, as introduced by motion and defocus blur and adaptive shading. It works by defining a many-to-one hash from visibility to shading samples, and using a buffer to memoize shading samples and exploit reuse across visibility samples. Decoupled sampling is inspired by the Reyes rendering architecture, but like traditional graphics pipelines, it shades fragments rather than micropolygon vertices, decoupling shading from the geometry sampling rate. Also unlike Reyes, decoupled sampling only shades fragments after precise computation of visibility, reducing overshading. We present extensions of two modern graphics pipelines to support decoupled sampling: a GPU-style sort-last fragment architecture, and a Larrabee-style sort-middle pipeline.

Our architecture introduces different mechanisms for programmable control of the shading rate, which enables efficient shading in several scenarios, e. g., rendering for high pixel den-sity displays, foveated rendering, and adaptive shading for motion and defocus blur. We also support shading at multiple rates in a single pass, which allows the user to compute different shading terms at rates better matching their frequency content...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the project “MASSE”, which focused on the research and development of technologies and process sequences for mass production of 20 % efficient monocrystalline p-type silicon solar cells. This goal is addressed by the use of PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell) and MWT-PERC (metal wrap through PERC) structures. Within the frame of the project, several technologies have been investigated in detail and optimised carefully. The various technologies are modular, which allows for an application both in PERC and MWT-PERC structures. We propose the use of thermal oxidation for simultaneous high quality front and rear surface passivation. On high-quality float-zone silicon, which we use for determining the efficiency potential of these structures, the best PERC solar cells achieve a conversion efficiency of 20. 0 %; <b>reduced</b> <b>shading</b> in MWTPERC type devices increases this value to 20. 3 %. In both cases, screen printing forms the front and rear contacts. The implementation of dispensed silver front contacts in MWT-PERC structures increases the maximum cell efficiency even further to 20. 6 %. Solder pads enable module assembly with existing equipment. By using rectangular masks for aperture area definition, conversion efficiencies of 17. 7 % for PERC and 18. 2 % for MWT-PERC modules are measured...|$|R

Irradiance was the most important factor to influence P(N), leaf temperature, stomatal conductance (g(s) and transpiration rate (E). Under canopy layer low red-far red ratio <b>reduced</b> P(N). <b>Shade</b> leaves were enriched by Chl b.
