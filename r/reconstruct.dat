5|$|Attempts to <b>reconstruct</b> the uncut {{version of}} Greed without {{use of the}} lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named Greed {{as one of the}} twelve {{greatest}} films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for Greed, which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order to <b>reconstruct</b> the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos to <b>reconstruct</b> the uncut version of Greed, the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E

30|$|<b>Reconstructed</b> 1890 {{basal area}} in ponderosa pine sites {{consisted}} primarily of ponderosa pine (71 % to 100 % of total <b>reconstructed</b> basal area).

5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement.

This work aims at investigating a new methodological concept for a reliable and robust quantification of <b>reconstructed</b> activities in scintigraphic images. ...|$|R
