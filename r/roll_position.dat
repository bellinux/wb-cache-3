The main feature of the system proposed in the paper consists in the compensation of the errors introduced by the deficient dynamics of the hydraulic servo-system used for the <b>rolls</b> <b>positioning,</b> by means of a dynamic compensator that approximates the inverse system of the servo-system. Because the servo-system is considered variant over time, an on-line identification of the servo-system and parameter adapting of the compensator are achieved.

Several eye photographs were recorded every 30 minutes {{during a period}} of 8 hours in which the subject was held in a lateral tilt (60 deg) position. The recorded eye <b>roll</b> <b>position</b> varied to an expected small extent within each test session; this variation about a given mean <b>roll</b> <b>position</b> was similar among the test sessions for all subjects.

Furthermore, the intersessional variation in the mean torsional eye position of the normal subjects was equivalent to that of the labyrinthine-defective subjects who displayed little or no counterrolling. These results suggest that the human counterrolling response is maintained either by essentially nonadapting macular receptors or by extremely fine movements of the head in the gravitational field, such as may have been allowed by the biteboard/headrest restraint system used in this study, which served as an everchanging accelerative stimulus...|$|E

The open loop unstable model of the roll control (or <b>roll</b> <b>position</b> demand) autopilot has been stabilized by using pole placement and state feedback. The non-minimum phase feature of rear controlled missile airframes is analyzed. Actuator dynamics has also been included in this design to make the overall system practically suitable for use. The overall responses of the Roll Control autopilot has been significantly improved over the frequency domain design approach where phase lag & phase lead compensator were used.

40|$|The {{subjective}} visual vertical (SVV) indicates perceived {{direction of}} gravity. Even in healthy human subjects, roll-angle dependent misestimations - roll over-compensation (A-effect, head-roll> 60 °&< 135 °) and under-compensation (E-effect, head-roll< 60 °) - occur. Previously, we demonstrated that, after prolonged roll-tilt, SVV estimates when upright are biased towards the preceding <b>roll</b> <b>position,</b> {{which indicates that}} perceived vertical (PV) is shifted by the prior tilt. Hypothetically, PV in any <b>roll</b> <b>position</b> could be biased towards the previous <b>roll</b> <b>position.</b> We asked whether such a "global" bias occurs or whether the bias is "local". The SVV of healthy human subjects (N= 9) was measured in nine roll positions (- 120 ° to + 120 °, steps= 30 °) after 5 min of roll-tilt {{in one of two}} adaptation positions (± 90 °) and compared to control trials without adaptation. After adapting, adjustments were shifted significantly (p< 0. 05) towards the previous adaptation position for nearby roll-tilted positions (± 30, ± 60 °) and upright only. We computationally simulated errors based on the sum of a monotonically increasing function (producing roll under-compensation) and a mixture of Gaussian functions (representing roll over-compensation centered around perceived vertical). In combination, the pattern of A- and E-effects could be generated. By shifting the function representing local over-compensation towards the adaptation position, the experimental post-adaptation data could be fitted successfully. We conclude that prolonged roll-tilt locally distorts PV rather than globally shifting it. Short-term adaptation of roll over-compensation may explain these shifts and could reflect the brain's strategy to optimize SVV-estimates around recent roll-positions. Thus, postural stability can be improved by visually-mediated compensatory responses at any sustained body-roll orientation...|$|E
