40|$|We {{explore the}} value and utility of <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> for {{cellular}} users that live in areas of poor or intermittent network coverage. <b>Voice</b> <b>messages</b> {{have the potential to}} be much lower cost than traditional live calls and should work well in areas of intermittent coverage. To explore these questions, we built a prototype cellphone system with <b>voice</b> <b>messaging</b> capability, performed trials with rural Ugandan users, and then conducted focus group discussions to understand their reactions. Overall, we conducted focus groups with 230 participants in ten villages of varying connectivity. We found that <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> were quite popular and uniformly preferred over text messages (SMS) due to their ease of use and the richness of voice. We also found that <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> can mitigate the problems of intermittent connectivity. Finally, we found that, assuming lower cost for messages than live calls, users would use <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> frequently (more than they currently use SMS), but that they would still prefer live calls in some situations. Based on these results, we believe that <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> are an important capability to add to cellular networks in emerging regions, especially for users that live in areas of poor coverage. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} transfer <b>voice</b> <b>message</b> through SMS in GSM network with and without using compression technique and then their results are compared. Generally, SMS is not used to transfer voice because it doesn’t have high bandwidth data service like GPRS, EDGE, and HSDPA. In this paper two approaches are used to transfer voice through SMS. Firstly, <b>voice</b> <b>message</b> is transferred without using compression technique, Secondly; Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) technique is used to compress payload text of SMS. Major functionality of the algorithm is to convert <b>voice</b> <b>message</b> in to characters, than apply compression method on those characters. Finally, set those compressed characters as a payload text of SMS, and transmit it over GSM Network. For testing the proposed method an application is developed using J 2 ME language. We test our application on Nokia N 95 with different <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> up to 360 times...|$|R

They could also prepare and rehearse before asking and answering questions {{in order to reduce the}} anxiety. They could also delete their <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> after posting and re-do it if they were not yet satisfied.|$|R

40|$|Current {{asynchronous}} <b>voice</b> <b>messaging</b> interfaces, like voicemail, fail to {{take advantage}} of our conversational skills. TalkBack restores conversational turn-taking to voicemail retrieval by dividing <b>voice</b> <b>messages</b> into smaller sections based on the most significant silent and filled pauses and pausing after each to record a response. The responses are composed into a reply, alternating with snippets of the original message for context. TalkBack is built into a digital picture frame; the recipient touches a picture of the caller to hear each segment of the message in turn. The minimal interface models synchronous interaction and facilitates asynchronous <b>voice</b> <b>messaging.</b> TalkBack can also present a voice-annotated slide show which it receives over the Internet...|$|R
