25|$|The Georgian {{railways}} {{represent an}} important transport artery for the Caucasus {{as they make}} up the largest proportion of a route linking the Black and Caspian Seas, this in turn has allowed them to benefit in recent years from increased energy exports from neighbouring Azerbaijan to the European Union, Ukraine and Turkey. Passenger services are operated by the state-owned Georgian Railways whilst freight operations are carried out {{by a number of}} licensed operators. Since 2004 the Georgian Railways have been undergoing a <b>rolling</b> <b>program</b> of fleet-renewal and managerial restructuring which is aimed at making the service provided more efficient and comfortable for passengers. Infrastructural development has also been high on the agenda for the railways, with the key Tbilisi railway junction expected to undergo major reorganisation in the near future. Additional projects also include the construction of the economically important Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway, which was opened on October the 30th, 2017 and connects much of the Caucasus with Turkey by standard gauge railway.|$|E

ESPN follows a similar format by running its flagship newscast, SportsCenter, throughout the daytime hours.

5000|$|Commercial paper - {{though a}} {{short-term}} obligation - is issued {{as part of}} a continuous significantly longer <b>rolling</b> <b>program,</b> which is either a number of years long (as in Europe), or open-ended (as in the U.S.). [...] Because the continuous commercial paper program is much longer than the individual commercial paper in the program (which cannot be longer than 270 days), as commercial paper matures it is replaced with newly issued commercial paper for the remaining amount of the obligation. If the maturity is less than 270 days, the issuer does not have to file a registrations statement with the SEC, which would mean delay and increased cost.|$|E

5000|$|Jeremy Corbyn became {{leader of}} the Labour Party in September 2015. Renationalisation {{had been one of}} Corbyn's key pledges during his 2015 {{leadership}} election and upon its formal adoption at the subsequent Labour Party conference, Corbyn told the audience [...] "We will be running our railways in the interests of passengers and taxpayers." [...] According to The Guardian, its adoption as official party policy had been a significant boost for Corbyn, who had suffered a series of setbacks over the European Union and the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent. It stated Corbyn believed this showed that policies which had once been dismissed as leftwing, could be [...] "hugely popular among mainstream voters". The specific policy called for a <b>rolling</b> <b>program</b> of renationalisation, with franchises taken back into public control as and when they {{reached the end of the}} term, leading to the prediction of a third of passenger franchises being publicly owned by the end of Corbyn's first full term, if he had won the general election which was at the time scheduled to be held in 2020, but was later brought forward to 2017.|$|E

5000|$|The German army, {{mindful of}} the {{steadily}} increasing proportion of spending going to the navy, demanded an increase of 136,000 men to bring its size closer to that of France. In February 1912 the British war minister, Viscount Haldane, came to Berlin to discuss possible limits to naval expansion. Meanwhile, in Britain, the First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill made a speech describing the German navy as a 'luxury', which was considered an insult when reported in Germany. The talks came to nothing, ending in recriminations over who had offered what. Bethmann-Hollweg argued for a guaranteed proportion of expenditure for the army, but failed when army officers refused to support him publicly. Tirpitz argued for six new capital ships, and got three, together with 15,000 additional sailors in a new combined military budget passed in April 1912. The new ships, together with the existing reserve flagship and four reserve battleships were to become one new squadron for the High Seas Fleet. In all the fleet would have five squadrons of eight battleships, twelve large cruisers and thirty small, plus additional cruisers for overseas duties. Tirpitz intended that with the <b>rolling</b> <b>program</b> of replacements, the existing coastal defence squadron of old ships would become a sixth fleet squadron, while the eight existing battle-cruisers would be joined by eight more as replacements for the large cruisers presently in the overseas squadrons. The plan envisaged a main fleet of 100,000 men, 49 battleships and 28 battlecruisers by 1920. The Kaiser commented of the British, [...] "... we have them up against the wall." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{influential}} parameters affecting the work roll wear are investigated. Essential theories related to work roll wear predictions are explained. The wear profile prediction after a <b>rolling</b> <b>program</b> {{is related to}} the material tonnage rolled. The roll barrel was divided into a number of equal segments and for each segment, the passed tonnage is obtained according to the whole tonnages and the widths of the strip in a <b>rolling</b> <b>program.</b> This is used as the input data for the neural network training while the output is the quantity of wear for each segment. A large number of experimental results were acquired from the roll surface graphs in the grinding machine of the roll shop unit in a steel company and the training is performed using the real work roll wear graphs. The present model can easily and quickly predict the roll wear. Predicted wear graphs are found to be in good agreement with the industrial measured values...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGreen {{industry}} {{is becoming a}} hot issue all over the world. The basic principles of it are to minimize resources and emissions. Several developed and developing countries have obligated the implementation of green industry. Indonesian government also strives to implement the green industry principles by adding green industrial standards through the Act No. 3 / 2014. To support the implementation of that Act, Indonesian government through the Ministry of Industry has published the guideline for implementing green industry. In response to that Act, Surabaya City Government, that has successfully reduced carbon emission by green and clean initiatives in housing, kampong, and open space, tries to select some medium enterprises to implement the green industry principles in their companies. The selected companies will be provided technical assistance to fully implement the green standards, thus become the pilot projects in Surabaya. It is expected {{that the success of}} those selected companies will trigger other companies to implement the green principles as well. In Indonesian context, the role of examples is proven in successfully <b>rolling</b> <b>programs.</b> Therefore the selection process of potential medium companies to be the pilot projects becomes the critical step in implementing the program. This paper will present the processes and the findings of the top-down selection done by Surabaya Council of Trade and Industry together with ITS Team. The top-down selection consists of criteria setting, Analytical Network Process (ANP) modeling, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Idea Solution (TOPSIS) processing. Workshops and industrial visits are also the part of the selection processes. The effectiveness of the top-down approach will be discussed and lesson learnt will be highlighted. Furthermore, better approaches will be proposed. This paper will provide insights and serve as a good reference for other cities that want to implement the same program in the future...|$|R
