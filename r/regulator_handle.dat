40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to measure the}} effect on financial markets of two important regulatory events in the British telecommunications and gas industries namely the 1991 Duopoly Review and the 1996 Transco Price Review. These events were chosen because {{it is widely believed}} that the individual industry <b>regulators</b> <b>handled</b> them very differently. The expected volatility of the share returns for these two companies is modelled as an ARCH representaion and it is found that the conditional variance of share returns in British Gas was higher after the Transco Price Review. The share returns of British Telecommunications exhibit a lower expected volatility. It is concluded that these results support the contention that the high level of discretion accorded to British regulators may increase the cost of capital for regulated firms. ...|$|R

40|$|Taming linear-regulator inrush {{currents}} Many older linear regulators and some regulators {{specifically designed for}} fast start-up require signif-icant inrush current at start-up to charge their output capac itors and to provide current to their resistive loads. The relation ship IInrush = COUT × VOUT/tRise predicts the regulator’s required input current at start-up for a given rise time, tRise, where COUT is the regulator’s output capacitance. With no inrush-control (commonly called “soft-start”) circuitry, IInrush is clamped to the regulator’s current limit, which is typically {{significantly higher than the}} regulator’s rated current. If the input power supply is current-limited or connected by long inductive traces, the voltage at the regulator’s input will droop, possibly below that of the regulator’s under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. Figure 1 illustrates how this causes the regulator to “stair step ” or ratchet its way up to regulation, shutting down momentarily while the input capacitor recharges, then starting up again. In the past, start-up problems were common for linear regulators and can still occur when the output capacitance seen by the regulator is large. End-equipment designers need to take into account how linear <b>regulators</b> <b>handle</b> inrush current, especially if the selected regulator has no inrush-current control other than clamping to its current limit. Additional circuitry can be configured to manage inrush current for any regulator or converter. Simply by adding a FET and some passive elements following the regulator’s or converter’s output voltage, the designer can shape the FET’s turn-on characteristic and the output-voltage wave-form. For example, a designer has minimal control ove...|$|R

To investigate whether renal synthesis of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is influenced in diabetes, we measured renal ANP mRNA levels, urine volume, urinary ANP and sodium excretion rates in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. By using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern blot analysis, we found that renal cortical and outer medullary ANP mRNA levels in untreated diabetic rats were markedly increased {{as early as the}} second day after the onset of hyperglycemia and remained elevated for the entire 42 -day study period. Plasma ANP concentrations in untreated diabetic rats were increased on the 42 nd day, whereas plasma renin activity were suppressed. The urine volume, urinary ANP and sodium excretion rates in untreated diabetic rats were also significantly elevated on the second day and remained elevated for the entire 42 -day study period. Urinary ANP excretion rates were well correlated with urine volume, and urinary sodium excretion rate in normal rats and diabetic rats on days 2, 4, 7, 14 and 42.

40|$|Abstract. For widely-used {{interactive}} communication, it {{is essential}} that traffic is kept as smooth as possible; the smoothness of a traffic is typically captured by its delay jitter, i. e., the difference between the maximal and minimal end-to-end delays. The task of minimizing the jitter is done by jitter regulators that use a limited-size buffer in order to shape the traffic. In many real-life situations <b>regulators</b> must <b>handle</b> multiple streams simultaneously and provide low jitter on each of them separately. This paper investigates the problem of minimizing jitter in such an environment, using a fixed-size buffer. We show that the offline version of the problem can be solved in polynomial time, by introducing an efficient offline algorithm that finds a release schedule with optimal jitter. When regulating M streams in the online setting, we take a competitive analysis point of view and note that previous results in [1] can be extended to an online algorithm that uses a buffer of size 2 MB and obtains the optimal jitter possible with a buffer of size B. The question arises whether such a resource augmentation is essential. We answer this question in the affirmative, by proving a lower bound that is tight up to a factor of 2, thus showing that jitter regulation does not scale well as the number of streams increases unless the buffer is sized-up proportionally. ...|$|R

40|$|Synucleins are {{a family}} of {{homologous}} proteins principally known for their involvement in neurodegeneration. γ-Synuclein is highly expressed in human white adipose tissue and increased in obesity. Here we show that γ-synuclein is nutritionally regulated in white adipose tissue whereas its loss partially protects mice from high-fat diet (HFD) –induced obesity and ameliorates some of the associated metabolic complications. Compared with HFD-fed WT mice, HFD-fed γ-synuclein–null mutant mice display increased lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and energy expenditure, and reduced adipocyte hypertrophy. Knockdown of γ-synuclein in adipocytes causes redistribution of the key lipolytic enzyme ATGL to lipid droplets and increases lipolysis. γ-Synuclein–deficient adipocytes also contain fewer SNARE complexes of a type involved in lipid droplet fusion. We hypothesize that γ-synuclein may deliver SNAP- 23 to the SNARE complexes under lipogenic conditions. Via these independent but complementary roles, γ-synuclein may coordinately modulate lipid storage by influencing lipolysis and lipid droplet formation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} admittedly {{different}} for a “Charities Regulation Policy Conference. ” Instead of focusing narrowly on {{the actions of}} nonprofits and foundations, this paper flips the accountability lens to look back more broadly at government actions. It invites conference attendees to take a giant step back to assess how government policymakers (specifically excluding <b>regulators)</b> are <b>handling</b> their responsibilities with respect to community assets known as charitable nonprofits. The traditional one-way lens misses the bigger picture: the public depends on the charitable sector to be healthy enough to provide a reliable social safety net and deliver {{a wide range of}} other services. Yet since the Great Recession began governments have been rapidly shifting massive amounts of their financial burdens onto charitable nonprofits, thereby straining and stretching that safety net to the point of imperiling the health of nonprofits and hurting the public. This purposefully provocative paper documents five hidden-in-plain-sight trends to highlight how individuals and local communities are endangered by an increasing number of governments: 1. Abusing nonprofits in the contracting context, hurting program recipients and taxpayers in the process; 2. Directly taking money away from nonprofit mission; 3. Indirectly taking nonprofit resources by invading nonprofit boardrooms; 4. Abandoning commitments to the public as they eliminate programs and slash funds, expecting charitable nonprofits and foundations to fill the voids governments create; and 5. Draining the philanthropic pool of dollars. Charity regulators have not caused the five dangerous trends, but they can be an instrumental source of solutions. From front-line staff to front-office AGs (standing for “Accomplished Galvanizers” and “Always Glamorous,” as explained below), charity regulators can do their duties of protecting the public in a more holistic way that protects and advances the public interest.

40|$|Synucleins are {{a family}} of homologous, {{predominantly}} neuronal proteins known for their involvement in synaptic transmission and neurodegeneration. γ-synuclein is predominantly localized in axons and presynaptic terminals of selected populations of peripheral and central neurons but is also highly expressed in human white adipose tissue (WAT) and increased in obesity. We have recently shown that γ-synuclein is nutritionally regulated in murine adipocytes while its loss protects mice from high fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. This protection was coupled with increased adipocyte lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and energy expenditure in HFD-fed γ-synuclein-null mutant compared with wild-type mice. Cellular studies suggest that relocalization of ATGL to the lipid droplet in γ-synuclein-deficient adipocytes may contribute to increased lipolysis in these cells. Loss of γ-synuclein in adipocytes also attenuates the assembly of SNARE complexes, {{an important component of}} lipid droplet fusion machinery, possibly due to reduced chaperoning of SNAP- 23 to the assembling SNARE complex by γ-synuclein.

Here we show that γ-synuclein is nutritionally regulated in murine adipocytes and that γ-synuclein deficiency protects mice from high fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity and associated metabolic complications. When compared to HFD-fed wild type mice, HFD-fed γ-synuclein deficient mice display increased lipolysis, lipid oxidation and energy expenditure, and reduced adipocyte hypertrophy. γ-synuclein null adipocytes express more ATGL, a key lipolytic enzyme, and contain fewer SNARE complexes of a type involved in lipid droplet fusion.

40|$|Defective cardiac {{mechanical}} {{activity in}} diabetes results from alterations in intracellular Ca(2 +) handling, in part, {{due to increased}} oxidative stress. Beta-blockers demonstrate marked beneficial effects in heart dysfunction with scavenging free radicals and/or acting as an antioxidant. The {{aim of this study}} was to address how β-blocker timolol-treatment of diabetic rats exerts cardioprotection. Timolol-treatment (12 -week), one-week following diabetes induction, prevented diabetes-induced depressed left ventricular basal contractile activity, prolonged cellular electrical activity, and attenuated the increase in isolated-cardiomyocyte size without hyperglycemic effect. Both in vivo and in vitro timolol-treatment of diabetic cardiomyocytes prevented the altered kinetic parameters of Ca(2 +) transients and reduced Ca(2 +) loading of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), basal intracellular free Ca(2 +) and Zn(2 +) ([Ca(2 +) ]i and [Zn(2 +) ]i), and spatio-temporal properties of the Ca(2 +) sparks, significantly. Timolol also antagonized hyperphosphorylation of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR 2), and significantly restored depleted protein levels of both RyR 2 and calstabin 2. Western blot analysis demonstrated that timolol-treatment also significantly normalized depressed levels of some [Ca(2 +) ]i-handling regulators, such as Na(+) /Ca(2 +) exchanger (NCX) and phospho-phospholamban (pPLN) to PLN ratio. Incubation of diabetic cardiomyocytes with 4 -mM glutathione exerted similar beneficial effects on RyR 2 -macromolecular complex and basal levels of both [Ca(2 +) ]i and [Zn(2 +) ]i, increased intracellular Zn(2 +) hyperphosphorylated RyR 2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Timolol also led to a balanced oxidant/antioxidant level in both heart and circulation and prevented altered cellular redox state of the heart. We thus report, for the first time, that the preventing effect of timolol, directly targeting heart, seems to be associated with a normalization of macromolecular complex of RyR 2 and some Ca(2 +) <b>handling</b> <b>regulators,</b> and prevention of Ca(2 +) leak, and thereby normalization of both [Ca(2 +) ]i and [Zn(2 +) ]i homeostasis in diabetic rat heart, at least in part by controlling the cellular redox status of hyperglycemic cardiomyocytes...|$|R
40|$|As IC {{technology}} {{continues to}} follow the Moore?s Law, IC designers have been constantly challenged with power delivery issues. While useful power must be reliably delivered to the on-die functional circuits to fulfill the desired functionality and performance, additional power overheads arise due to the loss associated with voltage conversion and parasitic resistance in the metal wires. Hence, {{one of the key}} IC power delivery design challenges is to develop voltage conversion/regulation circuits and the corresponding design strategies to provide a guaranteed level of power integrity while achieving high power efficiency and low area overhead. On-chip voltage regulation, a significant ongoing design trend, offers appealing active supply noise suppression close to the loads and is well positioned to address many power delivery challenges. However, to realize the full potential of on-chip voltage regulation requires systemic optimization of and tradeoffs among settling time, steady-state error, power supply noise, power efficiency, stability and area overhead, which are the key focuses of this dissertation. First, we develop new low-dropout voltage regulators (LDOs) that are well optimized for low power applications. To this end, dropout voltage, bias current and speed are important competing design objectives. This dissertation presents new flipped voltage follower (FVF) based topologies of on-chip voltage <b>regulators</b> that <b>handle</b> ultra-fast load transients in nanoseconds while achieving significant improvement on bias current consumption. An active frequency compensation is embedded to achieve high area efficiency by employing a smaller amount of compensation capacitors, the major silicon area contributor. Furthermore, in one of the proposed topologies an auxiliary digital feedback loop is employed in order to lower quiescent power consumption further. Second, coping with supply noise is becoming increasingly more difficult as design complexity grows, which leads to increased spatial and temporal load heterogeneity, and hence larger voltage variations in a given power domain. Addressing this challenge through a distributed methodology wherein multiple voltage regulators are placed across the same voltage domain is particularly promising. This distributive nature allows for even faster suppression of multiple hot spots by the nearby regulators within the power domain and can significantly boost power integrity. Nevertheless, reasoning about the stability of such distributively regulated power networks becomes rather complicated as a result of complex interactions between multiple active regulators and the large passive subnetwork. Coping with this stability challenge requires new theory and stability-ensuring design practice, as targeted by this dissertation. For the first time, we adopt and develop a hybrid stability framework for large power delivery networks with distributed voltage regulation. This framework is local in the sense that both the checking and assurance of network stability can be dealt with on the basis of each individual voltage regulator, leading to feasible design of large power delivery networks that would be computationally impossible otherwise. Accordingly, we propose a new hybrid stability margin concept, examine its tradeoffs with power efficiency, supply noise and silicon area, and demonstrate the resulted key design implications pertaining to new stability-ensuring LDO circuit design techniques and circuit topologies. Finally, we develop an automated hybrid stability design flow that is computationally efficient and provides a practical guarantee of network stability...|$|R

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{environmental}} occurrence of pesticide transformation products is well established, ecotoxicological data for transformation products are often lacking. Therefore, it {{remains an open}} question for <b>regulators</b> how to <b>handle</b> transformation products in the process of authorization and risk assessment. Transformation products may (1) possess a similar mode of toxic action as the parent compound, (2) exhibit unexpected effects towards non-target organisms or (3) contribute to overall mixture toxicity through baseline toxicity even if the specific activity of the parent compound is lost. In the present study, a systematic and integrated approach is presented to differentiate between these three options with the goal of identifying transformation products that significantly add to the risk posed by the parent compound. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and a toxic ratio (TR) analysis were used to evaluate the toxicity and mode of toxic action of the transformation products relative to the parent compound. In addition, mixture toxicity experiments were used as diagnostic tools to underpin the mode of action analysis and to elucidate whether the transformation products possess a similar risk potential as the parent compound. As an illustrative example, the phenylurea herbicide diuron was chosen since a sound basis of ecotoxicological data was available not only for diuron itself but also for most of its transformation products. Effects were investigated using the most sensitive species, algae, and the non-target organism Daphnia magna, for which a previous QSAR-analysis of literature data suggested a specific hazard. In the present study the primary transformation products 1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 3 -methlyurea (DCPMU), 3 -(3 -chlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (MCPDMU), and 1 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) urea (DCPU) were identified as specific toxicants in algae, but as baseline toxicants in daphnids. The subsequent loss of the methylurea group during degradation, which formed 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, led to a clear detoxification in algae but to an increase in toxicity in daphnids. It could be shown that 3, 4 -dichloroaniline acted as baseline toxicant in algae, but showed a specific mode of toxic action in daphnids. Mixture toxicity experiments confirmed this mode of action analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Obesity as a {{cause of}} {{diseases}} like metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease is increasingly becoming a worldwide health problem. Dysfunctional lipid metabolism is a key catalyst for the development of obesity, as impaired triglyceride storage and mobilization (lipolysis) lead to lipotoxicity and cellular stress in white adipose tissue (WAT) and other metabolically active organs. WAT is central to systemic energy metabolism as {{it has the potential to}} adapt to external and internal signals by tightly regulated lipid uptake and removal as well as adipocytokine release. Although it is widely accepted that lipolysis in adipose tissue critically determines lipid turnover and obesity, the molecular mechanisms of WAT lipid handling are largely unknown. In this context, the transcriptional co-factors transducin beta like (TBL) 1 and TBL related (TBLR) 1, that have previously been described as <b>regulators</b> of lipid <b>handling</b> in liver, were investigated to establish co-factor function in adipose tissue triglyceride metabolism. Genetic inactivation of TBLR 1, but not TBL 1, in adipocytes increases triglyceride content of these cells by inhibiting lipolysis at the level of gene transcription. Gene expression profiling revealed an involvement of adipocyte TBLR 1 in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and adipocytokine signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways. Indeed, TBLR 1 interacts with PPARγ and RXR, and treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone partly reverses the effects of TBLR 1 knockdown on triglyceride hydrolysis. Consistent with its role as a transcriptional co-factor TBLR 1 regulates gene expression of the key lipases involved in lipolysis, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Apart from that, TBLR 1 also influences hormone-stimulated activation of lipid breakdown by interfering with the activating adrenoceptor-cAMP-PKA axis at the level of receptor expression. Adipocyte specific deletion of TBLR 1 in mice leads to increased body weight and adiposity, adipocyte hypertrophy, as well as impaired lipid mobilization in fasting. Consistent with the finding that impaired lipolysis favors the development of obesity, body weight and adiposity increase in the adipocyte specific TBLR 1 knockout (ATKO) mice with proceeding age. When fed a high fat diet, ATKO mice gain more weight and body fat than their wild type littermates, are less glucose tolerant and insulin sensitive and show increased signs of adiposity, namely adipocyte hypertrophy and increased adipocytokine release. Importantly, TBLR 1 levels in white adipose tissue increase in states with high lipolytic activity like fasting and obesity in both mice and human patients and correlate with serum parameters and adrenoceptor expression. In summary, TBLR 1 expression is activated in situations with augmented lipid mobilization and required for efficient triglyceride breakdown in adipocytes. Thus, manipulating TBLR 1 levels in adipocytes may represent a future perspective to treat metabolic diseases like obesity or metabolic syndrome...|$|R
