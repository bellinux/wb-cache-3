40|$|In many fungi, {{transcriptional}} {{responses to}} alkaline pH are mediated by conserved signal transduction machinery. In the homologous system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the zinc-finger transcription factor <b>Rim</b> 101 is activated under alkaline conditions to regulate transcription of target genes. The activation of <b>Rim</b> 101 is exerted through proteolytic processing of its C-terminal inhibitory domain. Regulated processing of <b>Rim</b> 101 requires several proteins, including the calpain-like protease <b>Rim</b> 13 /Cpl 1, a putative protease scaffold <b>Rim</b> 20, putative transmembrane proteins <b>Rim</b> 9, and <b>Rim</b> 21 /Pal 2, and <b>Rim</b> 8 /Pal 3 of unknown biochemical function. To identify new regulatory components and thereby determine {{the order of}} action among the components in the pathway, we screened for suppressors of <b>rim</b> 9 Δ and <b>rim</b> 21 Δ mutations. Three identified suppressors—did 4 /vps 2, vps 24, and vps 4 —all belonged to “class E” vps mutants, which are commonly defective in multivesicular body sorting.

40|$|Growth and {{differentiation}} of Candida albicans over a broad pH range underlie {{its ability to}} infect an array of tissues in susceptible hosts. We identified C. albicans <b>RIM</b> 101, <b>RIM</b> 20, and <b>RIM</b> 8 based on their homology to components of the one known fungal pH response pathway. PCR product-disruption mutations in each gene cause defects in three responses to alkaline pH: filamentation, induction of PRA 1 and PHR 1, and repression of PHR 2. We find that <b>RIM</b> 101 itself is an alkaline-induced gene that also depends on <b>Rim</b> 20 p and <b>Rim</b> 8 p for induction. Two observations indicate that a novel pH response pathway also exists. First, PHR 2 becomes an alkaline-induced gene {{in the absence of}} <b>Rim</b> 101 p, <b>Rim</b> 20 p, or <b>Rim</b> 8 p. Second, we created strains in which <b>Rim</b> 101 p activity is independent of <b>Rim</b> 20 p and <b>Rim</b> 8 p; in these strains, filamentation remains pH dependent.

40|$|Yeast cells contain two Bro 1 domain proteins: Bro 1, {{which is}} {{required}} for endosomal trafficking, and <b>Rim</b> 20, which {{is required for}} the response to the external pH via the <b>Rim</b> 101 pathway. <b>Rim</b> 20 associates with endosomal structures under alkaline growth conditions, when it promotes activation of <b>Rim</b> 101 through proteolytic cleavage. We report here that the pH-dependent localization of <b>Rim</b> 20 is contingent on the amount of Bro 1 in the cell. Cells that lack Bro 1 have increased endosomal <b>Rim</b> 20 -green fluorescent protein (GFP) under acidic conditions; cells that overexpress Bro 1 have reduced endosomal <b>Rim</b> 20 -GFP under acidic or alkaline conditions. The novel endosomal association of <b>Rim</b> 20 -GFP in the absence of Bro 1 requires ESCRT components including Vps 27 but not specific <b>Rim</b> 101 pathway components such as Dfg 16.

40|$|Meiosis and spore {{formation}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased expression of sporulation-specific genes. One of these genes, IME 2, encodes a putative protein kinase that is a positive regulator of other sporulation-specific genes. We have isolated mutations that cause reduced expression of an ime 2 -lacZ fusion gene. We found mutations in IME 1, a known positive regulator of IME 2, and MCK 1, a known positive regulator of IME 1. We also isolated recessive mutations in 12 other genes, which we designate <b>RIM</b> (Regulator of IME 2) genes. Our analysis indicates that the defects in <b>rim</b> 1, <b>rim</b> 8, <b>rim</b> 9 and <b>rim</b> 13 mutants are a consequence of diminished IME 1 expression and can be suppressed by expression of IME 1 from the heterologous ACT 1 promoter. These <b>rim</b> mutations also reduced expression of an ime 1 -HIS 3 fusion, in which the HIS 3 gene is expressed from the IME 1 promoter, and caused reduced levels of IME 1 RNA. Although the <b>rim</b> 1, <b>rim</b> 8, <b>rim</b> 9 and <b>rim</b> 13 mutant phenotypes {{are similar to those}} of mck 1 mutants, we found that the defects in ime 2 -lacZ expression and sporulation of the mck 1 <b>rim</b> double mutants were more severe than either single mutant.

In this report, we have determined the relationship between <b>RIM</b> 1 and the other genes, <b>RIM</b> 8, 9, and 13, in this group. We have analyzed production of epitope-tagged <b>Rim</b> 1 p derivatives with HA epitopes at the N-terminus or {{in the middle of}} the protein. These <b>Rim</b> 1 p derivatives exist primarily as a small form (90 kD for <b>Rim</b> 1 -HA 2 p) in wild-type cells and as a large form (98 kD for <b>Rim</b> 1 -HA 2 p) in <b>rim</b> 8, 9, and 13 mutants. We have also analyzed production of β-galactosidase in strains that express a <b>RIM</b> 1 -lacZ fusion gene. β-galactosidase exists primarily as a ~ 130 kD form in wild-type cells and as a ~ 190 kD form in <b>rim</b> 9 mutants. These results indicate that <b>Rim</b> 1 p undergoes C-terminal proteolytic cleavage, and that <b>rim</b> 8, 9, and 13 mutations block cleavage.

We report the sequence of <b>RIM</b> 1 and functional analysis of its coding region. The <b>RIM</b> 1 gene product (<b>RIM</b> 1) contains three regions similar to C 2 H 2 zinc fingers. Serine substitutions for cysteine in each of the putative zinc fingers abolish <b>RIM</b> 1 function. The carboxyl-terminus of <b>RIM</b> 1 is enriched in acidic amino acids and is required for full <b>RIM</b> 1 activity. <b>RIM</b> 1 also contains two putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) phosphorylation sites. At one site, substitution of alanine for serine does not affect <b>RIM</b> 1 activity; at the other site, this substitution impairs activity. This analysis of <b>RIM</b> 1 suggests that the protein may function as a transcriptional activator. We have used the cloned <b>RIM</b> 1 gene to create a complete <b>rim</b> 1 deletion. This null allele, like previously isolated <b>rim</b> 1 mutations, causes a partial meiotic defect. In addition to <b>RIM</b> 1, maximum IME 1 expression requires the MCK 1 and IME 4 gene products.

In this work, we investigated the localization, physical interaction, and interrelationship of <b>Rim</b> 21, Dfg 16, and <b>Rim</b> 9. These proteins were found to form a complex and to localize to the plasma membrane in a patchy and mutually-dependent manner. Their cellular level was also mutually dependent.

A light breeze stirred her hair from the side, and for the space of one deep breath she turned her head and followed it around until she met it full-faced.|$|E
50|$|The inner <b>rim</b> is sanded and {{polished}} {{as well as}} the outer <b>rim.</b> The inner <b>rim</b> fits inside the basket and the outer <b>rim</b> fits on the outside. Every third stave a brass escutcheon pin (basically a small nail) is driven through the outer <b>rim,</b> through the stave and into the inner <b>rim.</b> The tops of the staves are then all trimmed flush with the <b>rim</b> and a piece of rattan is used to lash the two together. As the lasher goes around another strip of rattan is used to cover the gap between the inner and outer <b>rims.</b> The lasher can go around twice to get a cross-lashed effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{cross-section}} of a <b>rim</b> {{can have a}} wide range of geometry, each optimized for particular performance goals. Aerodynamics, mass and inertia, stiffness, durability, tubeless tire compatibility, brake compatibility, and cost are all considerations. If the part of the {{cross-section of}} the <b>rim</b> is hollow where the spokes attached, as in the Sprint <b>rim</b> pictured, it is described as box-section or double-wall to distinguish it from single-wall <b>rims</b> such as the Westwood <b>rim</b> pictured. The double wall can make the <b>rim</b> stiffer. Triple-wall <b>rims</b> have additional reinforcement inside the box-section.|$|R
40|$|The <b>RIM</b> 101 pathway of Candida albicans {{signals the}} {{expression}} of fungal genes involved in adaptation and morphogenesis. Fungal mutants lacking <b>Rim</b> 8 p, <b>Rim</b> 13 p, <b>Rim</b> 20 p, or <b>Rim</b> 101 p or the downstream cell-wall protein Phr 1 p, showed that this pH-responsive pathway contributes to the pathogenicity of C. albicans for the cornea...|$|R
