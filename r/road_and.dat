The relationship between <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> rural buildings and their effects on Dongzhi Yuan are discussed also. The results showed that three environmental factors (topography, land cover, and development level) explained roads better than rural buildings referring densities and patterns. The environmental variables significantly related to roads have decreased, whereas those related to rural buildings have increased over time. Among these significant variables, percent of farmland mostly determined the densities and patterns of both <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> rural buildings. There was significant correlation between <b>roads</b> <b>and</b> rural buildings in terms of density and pattern.
