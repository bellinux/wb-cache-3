The <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> calculates the disturbance compensation based on the torque motor current and the angular rate measured real-time by the current detection circuit and the frame angular detection circuit in the gimbal servo system, then feedbacks to the frame servo system controller to regulating the torque motor output current. 500 Hz and 50 Hz sinusoidal disturbance torque are introduced into the system to test the role of the <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor.</b> The result proves the <b>interference</b> <b>suppressor</b> has the same significant inhibition of effect for disturbance torque of different frequencies by MATLAB simulating framework output angular rate waveform...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Radio {{interference}} {{should be}} taken into account to assign time slots to links in time division multiple access (TDMA) -based wireless mesh networks. In many graph theory-based time slot assignment algorithms, the protocol interference model is widely used to obtain <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> information, although this model is considered to be inaccurate when compared with actual <b>radio</b> <b>interference.</b> On the other hand, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio model (SINR model) is a well-known and accurate model of <b>radio</b> <b>interference.</b> However, the SINR model requires time slot information to obtain <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> relationship, and thus it is difficult to apply the SINR model to graph theory-based time slot assignment algorithms. In this paper, we extend the protocol interference model to represent <b>radio</b> <b>interference</b> more accu-rately for wireless mesh networks. To do this, we adjust the interference ratio parameter of the protocol interference model by considering SINR. We propose three methods for adjusting this parameter. Through simulation, it is shown that higher accuracy of the protocol interference model can be achieved by adjusting the interference ratio parameter for each node. Keywords-wireless mesh networks, protocol interference model, signal-to-plus-noise-ratio model, time slot assignment. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ad hoc {{wireless}} {{networks have}} enormous commercial and military potential {{because of their}} self-organizing capacity and mobility support. However, some specificities of these net-works such as <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> and limited resources make more complex the quality of service (QoS) support. Indeed, on the one hand, the bandwidth offered to users is strongly affected by <b>radio</b> <b>interferences.</b> On the other hand, flooding information in such a network must be optimized {{in order to save}} resources. Therefore, we propose in this paper, a solution taking into account <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> in mobile ad hoc network routing and optimizing flooding. This solution is based on {{a modified version of the}} OLSR routing protocol that considers bandwidth requests and <b>radio</b> <b>interferences</b> in the route selection process while providing a very efficient flooding. A comparative performance evaluation based on NS simulations shows that despite the overhead due to QoS management, this solution outperforms classical OLSR in terms of QoS perceived by the users (e. g. bandwidth amount granted to a flow and delivery rate). The efficiency of the optimized flooding is equal to that provided by the native version of OLSR...|$|R

The behavior of the oscillator susceptibility could be characterized with critical features and explained with three response modes. Both the simulated behavior and the proposed response mechanism are confirmed with the measurement results. The conclusion of the paper helps to calibrate oscillator sensors. It is also an important guideline for building analysis model in the design phase of the sensor. ...|$|R
