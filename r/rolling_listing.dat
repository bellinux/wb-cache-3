5000|$|MCP and COS {{were always}} type 2 tasks. The {{computer}} operator {{would see a}} count {{of the number of}} tasks within each queue on the system console. A complete list of the task queues was available from any interactive terminal with administrator access via a field-written program known as [...] "Stat200". This program would scan the task queues every few seconds and display a <b>rolling</b> <b>list</b> of tasks on the terminal screen until it was interrupted or terminated. While not an officially released product, it became the defacto standard for task monitoring.|$|R

50|$|Anderson survived three match darts versus John Bowles in {{the second}} round of the 2013 World Championship to win in a {{deciding}} set, but was then comfortably beaten by Raymond van Barneveld 0-4 in 33 minutes as he missed a total of 23 darts at doubles. Because the ranking system works as a two-year <b>rolling</b> <b>list</b> based on prize money earned, Anderson lost the £100,000 from reaching the 2011 World Championship final and dropped to world number 11 after the tournament. Anderson partnered Robert Thornton for the third time at the World Cup of Darts and they were shocked by Spain 4-5 in the last 16. He threw a nine-dart finish in the third UK Open Qualifier during a first round win over Josh Payne, but lost in the following round 5-6 to Michael van Gerwen.|$|R

50|$|Barrett {{finished}} runner-up at the 2015 Bowlmor AMF U.S. Open, defeating three {{opponents in}} the stepladder final before losing to Ryan Ciminelli in the final match, 236-223. In December, 2015, Barrett was the #1 seed for the PBA World Bowling Tour Men's Finals, held in Reno, NV, and defeated Mike Fagan in the final match. The three finalists for this non-title event were chosen and seeded based on a <b>rolling</b> points <b>list</b> of PBA International-World Bowling Tour tournaments held over the previous two years.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2005, the PBA tournament format was {{modified}} {{because of the}} all exempt tour. Non-exempt bowlers bowled {{on the first day}} to determine the additional six (or more) bowlers who qualify for the tournament (on top of the exempt field). The second day consisted of 64 bowlers rolling 14 games (two 7-game blocks) to determine the 32 bowlers who made [...] "match play" [...] on the third day. Seeding of the top 32 was based on a <b>rolling</b> points <b>list</b> of the 20 previous events.|$|R

50|$|No player {{had come}} back to win from six frames or more behind in a World Championship final since Dennis Taylor trailed Steve Davis by 8-0 and later 9-1 in the 1985 final. Selby became the fourth player (after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, and Ronnie O'Sullivan) to {{successfully}} defend the world title in the Crucible era. He also became the third man (after Hendry and Ding Junhui) to win five full ranking titles in a single season, the first man to win the China Open and the world title back-to-back, and the first man to win over £1m across the two-year <b>rolling</b> money <b>list.</b> Higgins went back to world number two {{as a result of his}} run to the final.|$|R
50|$|For {{a second}} {{straight}} year, the PBA will keep a <b>rolling</b> points <b>list</b> {{for all of the}} season's Xtra Frame tournaments (so designated because they are broadcast start-to-finish on the PBA's Xtra Frame subscription webcast service). Last season, a $10,000 winner-take-all bonus was awarded to the top points earner in the series. For 2017, the Xtra Frame series has been renamed the XF PBA Tour Storm Cup, with Storm Bowling sponsoring an expanded award platform. The top points earner in 2017 will win a $20,000 bonus, with additional payouts for second through fifth-place finishers ($10,000, $8,000, $7,000 and $5,000). Eight tour stops make up the Storm Cup series. Two additional tournaments (DHC PBA Japan Invitational and PBA-PWBA Striking Against Breast Cancer Mixed Doubles) are also covered exclusively by Xtra Frame, but do not qualify for Xtra Frame series points.|$|R
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly {{commented on}} the {{original}} news that several characters would be leaving the cast when they graduate, and said, [...] "Indeed, a <b>rolling</b> cast <b>list</b> has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on Friday Night Lights, which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, {{but it was a}} well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood didn't try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished: a seamless, realistic transition. The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glee strong points, {{which is not to say}} they couldn't be. But the question is: Is Glee looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of Friday Night Lights... or Saved By the Bell: The New Class?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{international}} tour stops, {{which are}} part of the World Bowling Tour (WBT), were again part of the PBA schedule. As in 2015, a PBA title was awarded for any qualifying WBT tournaments won by a PBA member. For the second straight season, some tournaments formerly consigned as PBA Regional Tour stops now qualified the winner to earn a PBA title in addition to a minimum $10,000 top prize for each event. These nine tour stops were designated as [...] "Xtra Frame" [...] tournaments, because they are broadcast exclusively (start-to-finish) on the PBA's Xtra Frame webcast service. For 2016, the Xtra Frame series had a <b>rolling</b> points <b>list,</b> with a $10,000 bonus given to the player with the most points after all eight Xtra Frame singles events were completed. (Note: The Xtra Frame series was shortened to seven singles events when the PBA Xtra Frame Tamarac Classic in Florida was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew.) Tommy Jones was the bonus winner with 89 points, surpassing E. J. Tackett (84 points) in the final Xtra Frame event of the season.|$|R
2500|$|McQueen, Newman, and William Holden {{all wanted}} top billing. Holden was refused, his {{long-term}} standing as a box office draw having been eclipsed by both McQueen and Newman. To provide dual top billing, the credits were arranged diagonally, with McQueen lower left and Newman upper right. Thus, each {{appeared to have}} [...] "first" [...] billing {{depending on whether the}} credit was read left-to-right or top-to-bottom, the first of countless times in which billing would be displayed this way in films. McQueen is mentioned first in the film's trailers. In the cast <b>list</b> <b>rolling</b> from top to bottom at the film's end, however, McQueen and Newman's names were arranged diagonally as at the beginning; as a consequence, Newman's name is fully visible first there.|$|R

Playing Joe Perry in the second round, O'Sullivan was behind {{for the first two}} sessions, but {{recovered}} to win the match 13–11. Up against Shaun Murphy in the 16th World Championship quarter-final of his career, O'Sullivan took 13 of the last 14 frames to win the match 13–3, with a session to spare. He defeated Barry Hawkins 17–7 in the semi-finals, also with a session to spare, to reach his sixth World Championship final. Facing Mark Selby in the final, O'Sullivan began strongly, taking a 10–5 lead, but lost 10 of the next 12 frames to trail 12–15. He went on to lose 14–18, his first ever defeat in a World Championship final. At around 1:30a.m., on their way home from the final, O'Sullivan and his six-year-old son were involved in a car crash. Neither O'Sullivan nor his son were injured. After the World Championship, a new ranking system took effect, based on a two-year <b>rolling</b> prize money <b>list</b> rather than ranking points. This meant that O'Sullivan ended the season ranked number 4.|$|R
50|$|When the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement expired, Jackson {{became a}} Restricted Free Agent for an {{additional}} year, causing the Chargers to place a one-year, $3.2 million tender on him. Seeking a long-term deal instead, Jackson held out of training camp. On June 15, 2010, the Chargers cut his tender to $583,000, 110% of his salary for the 2009 NFL season.On August 20, 2010, the Chargers placed him on the Roster Exempt List, meaning {{that he would have}} to serve a 3-game suspension once he had agreed to a contract.The National Football League Players Association arranged a deal in which if Jackson was traded by the Chargers by 4 PM on September 22, he would have instead been placed on the Commissioner Exempt <b>List,</b> <b>rolling</b> 6 games of suspensions (3 for pleading guilty to drunk driving and 3 for being placed on the roster exempt list) into 4. No deal materialized. The agreement also stipulated that he could be traded two days before the NFL trade deadline, but once again no deal materialized in that time. On October 29, 2010, Jackson ended his hold-out and signed the one-year tender. The deadline to sign and accrue a full season, so that he would be an unrestricted free agent in 2011, was October 30, 2010.|$|R

Neither O'Sullivan nor his son were injured. After the World Championship, a new ranking system took effect, based on a two-year <b>rolling</b> prize money <b>list</b> rather than ranking points.
