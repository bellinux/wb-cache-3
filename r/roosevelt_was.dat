5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 13, Roosevelt's body {{was placed in a}} flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train. After a White House funeral on April 14, <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> transported back to Hyde Park by train, guarded by four servicemen, one each from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. As was his wish, <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> buried in the Rose Garden of the Springwood estate, the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April 15. Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to him.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> {{an ardent}} conservationist, {{assisted}} in this by like-minded appointees, including Interior Secretary James R. Garfield and Chief Forester Gifford Pinchot. Taft {{agreed with the}} need for conservation, but felt it should be accomplished by legislation rather than executive order. He did not retain Garfield, an Ohioan, as secretary, choosing instead a westerner, former Seattle mayor Richard A. Ballinger. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> surprised at the replacement, believing that Taft had promised to keep Garfield, and this change was one of the events that caused Roosevelt to realize that Taft would choose different policies.|$|E

5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, {{a member of the}} ACLU.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} {{during the height of}} the nature fakers controversy, and it has been suggested that De Esque elected to release Betelguese, a Trip Through Hell while Theodore <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> on a trip to Africa in an effort to avoid potential conflict that might have resulted from Roosevelt's awareness of its content.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's mother, Sara Delano <b>Roosevelt,</b> <b>was</b> adamantly {{against the}} idea of divorce, however, as it would {{mark the end of}} Franklin's {{political}} career; she stated that she would cut him off from the family fortune if he chose to do so. Historians have also debated whether, as a Roman Catholic, Mercer would have been willing to marry a divorced man. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook expressed skepticism that this had been a serious obstacle, noting the depth of Mercer's feelings. Persico also doubts that this was a factor, observing that Mercer's mother Minnie had divorced and remarried, and that the family had come to Roman Catholicism only recently.|$|E

5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> convinced that federal activism {{was needed to}} reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Howe began {{raising money}} for the {{campaign}} from Democrats like Henry Morgenthau, Sr. and Joseph P. Kennedy as well as recruiting delegates for the 1932 national convention. Roosevelt's main rival at the convention was Smith, who was seeking his second consecutive nomination. Howe suffered from severe asthma attacks throughout the convention, but remained in telephone contact with Rooseveltwho was not present, per the custom of the dayand continued to meet with delegates who were brought to visit him. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> nominated by the convention after agreeing to make another rival, John Nance Garner, his vice presidential candidate, and after some of Smith's Tammany Hall supporters, led by William Gibbs McAdoo, began to defect.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Secretary of Commerce, Daniel Roper, {{appointed}} Flanders to the Business Advisory Council, {{which was}} created to provide input to the administration on matters affecting business. The Council then made Flanders chairman of the Committee on Unemployment. This committee recommended addressing the problem both geographically and by industry. Flanders reported, however, that when the committee made its recommendations President <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> preoccupied with augmenting the Supreme Court and ultimately chose the undistributed profits tax instead—a choice that Flanders felt discouraged capital investment.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Indiana Representative Mark Souder {{proposed}} that former president Ronald Reagan, {{who was then}} dying of Alzheimer's disease, replace Roosevelt on the dime once he died, stating that Reagan was as iconic to conservatives as <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> to liberals. Reagan's wife Nancy expressed her opposition, stating that she was certain the former president would not have favored it either. After Ronald Reagan died in 2004, there was support for a design change, but Souder declined to pursue his proposal.|$|E
5|$|In April 1960, <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia soon after {{being struck by}} a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, and she died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on the Upper East Side on November 7, 1962, {{at the age of}} 78. Her daughter Anna took care of Roosevelt when she was terminally ill in 1962. President John F. Kennedy ordered all United States flags lowered to half-staff throughout the world on November 8 in tribute to Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years at the White House, when <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> {{increasingly}} overworked, his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also faced {{with the news that}} Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1921, Howe was vacationing {{with the}} Roosevelts at Campobello Island when Franklin {{began to run}} a high fever and {{reported}} paralysis in his legs. A doctor was sent for, and <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> diagnosed with poliomyelitis. Howe remained by Roosevelt's bedside throughout {{the early days of}} his illness, cheering him up, tending to his needs, and even changing his bedpans. By September of that year, Howe had been formally invited to join the Roosevelt household, and began visiting his own family only on weekends.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) brought light rail planning to the Seattle region. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional light rail system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or underground light rail line through Roosevelt with a station in the neighborhood. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, only funding light rail from the University District to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; an extension north to Northgate via <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be recovering, but took {{a turn for the}} worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when a runner located him to convey the bad news. After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore <b>Roosevelt</b> <b>was</b> a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, {{known for}} his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world, and the animals who {{inhabited}} it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially {{in the name of}} progress. Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding areas together.|$|E
