500|$|In 1994, Selena opened two boutiques called Selena Etc. in Corpus Christi and San Antonio; {{they were}} {{equipped}} with in-house beauty salons. Quintanilla, Jr. thought Saldívar {{was a potential}} candidate to run the businesses because the family would be touring the country. He believed she was the best choice because of her success running the fan club. The family agreed; in January 1994, Saldívar became {{the manager of the}} boutiques. In September 1994, Selena signed Saldívar as her <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> in San Antonio. After being hired to run the boutiques, Saldívar moved from South San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena. In an interview with Primer Impacto in 1995, Quintanilla, Jr. said he [...] "always mistrusted Saldívar", though the family never found anything odd about Saldívar's behavior. Saldívar was authorized to write and cash checks, and had access to bank accounts associated with the fan club and boutiques.|$|E
500|$|The Quintanilla family {{appointed}} Yolanda Saldívar {{as manager}} of Selena's boutiques in early 1994. Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldívar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi {{to be closer to}} Selena. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores had decreased. According to staff members, Saldívar often dismissed employees she personally disliked. Employees at the stores regularly complained about Saldívar's behavior to Selena, who dismissed the claims, believing Saldívar would not negatively impose erratic decisions on Selena's fashion venture. According to Quintanilla, Jr., the staff later turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldívar's behavior. Quintanilla, Jr. took the claims seriously; he told Selena to [...] "be careful" [...] and said Saldívar may not be a good influence. Selena dismissed her father's inquiries because he had often distrusted people in the past. By January 1995, Selena's fashion designer Martin Gomez, her cousin Debra Ramirez, and clients expressed their concerns over Saldívar's behavior and management skills. During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from The Dallas Morning News said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.|$|E

The bill would amend the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act to repeal the contingent conditions under which the National Association of <b>Registered</b> <b>Agents</b> and Brokers (NARAB) shall not be established.

In this new system, however, the insurance company would only have to meet the requirements of their home state and the NARAB (only two entities), not their home state and every other state they wished to operate in (multiple entities).

50|$|For varying reasons a {{business}} entity might {{at some point}} wish to change their <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> to another party after a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> has already been designated. This is accomplished by obtaining a form from {{the secretary of state}} where the business entity is registered, completing said form, and filing it with that state office along with any requisite fees which may vary from state to state. In some cases the required form may simply be a dedicated change of <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> form, and in other cases, such as in Delaware, an actual amendment to the articles of the business entity must be filed.|$|E
5000|$|In United States {{business}} law, a <b>registered</b> <b>agent,</b> {{also known}} as a resident agent or statutory agent, is a business or individual designated to receive service of process (SOP) when a business entity is a party in a legal action such as a lawsuit or summons. The registered agent's address may also be where the state sends the paperwork for the periodic renewal of the business entity's charter (if required). The <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for a business entity may be an officer or employee of the company, or a third party, such as the organization's lawyer or a service company. Failure to properly maintain a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> can affect a company negatively.|$|E

5000|$|In most all cases, the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> for a {{business}} entity is assigned in the formation documents filed in a jurisdiction when the entity is originally created. For example, a person forming a corporation in the State of Nevada or Delaware, would designate the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> along with the agent's address on the articles of incorporation filed with the Nevada Secretary of State or Delaware Secretary of State respectively. If the agent cannot sign the articles to be filed, some states such as Nevada provide that the <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> may be designated using a separate [...] "Registered Agent Acceptance" [...] form with the appropriate acceptance and signature. A representative of the business or the individual accepting responsibility as <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> must sign to accept the responsibility of acting as agent. In most states it is a crime to knowingly file a false document {{with the office of}} the Secretary of State, although the penalties vary widely. For example, in Nevada it is a Class [...] "D" [...] felony to forge this signature, but in Michigan it is only a misdemeanor.|$|E

50|$|If a <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> {{fails to}} perform their function, it can have dire {{consequences}} for the business entity. For example, if a customer fell inside a store and sued the store, and the store's <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> failed to notify the business entity of a summons {{to appear in court}} to respond to the lawsuit, then when the case went to trial, nobody would appear to defend the store and the customer would win by a default judgment. Additionally, the store would likely {{not be able to get}} the judgment overturned on appeal because they had been properly served. This is one of the most common reasons that business entities generally will utilize a third party as their <b>registered</b> <b>agent</b> be it a commercial service company, an attorney, or in some cases, a CPA.|$|E

5000|$|The Model <b>Registered</b> <b>Agents</b> Act (MoRAA) is {{an effort}} spearheaded by the American Bar Association Business Law Section and the International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA) - Business Organization Section (BOS) to {{standardize}} business entity laws {{as they relate to}} annual reports, <b>registered</b> <b>agents</b> and other laws and forms used to file business entities. The act also creates two distinct classes of registered agent: [...] "commercial" [...] and [...] "non-commercial." [...] The National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) organized a drafting committee composed of commissions, ABA, and IACA representatives who drafted the act's language. NCCUSL adopted MoRAA at its 2006 annual meeting. It was amended in 2011.http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Registered%20Agents%20Act,%20Model%20(2006)%20(Last%20Amended%202011) Eleven US jurisdictions (Arkansas, District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) have since adopted the model act, and Delaware did not adopt the act, but did adopt the [...] "commercial registered agent" [...] provision. [...] The problem this effort seeks to alleviate is that disparate laws, filing requirements, and forms in all of the US jurisdictions where business entities are filed creates a quagmire for any company seeking to register to do business in those jurisdictions. By adopting a common set of laws, the Model <b>Registered</b> <b>Agents</b> Act seeks to create a uniform and simple process of filing and maintaining a business entity in any jurisdiction adopting it.|$|R
