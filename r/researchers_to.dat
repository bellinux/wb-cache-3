Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers.

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

5|$|After Sesame Streets first season, {{its critics}} forced its {{producers}} and <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life {{experiences of the}} show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, Sesame Street addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

One of the earliest and most famous examples of this {{was the use of}} egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs could never have known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus {{was widely}} {{distributed}} across western North America. The distribution of Edmontosaurus fossils {{suggests that it}} preferred coasts and coastal plains. It was a herbivore that could move on both two legs and four. Because it is known from several bone beds, Edmontosaurus {{is thought to have}} lived in groups, and may have been migratory as well. The wealth of fossils has allowed <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> study its paleobiology in detail, including its brain, how it may have fed, and its injuries and pathologies, such as evidence for tyrannosaur attacks on a few edmontosaur specimens.|$|E

For instance, inserting calmodulin into {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) allowed <b>researchers</b> <b>to</b> measure the activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split-GFP. Regions of GFP that tolerate the introduction of circular permutation {{are more likely to}} accept the addition of another protein while retaining the function of both proteins.|$|E
