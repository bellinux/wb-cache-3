5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge <b>resection)</b> may be performed. However, wedge <b>resection</b> has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

25|$|Surgical <b>resection</b> {{to remove}} the tumor while {{preserving}} enough remaining healthy liver to maintain normal physiologic function. Surgical removal results in favorable prognosis, but only 10-15% of patients are suitable for surgical <b>resection.</b> This is often because of extensive disease or poor underlying liver function. For example, <b>resection</b> in cirrhotic patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Preoperative evaluation for <b>resection</b> must include imaging of the liver in order to estimate the amount of residual liver remaining after surgery; {{in order to preserve}} normal function, the residual liver volume should be more than 25% of the total size in a non-cirrhotic liver, and more than 40% of the total size for a cirrhotic liver. The overall recurrence rate after <b>resection</b> is 50-60%. The Singapore Liver Cancer Recurrence (SLICER) score can be used to estimate risk of recurrence after surgery.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} surgical procedures {{that can be}} employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending {{on the extent of}} the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel <b>resection,</b> diaphragm stripping or <b>resection,</b> appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{relationship}} between the posterior cortex and cognitive functions is still a relatively open field.

25|$|Diverticulitis surgery {{can be done}} in two ways: {{through a}} primary bowel <b>resection</b> or through a bowel <b>resection</b> with colostomy. Both bowel resections may be done in the {{traditional}} way or by laparoscopic surgery. The traditional bowel <b>resection</b> is made using an open surgical approach, called colectomy. During a colectomy, the patient is placed under general anesthesia. A surgeon performing a colectomy will make a lower midline incision in the abdomen or a lateral lower transverse incision. The diseased section of the large intestine is removed and then the two healthy ends are sewn or stapled back together. A colostomy may be performed when the bowel has to be relieved of its normal digestive work as it heals. A colostomy implies creating a temporary opening of the colon on the skin surface {{and the end of the}} colon is passed through the abdominal wall and a removable bag is attached to it. The waste will be collected in the bag.|$|E

40|$|By Shetlar's method {{the author}} {{estimated}} {{the amount of}} serum polysaccharide in 33 cases with pulmonary tuberculosis {{both before and after}} the pulmonary <b>resections.</b> Patients were composed of 12 with segmental resections; 11 with lobectomy; 5 with pneumonectomy; and 5 with thoracoplasty. At the same time the relationship between blood sedimentation rate and the liver function was studied and the following conclusions were drawn: 1) Prior to pulmonary <b>resections</b> the majority of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show the values of both serum polysaccharide and of the rate of non-glucosamine polysaccharide to serum total protein (N. G. P. /S. T.) within the normal range, but in some of the group, such as ones with lobectomy, thoracoplasty and pneumonectomy, reveal a slight to a moderate increase in these values. 2) In pulmonary tuberculosis the values of serum polysaccharide and N. G. P. /S. T. P. after the operation show a marked transient increase as compared with those before <b>resections.</b> Howevr, decreasing slowly, these values, even in the cases which showed high values prior to the <b>resections,</b> later fall down to the normal level. It required 40 to 50 days to recover to the normal level in the cases with segmental <b>resections,</b> lobectomy, and thoracoplasty, while showing no significant difference among them. In the cases with pneumonectomy the duration of recovery time is markedly prolonged, namely, it requires 90 days after operation. 3) In the cases with complication of empyema the values of serum polysaccharide and N. G. P. /S. T. P., that increased after <b>resections,</b> do not fall for a long period of time, and a certain degree of parallel relationship can be recognized between the progress of disease after <b>resections</b> and the amount of serum polysaccharide. 4) It has been recognized that a quite close relationship exists between the variations of blood sedimentation rate and serum pslysaccharide after pulmonary <b>resections</b> as well ss after thoracoplasty, and that the course of disease after <b>resections</b> has a certain relationship with the blood sedimentation rate. 5) After pulmonary <b>resections</b> and thoracoplasty, no intimate relationship can be observable between the fluctuations in the results of functional liver tests and serum polysaccharide...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Two-stage liver <b>resections</b> with {{portal vein}} {{occlusion}} have become standard {{in patients with}} low volume future liver remnants. Whether they are associated with more complications is unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare complications of one- and two-stage <b>resections</b> in a retrospective study. METHODS: Patients with two-stage right liver <b>resections</b> with a previous portal vein occlusion were compared with patients with one-stage right liver <b>resections</b> between 2002 and 2010. Primary endpoints were the incidence of complications by severity. Secondary endpoints were mortality, post-operative liver- and kidney function tests, length of hospitalization and transfusion events. Logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: The groups were comparable except for right trisectionectomies, pre-operative chemotherapy and underlying liver disease. Overall complications occurred in 25 out of 35 patients with two-stage and 106 out of 163 in one-stage procedures. Severe complications were observed in 47 out of 163 patients versus 9 out of 35 patients, respectively. Two-stage procedures had no increased adjusted risk for complications [relative risk (RR) 0. 9, P = 0. 79]. Mortality (5. 7 % versus 3. 7 %) and post-operative liver failure rates (2. 9 % versus 3. 1 %) were low. Secondary endpoints showed no adjusted differences in risk.

The technique is mostly used in arm edemas after treatment of breast cancer and in unilateral edemas of lower extremities after <b>resection</b> of lymph nodes and radiation. The procedure is less widely used than the other surgical procedures, mainly in Germany. The method was developed in 1980 by Ruediger Baumeister.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSimultaneous {{colorectal}} and hepatic {{surgery for}} colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing as surgery becomes safer and less invasive. There is controversy regarding the morbidity associated with simultaneous, compared with separate or staged, <b>resections.</b> MethodsData for 2005 – 2008 from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) {{were used to}} compare morbidity after 19 [*] 925 colorectal procedures for CRC (CR group), 2295 hepatic <b>resections</b> for metastatic CRC (HEP group), and 314 simultaneous colorectal and hepatic <b>resections</b> (SIM group). ResultsAn increasing number of simultaneous <b>resections</b> were performed per year. Fewer major colorectal and liver <b>resections</b> were performed in the SIM than in the CR and HEP groups. Patients in the SIM group had a longer operative time and postoperative length of stay compared with those in either the CR or HEP groups. Simultaneous procedures resulted in higher rates of postoperative morbidity and major morbidity than CR procedures, but not HEP procedures. This difference was driven by higher rates of wound and organ space infections, and a greater incidence of septic shock. Mortality rates did not differ among the groups. ConclusionsHospitals in the NSQIP are performing more simultaneous colonic and hepatic <b>resections</b> for CRC. These procedures are associated with increases in operative time, length of stay and rate of perioperative complications. Simultaneous procedures do not, however, increase perioperative mortality...|$|R
