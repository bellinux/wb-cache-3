40|$|The {{beta-lactam}} hydrolysis of five cephalosporin 3 '-quinolones (dual-action cephalosporins) {{by three}} gram-negative beta-lactamases was examined. The dual-action cephalosporins tested were the ester <b>Ro</b> 23 <b>-</b> 9424; the carbamates <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 2016, <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 4095, and <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 4835; and the tertiary amine <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 0534. Also tested were cephalosporins with similar side chains (cefotaxime, desacetylcefotaxime, cephalothin, cephacetrile, and <b>Ro</b> 09 <b>-</b> 1227 [SR 0124]) and standard beta-lactams (penicillin G, cephaloridine). The beta-lactamases used were the plasmid-mediated TEM- 1 and TEM- 3 enzymes and the chromosomal AmpC. The cephacetrile-related compounds <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 4095 and <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 4835 were hydrolyzed by all three beta-lactamases with catalytic efficiencies (relative to penicillin G) ranging from approximately 5 (TEM- 1, AmpC) to approximately 25 (TEM- 3). The cephalothin-related <b>Ro</b> 25 <b>-</b> 2016 was also hydrolyzed by all three beta-lactamases, particularly the AmpC enzyme (relative catalytic efficiency, 110).

40|$|A {{range of}} new anthracyclines, {{structurally}} related to adriamycin (ADM), has been synthesised and studied in vitro. Three compounds {{described in this}} paper (<b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 1215; <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 1741; <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 2035) are all 4 -demethoxyanthracyclines. In the mouse mammary tumour cell line, EMT 6 /Ca/VJAC, using a 1 h drug exposure followed by colony formation as the response endpoint, we found <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 1215 and <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 1741 to be 2 - 3 x and 4 - 7 x more potent then ADM, whilst <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 2035 was 3 - 4 x less potent.

The potency ratios for continuous drug exposure of a human small cell lung cancer line were similar to those for continuous exposure of EMT 6.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of 50 min whole-body hyperthermia (WBH; 15 min equilibration followed by 41 degrees C for 35 min) on the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the radiosensitizer <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 in mice. WBH markedly reduced <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 LD 50 / 7 d from 779 to 259 micrograms g- 1 (P less than 0. 001). Pharmacokinetics were studied at 175 micrograms g- 1 (approximately 0. 6 WBH LD 50 / 7 d) with and without heat and 437 micrograms g- 1 (approximately 0. 6 control LD 50 / 7 d) without heat. WBH increased <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 plasma concentrations and prolonged its elimination t 1 / 2 by 26 % (P less than 0. 01). Total plasma area under the curve (AUC 0 -infinity) was increased by 22 %, but was still less than 50 % of the unheated high-dose value. <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 concentrated 300 - 400 % in tumour and brain relative to plasma. Absolute tumour and brain levels were unaltered by WBH, giving reduced tissue/plasma ratios. WBH greatly inhibited glomerular filtration (51 Cr EDTA clearance) during heating, contributing to the increased plasma <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 concentrations. WBH increased peak plasma concentrations of the <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 N-oxide metabolite <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 0313 by 61 % and the beta-phase AUC of i. v. administered <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 0313 by 36 %.

WBH had no effect on <b>Ro</b> 31 <b>-</b> 0313 tumour concentrations or its exclusion from brain. These complex effects of WBH on <b>Ro</b> 03 <b>-</b> 8799 pharmacokinetics may contribute to the enhanced toxicity, possibly through hyperthermia-stimulated bioreductive drug activation, but do not wholly explain it...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{anticonvulsant}} and sedative {{effects of}} diazepam (5 mg/kg) were reversed by subsequent {{administration of the}} suggested specific benzodiazepine antagonist <b>Ro</b> 15 <b>-</b> 1788.

50|$|Bujor Nedelcovici {{started his}} {{literary}} {{career with the}} novel The Last Ones / Ultimii (<b>Ro)</b> <b>-</b> published in 1970 in Bucharest. An abundant writing activity followed. Nedelcovici published in various Romanian magazines, newspapers, and continued to write novels: Without Oars / Fara Vâsle (<b>Ro)</b> <b>-</b> 1972, The Night / Noaptea (<b>Ro)</b> <b>-</b> 1974, Icoanei Garden / Gradina Icoanei (<b>Ro)</b> <b>-</b> 1977, Days of Sand / Zile de Nisip (<b>Ro)</b> <b>-</b> 1979, The Sleep of the Customs Officer / Somnul Vamesului (<b>Ro)</b> <b>-</b> 1981. The above novels were awarded several prizes by the Writers’ Union and the Writers’ Association of Romania. In 1981 the novel Days of Sand / Zile de Nisip (Ro) {{was made into a}} movie under the title Sand Cliffs / Faleze de Nisip (Ro). The novel only seems to be a simple story. A doctor from Bucharest is spending the summer holiday at a remote village near the Black Sea, and one day has his personal belongings stolen from the beach. He gets involved into the inquiry and runs the interrogation of an apparently innocent man. Nedelcovici, a master of the plot, makes us notice the relation between the crashing power of the authority and the common citizen who finally becomes its victim. The young man, a carpenter, tries by all means to prove his innocence and rebel against the unjust accusation that is laid against him, but is defeated by the system. In the end he murders the doctor who symbolically turns to represent the authority. The subtle criticism of the authorities became a matter of scandal: four days after Sand Clifs / Faleze de Nisip (Ro) was screened, in 1981, it was banned from the market. But this was apparently not enough. In 1983 Nicolae Ceauşescu, President of Romania at that time, gave a speech for Romanian Communist Party officials in Mangalia, harshly criticizing the movie and singling it out that Sand Cliffs was breaking with the ideological requirements.|$|R
