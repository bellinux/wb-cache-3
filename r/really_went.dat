25|$|This pencil-slim youngster bowled off-spinners in {{the first}} innings with a highly suspect and jerky action...but no one bothered much about {{him because of his}} {{comparatively}} modest success.

25|$|As late as 13 February the British {{were still}} unaware of these intentions, {{and while they}} then arrested many {{suspected}} Jacobites the French plans <b>really</b> <b>went</b> astray on 24 February {{when one of the}} worst storms of the century scattered the French fleets which were about to battle for control of the English Channel, sinking one ship and putting five out of action.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of given names follows trends, with some names being popular in some years, and some considered definitely out-of-fashion. As an example, few children born since 1970 would bear the name Germaine, {{which is generally}} associated {{with the idea of}} an elderly lady. However, as noted above, such old-fashioned names are frequently used as second or third given names, because in France the second or further given names are traditionally those of the godparents or the grandparents. Some older names, such as Suzanne, Violette, and Madeleine, have become fashionable again in the upper class and in the upper middle class. Others such as Jean, Pierre, Louis, and François never <b>really</b> <b>went</b> out of fashion. Alexandre (Alexander) was never very popular, but is not uncommon in middle and upper classes.|$|E

500|$|Roberts {{recorded}} her {{scenes from}} January 6–8, 1996. She {{had a relationship}} with cast member Matthew Perry at the time and an audience member said about their on-screen kiss, [...] "Julia looked at Matt and said 'I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend'." [...] A sound recordist commented: [...] "I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They <b>really</b> <b>went</b> at it." [...] Roberts thought her appearance on the show was [...] "the most nerve-wracking thing" [...] she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. [...] "I wanted to be the best I could be. [...] is incredibly funny, and you want to inspire that same kind of joy that he does. Then at a certain point at lunch, you go, 'Well, it ain't gonna happen. I'll just try to be cute.'" ...|$|E
500|$|During filming, {{there were}} reports of {{disputes}} on set. The Daily Mail reported that Spottiswoode and Feirstein were no longer on speaking terms and that crew members had threatened to resign, with one saying [...] "All the happiness and teamwork which is the hallmark of Bond has disappeared completely." [...] This was denied by Brosnan who claimed [...] "It was nothing more than good old creative argy-bargy", with Spottiswoode saying [...] "It has all been made up...Nothing important <b>really</b> <b>went</b> wrong." [...] Spottiswoode did not return to direct the next film; he said the producers asked him, but he was too tired. Apparently, Brosnan and Hatcher feuded briefly during filming due to her arriving late onto the set one day. The matter was quickly resolved though and Brosnan apologised to Hatcher after realising she was pregnant and was late for that reason.|$|E
500|$|Barbara Steele as Elizabeth. [...] This was Steele's {{first film}} since her {{break-through}} horror performance in Mario Bava's Black Sunday (1960). [...] The actress recalled {{that she was}} [...] "in awe" [...] of Price during the production and described the filming of their final scene together as surprisingly physical: [...] "Our major confrontation where he strangles me was done in one take…He <b>really</b> <b>went</b> at me and I had the bruises on my throat to prove it. [...] Afterward, he was so concerned he had hurt me—a perfect gentleman—a truly kind figure {{in spite of his}} image." [...] While watching the daily rushes of the movie, Corman became convinced that Steele's [...] "thick working class English accent" [...] was not blending well with the other cast members, so after the filming was completed he had all of her dialogue dubbed by a different actress.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} titled [...] "Transformer" [...] according to producer and featured guest Swizz Beatz in a September 2009 interview with MTV News. The song {{was set to}} be the first real record that Brown had released since [...] with then-girlfriend Rihanna {{at the beginning of the}} year. Another song [...] "Changed Man", an [...] "apologetic ode to Rihanna" [...] written by Brown, and several other tracks were leaked but Jive Records said the material was old. Swizz Beatz said that Brown had recorded [...] "60 or 70" [...] songs for the album, and that [...] "He's got something to prove." [...] Beatz also commented on Lil Wayne's contribution to the song, saying, [...] ""The Wayne part is just nothing to talk about, He really showed his ass on this one. It's probably the best feature verse since the 'It's Me ' remix. He <b>really</b> <b>went</b> in on the 'Transformer' joint." [...] It was originally supposed released on September 30, 2009, but Brown stated on his Twitter that the song would be released a day early on September 29, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He <b>really</b> <b>went</b> to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
500|$|Madonna was {{released}} in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] <b>really</b> <b>went</b> through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E

500|$|The Hammond organ was {{perceived}} as outdated by the late 1970s, particularly in the UK, where it was often used to perform pop songs in social clubs. Punk and new wave bands tended to prefer second-hand combo organs from the 1960s, or use no keyboards at all. Other groups started taking advantage of cheaper and more portable synthesizers that were starting to come onto the market. The Stranglers' Dave Greenfield was an exception to this, and used a Hammond onstage during the band's early career. Andy Thompson, better known for being an aficionado of the Mellotron, stated, [...] "the Hammond never <b>really</b> <b>went</b> away. There {{are a lot of}} studios that have had a B-3 or C-3 sitting away in there since the 70s." [...] The instrument underwent a brief renaissance in the 1980s with the mod revival movement. Taylor played the Hammond through the 1980s, first with the Prisoners and later with the James Taylor Quartet. The sound of the Hammond has appeared in hip-hop music, albeit mostly via samples. A significant use is the Beastie Boys' 1992 single [...] "So What'cha Want", which features a Hammond mixed into the foreground (the instrument was recorded live rather than being sampled).|$|E
500|$|While rehearsing {{for their}} {{performance}} at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna. After Madonna commented that she liked the track, Spears asked her to do the song with her. RedZone then handed [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna, who arranged and recorded her vocal additions on her own, therefore making the song a duet. Spears, {{who has been a}} Madonna fan for years, was [...] "beyond surprised" [...] when she heard Madonna's verse. She said [...] "I just asked her to do a little thing, but she <b>really</b> <b>went</b> there. She did a lot of stuff to it." [...] Jive Records hoped [...] "Outrageous" [...] would be released as the first single from the album, but Spears pushed for [...] "Me Against the Music". After she performed the song {{for the first time at}} the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live, Spears refused to answer if it was the first single from the album, but said that [...] "there are some surprises that are going to come up in the song that I'm really excited about." [...] On September 16, 2003, it was confirmed that [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] would be released as the first single from In the Zone.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{were unhappy}} with the turkey attack subplot, which they felt [...] "never <b>really</b> <b>went</b> anywhere" [...] and ended {{abruptly}} without any satisfying conclusion. They nevertheless included it because they felt obligated to include a B story, since every episode in the season so far had included one. Later in the series, they said they realized this was not necessary and made many episodes without a B story. Although the duo liked the [...] "payoff" [...] of the Starvin' Marvin main plot, {{they did not know}} how to end the turkey subplot, so they simply had the characters kill all the turkeys and claim that there were none left; they decided this sudden ending was the funniest possible option. Stone said of the subplot, [...] "The turkeys were just an excuse to have the Braveheart sequence." [...] The animators enjoyed creating the turkey battle scene, which was designed to be shown in widescreen aspect ratio while the rest of the episode was animated normally. However, the animation proved to be very difficult and took a long time to do because it involved a larger number of characters and animals in one scene than had ever been featured previously in the show. Some of the characters in the far background were animated as gray and shadowy, which Parker said was not so much a visual effect as it was a [...] "lighting effect meaning we didn't want to draw all these people".|$|E

500|$|Christopher Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone, {{presented}} Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of [...] "Me Against the Music"; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." [...] While rehearsing for their performance at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears played a finished version of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] to Madonna.

[...] RedZone were then enlisted to work on several more songs for the album, including co-writing [...] "Early Mornin'", recording background vocals for [...] "Outrageous" [...] and producing [...] "The Hook Up".|$|E
2500|$|Despite her {{disappointment}} over {{losing the}} coveted Jaws role, Harrison {{was fascinated by}} Gloria Swanson, and spent hours with her on sets between takes. [...] "She took a special liking to me. She <b>really</b> <b>went</b> on about the sex she had with Joe Kennedy. There wasn't anything she wouldn't say. He {{was going to marry}} her, but he couldn't leave Rose and the children, he was a wonderful lover, and she'd detail it." [...] Airport 1975 was the first time Harrison appeared under the name [...] "Augusta Summerland", which her guru had chosen for her.|$|E
2500|$|Keith Slater: Slater {{was another}} bowler accused of {{throwing}} during the series, {{but as he}} only took 2 Test wickets for 110 runs he was {{not considered to be}} a major problem.

2500|$|After {{the tour}} of South Africa, Wilkinson's 1939 season was disappointing. A hand injury {{prevented}} him from playing {{early on in the}} season. He finished the year with 63wickets at an average of 30.85, although he did manage career best figures of 8/53 against Hampshire in May 1939. Talking about why he thought he hadn't matched his success from the previous year, Wilkinson said [...] "I don't know why but nothing <b>really</b> <b>went</b> right. The only thing I can think of is that I tried to be too perfect, particularly with the googly. I had an England cap and as an England player I had to be good".|$|E
2500|$|Mac Rauch's {{original}} 30-page {{treatment was}} entitled Find the Jetcar, Said the President - A Buckaroo Banzai Thriller. Early on, {{one of the}} revisions Mac Rauch made was changing Buckaroo's surname from Bandy to Banzai but he wasn't crazy about it. However, Richter convinced him to keep the name. The Hong Kong Cavaliers also appeared in these early drafts, but, according to Richter, [...] "it never <b>really</b> <b>went</b> to a completed script. Mac wrote and wrote but never wrote the end". Another early draft was entitled The Strange Case of Mr. Cigars, about a huge robot {{and a box of}} Hitler's cigars. Mac Rauch shelved his work for a few years while he wrote New York, New York for Martin Scorsese and other un-produced screenplays.|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Rick Berman {{said that}} when creating , he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, and compared the normal Starfleet officers to that of Boy Scouts. Berman suggested that [...] "In the Pale Moonlight" [...] was the exception. Taylor said that the episode [...] "pushes the boundaries in a realistic way". In an interview in 2011, when talking about [...] "In the Pale Moonlight", Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said [...] "we're not really {{willing to take the}} consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would never do that. We dealt with issues like that and I don't think... you know... the other shows <b>really</b> <b>went</b> as far as we did." ...|$|E
