40|$|Catheter <b>related</b> {{bloodstream}} <b>infections</b> are {{a significant}} barrier to success in many inpatient healthcare facilities. The goal {{of this study was}} to analyze and determine if an evidence based methodology to reduce the number of catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infections</b> in a pediatric inpatient healthcare facility had significant impact on the <b>infection</b> rate. Catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection</b> rates were compared before and after program implementation. The patient population was selected based upon a recommendation in the 2010 National Healthcare Safety Network report on device <b>related</b> <b>infections.</b> This report indicated a need for more data on pediatric populations requiring admission to a long term care facility. The study design is a retrospective cohort study. Catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection</b> data was gathered between 2008 and 2011. In October of 2008 a program implementation began to reduce the number of catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infections.</b> The key components of this initiative were to implement a standardized catheter maintenance checklist, introduce the usage of a chlorhexadine gluconate based product for catheter maintenance and skin antisepsis, and a multidisciplinary education plan that focused on hand hygiene and aseptic technique. The catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection</b> rate in 2008 was 21. 21 infections per 1000 patient-line days. After program implementation the 2009 catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection</b> rate dropped to 1. 11 per 1000 patient-line days. The infection rates in 2010 and 2011 were 2. 19 and 1. 47 respectively. Additionally, this study demonstrated that there was a potential cost savings of $ 620, 000 to $ 1, 240, 000 between 2008 and 2009.

Central venous catheters were cultured both endoluminally and extraluminally. Peripheral blood, catheter hubs, skin entry, and skin control sites were also cultured. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to DNA fingerprint coagulase negative staphylococci isolated from patients with presumptive catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection.</b> RESULTS: Sixty cases of catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection</b> were identified, 21 of which were attributed to coagulase negative staphylococci. Two hundred and ninety four separate isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from the 21 cases of catheter <b>related</b> bloodstream <b>infection</b> were subjected to PFGE (mean of 14 for each case).

5000|$|In {{the article}} titled [...] "iDynoMiCS: {{next-generation}} individual-based modelling of biofilms", an agent-based model is presented that models the colonisation of bacteria onto a surface, {{leading to the}} formation of biofilms. The purpose of iDynoMiCS (standing for individual-based Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator) is to simulate the growth of populations and communities of individual microbes (small unicellular organisms such as bacteria, archaea and protists) that compete for space and resources in biofilms immersed in aquatic environments. iDynoMiCS can be used to seek to understand how individual microbial dynamics lead to emergent population- or biofilm-level properties and behaviours. Examining such formations is important in soil and river studies, dental hygiene studies, infectious disease and medical implant <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> research, and for understanding biocorrosion. An agent-based modelling paradigm was employed to make it possible to explore how each individual bacterium, of a particular species, contributes {{to the development of the}} biofilm. The initial illustration of iDynoMiCS considered how environmentally fluctuating oxygen availability affects the diversity and composition of a community of denitrifying bacteria that induce the denitrification pathway under anoxic or low oxygen conditions. The study explores the hypothesis that the existence of diverse strategies of denitrification in an environment can be explained by solely assuming that faster response incurs a higher cost. The agent-based model suggests that if metabolic pathways can be switched without cost the faster the switching the better. However, where faster switching incurs a higher cost, there is a strategy with optimal response time for any frequency of environmental fluctuations. This suggests that different types of denitrifying strategies win in different biological environments. Since this introduction the applications of iDynoMiCS continues to increase: a recent exploration of the plasmid invasion in biofilms being one example. This study explored the hypothesis that poor plasmid spread in biofilms is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate of the plasmid donor agent. Through simulation, the paper suggests that plasmid invasion into a resident biofilm is only limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth. Sensitivity analysis techniques were employed that suggests parameters relating to timing (lag before plasmid transfer between agents) and spatial reach are more important for plasmid invasion into a biofilm than the receiving agents growth rate or probability of segregational loss. Further examples that utilise iDynoMiCS continue to be published, including use of iDynoMiCS in modelling of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm with glucose substrate.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—The {{introduction}} of the adjunctive use of antiproliferatives to trabeculectomy has greatly improved the success rate of this operation. Trabeculectomy with antiproliferative treatment, however, is usually associated with a cystic and thin walled filtering bleb, which may be more susceptible to infection. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the incidence, clinical findings, and risk factors of delayed onset, bleb <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> after trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C (MMC) or 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) treatment.  METHODS—The records of 632  glaucoma patients who underwent 966  trabeculectomies, with and without the use of adjunctive MMC or 5 -FU treatment, between January 1985  and February 1995  were analysed. The mean follow up period was 3. 5  (2. 4) years (range 0. 1  to 11. 2  years). The mean patient age was 54. 8  (18. 8) years (range 0  to 88  years).  RESULTS—Bleb <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> occurred in one of 76  trabeculectomies that did not receive antiproliferatives (1. 3 %), three of 228  treated with 5 -FU (1. 3 %) trabeculectomies, and seven of 662  treated with MMC (1. 1 %). Five eyes developed blebitis; six eyes developed endophthalmitis. Bleb <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> developed an average of 3. 1  (1. 6) (range 0. 4  to 6. 0) years after trabeculectomy. All eyes had avascular or hypovascular blebs that were cystic in shape before infection and all eyes had reduced intraocular pressure. Early wound leaks and chronic, intermittent bleb leaks were identified to be risk factors for the bleb <b>related</b> <b>infection.</b>  CONCLUSION—The incidence of delayed onset, bleb <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> after trabeculectomy with antiproliferative treatment is similar to that after trabeculectomy without antiproliferatives. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of locally applied gentamicin to the systemic administration of the antibiotic in a rat infection model (n= 60). For the local application gentamicin was released from a biodegradable Poly(D,L-Lactide) -coating (PDLLA) on titanium implants and compared to the sole systemic administration of gentamicin as well as to a combination of both therapeutic regimen. Half of the animals (n= 30) received a weight-adopted single shot administration of gentamicin systemically 30 minutes prior to surgery. The medullary cavities of the tibiae were opened, Staphylococcus aureus (10 (2) colony forming units) was inoculated and the Kirschner-wires were implanted. The wires were either coated with PDLLA, coated with PDLLA + gentamycin 10 % w/w or uncoated. The animals were followed up for 42 days postoperatively. Follow up was carried out by clinical and radiological examination. After sacrifice infection of the tibiae was evaluated by histological and radiological analysis. All animals treated with either uncoated or PDLLA-coated K-wires without receiving systemic antibiotics developed an osteomyelitis radiologically and histologically. An implant <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> could be prevented in 15 % of all animals with sole systemic antibiotic administration. By treating animals with PDLLA + gentamicin coated K-wires implant <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> could be prevented in 85 % of the animals. The combination of both therapeutic regimen led to no further reduction of the infection rates. The gentamicin loaded biodegradable coating led to a statistically significant reduction of implant <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> rates compared to the systemic administration of gentamicin.

40|$|Introduction: Catheter <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} complications of vascular access devices. Treatment of these complications is important and life saving. The most common causative organisms are gram-positive bacteria especially staphylococcus. Vancomycin and teicoplanin are two antibiotics which widely used for invasive beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive infections. In this study, we aimed to compare efficacy of vancomycin and teicoplanin in treatment of catheter <b>related</b> <b>infection.</b> Material and Methods: In this clinical trial, 43 patients with catheter infection were enrolled. Diagnosis was based on clinical criteria. 22 patients were received teicoplanin 800 mg intra-venous loading dose and 400 mg at days 2 th, 3 th, 5 th, 12 th, 19 th and 21 patients received vancomycin 1 gr intra venous loading dose and 500 mg every 5 days and for 3 weeks. A criterion for treatment response was absence of fever after 72 hours. Results: 57. 1 patients who received vancomycin and 68. 2 patients who received teicoplanin had clinical response (p= 0. 454). In patients who received vancomycin, one case developed red man syndrome and one case developed diarrhea (9. 5) and in tiecoplanin group one patient developed rash (9. 1).

OIRI were further differentiated in two groups: Fracture Fixation-Device Infections (FFI) and Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI). Three-hundred and five S. aureus strains were collected from 4 different Swiss and 2 French hospitals (FFI, n= 112; PJI, n= 105; NIRI, n= 88). NIRI cases were composed of 27 Osteomyelitis (OM), 23 Diabetic Foot Infections (DFI), 27 Soft Tissue Infections (STI) and 11 postoperative Spinal Infections (SI). All isolates were tested for their ability to form biofilm, to produce staphyloxanthin and their haemolytic activity. They were typed by agr (accessory gene regulator) group, spa type and screened by PCR for the presence of genes {{of the most}} relevant virulence factors such as MSCRAMMs, Panton Valentine Leukotoxin (PVL), enterotoxins, exotoxins and toxic shock syndrome toxin. Overall, methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was more prevalent than methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in this collection. The OIRI group trended towards a higher incidence of MRSA, gentamicin resistance and haemolysis activity than the NIRI group. Within the OIRI group, PJI isolates were more frequently strong biofilm formers than isolates from the FFI group. A statistically significant difference was observed between OIRI and NIRI isolates for the sdrE gene, the cna gene, the clfA gene and the bbp gene. Certain spa types (t 230 and t 041) with a specific genetic virulence pattern were only found in isolates cultured from OIRI. In conclusion, our study highlights significant trends regarding the virulence requirements displayed by S. aureus isolates associated with implant <b>related</b> <b>infections</b> in comparison to non-implant <b>related</b> <b>infections.</b> However, future studies including whole genome sequencing will be required to further examine genomic differences among the different infection cases...|$|R

Hand hygiene should be performed {{before and after the}} clean and the unclean work with patients and materials. Health- <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> is an infection which can affect both employees and patients as a result of care, regardless of care service. Good compliance is when hand hygiene is carried out at an appropriate time, but several studies show that this is not followed.

The {{aim of this}} prospective clinical study is to demonstrate the infection rate related to peripheral arterial catheters and their clinical significance in neurosurgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients. After removal, all arterial catheter tips were cultivated by semiquantitative method and clinical data were collected. During {{a period of two}} years, 186 arterial catheters were placed in 105 neurosugical ICU patients. In 6 cases (3. 2 %) infection was presumably related to the arterial catheter. The rate of such probable catheter related infections was found to be 5 / 1000 catheter days. The isolated microorganisms were: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in 4 cases, Corynebacterium species and Candida albicans each in one case respectively. Thirteen cases (7. 0 %) were interpreted as contamination and one as colonization. An association was found between the presence of infection from different sources and significant bacterial growth on the catheter. Patients with positive catheter culture had a significantly longer ICU stay, more cumulative catheter days, and a higher mortality rate than those with sterile catheters. We can conclude that the rate of probable peripheral arterial catheter <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> is low. A higher mortality rate in patients who experienced probable catheter <b>related</b> <b>infection</b> {{does not seem to be}} a consequence of the aforementioned infection.
