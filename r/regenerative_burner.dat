40|$|Current European {{industrial}} furnaces (steel industry, metallurgy, ceramic, glass, forging, heat treatments, …) massively use {{natural gas}} as fuel. In {{order to save}} energy, most furnaces include an energy recuperation system on the exhaust gases to preheat the combustion air to temperatures up to 1000 °C (in case of <b>regenerative</b> <b>burners).</b> Enriching combustion air with oxygen also leads to not only a reduction of combustion products volume but also to energy savings. Unfortunately, this is generally achieved while NOx emissions are raised due to a higher flame temperature, and sometimes hot spots appear in furnaces, which can be harmful to the load.

To identify the potentials for energy recovery, it has been conducted energy balances. The resultsfrom the balances give {{an overview of the}} waste heat sources and their total energy content, togetherwith the temperatures at which they are available. The total energy in the waste heatsources for PFA 2 was found to be 17. 8 GWh/year. The largest waste heat sources were localisedin connection to the cooling agent of the casting ingot machine. Here disappears 12. 32 GWh/year through cooling water within a temperature range of 10 to 30 &# 176;C as well as convectionand radiation to surrounding. The cooling water section one was determined as the most promisingheat recovery potential with 7. 47 GWh/year. Furthermore the initialisation of liquid aluminiumalloy was revealed as a waste heat source with 5. 48 GWh/year. Here disappears 3. 34 GWh/year through the flue gas of the furnace within a temperature range of 288 to 1, 100 &# 176;C andcreates the most promising heat recovery potential at the furnace. The energy saving potential is divided into three groups: energy saving by existing equipment,optimising of equipment and waste heat recovery. Here energy saving by existing equipmentreveals 26. 4 MWh/year for an improved control quality of the melt temperature. The greatestpotential for energy saving by optimisation of the equipment was found to be 1. 98 GWh/year forthe implementation of <b>regenerative</b> <b>burner.</b> Furthermore effects an installation of a furnace pressurecontrol system 689. 14 MWh/year less energy consumption due to the avoided false air. Thegreatest energy saving potential for waste heat recovery was estimated to 1. 65 GWh/year for thepreheating of charged metals to 300 &# 176;C, instead of 20 &# 176;C. The preheating also leads to improvedsafety, because of the elimination of moist metal in the furnaces, and increases the process production,as a consequence of larger melt capacity. Furthermore, heat to power solutions revealedthe use of favourable electricity production by the generation of waste heat. Here the greatestgeneration potential was found to be in the flue gas from the furnace. A common Rankine cycle,with a direct heat recovery design and water as working fluid, was estimated with a recoverypotential of 1. 1 GWh/year. With the use of an organic Rankine cycle the potential can be recoveredto 489. 8 MWh/year for an indirect heat recovery design and pentane as working fluid. Thereare still some challenges associated with flue gas heat exchangers (dust) and operation of suchpower generation plants at alternating heat loads, but the technology is under rapid development.

40|$|The {{topic of}} Diluted Combustion Technologies is {{reviewed}} from early developments some 10 {{ten years ago}} up to date, {{for the sake of}} “design and process engineers”. Recent efforts of the academic community to supply interpretation and quantitative modelling of the occurring phenomena are briefly described. Diluted combustion with high temperature reactants, in particular with gas firing, has been developed since a few years for industrial use exhibiting ultra-low NOx emissions and suitable properties for extremely high air preheating, and therefore substantial energy savings and process advantages. Successful applications to high temperature furnaces, mainly in the steel industry, are illustrated to show several advantages obtained from applying the new combustion technologies. This story is a good lesson based on conscious, scientific approach, backed by permanent R&TD efforts. These examples should be pursued vigorously if concrete measures to cope with the Kyoto engagements to combat air pollution are to be brought about in reality.

This work started with the characterisation of flameless <b>regenerative</b> <b>burners</b> in our labs in collaboration with burner manufacturers. The main conclusion of the tests is that these burners are very low NOx (less than 300 mg/m 3 (n) at 3 %O 2), whatever the operating conditions, while having a very high thermal efficiency (more than 70 %). Gaz de France initiated a project with joint funding from Arcelor Research, Stein-Heurtey (furnaces manufacturer) and the French Environment Agency (Ademe), to evaluate the capabilities of the HiTAC (High Temperature Air Combustion) technology. This project, called InterNOx, ended in November 2003 was composed of three phases: basic understanding of this combustion mode, through semi-industrial test rigs, development of numerical simulation tools to reproduce the furnace (CFD, global tools) and demonstration operation at industrial scale.

40|$|Steel {{reheating}} is an energy-intensive process requiring uniform {{temperature distribution}} within reheating furnaces. Historically, recuperators have ben used to preheat combustion air, thereby conserving energy. More recent innovations include oxygen enrichment {{and the use}} of <b>regenerative</b> <b>burners,</b> which provide higher preheat air temperatures than recuperators. These processes have limitations such as equipment deterioration, decreasing energy efficiency over time, high maintenance costs, and increased NO{sub x} emissions with increased air preheat temperature, unless special equipment is used. Praxair, Inc., supplier of oxygen and other industrial gases to the steel industry, proposes to introduce an innovative oxy-fuel burner technology (using 100 % oxygen) to the steel reheating industry. Oxy-fuel combustion reduces or eliminates nitrogen in combustion air and substantially reduces waste heat carried out with flue gas. Based on technology currently used in the glass, hazardous waste, and aluminum industries, Praxair has developed and patented low temperature, oxy-fuel burners {{that can be used in}} high temperature industrial furnaces where temperature uniformity is critical and extremely low NO{sub x} emissions are desired. The technical goal of the project is to demonstrate the use of oxy-fuel burners in a slab reheat furnace while reducing energy consumption by 45 % and NO{sub x} emissions by 90 % within the converted furnace zones. Successful implementation of this technology also will eliminate the need to periodically replace recuperators and install NO{sub x} removal equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of a second fuel such as CO, C 3 H 8 or H 2 on the catalytic combustion of methane was investigated over ceramic monoliths coated with LaMnO 3 /La-Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Results of autothermal ignition of different binary fuel mixtures characterised by the same overall heating value show that the presence of a more reactive compound reduces the minimum pre-heating temperature necessary to burn methane. The effect is more pronounced for the addition of CO and very similar for C 3 H 8 and H 2. Order of reactivity of the different fuels established in isothermal activity measurements was: CO > H 2 ≥ C 3 H 8 > CH 4. Under autothermal conditions, nearly complete methane conversion is obtained with catalyst temperatures around 800 °C mainly through heterogeneous reactions, with about 60 - 70 ppm of unburned CH 4 when pure methane or CO/CH 4 mixtures are used. For H 2 /CH 4 and C 3 H 8 /CH 4 mixtures, emissions of unburned methane are lower, probably due to the proceeding of CH 4 homogeneous oxidation promoted by H and OH radicals generated by propane and hydrogen pyrolysis at such relatively high temperatures. Finally, a steady state multiplicity is found by decreasing the pre-heating temperature from the ignited state. This occurrence can be successfully employed to pilot the catalytic ignition of methane at temperatures close to compressor discharge or easily achieved in <b>regenerative</b> <b>burners...</b>|$|R

The staggered firing configuration shows higher emissions, for both NO and CO, compared to parallel firing. Increasing the λ increases the NO formation and decreases the CO formation.

40|$|International audienceA {{parametric}} {{study on}} a 300 kWth furnace equipped with {{three pairs of}} <b>regenerative</b> flameless combustion <b>burners</b> has been performed. Each burner pair has a rated thermal power of 100 kWth firing Dutch natural gas. The objective {{of the study was}} to optimize the furnace performance, i. e., to maximize the cooling tube efficiency and minimize the CO and NO emissions. In the study the following parameters were varied: the positions of the burners in the furnace (burner configuration), the firing mode (parallel and staggered), the excess air ratio (λ) and the cycle time (tcycle). Also, the influence on the furnace performance of the jet momentum of the combustion air and the temperature uniformity in the furnace were studied. It was concluded that staggered firing mode is disadvantageous, since it results in significantly higher NO emissions than parallel firing mode. Also, out of the five investigated burner configurations one has been exempted, since its cooling tube efficiency was significantly lower compared to the other configurations. Furthermore, a horizontal setup of the firing burners improves the cooling tube efficiency at a fixed temperature uniformity. Also, for the burner configurations with the firing burners positioned closer to the regenerating burners and further from the stack, the temperatures in the regenerators are higher, leading to higher combustion air preheat temperatures. The temperature in the regenerators was also influenced by the cycle time; higher cycle times leading to higher (peak) temperatures in the regenerators. Finally, this temperature in the regenerators was shown to be more decisive for the final amount of CO emitted than the excess air ratio or the jet momentum. In all experiments, due to differences in path length of the mean flow, higher CO emissions were measured in the flue gas from the regenerators compared to in the flue gas from the stack. These two trends in the CO emissions were not observed for the NO emissions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} three {{different}} combustion systems, equipped {{with either a}} single or multiple ?ameless combustion burner(s), are discussed. All these setups were investigated both experimentally and numerically, i. e., using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Flameless combustion is a combustion technology capable of accomplishing the combination of high energy ef?ciency (by preheating of the combustion air) and low emissions, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx). These high combustion air preheat temperatures normally account for increased thermal formation of NOx, however, in ?ameless combustion, by delayed mixing of the fuel and oxidizer and high internal ?ue gas recirculation, the rates of these reactions are decreased. Nitrogen oxide {{plays a key role}} in acid rain formation and the generation of photochemical smog. The ?rst setup that has been investigated is a furnace equipped with two <b>regenerative</b> ?ameless combustion <b>burner</b> pairs, with a thermal power of 100 kWth each, located at the laboratories of Kungliga Tekniska H¨ gskolan (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden (Chapter 4). The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of the furnace operating in two different ?ring modes, parallel and staggered. The furnace performance is de?ned as the energy ef?ciency and the NO emissions. Experimental results show that for parallel ?ring mode both the ef?ciency was higher and the NO emissions were lower compared to staggered ?ring mode. With the use of the CFD simulations, it was shown that in parallel mode the radiative heat transfer was higher due to formation of a larger zone with gases with improved radiative properties and that higher velocities along the cooling tubes, due to lower momentum destruction, led to higher convective heat transfer. Both of these heat transfer methods contributed to the higher energy ef?ciency in parallel ?ring mode. Additionally, the lower formation of NO emissions in parallel ?ring mode was due to the fact that the low-momentum fuel jets merged slower with the high-momentum combustion air jets, resulting in more internal ?ue gas recirculation and a less intense combustion zone. Moreover, it was found that NOx was formed via the thermal and N 2 O intermediate pathways. No prompt NO was formed, while the reburning pathway resulted in a reduction of the total NO emissions. The second setup is a 300 kWth furnace equipped with three pairs of <b>regenerative</b> ?ameless combustion <b>burners,</b> located at Delft University of Technology (DUT) in the Netherlands (Chapter 5). An experimental parametric study was performed, varying the positions of the burners in the furnace (the burner con?guration), the ?ring mode (parallel and staggered), the excess air ratio and the cycle time, with the objective to optimize the furnace performance. Since similar trends in the furnace performance, as for the furnace at KTH, comparing parallel and staggered ?ring mode, were observed, staggered mode was exempted from further analysis. Additionally, one of the ?ve investigated burner con?gurations has also been exempted due to a signi?cant lower energy ef?ciency compared to the other con?gurations. The experimental results show that the burner positioning and the cycle time had a signi?cant in?uence on the temperature inside the regenerators, and thus on the preheat temperature of the combustion air. This temperature turned out to be important regarding the CO emissions. Furthermore, it was found that comparing different cases ?ring in ?ameless mode, an improved temperature uniformity in the furnace was not re?ected by a higher energy ef?ciency. Finally, a horizontal setup of the ?ring burners (the three ?ring burners positioned in a horizontal row) improved the energy ef?ciency at similar temperature uniformities. Steady CFD simulations have been performed for this furnace for four different burner con?gurations ?ring in parallel mode (Chapter 6). During the careful selection of the set of physical models to be used, it was found that, due to relatively low Reynolds numbers in the cooling air ?ow in the annulus of the cooling tubes, predictions of the heat extraction rates of these cooling tubes were improved by treating the ?ow in the cooling tubes as laminar. Furthermore, the applied error tolerance of the ISAT procedure was insuf?cient for accurate species concentration predictions, however, based on analysis of the main species concentrations in the ?ue gas, this inaccuracy did not in?uence the overall predictions. It was possible to explain the most important results of the experimental study using the CFD simulations. In the ?rst place, it was found that a recirculation zone between the upper ?ring burners and the stack in two con?gurations resulted in a smaller fraction of the ?ue gases leaving the furnace via the stack compared to the other two con?gurations. Thus, a larger fraction of the ?ue gas left the furnace via the regenerating burners, which resulted in higher preheat temperatures of the combustion air. Secondly, the experimentally observed differences in the temperature uniformity between the four con?gurations could be explained by the presence of less or more pronounced recirculation zones, the latter leading to higher temperature uniformities in the furnace. Finally, it was con?rmed that the jets of the burners showed similar merging behaviour for different burner con?gurations, leading to similar NO emissions, a trend that was also observed in the experiments. The third setup is a prototype ?ameless combustion gas turbine combustor (Chapter 7). The combustor was ?red with various Low Calori?c Value (LCV) gases. The in?uence of several parameters (the fuel composition, the outlet temperature and the inlet nozzle diameter) on the CO and NO emissions has been investigated. In the ?rst place, it was shown that this prototype ?ameless combustion gas turbine combustor could be operated in ?ameless mode ?ring the LCV gases. Moreover, for both pollutants ultra-low emissions (single-digit) have been achieved. In the CFD simulations, different turbulence models and chemistry mechanisms have been compared, leading to a set with models which gave the best results. Comparing the measured and predicted axial temperature pro?les in the combustor, it was concluded that the observed discrepancies were within the range of uncertainty in what are optimal values of the model constants. From NO calculations, ultra-low emission combustion was con?rmed. Also, it was found that 90 % of the NO was formed via the N 2 O path, and the remaining 10 % via the thermal pathway. No prompt NO was formed, a trend also observed for the KTH furnace. In conclusion, important knowledge on the behaviour of furnaces equipped with multiple ?ameless combustion burners has been attained. Especially, the in?uence on the furnace performance of the ?ring con?guration of the burners and the burner positioning in the furnace will contribute to more successful (industrial) application of this combustion technology in the future. Recommendations for the installation of ?ameless combustion burners in large industrial-scale furnaces have been proposed. Finally, the shown possibility of ?ring a (prototype) gas turbine combustor with low calori?c value gases in ?ameless mode, enables the utilization of biomass derived gaseous fuels in existing equipment.
