2500|$|Psychometricians {{generally}} <b>regard</b> <b>IQ</b> {{tests as}} having high statistical reliability. A high reliability implies that – although test-takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, {{and although they}} may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same age – the scores generally agree {{with one another and}} across time. Like all statistical quantities, any particular estimate of IQ has an associated standard error that measures uncertainty about the estimate. For modern tests, the standard error of measurement is about three points. Clinical psychologists generally <b>regard</b> <b>IQ</b> scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes. In a survey of 661 randomly sampled psychologists and educational researchers, published in 1988, Mark Snyderman and Stanley Rothman reported a general consensus supporting the validity of IQ testing. [...] "On the whole, scholars with any expertise in the area of intelligence and intelligence testing (defined very broadly) share a common view of the most important components of intelligence, and are convinced that it can be measured with some degree of accuracy." [...] Almost all respondents picked out abstract reasoning, ability to solve problems and ability to acquire knowledge as the most important elements.|$|R

Starting from the importance of empirically investigate this issue and provide evidence to support prevention and intervention programs in child development, {{the aim of this}} study was to compare the effect of family SES (and specifically parental education) between age ranges <b>regarding</b> <b>IQ</b> performance, language (oral and written), memory (episodic, semantic and working) and executive functions (inhibitory components and cognitive flexibility, in particular) in children from 6 to 12 years old. The hypothesis was that the relationship between low socioeconomic status (including low parental education) and lower performance in IQ and in the assessed tasks (Ardila et al. 2005; Noble et al. 2007) would be more noticeable in younger children (Blair et al. 2011; Lupien et al. 2001). This study intends to give a better comprehension about this issue in Brazil, providing evidences from a large sample, using classical measures of SES and neuropsychological tasks based on traditional paradigms (besides IQ measures), with robust statistical analysis, that could be the basis for rethinking public policies that promote child development.|$|R

Unfortunately, not much is known on the prognosis of CLRE; it is assumed to be somewhere between the benign course of many idiopathic epilepsies and the more malignant course of most symptomatic epilepsies. The risk of cognitive decline over time seems to be increased for children with epilepsy, but no data are available specifically for CLRE. This study was a systematic cross-sectional open clinical and non-randomized investigation, which included 68 children with CLRE, 24 children with symptomatic localization related epilepsy (SLRE) and 21 children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). One-way between-groups ANOVAs with Tukey post hoc testing were used to test differences in demographical variables and IQ between CLRE, SLRE and IGE and to test the influence of duration of epilepsy and other epilepsy factors on IQ. To test whether there were IQ differences between the three types of epilepsy regarding duration of epilepsy and other epilepsy factors, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used. In CLRE, intelligence is stable over time; IQ scores do neither improve nor deteriorate. Age at onset, seizure type, seizure frequency and the use of AED appeared to have no influence on intelligence in CLRE.
