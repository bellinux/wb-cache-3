For each camera under investigation, we first determine its <b>reference</b> pattern <b>noise,</b> {{which serves as a}} unique identification fingerprint.

The first gates analyzed the statistical correlations between the input signal and the <b>reference</b> <b>noises.</b> The advantage {{of these is the}} robustness against background noise. The disadvantage is the slow speed and higher hardware complexity. The instantaneous logic gates are fast, they have low complexity but they are not robust against background noises. With either neural spike type signals or with bipolar random-telegraph waves of unity absolute amplitude, and randomness only in the sign of the amplitude offer very simple instantaneous logic gates. Then linear or analog devices unnecessary and the scheme can operate in the digital domain. However, whenever instantaneous logic must be interfaced with classical logic schemes, the interface must use correlator-based logic gates for an error-free signal.|$|R

Perlin noise suffers {{from a number of}} defects and there have been many attempts to create better or faster noise but Perlin’s ‘Gradi-ent Noise ’ has consistently proved to be the best compromise between speed and quality. Our objective was to create a better noise cheaply by use of the GPU. 2 <b>Reference</b> <b>Noise</b> Filtered noise is a continuous, locally smooth function that is random in the sense that values more than a certain distance apart will be uncorrelated. We would also like it to be isotropic in a statistical sense so if we trace the function along a line its appear-ance doesn’t depend on the direction of the line. Perlin’s gradient noise has discernible axis aligned artifacts and the very non-random property that the value is zero at every point of the rec-tangular grid used to define the function. You can disguise these defects by adding noise values from non-aligned grids but then it is not so cheap.

30|$|It is {{also worth}} noting that nature and {{statistics}} of noise in color images is not yet well described and modeled. Although in many <b>references,</b> <b>noise</b> {{is considered to be}} Gaussian and pure additive, this, strictly saying, does not hold in practice [18 – 21, 38]. The noise in original (raw) images is clearly signal dependent [1, 21, 38]. After nonlinear operations with data in image processing chain [2], the assumption on noise Gaussianity and approximately constant variance of noise holds only for component image fragments with local mean intensity from about 20 till about 230... 235 [18, 39]. Moreover, even for such fragments, noise variance can slightly differ for R, G, and B components where for G component it is usually the smallest. For fragments with local mean values outside these limits, noise variance is usually smaller and clipping effects can take place. This makes the analysis of filtering efficiency problematic. To simplify situation and comparisons, below we analyze additive Gaussian noise with variance values equal for all three components.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and Purpose: Although the {{evolution}} of industrial systems toward digital technologies decreased the exposure {{to high levels of}} noise, it has created some problems encountered with low level and provoking noise (low frequency noise). In the present work, the mental performance of students exposed to low frequency and reference noises at low and high levels (45 & 65 dB) were studied. Additionally, other factors such as annoyance, sensitivity to low frequency noise and hearing status of participants were considered. Materials and Methods: After generating low frequency and reference noises required for the study, a pilot study was conducted. Then, 54 students participated in the main study after preliminary tests. Their mental performances were evaluated with standard psychological tests while they were exposed to low frequency and reference noises at 45 and 65 dBA. Results: The results showed that noise annoyance and low frequency noise sensitivity do not have a significant correlation with age and sex. The results also revealed that, low frequency noise at 65 dB can decrease concentration (P= 0. 003) and increase response time (P= 0. 039) of performance in comparison with low frequency noise at 45 dB. On the other hand, <b>reference</b> <b>noise</b> at 65 dB can increase speed (P< 0. 001) of performance in comparison with <b>reference</b> <b>noise</b> at 45 dB.

In addition to the beamformer primary output, it provides <b>reference</b> <b>noise</b> signals by projecting the input signals onto the noise-only subsapce. Presumably, a desired signal component is stronger at the beamformer output than at any <b>reference</b> <b>noise</b> signal, and a noise component is strongest at one of the reference signals. Hence, the ratio between the transient power at beamformer output and the transient power at the reference signals indicates whether such a transient is desired or interfering. Based on a Gaussian statistical model [4], and an appropriate decision-directed a priori SNR estimate [6], we derive an estimator for the signal presence probability. This estimator controls the rate of recursive averaging in obtaining a noise spectrum estimate by the Minima Controlled Recursive Averaging (MCRA) approach [7].

40|$|Digital {{holographic}} interferometry (DHI) is {{an optical}} measurement technique {{that can be}} used to measure very small deformations and/or movements of an object. When the changes of an object are slow the measurement time has to be increased and vibrations of the components in the setup together with motion of the surrounding air start to interfere with the measurement. This thesis investigates the possibility of improving the quality of long time DHI measurements in a disturbed environment by post processing of the data.
