40|$|Resilient {{societies}} need {{technology with}} high recycling possibilities, {{as well as}} possibilities to treat wastewater with local ecosystem services as dominating driving forces. Modern wastewater treatment often suffers from the problem of being a linear system, rather than a recycling system. From a <b>recycling</b> <b>point</b> of view the nutrients in the wastewater is of highest interest. The use of microalgae has been proposed as collection systems for the nutrients, with several potential advantages: 1) they treat the wastewater further from a pathogenic point of view, 2) they produce a sludge of interesting biochemical quality depending on the species present in the treatment ponds, 3) they use the naturally occurring ecosystem services available at the wastewater treatment site {{in the form of}} sunlight, wind, and regional biodiversity of phytoplankton. The academic focus regarding microalgae use for wastewater treatment has to a large extent been on the “sunbelt”, between latitudes 35 North and South, respectively. However, a few investigations have been performed on northern and southern latitudes.

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau de Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Any: 2014, Tutora: Małgorzata DzięciołPoly(ethylene terephthalate), {{commonly}} abbreviated as PET, {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used thermoplastics in everyday life thanks to its excellent physical and chemical properties. Due to the slow biodegradability of PET wastes and the fact that its consumption is still increasing, there is a growing interest on recycling of post-consumer PET wastes to reduce its volume in land-fill sites. Among the recycling methods, chemical recycling is the most acceptable method in environmental terms as it leads to the formation of the materials from which the polymer is originally made or other raw materials. Moreover, the recycling of polymer waste by thermal processes (pyrolysis) can be an important source of hydrocarbons for the petrochemical industry, contributing to the environmental protection. However, this process requires high quantity of energy due to the poor thermal conductivity and endothermicity of plastics. To decrease thermal decomposition costs of polymeric material wastes, cheap catalysts have become of the most interest from a global <b>recycling</b> <b>point</b> of view. In the present work, two kinds of fly ash (coal and biomass fly ash) were tested as catalysts to examine their influence on the volatile compounds emitted during thermal decomposition process of waste PET in selected conditions: 400 ºC in N 2 atmosphere. Moreover, two methods of mixing sample with each fly ash were performed to compare their effects.

40|$|Solute {{recycling}} from irrigation can {{be described}} as the process that occurs when the salt load that is extracted from irrigation wells and distributed on the fields is returned to the groundwater below irrigated surfaces by deep percolation. Unless the salt load leaves the system by means of drains or surface runoff, transfer to the groundwater will take place, sooner or later. This can lead to solute accumulation and thus to groundwater degradation, particularly in areas where extraction rates exceed infiltration rates (semi-arid and arid regions). Thus, considerable errors can occur in a predictive solute mass budget if the recycling process is not accounted for in the calculation. A method is proposed which allows direct simulation of solute recycling. The transient solute response at an extraction well is shown to be a superposition of solute mass flux contributions from n recycling cycles and is described {{as a function of the}} travel time distribution between a <b>recycling</b> <b>point</b> and a well. This leads to an expression for a transient ‘recycling source’ term in the advection–dispersion equation, which generates the effect of solute recycling. At long times, the ‘recycling source’ is a function of the local capture probability of the irrigation well and the solute mass flux captured by the well from the boundaries. The predicted concentration distribution at steady state reflects the maximum spatial concentration distribution in response to solute recycling and can thus be considered as the solute recycling potential or vulnerability of the entire domain for a given hydraulic setting and exploitation scheme. Simulation of the solute recycling potential is computationally undemanding and can therefore, for instance, be used for optimisation purposes. Also, the proposed method allows transient simulation of solute recycling with any standard flow and transport code...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} argued in the {{literature}} that religious belief has {{a role to play}} in dealing with environmental issues and enhancing environmental practices. In line with this perspective, it is interesting to observe that Muslim communities have started to use the Islamic institutions as an organizational and institutional platform for shown their environmental programmes. In some mosques and small mosques (surau), inspiring green programmes such as the 3 R programme have also conducted. However, previous research on the role of religious community in enhancing environmental practices is mostly discussed at the theoretical level and only a handful have undertaken in systematic empirical research on this topic. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore an innovation process in Islamic institutions which refer to ‘mosque and small mosque’ (surau), as a central organisational and institutional structure in the Muslim community especially in carry out the 3 R programme. In addition, this study will also identify the potential role of mosque and surau in adoption of 3 R program. The framework for this research is based on the adaptation of theoretical frameworks: “The adoption of innovation of organisational process framework” developed by Everett Rogers (2005). The article is mainly based on a qualitative study. It employs an in-depth case study on the 3 R activities conducted in mosque at Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia that are involved in the “Amal Jariah melalui Kitar Semula di Masjid” programme and 3 R programme from small mosque - Surau al-Husna in Shah Alam, Selangor. In this research, semi-structured interview and focus group study have been carried out. Preliminary work reveals the inspired results. From our key findings, both Islamic institution; mosque and surau have a big advantages in playing its role due to its systematic organisational structure and unique ability to adopt the 3 R programme efficiently. The potential role can be seen in stability in organisational structure, formal and non-formal environmental education, strong element of leadership, provide a <b>recycling</b> <b>point</b> facilities, and Islamic institution as a community center and also ‘innovation laboratory’. Another role that should be underlined is the way Islamic institution in cultivating the concept of charity/giving alms (sedekah) through recycling - where people have the opportunity to contribute their recyclable items to generate money for mosque and surau. These case studies is hopefully can gives inspiration and motivation to other religious institution in acting the good deeds towards environment through 3 R practices...|$|E

In addition, it is also focused on identifying {{the most effective way}} of transmitting environmental information to parents and children to promote the collection of electrical and electronic toys at their end-of-life. The study was implemented in a Spanish municipality. With regard to the consumption habits, aspects related to the amount of toys that children receive annually and percentage of those which are electrical and electronic toys have been obtained and classified according to the family size. Results from Chi-squared analysis and Ordinal Logistic Regression show that there is a statistically significance relationship among these variables. Regarding disposal habits, aspects related to the reasons and way for discarding electrical and electronic toys, time that toys are kept at home or the willingness to rent or buy second hand e-toys have been obtained.

40|$|Cities {{currently}} manage uneaten {{food and}} other food system based biowaste quite inefficiently. The organic compound, despite its high nutriment value, is only to a small extent recycled and returned to farm soil and therefore, does not contribute to closing ecological nutrient cycles and to supporting sustainable food production [1]. In the US, over 97 % of food waste {{is estimated to be}} buried in landfills [2]. Forkes has shown for Toronto that only 4. 7 % at most of food waste nitrogen (including sewage waste) was recovered and/or recycled [3]. For Paris and its suburbs, a similar estimate has been obtained, and this share of nitrogen food waste recycling has been in steep decline in the course of two centuries, from 40 % to close to 5 % estimated for today [4]. One study has analyzed the nutrient balance (N, P) for Bangkok Province [5]. These studies mainly focus on food waste and sewage waste management from a nutrient <b>recycling</b> <b>point</b> of view. Furthermore, food waste related resource use and environmental pollution are highlighted as no longer acceptable in the context of global warming and increasing pressure on the planet’s limited boundaries [6], [7]. According to an analysis from the Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP), prevention of 1 ton of food waste can yield in carbon equivalent savings of 3090 kg when food from manufacture or retail is redistributed to people. But savings are much lower when food from manufacture is redistributed as animal feed (220 kg eq CO 2 / ton food) or used for anaerobic digestion (162 kg eq CO 2 / ton food). This analysis illustrates from a climate point of view priority for food waste prevention over food waste valorization. The problem of food waste is crucial: the FAO estimates that one third of world food production is lost or wasted. In industrialized countries, food waste amounts to close to 300 kg/cap/year in North America or Europe – and more than two third of it occurring at distribution, catering and in-home consumption [8]. A “preparatory study on food waste across the EU 27 Member States” estimates annual food waste generation in the EU 27 at approximately 89 million tons, or 179 kg per capita (without agriculture) [9]. Households (42 %) and manufacturing (39 %) have been identi-fied as the most important food waste producers, followed behind by food services/caterers (14 %) and retail/wholesale (5 %). The high share of food waste occurrence close to consumption, cities’ dense population and the accumulation of waste in periurban areas, together with the numerous socio-technical initiatives coming from both urban citizens and stakeholders are all factors that place cities as important players. Although food waste in cities in Asia, Africa and South America is relatively lower at the downstream stages of supply chains, the fast growing population and changing habits towards urban diets nevertheless raise the question also for these sets on how to optimize food use in cities. The world population is going to become more and more urban, being expected to make up 66 % of the world population by 2050 compared to 30 % in 1950. Ongoing population growth together with urbanization is expected to increase the urban population pre-dominantly in Asia and in Africa. Today, the most urbanized regions include Northern America (82 %), Latin America and the Caribbean (80 %) and Europe (73 %), but all regions in the world are projected to urbanize further [10]. Our study analyses the specific link between food waste and cities in a zero waste perspective in the future. By using a foresight approach we suggest to identify and discuss key prevention and valorization measures, to pinpoint knowledge gaps on the specific character of food waste in cities and to bring up relevant questions for research...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, it {{is known}} that {{reserves}} of non-renewable resources are limited and also the waste sent to the air, soil and earth pollute the environment. Besides proposing a change in the architects¿ way of thinking, the climate change requires an improvement in the environment, politics and social consciousness. The chase for a sustainable architecture has also to consider the close down of materials cycles. The aim of this research is to introduce new concepts for the materials that reach the end of their first life cycle, and in addition evaluate the potential of materials recyclability and building elements, usually used in the building construction. The research method is based on a hierarchy order of an up-side-down pyramid given priority to the reuse and recyclability of materials, which will afterwards support the creation of methods to determine their recyclability levels. The proposition of concepts for all different uses of building materials after the end of their life cycles was elaborated from observation of current recycling methods that are economically doable and likewise based on visits done to building materials <b>recycling</b> <b>points</b> in Spain. The results show the concepts created regarding recycled materials, infracycled, reused and infraused, are more suitable to the current situation if the majority of the materials do not reach their end of life cycle. The level of recyclability works as a tool used to make decisions because they allow to quantify the environment betterment in the building processes of buildings that are made from recycled materials or those that can be recycled. In this way, it allows to increase the build and demolish of buildings that apply reused materials or have recycled content, besides contributing for the reduction of the environment impact in comparison to ordinary buildings.
