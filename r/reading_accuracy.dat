25|$|In 1993, Castles and Coltheart {{describe}} developmental dyslexia as two prevalent {{and distinct}} varieties using the subtypes of Alexia (acquired dyslexia), Surface and Phonological Dyslexia. Understanding these subtypes {{is useful in}} diagnosing learning patterns and developing approaches for overcoming visual perception impairments or speech discrimination deficits. Cestnick and Coltheart (1999) demonstrated what these underlying deficits are in part, through unveiling different profiles of phonological versus surface dyslexics. Surface Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read known words but who have trouble reading words that are irregular. Phonological Dyslexia is characterized by subjects who can read aloud both regular and irregular words but have difficulties with non-words and with connecting sounds to symbols, or with sounding out words. Phonological processing tasks predict <b>reading</b> <b>accuracy</b> and comprehension. Cestnick and Jerger (2000) and Cestnick (2001) further demonstrated distinct processing differences between phonological and surface dyslexics. Manis et al. 1996, concluded that there were probably more than two subtypes of dyslexia, which would be related to multiple underlying deficits.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} factor in increasing the widespread adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for different supply chain applications {{is the ability to}} achieve a high level of <b>read</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The <b>read</b> <b>accuracy</b> is dependent {{on the size of the}} region that receives sufficient power from the reader. While most current research considers the powering region of a reader to be determined only by its read range, in reality <b>read</b> <b>accuracy</b> can be complicated by such issues as polarizations and the relative orientations of reader antennas and tags. In particular, when tag positions are not fixed, the specific placement of reader antennas and their interaction with the polarization and the orientation of the tags can have a significant effect on the success of the interrogation processes. This research uses Friis' equation for both the forward link and the backward link to explicitly consider orientations and polarizations while addressing the problem of optimizing the locations of a set of reader antennas at a scanning portal. The objective is to maximize the size of the powering region satisfying a particular <b>read</b> <b>accuracy</b> requirement. This research develops different methodologies and provides results for obtaining the best antenna locations to address different scenarios in supply chain applications. It addresses the case where items are static within a read portal, as well as when they might be moving on some type of material handling equipment. Various scenarios are considered for the tag orientations, including item-level applications where any orientation might be possible and case-level and pallet-level scenarios where the number of possible tag orientations might be limited...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} list of {{companies}} implementing radio frequency identification (RFID) systems to help optimize their supply chain processes. These companies realize that a successful RFID system can potentially lead to lower supply chain inventory levels, reduced operating expenses, and greater visibility throughout the supply chain. However, since RFID technology is still relatively immature, a majority of the applications experience less than perfect read rates for tagged items moving through the supply chain. This paper reports the results for a variety of different arrangements of variables that may influence the readability of the RFID tags in a conveyer belt environment. The variables tested for this study were tag placement on the package, tag orientation, conveyer belt speed, tag type, package contents, and the reader antenna distance from the conveyer belt. The goal of this research was to determine how these variables influenced the readability of the RFID tags.

5000|$|Detecting {{phosphorus}} deficiency {{can take}} multiple forms. A preliminary detection method is a visual inspection of plants. Darker green leaves and purplish or red pigment can indicate a deficiency in phosphorus. This method however {{can be an}} unclear diagnosis because other plant environment factors can result in similar discoloration symptoms. In commercial or well monitored settings for plants, phosphorus deficiency is diagnosed by scientific testing. Additionally, discoloration in plant leaves only occurs under fairly severe phosphorus deficiency so it is beneficial to planters and farmers to scientifically check phosphorus levels before discoloration occurs. The most prominent method of checking phosphorus levels is by soil testing. The major soil testing methods are Bray 1-P, Mehlich 3, and Olsen methods. Each of these methods are viable but each method has tendencies to be more accurate in known geographical areas. These tests use chemical solutions to extract phosphorus from the soil. The extract must then be analyzed to determine the concentration of the phosphorus. Colorimetry is used to determine this concentration. With {{the addition of the}} phosphorus extract into a colorimeter, there is visual color change of the solution and the degree to this color change is an indicator of phosphorus concentration. To apply this testing method on phosphorus deficiency, the measured phosphorus concentration must be compared to known values. Most plants have established and thoroughly tested optimal soil conditions. If the concentration of phosphorus measured from the colorimeter test is significantly lower than the plant’s optimal soil levels, then it is likely the plant is phosphorus deficient. The soil testing with colorimetric analysis, while widely used, can be subject to diagnostic problems as a result of interference from other present compounds and elements. Additional phosphorus detection methods such as spectral radiance and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP) are also implemented with the goal of improving <b>reading</b> <b>accuracy.</b> According to the World Congress of Soil Scientists, the advantages of these light-based measurement methods are their quickness of evaluation, simultaneous measurements of plant nutrients, and their non-destructive testing nature. Although these methods have experimental based evidence, unanimous approval of the methods has not yet been achieved.|$|E

In all three studies, typically developing children matched for <b>reading</b> <b>accuracy</b> also participated. The effect of phonological and non-phonological oral language skills on <b>reading</b> <b>accuracy</b> was examined in Studies 1 and 3. In Study 1, phoneme awareness and vocabulary were evaluated as predictors of <b>reading</b> <b>accuracy.</b> Neither were longitudinal predictors in either group due to the strength of the autoregressor. However, vocabulary was a concurrent predictor for the children with Down syndrome. In Study 3, children with Down syndrome showed poorer orthographic learning than typically developing children. However when equated for decoding skill, the level of orthographic learning and the benefit from phonological pre-training were equivalent in the two groups. The proposed benefit of learning to read on oral language development was tested in Studies 1 and 2. In Study 1, <b>reading</b> <b>accuracy</b> had a moderate effect on vocabulary development for children with Down syndrome and typically developing children. In Study 2, children with Down syndrome and typically developing children showed similar levels of phonological learning, which was facilitated by orthographic support to the same extent.
