5|$|By {{its great}} atomic density, barium {{carbonate}} increases the <b>refractive</b> index and luster {{of glass and}} reduces leaks of X-rays from cathode ray tubes (CRT) TV sets.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the <b>refractive</b> index {{generally is}} greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the <b>refractive</b> index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with <b>refractive</b> index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the <b>refractive</b> index in {{the plane of the}} bilayer differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 <b>refractive</b> index units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.|$|E
5|$|The mature {{mycelium}} {{consists of}} thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear <b>refractive</b> when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with <b>refractive,</b> frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a <b>refractive</b> yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high <b>refractive</b> index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), <b>refractive</b> index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that the {{silicate}} particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary <b>refractive</b> index under visible light.|$|E
5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The <b>refractive</b> index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of <b>refractive</b> index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} reduced oxides of {{titanium}} are known. Ti3O5, {{described as a}} Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO2 with hydrogen at high temperatures,O5 Powder|journal=Journal of Inorganic Materials|date=26 June 2013|volume=28|issue=4|pages=425–430|doi=10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12309|language=Chinese}} and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO2 evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable <b>refractive</b> index. Also known is Ti2O3, with the corundum structure, and TiO, with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Leona Marshall {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where she became a fellow at Fermi's Institute for Nuclear Studies. Working with the Chicago Pile 3 heavy water reactor, she {{found a way to}} 100 percent spin polarize neutron beams, and determined the <b>refractive</b> index of neutrons for various materials. Her second child, John Marshall III, was born in 1949. She became an assistant professor in 1953.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} <b>refractive</b> index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300nm. Here, the 18km (k {{was found to be}} around 0.009) sample was much more absorbent than the 15km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).|$|E
5|$|Hyperoxic myopia has {{occurred}} in closed circuit oxygen rebreather divers with prolonged exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This is due {{to an increase in}} the <b>refractive</b> power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{aluminium}} garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} lens material in high <b>refractive</b> index immersion lithography. Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|More than 20 other {{minerals}} have higher dispersion (that is difference in <b>refractive</b> index for {{blue and red}} light) than diamond, such as titanite 0.051, andradite 0.057, cassiterite 0.071, strontium titanate 0.109, sphalerite 0.156, synthetic rutile 0.330, cinnabar 0.4, etc. (see dispersion). However, the combination of dispersion with extreme hardness, wear and chemical resistivity, as well as clever marketing, determines the exceptional value of diamond as a gemstone.|$|E
5|$|The {{applications}} of zinc oxide powder are numerous, {{and the principal}} ones are summarized below. Most applications exploit the reactivity of the oxide as a precursor to other zinc compounds. For material science applications, zinc oxide has high <b>refractive</b> index, high thermal conductivity, binding, antibacterial and UV-protection properties. Consequently, it is added into materials and products including plastics, ceramics, glass, cement, rubber, lubricants, paints, ointments, adhesive, sealants, concrete manufacturing, pigments, foods, batteries, ferrites, fire retardants, etc.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly <b>refractive</b> titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E
5|$|Underwater {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the <b>refractive</b> index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in <b>refractive</b> index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small viewport in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Refractive</b> index: cubic {{zirconia}} has a <b>refractive</b> {{index of}} 2.15–2.18, {{compared to a}} diamond's 2.42.|$|E
25|$|File:X-Ray <b>Refractive</b> X-Ray Lenses.jpg|X-ray <b>refractive</b> x-ray lenses made of SU8 polymer. The {{patterns}} {{are made by}} tilting the mask and substrate in the beam twice by +-45°.|$|E
25|$|Cataract {{extraction}} following <b>refractive</b> surgery poses {{special problems}} for {{the patient and the}} surgeon because the corneal change as a result of <b>refractive</b> surgery complicates accurate keratometry, a key element of lens implant power calculation. After laser <b>refractive</b> surgery for myopia, this could result in overestimation of corneal power, underestimation of the IOL power required, and hyperopic outcomes after cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|The <b>refractive</b> {{index is}} basic {{to the science}} of optics. Shifting the <b>refractive</b> index to a {{negative}} value may be a cause to revisit or reconsider the interpretation of some norms, or basic laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} aerosol directly affects how it interacts with solar radiation. The chemical constituents within the aerosol change the overall <b>refractive</b> index. The <b>refractive</b> index will determine how much light is scattered and absorbed.|$|E
25|$|A {{common cause}} of low visual acuity is <b>refractive</b> error (ametropia), or errors in how the light is refracted in the eyeball. Causes of <b>refractive</b> errors include aberrations {{in the shape of}} the eyeball, the shape of the cornea, and reduced {{flexibility}} of the lens. Too high or too low <b>refractive</b> error (in relation to the length of the eyeball) is the cause of nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) (normal <b>refractive</b> status is referred to as emmetropia). Other optical causes are astigmatism or more complex corneal irregularities. These anomalies can mostly be corrected by optical means (such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, laser surgery, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Metamaterials that {{exhibit a}} {{negative}} {{value for the}} <b>refractive</b> index are often referred to by any of several terminologies: left-handed media or left-handed material (LHM), backward-wave media (BW media), media with negative <b>refractive</b> index, double negative (DNG) metamaterials, and other similar names.|$|E
25|$|Form birefringence, whereby {{structure}} {{elements such}} as rods, having one <b>refractive</b> index, are suspended in a medium with a different <b>refractive</b> index. When the lattice spacing is much smaller than a wavelength, such a structure {{is described as a}} metamaterial.|$|E
25|$|In a {{birefringent}} material, a wave {{consists of}} two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective <b>refractive</b> indices. The so-called slow ray is the component for which the material has the higher effective <b>refractive</b> index (slower phase velocity), while the fast ray is the one with a lower effective <b>refractive</b> index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower <b>refractive</b> index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure {{at the top of}} the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with s polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and vitreous humors both have a <b>refractive</b> index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a <b>refractive</b> index of 1.376. Because the change in <b>refractive</b> index between cornea and aqueous humor is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible <b>refractive</b> effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a positive meniscus lens.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>refractive</b> eye surgery {{techniques}} {{change the}} shape of the cornea {{in order to reduce the}} need for corrective lenses or otherwise improve the <b>refractive</b> state of the eye. In many of the techniques used today, reshaping of the cornea is performed by photoablation using the excimer laser.|$|E
25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high <b>refractive</b> index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a <b>refractive</b> index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened <b>refractive</b> index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures {{the degree to which}} a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high <b>refractive</b> index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be achromatic.|$|E
25|$|This {{quantity}} {{is often}} (ambiguously) called simply the <b>refractive</b> index.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence is {{the optical}} {{property}} of a material having a <b>refractive</b> index {{that depends on}} the polarization and propagation direction of light. These optically anisotropic materials are said to be birefringent (or birefractive). The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between <b>refractive</b> indices exhibited by the material. Crystals with non-cubic crystal structures are often birefringent, as are plastics under mechanical stress.|$|E
25|$|Optical properties: <b>Refractive</b> {{index is}} {{directly}} related to density (or periodic density fluctuations).|$|E
25|$|In optics, {{chromatic}} aberration (abbreviated CA; also called chromatic distortion and spherochromatism) is an effect resulting from dispersion {{in which there}} is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same convergence point. It occurs because lenses have different <b>refractive</b> indices for different wavelengths of light. The <b>refractive</b> index of transparent materials decreases with increasing wavelength in degrees unique to each.|$|E
25|$|A {{mixture of}} silicon dioxide and {{germanium}} dioxide ("silica-germania") {{is used as}} an optical material for optical fibers and optical waveguides. Controlling {{the ratio of the}} elements allows precise control of <b>refractive</b> index. Silica-germania glasses have lower viscosity and higher <b>refractive</b> index than pure silica. Germania replaced titania as the silica dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the need for subsequent heat treatment, which made the fibers brittle.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a <b>refractive</b> cornea is only useful out of water; in water, {{there is}} little difference in <b>refractive</b> index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water. Hence creatures that {{have returned to the}} water – penguins and seals, for example – lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision. An alternative solution, borne by some divers, is to have a very strongly focusing cornea.|$|E
25|$|Silica aerogels {{also have}} a high optical {{transmission}} of ~99% and a low <b>refractive</b> index of ~1.05.|$|E
25|$|Ray tracing in 3D optical {{systems with}} a finite set of {{rectangular}} reflective or <b>refractive</b> objects is undecidable.|$|E
