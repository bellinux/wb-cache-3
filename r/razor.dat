5|$|After {{discovering}} the diary, <b>razor,</b> and dress, Cavendish {{came to believe}} that he was destined to continue Arkham's work. On April Fools Day—the date Arkham's family was murdered—Cavendish released the patients and lured Batman to the asylum, believing him to be the bat Arkham spoke of. Cavendish accuses him of feeding the evil of the asylum by bringing it more insane souls. Batman attempts to convince Cavendish he is sick and needs treatment, but Cavendish responds by attacking him. Batman and Cavendish proceed to struggle, which ends after Adams slashes Cavendish's throat with the <b>razor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} <b>Razor</b> 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The <b>Razor</b> 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the <b>Razor</b> 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E

5|$|The feud between <b>Razor</b> Ramon and I.R.S. ended {{shortly after}} the Royal Rumble. On the January 31, 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw, the 1-2-3 Kid stole Ramon's chains back from I.R.S., {{bringing}} the feud to an end. Shawn Michaels’ attack on <b>Razor</b> Ramon increased the hostility between the two. The debate over the true holder of the Intercontinental Championship was settled at WrestleMania X in a ladder match with both belts suspended above the ring. This ended the feud between Michaels and Ramon, although Ramon continued to feud with Michaels’ friend Diesel.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the match between Shawn Michaels and <b>Razor</b> Ramon, Diesel begin to {{challenge}} Ramon for the Intercontinental championship. Michaels helped Diesel defeat Ramon for the title on April 13, 1994. This win began a push for Diesel that saw him win the WWF's Triple Crown Championship in one calendar year.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, Money Inc. began a feud with <b>Razor</b> Ramon. DiBiase had been making fun of Ramon over his upset loss to the 1-2-3 Kid, and even offered Ramon a job as his servant. Ramon was furious with DiBiase and turned face during their feud. Soon after, Ramon distracted DiBiase in a match against the 1-2-3 Kid, causing the Million Dollar Man an {{embarrassing}} loss of his own. At SummerSlam 1993, <b>Razor</b> Ramon defeated Ted DiBiase in what would be DiBiase's last WWF match. Later in the event, I.R.S. defeated the 1-2-3 Kid. DiBiase went on {{a leave of absence}} for several months, and Schyster returned to singles competition, feuding with Ramon.|$|E
50|$|These <b>razors</b> {{are similar}} in use and {{appearance}} to straight <b>razors,</b> but use disposable blades, either standard double edged cut in half or specially made single edge. These shavettes {{are used in the}} same way as straight <b>razors</b> but do not require stropping and honing. Although the blades of disposable <b>razors</b> wear quickly, useful blade life can be extended with proper care, including drying the blade after use.|$|R
50|$|As {{compared}} to the disposable and cartridge <b>razors,</b> straight <b>razors</b> are more economical, despite a higher initial cost {{due to the fact}} that if properly cared for, no additional cost is incurred, as {{compared to}} disposable <b>razors</b> where new cartridges must be periodically procured.|$|R
50|$|Still {{others argue}} that {{straight}} <b>razors</b> provide a superior shave through a larger blade and greater control of the blade, including the blade angle. Straight <b>razors</b> cover a much greater area per shaving stroke, because their cutting edge is much longer {{than any of the}} multi-blade <b>razors.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} match of the tournament, Bam Bam Bigelow got the early {{advantage}} by attacking <b>Razor</b> Ramon from behind. Ramon gained momentum after Bigelow missed a diving headbutt, but Bigelow used {{his strength and}} got Ramon in a torture rack. As Bigelow climbed the ropes, however, Ramon threw {{him back into the}} ring and scored the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel {{defeated}} Sid to retain his title. In the undercard Bret Hart defeated Hakushi, but lost to Jerry Lawler, whereas <b>Razor</b> Ramon defeated Jeff Jarrett and The Roadie in a two-on-one handicap match.|$|E
5|$|Oxford's {{philosophical}} tradition {{started in}} the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste and William of Ockham, commonly known for Occam's <b>razor,</b> among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.|$|E

5|$|<b>Razor</b> Ramon {{continued}} to wrestle in high-profile matches but achieved little success until changing his persona to a face {{after losing to}} the underdog 1-2-3 Kid in May 1993. As a fan favorite, Ramon won his first of four Intercontinental Championships in September 1993.|$|E
5|$|<b>Razor</b> Ramon faced Bob Backlund next. Ramon {{used his}} power to {{dominate}} {{the majority of the}} match, but Backlund used hip tosses to attempt a comeback. Ramon won the match in under four minutes by pinning Backlund with a small package.|$|E
5|$|<b>Razor</b> Ramon {{had been}} feuding with Shawn Michaels since being pushed {{to win the}} WWF Intercontinental Championship in late 1993. After {{defeating}} Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania X, Ramon dropped the belt to Diesel, Michaels' bodyguard. A rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam 1994. Ramon brought in NFL Hall of Famer Walter Payton to be his cornerman and help prevent Michaels from interfering.|$|E
50|$|Safety <b>razors</b> {{originally}} had an edge {{protected by a}} comb patterned on various types of protective guards that had been affixed to open-blade straight <b>razors</b> during the preceding decades.|$|R
25|$|Murray {{began work}} on a film {{adaptation}} of the novel The <b>Razor's</b> Edge. The film, which Murray co-wrote, was his first starring role in a dramatic film. He later agreed with Columbia Pictures to star in Ghostbusters—in a role originally written for John Belushi—to get financing for The <b>Razor's</b> Edge. Ghostbusters became the highest-grossing film of 1984. The <b>Razor's</b> Edge, which was filmed before Ghostbusters but not released until after, was a box-office flop.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Razor's</b> Edge is an {{adaptation}} of W. Somerset Maugham's 1944 novel The <b>Razor's</b> Edge. It stars Bill Murray (who also co-writes), Theresa Russell, Catherine Hicks, Denholm Elliott, Brian Doyle-Murray and James Keach. It was directed and co-written by John Byrum.|$|R
5|$|Several of {{the events}} during the Royal Rumble match led to feuds and {{pay-per-view}} matches later in 1994. Diesel's performance in the Royal Rumble match led to him becoming an up and comer in the WWF pecking order and he became the Intercontinental Champion shortly after WrestleMania X with assistance from Shawn Michaels. The duo later won the WWF Tag Team Championship the night before SummerSlam in August. At SummerSlam, however, Michaels cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship by inadvertently kicking him when <b>Razor</b> Ramon ducked out of the way. Finally, at Survivor Series in November, the still-simmering {{tension between the two}} friends boiled over when Michaels hit Diesel with another kick intended for <b>Razor</b> during their Survivor Series elimination match. Diesel became irate and chased after Michaels, who escaped in a car and declared their friendship and team over.|$|E
5|$|The WWF Intercontinental Championship {{was also}} defended at WrestleMania. Jeff Jarrett, the champion, had been feuding with <b>Razor</b> Ramon, the challenger, for several months. At Royal Rumble 1995, Jarrett was {{accompanied}} by The Roadie, who interfered on Jarrett's behalf and helped Jarrett win the championship. To even the sides in the rematch at WrestleMania, Ramon {{was accompanied by}} his friend, the 1–2–3 Kid.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Jeff Jarrett and <b>Razor</b> Ramon {{began in}} late 1994 when Jarrett {{challenged}} Ramon for Ramon's WWF Intercontinental Championship. They {{faced each other}} several times, but Jarrett was unable to win the belt. Jarrett, who portrayed an aspiring country music star, was accompanied to the ring by The Roadie, who often interfered in matches on Jarrett's behalf.|$|E
5000|$|After {{reviewing}} {{the data that}} Zsinj provided, Wedge figures out that Zsinj wants to attack Kuat and steal a new Super Star Destroyer, the <b>Razors</b> Kiss. Shalla is sent as the Hawk-bats combat specialist to [...] "assist" [...] Zsinjs commando force, {{while the rest of}} Wraith Squadron will pose as the Hawk-Bats, and will aid Zsinjs forces in the assault on the Kuat shipyards. Shalla manages to install Castins tracker program into the <b>Razors</b> Kiss computers, and sabotages the shield generators. A New Republic task force led by Han Solo ambushes Zsinjs forces at the rendezvous after the successful capture of the <b>Razors</b> Kiss, destroying <b>Razors</b> Kiss and severely damaging the Iron Fist.|$|R
60|$|Nor are the {{implements}} {{of these}} man-of-war barbers out of {{keeping with the}} rude appearance of their shops. Their <b>razors</b> are of the simplest patterns, and, from their jagged-ness, would seem better fitted for the preparing and harrowing of the soil than for the ultimate reaping of the crop. But this is no matter for wonder, since so many chins are to be shaven, and a razor-case holds but two <b>razors.</b> For only two <b>razors</b> does a man-of-war barber have, and, like the marine sentries at the gangway in port, these <b>razors</b> go off and on duty in rotation. One brush, too, brushes every chin, and one lather lathers them all. No private brushes and boxes; no reservations whatever.|$|R
50|$|An {{expanded}} {{version of}} the game titled Ninja Gaiden 3: <b>Razor's</b> Edge was released later on November 18th {{of the same year}} for the Wii U. In early 2013, <b>Razor's</b> Edge was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well.|$|R
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} <b>Razor</b> Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase {{got off to}} a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|The {{record sleeve}} {{includes}} a montage photograph {{in the studio}} consisting of a mirror, straw, <b>razor</b> blade and a rolled up five pound note (as an overt reference to cocaine consumption). Lynott insisted on adding the picture {{over the rest of}} the band's objections.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight <b>razor,</b> imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the <b>razor,</b> imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
50|$|Straight <b>razors</b> {{are also}} {{much easier to}} clean and can handle tougher shaving tasks, such as longer facial hair, than modern multi-blade <b>razors,</b> which tend to trap shaving debris between their tightly packed blades and are easily , even with {{relatively}} short stubble.|$|R
50|$|Previously {{considered}} old fashioned, {{double edge}} <b>razors</b> have regained popularity {{in recent years}} due to long term cost savings, and for some, less irritating shaves. Specialty store chain The Art of Shaving has stated sales of safety (DE) <b>razors</b> have increased 1,000 percent from 2009 to 2014.|$|R
50|$|Disposable safety <b>razors</b> {{are highly}} similar in design to Cartridge <b>Razors,</b> {{constructed}} from inexpensive materials (commonly injection moulded polycarbonate), yet {{are meant to}} be wholly disposable after use with no blade sharpening or replacement possible. One device was invented in 1963 by American entertainer and inventor Paul Winchell.|$|R
