Successful design and manufacture of a high-performance <b>refractory</b> <b>shape</b> system requires understanding refractory materials, manufacturing, anchoring systems, and construction practice.

Standard shapes have dimension that are conformed by most refractory manufacturers and are generally applicable to kilns or furnaces {{of the same}} types. Standard shapes are usually firebrick that have a standard dimension of 9 x 4-1/2 x 2-1/2 inches and this dimension is called a [...] "one brick equivalent". [...] "Brick equivalents" [...] are used in estimating how many firebrick {{it takes to make}} an installation into an industrial furnace. Special shapes are specifically made for particular kilns or furnaces.Precast <b>refractory</b> <b>shape</b> technology has become a specialized field within the refractory industry in recent years. As demands increase for greater refractory lining performance and lower maintenance costs, refractory users are finding that one effective way to achieve those goals is to incorporate a broader use of precast refractory shapes into their lining systems. Across virtually all industries - petrochemical, steel, power generation, metal casting and treatment, wood products, minerals processing and others - the applications for precast shapes are limited only by the imagination, and almost invariably their use results in better performance and lower cost. This article discusses the design and manufacture of precast refractory shapes, and the benefits to material properties and installation logistics.|$|E

40|$|Andalusite, kyanite and {{sillimanite}} are alumino-silicate polymorphs of metamorphic origin {{with the}} chemical formula Al 2 SiO 5. When calcined, these polymorphs convert to mullite, a highly refractory material. The conversion {{is accompanied by}} an irreversible volume expansion of 5 %, 18 % and 7 % for andalusite, kyanite and sillimanite, respectively (Skillen, 1993). Worldwide, andalusite is the preferred of the three raw materials because it converts to mullite at lower temperatures (1380 °C) than sillimanite (1550 °C). Although kyanite converts to mullite at 1370 °C, andalusite is favoured because the volume change during mullitization is negligible; therefore no calcination is required before manufacturing <b>refractory</b> <b>shapes.</b> Approximately 4. 22 x 109 joules (4 x 106 BTU) are needed to mullitize one tonne of kyanite (Skillen, 1993).

High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.|$|R
50|$|With {{the use of}} precast shapes, crew sizing can be minimized. Speed of {{installation}} {{is another}} obvious benefit to both the installer and the owner, resulting in reduced costs due to shorter job duration. Material usage is also reduced, {{when compared to other}} installation methods such as guniting, where as much as 45% of extra material is required to compensate for rebound and other job losses. Environmental hazards such as dusting and tripping hazards associated with equipment and hoses are also reduced substantially, if not eliminated. Future repairs also become much more economical and quicker to accomplish. Repair areas can be isolated to just the immediate wear area within the boundaries of a shape. Anchor attachment points can typically be reused. Replacement shapes, purchased early and kept as spare parts on site, can be easily installed in a fraction of the time required for conventional repair methods. The initial bake-out of a new refractory lining on site can be a very expensive and time-consuming component of a refractory repair project. The use of precast and prefired <b>refractory</b> <b>shapes</b> can sometimes reduce or even eliminate the need for an extensive initial bake-out. If an entire repair is made with a prefired system, then normal furnace start up schedules can be used, without the fear of steam spalls or other damage during the initial heating. Bake-out of multi-component linings, which may include a combination of precast shapes and other materials placed in the field, can often be reduced by the pre-firing of the castable shapes, particularly if that material would have been the critical item determining the bake out schedule. This can {{have a positive impact on}} not only job costs, but in reducing down time as well.|$|R

Hence, there has been a shift of focus towards unshaped refractories, over conventional and <b>shaped</b> <b>refractories.</b> Refractory castables consists of a mixture of aggregate refractory grains, matrix phases, binders, deflocculants and other additives. In order to get the optimum result as envisioned, castable manufacturing needs to be controlled right from compositional batch calculation to the firing process. In this project, the effect of different types of deflocculant and its amount on high alumina low cement castables is observed.

40|$|The {{demand for}} the {{monolithic}} refractories as compared to their shaped counterparts have been increasing over the years due to their distinct advantages like comparable durability, low cost and relatively easy installation procedure. Several attempts are being made in the optimization of the properties of these products. Among monolithics, refractory castables are the major ones which have replaced significant fraction of <b>shaped</b> <b>refractories</b> in the furnace lining. Among the castables, high alumina based castables {{are the most important}} type. This work focuses on the study of the properties of the conventional high alumina based refractory castables, firstly due to the reduction in the percentage of cement by reactive alumina and secondly due to the replacement of cement by micro-silica in the composition. The reduction in the percentage of cement improved the thermo-mechanical property which was indicated by the HMOR values and the incorporation of the micro-silica in the composition resulted in the development of good mechanical strength to the castables and also improved their thermo-mechanical properties. The improvement in mechanical properties and HMOR values for microsilica castables was definitely due to mullite formation.

40|$|During {{mast cell}} degranulation, {{histamine}} is released in large quantities. Human eosinophils {{were found to}} express histamine H 4 but not H 3 receptors. The possible effects of histamine on eosinophils and the receptor mediating these effects were investigated in our studies. Histamine (0. 01 – 30 μM) induced a rapid and transient cell shape change in human eosinophils, but had no effects on neutrophils. The maximal shape change was at 0. 3 μM histamine with EC 50 at 19 nM. After 60 min incubation with 1 μM histamine, eosinophils were desensitized and were <b>refractory</b> to <b>shape</b> change response upon histamine restimulation. Histamine (0. 01 – 1 μM) also enhanced the eosinophil shape change induced by other chemokines. Histamine-induced eosinophil shape change was mediated by the H 4 receptor. This effect was completely inhibited by H 4 receptor-specific antagonist JNJ 7777120 (IC 50 0. 3 μM) and H 3 /H 4 receptor antagonist thioperamide (IC 50 1. 4 μM), but not by selective H 1, H 2 or H 3 receptor antagonists. H 4 receptor agonists imetit (EC 50 25 nM) and clobenpropit (EC 50 72 nM) could mimic histamine effect in inducing eosinophil shape change. Histamine (0. 01 – 100 μM) induced upregulation of adhesion molecules CD 11 b/CD 18 (Mac- 1) and CD 54 (ICAM- 1) on eosinophils. This effect was mediated by the H 4 receptor and could be blocked by H 4 receptor antagonists JNJ 7777120 and thioperamide. Histamine (0. 01 – 10 μM) induced eosinophil chemotaxis with an EC 50 of 83 nM. This effect was mediated by the H 4 receptor and could be blocked by H 4 receptor antagonists JNJ 7777120 (IC 50 86 nM) and thioperamide (IC 50 519 nM). Histamine (0. 5 μM) also enhanced the eosinophil shape change induced by other chemokines. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new mechanism of eosinophil recruitment driven by mast cells via the release of histamine. Using specific histamine receptor ligands, we have provided a definitive proof that the H 4 receptor mediates eosinophil chemotaxis, cell shape change and upregulation of adhesion molecules. The effect of H 4 receptor antagonists in blocking eosinophil infiltration could be valuable {{for the treatment of}} allergic diseases. The histamine-induced shape change and upregulation of adhesion molecules on eosinophils can serve as biomarkers for clinical studies of H 4 receptor antagonists...|$|R
40|$|Unshaped {{refractories}} {{are superior}} over <b>shaped</b> <b>refractories</b> with respect of ease installation, durability, safety, cheaper, joint less or minimum joint structure and so on. In unshaped refractories, High- alumina cements (HACs) {{are the main}} binder and are currently most in demand. In {{the first generation of}} unshaped refractory the HACs were the one and only binding agent used. The good corrosion resistance and refractory properties of HAC account for its wide use in refractory concretes. The major mineral phases present in HACs are Monocalcium aluminate (CA), Monocalcium dialuminate (CA 2), Dodecacalcium heptaaluminate (C 12 A 7) and á-Al 2 O 3. Depending on the prescribed setting times and mechanical properties of unshaped refractories in accordance with their application area, the quality or desired characteristics of HACs changes. All the properties of HACs depend only on its mineralogical phase composition. Just as CA phase is responsible for development of highest strength among all other Calcium Aluminate phases and relatively reduces the time during hydration. So for the achievement of desired characteristics or properties of the refractory or HACs the major concern must be taken in its phase composition. So in the present work attempt has been made to prepare HACs by varying operating parameter such as starting composition, raw materials and sintering temperature (during manufacturing) and study the effect of mineralogical composition of those cements on the properties of final product (refractory castable). In the preparation of HACs, alumina content and alumina sources (partially) were varied and sintering was done at two different temperatures 1430 oC and 1470 oC.

40|$|Ever-increasing {{demand and}} {{application}} of unshaped <b>refractories</b> replacing <b>shaped</b> ones have inspired the scientists and manufacturers to investigate these materials in depth for further improving the quality and performance. Among the various unshaped refractories, castables lead in all the areas of research, development, manufacturing and application. Physical, mechanical, chemical and thermo-mechanical characteristics of various castable systems {{as well as their}} processing and bonding mechanisms are the focus of such investigations. Among the different bonding materials, calcium aluminate cement (CAC) is most common, but the introduction of CaO in the refractory castable system by the use of CAC produces low melting phases on reaction with Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 of the refractory systems and finally resulting in poor high temperature properties. To avoid the crisis, decrease in cement content and use of alternate bonding system were widely experimented. Among alternate bonding materials, development of sol-gel technique has opened a new horizon in bonding system for refractory technologists. The principle behind sol-gel bonding is the formation of a 3 -dimensional network (gel) of particles that surrounds the refractory materials and which on subsequent heating develop strength by formation of ceramic bonding through sintering. In the present work, four different precursor sol systems have been synthesized, namely alumina, boehmite, mullite, and spinel by wet chemical synthesis. The sol systems were chosen {{in such a way that}} they generate high temperature withstanding refractory oxides on firing (alumina, mullite, and spinel). These synthesized sols are used as a sole binder in high alumina castable systems, with two different particle size distributions, containing no cement. The castables were processed conventionally and evaluated at different temperatures for the various refractory properties. Phase analysis and microstructural development are also studied to investigate the reasoning for the development of the properties. These synthesized sol based castable compositions were further compared with commercially available silica sol and cement-containing compositions using similar raw materials, particle size distributions and processed under exactly similar conditions. The synthesized sol bonded castables showed well-sintered density and strength compared to traditional cement and silica sol bonded castables. The densities (3. 0 - 3. 2 g/cc) obtained signifies a well compact microstructure, as also observed in the microstructural analysis. Considerably high hot strength and higher thermal shock and corrosion resistances were observed for the developed sol containing compositions, higher than the commercial binders, mainly due to the absence of any impurity phase. Among the developed sol bonding systems, mullite and spinel sols were found to have improved hot properties and greater resistances against corrosion and thermal shock. All the developed sol containing compositions showed no deformation or any considerable shrinkage even on firing at 16500 C, indicating its application at and above this temperature without any difficulty. However, conventional cement and silica containing compositions resulted in poor properties due to the formation of low melting compounds in the system...|$|R

In current practice, at end-of-life different types of refractories are mixed resulting in material that is only suitable for low grade applications or landfilling. for high value reuse as refractory raw materials, the mixed refractory waste must be sorted into high purity fractions of distinct refractory types based on the chemical composition. The ongoing European FP 7 project REFRASORT aims to develop an automated sorting technology to separate up to 8 types of waste refractory bricks into pure material fractions under industrial conditions. The refractory types that are targeted represent > 90 % of all <b>shaped</b> <b>refractories,</b> and fall into three main classes (magnesia-based, doloma-based, alumina-based) with further subdivisions based on C and Al content. The REFRASORT system consists of different steps, namely: 1) pre-treatment (dust and metal removal), 2) inlining, 3) identification and 4) mechanical sorting. This contribution focuses on the metal removal and identification steps. As {{a result of the}} use and handling, a surface alteration layers is present on the spent refractory bricks. This layer, which is generally 100 – 200 μm thick but may reach up to 1 mm at surfaces that were in direct contact with the molten metal and slag, complicates the search for a suitable identification technique. Feasibility tests showed that most sensor techniques based on surface measurements, such as colour sensors, LIF, XRF and FTIR are not suited for reliable identification. The most promising technique for reliable identification of spent refractories was found to be the LIBS (Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy), but it too experiences difficulties to identify metal and C containing bricks due to the inherent properties of the spent refractories. Feasibility tests with a portal-type metal detector have shown promising results to sort out metal and C containing bricks simultaneously. These results are presented in this paper...|$|R

David Huson {{and colleagues at}} the Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England are conducting a project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council to continue their research into the 3 D printing of ceramic materials. Many ceramic manufacturing companies use 3 D CAD software and 3 D printing technologies to produce design concept models for evaluation, although the value to the design process is limited due {{to the type of}} materials that can be printed, conventional modelling and processing methods still need to be used to achieve a design concept model in a real material. In the UK ceramic industry, one of the companies at the forefront of these developments is Denby Pottery, a leading tableware manufacturer; they use several Z Corporation printers in their design studio to aid in the development of new design concepts. They are extremely positive about these technologies and cite great advantages in terms of time, cost and design flexibility. Denby are seeking a concept model process that gives a prototype that looks and feels like the final product and which can be fully tested for functionality glaze and decoration. In collaboration with Denby Pottery as the industrial partner the research project has refined and enhanced the 3 D ceramic printing process already developed at the University of the West of England, and has enabled the production of concept models of new design ideas in a real ceramic material, printed directly from CAD data, fired, glazed and decorated. Conventionally, highly vitrified thin section bodies such as stoneware, bone china and porcelain used in tableware require the use of profile setters during firing to maintain the integrity of the shape. Profile setters are purpose built ceramic supports that have a similar expansion and contraction rate to the object they are supporting.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the program was}} to optimize refractory materials and foundry processing used in casting steel. This objective was to be met by completing the following: (1) Surveying the steel foundries both through paper/electronic surveys sent to North American steel foundries as well as plant visits to participants. Information concerning refractory selection and performance as well as refractory and steelmaking practices provides a baseline for future comparison and to identify opportunities for substantial improvement in energy efficiency. (2) Conducting post-mortem analysis of materials from existing refractory/steelmaking practices to determine wear/failure mechanisms. (3) Identify areas for research on developing refractories for use in steel foundry furnaces, adjusting steelmaking practices to improve efficiency and modifying slag practices to improve refractory performance. The {{overall objective}} of the steel foundry refractory lining optimization program was to review established refractory and steelmaking practices to identify opportunities for improvements that would yield substantial energy savings for steel foundries. Energy savings were expected to arise from improved efficiency of the electric arc furnaces and from reductions in the post-casting welding and grinding that are normally required. Ancillary energy savings related to a reduction in the amount of refractories currently produced {{to meet the needs of}} the steel foundry industry, and a shift from pre-fired materials (<b>shaped</b> <b>refractories)</b> to monolithic refractories that are heat treated ''in situ'' were anticipated. A review of the complete program results indicates that techniques for achieving the overall goal were demonstrated. The main difference between the predicted and the actual achievements relates to the areas from which actual energy savings could be realized. Although reductions in furnace tap temperature would result in a reduction in the power required for melting, such reductions are realized through changes within the ladle transfer portion of the process, through modified ladle pre-heat and refractory insulation. Reductions in clean room energy usage proved very difficult to track, and some questions as to just how much impact refractory related inclusions have on the degree of welding and grinding required for completion of a casting, remain. Post-mortem analysis of casting defects did identify refractory derived inclusions but the greatest concentration of inclusions related to steel reoxidation issue. In almost every instance, the suggested refractory/process modifications were proven to be both technically and economically feasible. The difficulty in implementation of the proposed changes relates to the ''up front'' expense and the learning curve associated with any process modification. These two issues were compounded by production slow downs that are too common in the current market. Such slow downs normally result in less energy efficient processing coupled with reductions in capital or ''up front'' expenditures. A return to historical norms should allow foundries to implement the suggested modifications and then evaluate the overall benefit...|$|R
