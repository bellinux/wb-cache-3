5000|$|As {{the demands}} for rolled steel {{products}} developed, the speeds and loads of the mills increased, {{and the problem of}} adequate roll bearings became more and more acute.First introduced in 1932, MORGOIL bearings were welcomed by the rolling mill industry where <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> problems were hampering the development of faster and more powerful rolling mills. MORGOIL Bearings provided higher load capacities, higher speed capabilities, lower power consumption, and longer life then existing bearing choices ...|$|E
50|$|The typical MORGOIL tapered <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> {{assembly}} {{consists of}} a sleeve with a non-locking tapered bore that facilitates removal of the bearing chock assembly from the <b>roll</b> <b>neck.</b> The sleeve, keyed to the neck to prevent creeping during operation, produces a slight interference fit on the <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> {{by means of the}} push-up force used to mount the bearing on the roll. The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} assembly of stocks, sails, windshaft, brake wheel etc. is supported on two <b>bearings.</b> The <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> supports {{by far the}} largest fraction of the weight. This is a plain bearing which supports the majority of the vertical component of the weight of the {{rotating assembly}}. The bearing block is of solid brass construction and is lubricated with animal fat. The shaft lays in a shallow groove of the <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> block and is kept in position by the weight of the rotating assembly. The tail bearing supports the remainder of the vertical weight and any (horizontal) thrust generated by the wind. The <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> does not react any thrust forces.|$|R

50|$|Tolypocladium inflatum is occurs most {{commonly}} in soil or leaf litter, particularly at high latitudes in cold soils. The species {{is characterized by}} spherically swollen phialides that are terminated with narrow <b>necks</b> <b>bearing</b> subglobose conidia. Tolypocladium inflatum is highly tolerant of lead (Pb) and {{has been found to}} dominate the mycota of lead-contaminated soils. A study conducted by Baath et al. found that 35% of the fungal isolates recovered from lead-laden soil were T. inflatum.|$|R
50|$|While most {{focus in}} the bearing is on the load {{carrying}} components, locking is equally as important since these components must be held securely on the <b>roll</b> <b>neck.</b> HB (hydraulic bayonet) locking was introduced in 1980 provides safe and repeatable performance. Later locking concepts such as the RM (removable mount) and CB (compact bayonet) have been more recently introduced, but they all share hydraulic mount and dismount functions.|$|R

50|$|The {{octagonal}} cast-iron windshaft has two square sections {{to take a}} Head Wheel and Tail Wheel as was {{its intended}} purpose in a post mill, and was moved to Upminster from a post mill near Maldon in 1899 to replace one broken during a storm. It carries a 10 ft diameter composite Brake Wheel with eight cast-iron arms and six wooden cants. The Brake Wheel has 78 cogs. The <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> of the windshaft is a roller bearing, fitted after the mill ceased working commercially.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} three-segment loop-like damage of sleeve under rolling load case, to quantitatively analyze bearing failure mechanism, a {{mathematical}} model of oil-film bearing for producing the 3 -D contact pressure and shear stress distribution between sleeve and <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> was developed by 3 D elastic contact boundary element method. Some programs for automatically creating 3 -D surface grid model {{have been developed to}} check data and display deformation, as well as to plot the deformation fields of roller and sleeve. Analytical results provide an effective way to decrease wear and adhesive damage of sleeve, and help to increase the load capacity of oil-film bearing and service life as well...|$|R
2500|$|Buxhall Mill {{was built}} by William Bear, the Sudbury {{millwright}} {{at a cost of}} £506 6s 9d. The lower three storeys formed the base of a smock mill which stood on the site previously. The mill was worked by wind until [...] November 1929 when the sails were damaged in a storm. The swing-pot <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> was removed and sold to John Bryant of Pakenham mill. It was eventually installed in that mill in 1950 by Amos Clarke, the Ipswich millwright. In the 1940s Buxhall mill was stripped of its millstones and refitted as an engine driven mill, in which form it worked until 1971. The mill had lost its cap by 1971, with the cap frame remaining {{on the top of the}} tower.|$|R
50|$|Morgan Construction Company built a {{test stand}} that held a {{completely}} instrumented full size mill bearing in the 1990s. Proprietary {{research conducted by}} the Morgan Construction Company from 1999-2001 showed that mill bearings operated on the principals of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHD), where the elasticity of the structure {{plays a significant role}} in the size and shape of the pressure field that supports the bearing. In the case of tapered <b>neck</b> <b>bearings,</b> very small deflections in the sleeve in the load zone of the bearing allow the bearing to redistribute the pressure field in a manner that increases support area and significantly reduces peak pressure in the oil film. Oil film thickness is also significantly larger than predicted by hydrodynamic theory.|$|R
50|$|Pakenham Mill {{was built}} in 1831. Clement Goodrich was the miller in 1846, when he took on an apprentice. The mill came into the {{ownership}} of the Bryant family in 1885. A steam engine was used as auxiliary power. In 1947, the mill was nearly tail-winded, but the miller managed to turn the cap in time to avoid this happening. The mill was restored in 1950, with a new weatherbeam fitted by Amos Clarke, the Ipswich millwright. At this time the swing-pot <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> from Buxhall mill was installed. A second-hand stock from Thurston post mill was fitted at this time and a gallery constructed around the cap. The gallery was based on that at Wendover mill, Buckinghamshire. New sails were also fitted.|$|R
50|$|The urban {{district}} council adopted an unofficial {{coat of arms}} consisting of a shield bearing crossed swords between a red rose of Lancaster and a white rose of York and the Greek letter omega. This design represented the Battle of Barnet, the final battle in the Wars of the Roses. The chief or top third of the shield showed a fleur de lys between two flory crosses, emblems of St Mary, {{the patron saint of}} the ancient parish of East Barnet. In 1955 this became the basis for an official grant from the College of Arms. A crest was added above the shield: a hart from the arms of Hertfordshire County Council, with a shield hanging from the <b>neck</b> <b>bearing</b> the cross of St Alban for the historical associations of the Abbey of St Albans with the area. The motto adopted: Willingness Rids Way, was from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3. It comes from a speech made by Edward IV following the Battle of Barnet.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered <b>Roll</b> <b>Neck,</b> thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|R
