40|$|Abstract. The {{flammability}} {{of living}} vegetation {{is influenced by}} a variety of factors, including moisture content. physical structure and chemical composition. The <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> of ornamental vegetation is of interest to homeowners seeking to make their homes ‘fire safe’. The relative importance of the factors influencing fire behaviour characteristics, such as flammability, is unknown. In the present study, oxygen consumption calorimetry was used to obtain selected combustion characteristics of ornamental vegetation. Peak heat release rate, mass loss rate, time to ignition and effective heat of combustion of 100 × 100 -mm samples of foliage and small branches were measured using a bench-scale cone calorimeter. Green and oven-dry samples of 10 species were collected and tested seasonally for a period of 1 year. Similar measurements were made on whole shrubs in an intermediate-scale calorimeter. The range of cone calorimeter peak heat release rates for green and oven-dry samples was 1 - 176 and 49 - 331 kW m- 2, respectively. Moisture content significantly reduced heat release rates and increased time to ignition. Peak heat release rates for Olea europea and Adenostoma fasciculatum were consistently highest over the year of testing; Aloe sp. consistently had the lowest heat release rate. The correlation of peak heat release rater measured by the cone calorimeter and an intermediate-scale calorimeter was statistically significant yet low (0. 5 1) The use of the cone calorimeter as a tool to establish the <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> rating for landscape vegetatio...|$|E
40|$|Promoted {{ignition}} testing (NASA Test 17) [1] is used {{to determine}} the <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> of metal rods in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. A promoter {{is used to}} ignite a metal sample rod, initiating sample burning. If a predetermined length of the sample burns, beyond the promoter, the material is considered flammable at the condition tested. Historically, this burn length has been somewhat arbitrary. Experiments were performed to better understand this test by obtaining insight into the effect a burning promoter has on the preheating of a test sample. Test samples of several metallic materials were prepared and coupled to fast-responding thermocouples along their length. Thermocouple measurements and test video were synchronized to determine temperature increase with respect to time and length along each test sample. A recommended flammability burn length, based on a sample preheat of 500 F, was determined based on the preheated zone measured from these tests. This length was determined to be 30 mm (1. 18 in.). Validation of this length and its rationale are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present PhD study is to determine risk indices to prevent and fight forest fires in the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) area Thrakomakedones (Athens, Greece), using analytical methods and lab-scale techniques, {{in connection with the}} topographic and meteorological data. The {{objective of}} the first work is to determine the forest species relative particle foliar combustibility, using thermal analysis (TG, DTG and SDTA) under oxygen atmosphere, calorimetry and a new lab-scale flame spread test. Based on the thermal-calorimetry analysis and flame spread test data, the examined forest species were ranked into categories. Thus, the most combustible fuel was Pinus halepensis and the least one was Cistus incanus. A method was developed to measure the relative particle ignitability (spontaneous and pilot) of forest species using thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) and limiting oxygen index (LOI) techniques. The relationships of spontaneous with pilot ignition and ignitability with other flammability parameters (i. e., combustion duration), were investigated. Based on the above ignitability measurements the examined forest species were ranked into categories. Thus, the most ignitable fuel was forest litter and the least one Pistacia lentiscus. Moreover, the particle and plant flammability of various forest species have been determined, using analytical and lab-scale tests. The analytical technique chosen was differential thermogravimetry (DTG), under air flow conditions, and the lab-scale ones were limiting oxygen index (LOI) and flame spread tests. Based on the above techniques, a method was developed for measuring all particle and plant flammability parameters: ignitability, combustibility, sustainability and consumability. Comparing the particle with the plant flammability we found that particles are more flammable than the leaves. However, the <b>relative</b> particle <b>flammability</b> is very close to the <b>relative</b> plant <b>flammability.</b> The main purpose of the last work is to evaluate and combine various thermochemical parameters deriving from lab scale, analytical scale fire tests and field data (i. e., calorific values, flame spread rate at different inclinations, flame intensity values, meteorological data, elementary chemical composition and heavy metal contents) for determining risk indices to prevent and fight forest fires in the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) area Thrakomakedones (Athens, Greece). Two indices were calculated: (a) Bioclimatic Flammability Index (BFI), based on meteorological data and calorific values and (b) Flammability Inclination Index (FII), based on flame spread rate values at different inclinations.

40|$|Assessment of the {{flammability}} of ornamental vegetation (particularly hedges) planted around houses {{is necessary}} {{in light of the}} increasing urbanization of the wildland-urban interfaces (WUIs) and the high fire occurrence in such areas. The structure and flammability of seven of the species most frequently planted as hedges in Provence (South-eastern France) were studied at particle level. Spatial repartition of the different types of fuel particles within plants was assessed by means of the Cube Method. The leaf flammability was assessed using an epiradiator as a burning device and measurements of foliar physical characteristics and gross heat of combustion (GHC) helped to explain the results of burning experiments. Co-inertia analysis revealed that species with thin leaves were quick to ignite (Pyracantha coccinea, Phyllostachys sp.) and species with high leaf GHC burned the longest (Pittosporum tobira, Nerium oleander). Species presenting high ignitability (Photinia fraseri, Phyllostachys sp. and Pyracantha coccinea) were characterised by high foliar surface area-to-volume ratio, and species presenting lower ignitability were characterised by high GHC (Pittosporum tobira, Nerium oleander, Cupressus sempervirens). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the flammability variables (ignition frequency, time-to-ignition and flaming duration) categorized the <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> of the seven species (including dead Cupressus sempervirens) in five clusters of species from poorly flammable (Pittosporum tobira) to extremely flammable (dead Cupressus sempervirens).

40|$|A {{simple method}} was {{developed}} to determine the <b>relative</b> particle foliar <b>flammability</b> and heat content of forest fuels. The apparatus used {{was similar to the}} one described by the 79 / 831 European Commission Directive for measuring the relative self-ignition temperature (minimum ambient temperature at which a certain volume of a substance ignites under defined conditions). The forest materials examined were: Cupressus sempervirens (Italian cypress), Olea europaea (Olive tree), Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine), Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic tree), Quercus coccifera (Holly oak). These species are very common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The relative data determined (self-ignition temperature, ignition delay times, combustion duration, etc.) provide a simple screening test on the fire hazard properties of forest species, which could be used for comparison purposes. Among the forest species examined, Pinus brutia had the highest relative ignition temperature and the longest ignition delay time, while Pistacia lentiscus had the lowest and shortest ones. Also, Quercus coccifera and Pistacia lentiscus had the highest heat content and Olea europaea the lowest one. Finally, Cupressus sempervirens was the most combustible and Pinus halepensis the most sustainable fuel. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|With its {{founding}} in 1975, Committee G- 4 of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) embarked {{on the process of}} defining the flammability of metallic materials in oxygen-enriched atmospheres. In this process, they are joined by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA). Although none of these organizations has explicitly defined flammability, the following definitions and statements provide a composite understanding of the concept: 1. "This Standard Guide (ASTM G 94 - 92) is concerned primarily with the properties of a material associated with its relative susceptibility to ignition and propagation of combustion. " 2. "A material is considered flammable at the maximum use pressure if at least one sample burns more than 6 in. (15. 2 cm). At least, five samples must be tested. " NASA 3. "Flammable: Capable, when ignited of maintaining combustion under the specified environmental conditions. " NFPA 53. 4. "Combustion: A complex sequence of chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the evolution of heat, and usually, the emission of light. " NFPA 53. and 5. "A safe oxygen-piping transmission or distribution system is one that is designed and installed in accordance with all applicable codes and regulations for the service conditions and locations involved and further meets the special requirements for oxygen services. " CGA-G 4 Flammability thus equates, after ignition, to propagation of combustion, synonymous with steady state burning, under specified environmental conditions. Properties for which quantitative values are given in ASTM G 94 - 92 and which are used to describe metals flammability consistent with the concept of steady state burning are either system independent properties, such as, enthalpies of reaction, burn ratios, flame temperatures, thermal conductivity, and heat release; or system dependent properties, such as, oxygen index, promoted combustion, threshold pressure and burn rates.

40|$|In fire-prone ecosystems, {{many plants}} possess traits that enhance their <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> and ecologists have {{suggested}} increased flammability could result from natural selection. To date, theoretical models addressing {{the evolution of}} flammable characteristics assume that flammable plants realize some direct fitness advantage. In this paper, we explore the idea that enhanced flammability can increase in frequency in a population without any direct fitness benefit to the flammable type. In our model, flammability evolves due to an association between an allele that promotes flammability and alleles at unlinked loci that give high fitness. In analogy to genetic hitchhiking, in which a deleterious allele can invade due to a genetic linkage, we call this process ‘‘genetic niche-hiking,’ ’ because the association results from localized niche construction. Specifically, flammable plants sacrifice themselves and their neighbors to produce local fire-cleared gaps (the constructed niche) in which their offspring are able to continually track an ever-changing environment. Niche-hiking requires that mating, dispersal and niche construction all occur locally (i. e. the population is spatially structured), such that offspring are likely to experience the niches their parents construct. Using a spatially-explicit lattice-based simulation, we find that increased flammability can evolve despite the ‘‘self-killing’ ’ cost of such a trait. Genetic niche-hiking may also be applicable {{to the evolution of}} other traits in spatially structured ecological systems such as plant disease susceptibility and forest tree characteristics that influence gap production...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposed qualitative framework {{to discuss the}} heterogeneous burning of metallic materials, through parameters and factors that influence the melting rate of the solid metallic fuel (either in a standard test or in service). During burning, the melting rate {{is related to the}} burning rate and is therefore an important parameter for describing and understanding the burning process, especially since the melting rate is commonly recorded during standard flammability testing for metallic materials and is incorporated into many <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> ranking schemes. However, whilst the factors that influence melting rate (such as oxygen pressure or specimen diameter) have been well characterized, {{there is a need for}} an improved understanding of how these parameters interact as part of the overall melting and burning of the system. Proposed here is the ‘Melting Rate Triangle’, which aims to provide this focus through a conceptual framework for understanding how the melting rate (of solid fuel) is determined and regulated during heterogeneous burning. In the paper, the proposed conceptual model is shown to be both (a) consistent with known trends and previously observed results, and (b) capable of being expanded to incorporate new data. Also shown are examples of how the Melting Rate Triangle can improve the interpretation of flammability test results. Slusser and Miller previously published an ‘Extended Fire Triangle’ as a useful conceptual model of ignition and the factors affecting ignition, providing industry with a framework for discussion.

40|$|In {{order to}} supply {{eucalypt}} pulpwood to an expanding woodchip industry the silvicultural management practice of clearfelling followed by slash-burning was {{adopted in the}} dry eucalypt forests on dolerite in southeastern Tasmania. To provide data on the vegetation and fuel dynamics following dry forest utilisation, a study area with comparable sites that were (a) unlogged, (b) clearfelled, (c) clearfelled and slash-burned, was monitored over a 24 month period. Detailed records were made of plant species composition and cover on floristically similar permanent plots {{on each of these}} sites. Fuel levels, fuel structure and fuel composition were measured at the study area, and at other East Coast sites of varying ages since slash-burning. A monthly bird census was conducted in the main experimental area to establish the inter-relationships of the avifauna with particular plant species and habitats. Following clearfelling there was found to be marked variation in the growth response of plant species, due to environmental situation, degree of disturbance, and intensity of slash-burn. Moreover, the effect of these factors on individual species was greatly influenced by selective grazing and browsing, predominantly by native fauna. The combination of burning and predation tended to favour unpalatable species which recovered rapidly by vegetative means. The succession of plant species following fire in dry forest communities most closely approximated the initial floristic composition model. Most of the plant species recovered rapidly with a progressive increase in species richness {{for at least two years}} after disturbance. Slash-burning was found to reduce the levels of fine fuel (2. 0 cm in diameter or thickness) left as a result of clearfelling, but the practice was ineffective in reducing the volume of coarse fuel (2. 0 cm in diameter or thickness). However, over time, this relative reduction of fine fuel was only persistent in the compacted ground fuel layer, as the regenerating stand rapidly recovered the above-ground, vertical fine fuel structure. Experiments were conducted on various dry forest and wet forest plant species and fuel components, in order to establish their energy content and <b>relative</b> <b>flammability.</b> It was found that eucalypt dry forest species and fuel components had the highest energy content and the greatest tendency to propagate fire, whereas species from wet forest and Casuarina dry forest communities propagated fire less readily. Species from dry habitats had, in general, low ash contents, high energy levels, high volatile oil contents and low moisture contents. Wet habitat species had high percentages of moisture and ash. As a result, general support could be given to the hypothesis that natural selection has favoured flammable characteristics in fire-dependent plant communities. The gains from the retention of natural eucalypt regeneration after clearfelling (i. e. forest management in the absence of hot, slash-burns) may generally offset the short-term advantage of reduced fire hazard which results from slash-burning...|$|E
40|$|The World Heritage listed {{landscapes of}} {{southwest}} Tasmania are an ideal model system for investigating {{the role of}} fire in shaping the distribution of fire-sensitive and fire-adapted vegetation communities. Two models of vegetation dynamics have been put forward to explain the mosaic of rainforest, sclerophyll and treeless moorland vegetation in this region: the alternative stable states model of Jackson (1968) and the sharpening switch model of Mount (1979). Drawing on the concepts in these models, this aims of this thesis were to (a) contribute new evidence on the decadal, century and millennial scale dynamics of southwest Tasmanian vegetation communities and (b) investigate the role of interactions between fire, vegetation, soil and the physical environment in determining observed vegetation dynamics. The application of geospatial statistics to mapped distributions of rainforest vegetation and the spatial pattern of four very large fires confirmed that the distribution of fire-sensitive rainforest is related to topographic fire refugia. Topography clearly {{plays an important role}} in mediating the feedbacks between fire and vegetation in southwest Tasmania. This study also provided the first integrated data on the <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> of the major vegetation communities at the landscape scale. Repeat image analysis of aerial photographs (1948, 1988) and satellite imagery (2010) revealed that forest and non-forest vegetation communities have been largely stable over the last sixty-two years. Decadal scale fluctuations near forest boundaries were related to recovery from stand replacing fire and the very slow encroachment of trees into moorland. Analyses of soil samples collected across stable forest boundaries suggested that firevegetation- soil feedbacks may contribute to the maintenance of vegetation communities over time. Evidence from radiocarbon dating showed that interactions involving soils are also influenced by topography and its effect on drainage. This study also showed that stable carbon isotopes in organic soil profiles cannot be used to examine millennial scale vegetation boundary shifts in southwest Tasmania. Dendro-ecology studies revealed that an even-aged cohort of Eucalyptus regnans and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius established after a stand-replacing fire in 1490 - 1510 AD. Therefore, overstorey E. regnans trees can live for well in excess of 500 years. Current models of forest dynamics for southwest Tasmania clearly underestimate the time frame required for century scale transitions from eucalypt forest to rainforest in productive systems. Whilst there is some evidence to support the alternative stable states model for southwest Tasmanian vegetation communities, this support must remain equivocal. Vegetation patterns in southwest Tasmania appear to be predominantly stable at a range of temporal scales and interactions between fire, vegetation, soil fertility and topography are likely to contribute to the resilience of vegetation communities. Transitions between vegetation types can occur, although the time frames for transitions appear to be underestimated by current models. Further investigations into feedback mechanisms, the role of the physical environment and state-transition dynamics are required. The implementation of a well designed vegetation monitoring system is an important step toward our understanding and management of the relationships between fire and vegetation in southwest Tasmania under current and future climates...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{materials}} and oxygen {{can be a}} volatile combination when accompanied by ignition mechanisms. Once ignited, metallic materials can readily burn in high pressure oxygen atmospheres, releasing {{an enormous amount of}} energy and potentially destroying equipment, space missions and resulting in the loss of life. The potential losses associated with these fires led to research into the conditions under which metal fires propagate. Several organisations, including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), have published recommended standard test practices with which to assess the <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> of metallic materials. These promoted ignition tests, so called because samples are ignited with an overwhelming source of energy, are typically used to examine two important parameters as an indication of a metallic material's flammability: Threshold Pressure (TP) and the Regression Rate of the Melting Interface (RRMI). A material's TP is the minimum pressure at which it burns, therefore, TPs of different materials can be compared to assess which materials are most suited for a range of high pressure applications. The RRMI is a useful measure for ranking materials, particularly if they have the same TP, but {{can be used as a}} ranking method irrespective of TP. In addition, it is a crucial parameter to aid in understanding the complex burning process and is one of the few experimental parameters that can be measured. Promoted ignition test standards specify a standard sample geometry to use when performing the test, typically a 3. 2 mm diameter cylindrical rod. The recent addition of a 3. 2 × 3. 2 mm square rod as an optional standard sample geometry raises the issue of how the geometry of a sample affects its flammability. Promoted ignition test results for standard geometries are often applied to assess the flammability risk for the complex geometries of real components within oxygen systems, including regulators, valves, piping etc. Literature shows that sample geometry has a significant effect on material rankings when rankings are based on testing of standard geometries, for example, cylindrical rods, compared to non-standard geometries, for example, sintered filters and meshes. In addition, the RRMI has been shown to be dependent on a sample's cross-sectional area (XA). However, it remains unclear, from a simple heat transfer analysis, why the RRMI is dependent on XA or how the shape of a sample affects its melting rate. These questions are particularly relevant since understanding how sample geometry affects burning contributes to two important research goals: to be able to accurately model and predict the flammability risk of a metallic component without the need for physical testing, and to understand the effects of different sample geometries on their relative flammabilities within the standard tests used. Promoted ignition tests were conducted on iron rods with cylindrical, rectangular and triangular cross sections for a range of XAs. Their RRMIs were measured and analysed using a statistical approach which allowed differences in RRMI to be quantitatively assessed. Statistically significant differences in RRMI were measured for rods with the same XA but of different shape. Furthermore, the magnitude of the difference was dependent on XA. Triangular rods had the fastest RRMIs, followed by rectangular rods and then cylindrical rods. Differences in RRMI based on rod shape are due to heat transfer effects and the dynamic motion of the attached molten mass during the drop cycle. The corners of the rectangular and triangular rods melt faster due to their locally higher Surface Area to Volume ratio (SA/V). This dynamic effect increases the area of contact between the molten mass and the solid rod (solid liquid interface (SLI)) which facilitates increased heat transfer to the rod resulting in a faster RRMI. This finding highlights the importance of the SLI in the heat transfer process. Although the SLI is largely dependent on the XA, the shape of the rod causes subtle changes to the size of the SLI and thus affects heat transfer, burning and observed RRMI. The relationship between rod diameter, test pressure and Extent of Reaction (ER), the proportion of metal that reacts (oxidises) whilst attached to the burning rod, was investigated. During promoted ignition testing of iron rods of varying diameter the detached drops were rapidly quenched by immersion in a water bath. Microanalysis techniques were used to qualitatively assess the ER as a function of pressure and rod diameter. It was found that the pressure dramatically affects ER. High pressure tests resulted in a slag mass consisting of oxide, with no unreacted iron, whereas low pressure tests resulted in a significant fraction of unreacted iron within the slag. This indicates that the ER contributes directly to the observed increase in RRMI with increasing test pressure. At high pressures the ER is not affected by rod diameter, since all available liquid metal reacted, but at low pressures ER is a function of rod diameter, ER decreases as XA increases. This thesis also investigates the analysis of promoted ignition test data through suitable statistical methods. Logistic regression is identified as an appropriate method for modelling binary burn/no-burn test data. The relationship between the reaction probability, defined as the probability that a sample will undergo sustained burning, and pressure, is evaluated for two different data sets. The fits of the logistic regression models are assessed and found to model the available data well. The logistic regression method is contrasted with the confidence levels associated with binary data based on the Bernoulli distribution. It is concluded that a modelling approach is beneficial in providing an overall understanding of the transition between pressures where no burning occurs and pressures where burning is expected...|$|E
40|$|Metallic {{materials}} {{exposed to}} oxygen-enriched atmospheres – as {{commonly used in}} the medical, aerospace, aviation and numerous chemical processing industries – represent a significant fire hazard which must be addressed during design, maintenance and operation. Hence, accurate knowledge of metallic materials flammability is required. Reduced gravity (i. e. space-based) operations present additional unique concerns, where the absence of gravity {{must also be taken}} into account. The flammability of metallic materials has historically been quantified using three standardised test methods developed by NASA, ASTM and ISO. These tests typically involve the forceful (promoted) ignition of a test sample (typically a 3. 2 mm diameter cylindrical rod) in pressurised oxygen. A test sample is defined as flammable when it undergoes burning that is independent of the ignition process utilised. In the standardised tests, this is indicated by the propagation of burning further than a defined amount, or „burn criterion [...] The burn criterion in use at the onset of this project was arbitrarily selected, and did not accurately reflect the length a sample must burn in order to be burning independent of the ignition event and, in some cases, required complete consumption of the test sample for a metallic material to be considered flammable. It has been demonstrated that a) a metallic material. s propensity to support burning is altered by any increase in test sample temperature greater than ~ 250 - 300 oC and b) promoted ignition causes an increase in temperature of the test sample in the region closest to the igniter, a region referred to as the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ). If a test sample continues to burn past the HAZ (where the HAZ is defined as the region of the test sample above the igniter that undergoes an increase in temperature of {{greater than or equal to}} 250 oC by the end of the ignition event), it is burning independent of the igniter, and should be considered flammable. The extent of the HAZ, therefore, can be used to justify the selection of the burn criterion. A two dimensional mathematical model was developed in order to predict the extent of the HAZ created in a standard test sample by a typical igniter. The model was validated against previous theoretical and experimental work performed in collaboration with NASA, and then used to predict the extent of the HAZ for different metallic materials in several configurations. The extent of HAZ predicted varied significantly, ranging from ~ 2 - 27 mm depending on the test sample thermal properties and test conditions (i. e. pressure). The magnitude of the HAZ was found to increase with increasing thermal diffusivity, and decreasing pressure (due to slower ignition times). Based upon the findings of this work, a new burn criterion requiring 30 mm of the test sample to be consumed (from the top of the ignition promoter) was recommended and validated. This new burn criterion was subsequently included in the latest revision of the ASTM G 124 and NASA 6001 B international test standards that are used to evaluate metallic material flammability in oxygen. These revisions also have the added benefit of enabling the conduct of reduced gravity metallic material flammability testing in strict accordance with the ASTM G 124 standard, allowing measurement and comparison of the <b>relative</b> <b>flammability</b> (i. e. Lowest Burn Pressure (LBP), Highest No-Burn Pressure (HNBP) and average Regression Rate of the Melting Interface(RRMI)) of metallic materials in normal and reduced gravity, as well as determination of the applicability of normal gravity test results to reduced gravity use environments. This is important, as currently most space-based applications will typically use normal gravity information in order to qualify systems and/or components for reduced gravity use. This is shown here to be non-conservative for metallic materials which are more flammable in reduced gravity. The flammability of two metallic materials, Inconel® 718 and 316 stainless steel (both commonly used to manufacture components for oxygen service in both terrestrial and space-based systems) was evaluated in normal and reduced gravity using the new ASTM G 124 - 10 test standard. This allowed direct comparison of the flammability of the two metallic materials in normal gravity and reduced gravity respectively. The results of this work clearly show, for the first time, that metallic materials are more flammable in reduced gravity than in normal gravity when testing is conducted as described in the ASTM G 124 - 10 test standard. This was shown to be the case in terms of both higher regression rates (i. e. faster consumption of the test sample – fuel), and burning at lower pressures in reduced gravity. Specifically, it was found that the LBP for 3. 2 mm diameter Inconel® 718 and 316 stainless steel test samples decreased by 50 % from 3. 45 MPa (500 psia) in normal gravity to 1. 72 MPa (250 psia) in reduced gravity for the Inconel® 718, and 25 % from 3. 45 MPa (500 psia) in normal gravity to 2. 76 MPa (400 psia) in reduced gravity for the 316 stainless steel. The average RRMI increased by factors of 2. 2 (27. 2 mm/s in 2. 24 MPa (325 psia) oxygen in reduced gravity compared to 12. 8 mm/s in 4. 48 MPa (650 psia) oxygen in normal gravity) for the Inconel® 718 and 1. 6 (15. 0 mm/s in 2. 76 MPa (400 psia) oxygen in reduced gravity compared to 9. 5 mm/s in 5. 17 MPa (750 psia) oxygen in normal gravity) for the 316 stainless steel. Reasons for the increased flammability of metallic materials in reduced gravity compared to normal gravity are discussed, based upon the observations made during reduced gravity testing and previous work. Finally, the implications (for fire safety and engineering applications) of these results are presented and discussed, in particular, examining methods for mitigating the risk of a fire in reduced gravity...|$|E
