40|$|SummaryIn {{flowering}} plants, {{formation of}} the haploid male gametophytes in anthers requires the interaction between <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells</b> and the neighboring somatic cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal the crucial role ofÂ a fasciclin glycoprotein, MICROSPORE AND TAPETUM REGULATOR 1 (MTR 1), in controlling the development of sporophytic and <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells</b> in rice (Oryza sativa). MTR 1 is specifically expressed in the male <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells,</b> yet its mutant exhibits defects in both tapetum and microspore development, causing complete male sterility. We also demonstrate that the fasciclin domains, N-glycolation, and N-terminal signal peptide-mediated plasma membrane localization of MTR 1 are required for normal anther development and pollen fertility. Our findings show that rice male <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells</b> secrete the MTR 1 protein to control the development of <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells</b> and their adjacent somatic cells, thus providing novel insights into the mechanism of plant male reproductive development...|$|R

40|$|Most {{conspicuous}} {{organisms are}} multicellular and most multicellular organisms develop somatic cells to perform specific, non-reproductive tasks. The ubiquity of this {{division of labor}} {{suggests that it is}} highly advantageous. In this paper, I present a model to study the evolution of specialized cells. The model allows for unicellular and multicellular organisms that may contain somatic (terminally differentiated) cells. Cells contribute additively to a quantitative trait. The fitness of the organism depends on this quantitative trait (via a benefit function), the size of the organism, and the number of somatic cells. This model allows one to determine when somatic cells are advantageous and to calculate the optimum number (or fraction) of <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells.</b> I show that the fraction of <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells</b> is always surprisingly high. If somatic cells are very small they can outnumber <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells</b> but their biomass is still less than the biomass of <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells.</b> Only for convex benefit functions can the biomass of somatic cell exceed the biomass of <b>reproductive</b> <b>cells.</b> I discuss the biology of primitive multicellular organisms with respect to the model predictions.

50|$|The {{condition}} 48,XXYY is not inherited; {{it usually}} occurs as a random event during {{the formation of}} reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a <b>reproductive</b> <b>cell</b> with an abnormal number of chromosomes. In 48,XXYY syndrome, the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell. Nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes (one X and two Y chromosomes).

50|$|Eisenia hortensis is an hermaphrodite, it {{has both}} male and female {{reproductive}} organs. In mating, the less strong partner is forced in to the female role which is more 'expensive' in terms of biological reproduction-costs, for a sperm cell is generally less massive and energy demanding than an ovum ("egg cell"), which is the female <b>reproductive</b> <b>cell</b> (gamete) in anisogamous organisms. Two worms join clitella, the large lighter-colored bands which contain the worms' reproductive organs, and which are only prominent during the reproduction process. The two worms exchange sperm. Both worms may secrete cocoons which contain an egg each. These cocoons are lemon-shaped and are pale yellow at first, becoming more brownish as the worms inside become mature. These cocoons are clearly visible to the naked eye.|$|E
5000|$|Sperm is {{the male}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>cell</b> and {{is derived from}} the Greek word (ÏÏÎ­ÏÎ¼Î±) sperma (meaning [...] "seed"). In the types of sexual {{reproduction}} known as anisogamy and its subtype oogamy, there is a marked difference {{in the size of the}} gametes with the smaller one being termed the [...] "male" [...] or sperm cell. A uniflagellar sperm cell that is motile is referred to as a spermatozoon, whereas a non-motile sperm cell is referred to as a spermatium. Sperm cells cannot divide and have a limited life span, but after fusion with egg cells during fertilization, a new organism begins developing, starting as a totipotent zygote. The human sperm cell is haploid, so that its 23 chromosomes can join the 23 chromosomes of the female egg to form a diploid cell. In mammals, sperm develops in the testicles and is released from the penis.|$|E

5000|$|In botany, a zoid or zoÃ¯d [...] is a <b>reproductive</b> <b>cell</b> that {{possesses}} {{one or more}} flagella, and {{is capable}} of independent movement. [...] Zoid can refer to either an asexually reproductive spore or a sexually reproductive gamete. In sexually reproductive gametes, zoids can be either male or female depending on the species. For example, some brown alga (Phaeophyceae) reproduce by producing multi-flagellated male and female gametes that recombine to form the diploid sporangia. [...] Zoids are primarily found in some protists, diatoms, green alga, brown alga, non-vascular plants, and a few vascular plants (ferns, cycads, and Ginkgo biloba). The most common classification group that produces zoids is the heterokonts or stramenopiles. These include green alga, brown alga, oomycetes, and some protists. [...] The term is generally not used to describe motile, flagellated sperm found in animals. Zoid is also commonly confused for zooid which is a single-celled organism {{that is part of}} a colonial animal.|$|E
50|$|Cell {{division}} {{is the process}} by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs {{as part of a larger}} cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a <b>reproductive</b> <b>cell</b> division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis). Meiosis results in four haploid daughter cells by undergoing one round of DNA replication followed by two divisions. Homologous chromosomes are separated in the first division, and sister chromatids are separated in the second division. Both of these cell division cycles are used in the process of sexual reproduction at some point in their life cycle. Both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Prokaryotes undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission, where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cells. All cell divisions, regardless of organism, are preceded by a single round of DNA replication.|$|E
