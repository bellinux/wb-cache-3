A new Land Environment Air Picture Provision Battery (49 (Inkerman) Battery RA), was also established and subordinated to 16 Regiment RA, being commanded by an RAF Squadron Leader but manned by a 50/50 split RAF to RA. The position of Commander Jt GBAD was tied as a Royal Artillery post and Deputy Commander to the RAF. The formation now controlled all GBAD assets in the UK military less for the Air Defence Troop Royal Marines over which it only has training validation authority.
