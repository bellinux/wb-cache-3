40|$|Applied {{electric}} fields {{have previously}} been {{presented as a}} potential method of inducing functional recovery after neural trauma, specifically spinal cord injury. To date, most of this {{research has focused on}} the application of a direct current (dc) stimulus to produce the desired therapeutic electric field and induce preferential neuronal growth. It is proposed that high duty-cycle alternating current stimulation (ac) is capable of inducing similar electric fields within the spinal cord and eliciting a neural response with the added benefits of increased field propagation and lower power consumption. Through ex-vivo tissue testing of porcine spinal columns and Xenopus laevis cell cultures, 80 % duty-cycle ac stimulation was compared to dc stimulation for efficacy in field generation and induction of neurite growth. Results from ex-vivo measurement show that ac stimulation is capable of producing electric fields of greater magnitudes over an increased distance in the spinal cord than dc stimulation at the same current magnitude. Furthermore, stimulation of Xenopus laevis neuronal cultures with 80 % duty-cycle <b>rectangular</b> <b>waves</b> indicated a significant increase in neurite length as compared to non-stimulated controls, growth that was statistically similar to dc stimulated cells.

The same protocol was carried out in another group of volunteers using placebo stimulation (0. 5 Hz) (B).

ACTH and cortisol concentrations show only random variations after both high and low frequency TNS. A positive linear correlation was found between the maximum percentage increase of RIII threshold after high frequency TNS and the maximum percentage increase of BLPH plasma levels occurring 20 min beforehand (r = 0. 856, P less than 0. 001). A less positive correlation was found between RIII and BEP levels (r = 0. 574, P less than 0. 05).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} delta modulated inverters and their applications to submersible motors. Submersible motors are induction motors with unique constructional features. These motors are required to operate {{in one of the}} most harsh environmental conditions. The operating characteristics of the submersible motor pump system require soft starting facility and variable speed operation during production. To satisfy both requirements, a delta modulated inverter supply is proposed for the operation of the submersible motor. Several delta modular schemes have been studied and the <b>rectangular</b> <b>wave</b> delta modulation technique is selected for the switching of the inverter. <b>Rectangular</b> <b>wave</b> delta modulation provides inherent constant voltage/frequency (V/f) characteristic of the supply voltage and current control of the motor. The constant V/f characteristic is provided by the low-pass filter in the feedback loop of the modulator and the current control is provided by the hysteresis window of the quantizing comparator in the feedforward path of the modulator. [...] The modulator and the inverter waveform were studied using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This is simpler than the conventional Fourier series analysis. It is suitable for on-line harmonic analysis of the modulated waveforms. It also gives the information about the sub-harmonics of the modulated waveforms. An on-line harmonic minimization technique using a tuned filter in the delta modulator has been implemented. This method uses the continuous tuning of the feedback filter in the modulator to minimize the low order harmonics of the modulated wave for variable frequency operation of the inverter. [...] The steady state and starting characteristics of the submersible motor supplied from the <b>rectangular</b> <b>wave</b> delta modulated inverter have been studied using time-domain analysis. Time domain analysis of inverter-fed submersible motors was found to be more accurate and easier than the conventional frequency domain analysis. The motor was provided with ramp frequency and voltage (RFV) control to reduce its electrical and mechanical starting stresses. A semi-closed loop operation has been chosen to maintain constant slip operation of the motor. For the semi-closed loop operation, motor speed was estimated using the motor terminal voltage, current and the phase angle between them. [...] The characteristics of the modulator and the motor fed from the <b>rectangular</b> <b>wave</b> delta modulated inverter were experimentally verified...|$|E

40|$|One way to {{maximize}} the sensitivity of an ultrasonic inspection is by establishing the pulser output voltage waveform to provide the maximum possible fraction of its energy in the pass-band of the piezoelectric transducer. An analytical study is reported that is backed up with experimental verification. Two pulser constraints are analyzed in this study. The first constraint is to study the common and easily generated waveform shapes for which each waveform has unit energy and compare to the optimum waveform shape with unit energy that is determined analytically. The second constraint is to repeat the first analysis with waveforms having unit amplitude rather than unit energy. The analysis for the first constraint shows that the numerically intractable problem of summing {{a very large number}} of Fourier coefficients can be replaced by a mathematically equivalent evaluation of the pass-band energy which requires only the integration of smooth functions. This alternative formulation also leads to the result that the optimized waveform is the eigenfunction of a particular integral operator corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The eigenvalue itself gives the maximum attainable passband energy. The optimized waveform is compared with sine <b>waves,</b> <b>rectangular</b> <b>waves,</b> trapezoidal waves, triangle waves and exponential spikes for 1 / 2, 1 and 3 / 2 cycle durations. The analysis for the second constraint shows that the unit amplitude is in the form of an inequality which is outside the realm of the classical calculus of variations. An exact characterization of the optimized waveform was not found but numerical integration techniques were employed to determine the pass-band energies for the waveforms considered under the first constraint. Finally, a breadboard pulser model is constructed and extensive comparisons of the various waveshapes, sensitivity studies, spectral distributions and experimental verification are made for each constraint...|$|R

In some experiments paired measurements of VL and Vc were performed at two abscissas x and x'. The luminal length constant of about 1, 030 pm was shown to provide a good estimate of the transepithelial resistance, specific resistance (Ra'E = 420 ~. cm 2) and/or per unit length (ram = 1. 3 X 104 ~. cm). The apparent intraepithelial length constant was subject to distortions arising from concomitant current spread in the lumen. The resistances of luminal membrane (rL), basolateral membrane (rs), and shunt pathway (rs) were estimated by two independent methods at 3. 5 • 104, 1. 2 • 104, and 1. 7 X 104 ~. cm, respectively. The corresponding specific resistances were close to 1, 200, 600, and 600 ~. cm 2. There are two main conclusions of this study.
