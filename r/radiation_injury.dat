5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect <b>radiation</b> <b>injury,</b> some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for <b>radiation</b> <b>injury,</b> three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E
5|$|Their {{desire to}} return to Bikini was thwarted indefinitely by the U.S. {{decision}} to resume nuclear testing at Bikini in 1954. During 1954, 1956, and 1958, twenty-one more nuclear bombs were detonated at Bikini, yielding a total of , equivalent to more than three thousand Baker bombs. Only one was an air burst, the 3.8 megaton Redwing Cherokee test. Air bursts distribute fallout in a large area, but surface bursts produce intense local fallout. The first after Crossroads was the dirtiest: the 15 megaton Bravo shot of Operation Castle on March 1, 1954, which was the largest-ever U.S. test. Fallout from Bravo caused <b>radiation</b> <b>injury</b> to Bikini islanders who were living on Rongelap Atoll.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma {{radiation}} came directly from the fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct radiation, but died in the firestorm before their <b>radiation</b> <b>injuries</b> would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of <b>radiation</b> <b>injuries.</b> Among injured survivors, 30% had <b>radiation</b> <b>injuries</b> from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|R
50|$|There were 10 {{fatalities}} and 49 {{other people}} suffered <b>radiation</b> <b>injuries.</b>|$|R
25|$|Thermal {{effects are}} the {{predominant}} cause of laser <b>radiation</b> <b>injury,</b> but photo-chemical effects {{can also be}} of concern for specific wavelengths of laser radiation. Even moderately powered lasers can cause injury to the eye. High power lasers can also burn the skin. Some lasers are so powerful that even the diffuse reflection from a surface can be hazardous to the eye.|$|E
25|$|Equipment {{failure is}} one {{possible}} type of accident. In Białystok, Poland, in 2001 the electronics {{associated with a}} particle accelerator used {{for the treatment of}} cancer suffered a malfunction. This then led to the overexposure of at least one patient. While the initial failure was the simple failure of a semiconductor diode, it set in motion a series of events which led to a <b>radiation</b> <b>injury.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal. This {{syndrome}} often follows absorbed {{doses of}} 6–30Gy (600–3000rad). The {{signs and symptoms}} of this form of <b>radiation</b> <b>injury</b> include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above 4Gy. Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common. The death is generally more due to infection than gastrointestinal dysfunction.|$|E

50|$|Ten naval {{personnel}} were killed (8 officers and 2 enlisted men), probably by the explosion itself {{and not from}} <b>radiation</b> <b>injuries.</b> <b>Radiation</b> <b>injuries</b> were observed in 49 people, with 10 developing radiation sickness; the latter figure included mostly firefighters, some of whom sustained doses up to 220 rad (2.2 Gy) external and 400 rem (4 Sv) to the thyroid gland. Of the 2,000 involved in cleanup operations, 290 were exposed {{to high levels of}} radiation compared to normal standards.|$|R
25|$|Central neuropathic pain {{is found}} in spinal cord injury, {{multiple}} sclerosis, and some strokes. Aside from diabetes (see diabetic neuropathy) and other metabolic conditions, the common causes of painful peripheral neuropathies are herpes zoster infection, HIV-related neuropathies, nutritional deficiencies, toxins, remote manifestations of malignancies, immune mediated disorders and physical trauma to a nerve trunk. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer {{as a direct result}} of cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor), or as a side effect of chemotherapy (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), <b>radiation</b> <b>injury</b> or surgery.|$|E
500|$|Only {{pigs and}} rats {{were used in}} the Baker test. [...] All the pigs and most of the rats died. Several days elapsed before sailors were able to reboard the target ships where test animals were located; during that time the {{accumulated}} doses from the gamma rays produced by fission products became lethal for the animals. Since much of the public interest in Operation Crossroads had focused on the fate of the test animals, in September Blandy asserted that radiation death is not painful: [...] "The animal merely languishes and recovers or dies a painless death. Suffering among the animals as a whole was negligible." [...] This was clearly not true. While the well-documented suffering of Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin as they died of <b>radiation</b> <b>injury</b> at Los Alamos was still secret, the widely reported radiation deaths at Hiroshima and Nagasaki had not been painless. [...] In 1908, Dr. Charles Allen Porter had stated in an academic paper, [...] "the agony of inflamed X-ray lesions is almost unequalled in any other disease." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{new method}} to reduce rectal <b>radiation</b> <b>injury</b> in {{prostate}} cancer patients {{involves the use}} of an absorbable spacer placed between the prostate and rectum. [...] Such spacers are commercially available in some regions, and are undergoing clinical trials in others. [...] By temporarily altering [...] the anatomy these products have the potential to allow for improved cancer targeting while minimizing risk to neighboring healthy tissues. [...] Prostate Rectum Spacers should be compatible with all prostate cancer radiotherapy treatments including 3D conformal, IMRT and stereotactic radiation and brachytherapy.|$|E

The effects of <b>radiation</b> combined <b>injury</b> are potentially more lethal than either insult in isolation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine mechanisms of mortality and possible therapeutic targets in <b>radiation</b> combined <b>injury.</b> Mice were exposed to IR with 2. 5 Gray (Gy) followed four days later by intratracheal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). While either IR or MRSA alone yielded 100 % survival, animals with <b>radiation</b> combined <b>injury</b> had 53 % survival (p = 0. 01). Compared to IR or MRSA alone, mice with <b>radiation</b> combined <b>injury</b> had increased gut apoptosis, local and systemic bacterial burden, decreased splenic CD 4 T cells, CD 8 T cells, B cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, and increased BAL and systemic IL- 6 and G-CSF.
