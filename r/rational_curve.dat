Sections one through five and seven closely follow the lectures of J. Koll'ar given at the summer school &quot;Higher dimensional varieties and rational points&quot;. The notes were written up by C.

Thus a variety is an integral separated scheme of finite type over a field (not necessarily algebraically closed). Somewhat inconsistently, by a curve we mean a geometrically reduced (not necessarily irreducible) separated 1 -dimensional scheme of finite type over a field. 1. <b>Rational</b> <b>Curves</b> on Surfaces In this section we study <b>rational</b> <b>curves</b> on surfaces. Our main point is that rational surfaces contain plenty of <b>rational</b> <b>curves</b> (at least when we are over an algebraically closed field).
