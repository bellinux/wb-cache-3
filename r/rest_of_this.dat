For purposes of presentation, these arguments are summarized here rather than in the article Tax protester statutory arguments.

5|$|The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> edition I {{have not}} read, but, {{from the little}} that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|A sequel, titled Toy Story 4, will be {{released}} on June 21, 2019. The film was originally to be directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Josh Cooley. In July 2017, however, {{it was announced that}} Cooley would be the movie's sole director. The film will focus on Bonnie's toys helping Woody to reunite with Bo Peep, who was given away before the events of this film. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kristen Schaal and Laurie Metcalf will reprise their roles of Woody, Buzz, Trixie and Mrs. Davis. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> film's cast may also return. Don Rickles also signed on to return to voice Mr. Potato Head; however, Rickles died during production. It is uncertain how his death will affect Potato Head's role in the fourth film.|$|E
5|$|The Sunwin Stand {{has further}} room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs {{three-quarters of the}} length of the pitch. The <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> side is taken up by a brick building, {{situated}} in the south west corner of the stadium, which houses the club changing rooms and the security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground's 17executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity for up to 700people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop, has room for another 300 people. There is also more office space, a club store, ticket office and museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store will also include a dental surgery, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club.|$|E

5|$|The main {{documentary}} {{source for}} the kings of the Crovan dynasty is the Chronicle of Mann, the only contemporary indigenous narrative-source concerning these men. The source itself survives {{in the form of}} a fourteenth-century Latin manuscript, which is in turn a copy of a chronicle probably first commissioned and composed during the reign of Magnús Óláfsson, King of Mann and the Isles (died 1265). About fifteen percent of the chronicle is devoted to the strife between the half-brothers, and much of the <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> source deals with the after-effects of the conflict. Although the chronicle's account of the half-brothers' struggle appears to be somewhat neutral, its treatment of their descendants is clearly slanted in favour of Óláfr's sons. In fact, it was only during the reign of Óláfr's son Magnús, that the former's sons finally overcame Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson's descendants once and for all. The chronicle, therefore, may have been composed to further legitimise king's descended from Óláfr. In consequence, even the chronicle's claim that Óláfr's father had chosen him as his successor may be suspect. Whatever the case, the chronicle is the main historical {{source for the}} life of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson.|$|E
