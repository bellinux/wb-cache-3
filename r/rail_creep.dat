5000|$|The {{fishplates}} (joint bars) in jointed track may fail, {{allowing the}} rails to pull apart in extremely cold weather; {{this is usually}} associated with uncorrected <b>rail</b> <b>creep.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{new designs}} were successful, but they {{introduced}} many challenges, {{especially as the}} availability of experienced track maintenance staff became acutely difficult, and poorly maintained flat bottom track seemed more difficult to keep in good order than poorly maintained bullhead track. The greater stiffness of flat-bottom was an advantage, but it tended to straighten out between the joints on curves; and flat bottom’s rigidity led to high vertical impact forces at badly maintained joints and this resulted in high volumes of fatigue fractures at the joints. Moreover, the elastic rail fastenings had little resistance to <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> - the propensity of the rails to move gradually {{in the direction of}} traffic, and the workload of pulling back the rails to regulate the joints was surprisingly high.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the work}} of {{maintaining}} the track was at the joints, especially as the stiff rails became dipped, and the joint sleepers took a hammering. Pre-war experiments with long welded rail lengths were built upon, and in the years from 1960 long rail lengths were installed, at first on hardwood sleepers but soon on concrete sleepers. For example, the first long welded rail (almost 1 mi) on the UK's East Coast Main Line was laid in 1957, just south of Carlton-on-Trent, resting on rubber pads to resist <b>rail</b> <b>creep.</b> In this pioneering stage, some catastrophic mistakes in detailed design were made, but from about 1968 continuous welded rail became a reliable standard for universal installation on main and secondary routes. The form adopted used pre-stressed concrete sleepers and a 110A rail section - a slight improvement on the 109 rails previously used - the A was to distinguish it from the British Standard 110 lb/yd rail section, which was unsuitable. Rail fastenings eventually converged onto a proprietary spring clip made by the Pandrol company which was the exclusive form of fastening in Britain for about 30 years.|$|E
40|$|Wheelset is {{the basic}} {{component}} of a railway vehicle system. The wheel set has two wheels rigidly connected by an axle. There are mainly two non-constant values related to the wheelset {{that need to be}} estimated. They are the wheelset’s conicity and creep coefficients. Conicity (X) is a term related to the coning of the wheel tread and its value depends on the track and wheel profiles. For wheelset with profiled wheels, the conicity values is non-linear and depends on the relationship between the wheelset’s rolling radius difference and its lateral displacement Meanwhile, the creep coefficients (fit and fn) are related to the relative velocities of the wheel and the <b>rail.</b> This <b>creep</b> coefficient is non-linearly dependent on the normal force between the wheel and rail, and the value of this force is changing especially during curving. The values of the conicity and creep coefficients as well can be changed by other factors such as surface contamination, varying surface condition and railhead shapes. This project outlines the parameter estimator that can effectively estimate and track the time-varying conicity and creep coefficients. The performances of the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Recursive Instrumental Variable (RIV) used to estimate the conicity and creep coefficients values are compared. Via simulations, it is shown that the conicity and creep coefficients estimation using RLS algorithm takes longer time to converge to the true values {{and at the same time}} contains large amount of bias and oscillation. The RIV method overcome RLS problem in term of convergence and bias but the overshoot produced by this method is larger than RLS method...|$|R
40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} parameters affecting stability of Continuously Welded Rail are rail stress and lateral resistance of the track. It has been identified that Stress Free Temperature of rail plays the most {{important role in the}} understanding, monitoring and managing of rail stress. Railway companies are focussed on finding an effective means of measuring longitudinal rail forces through use of Stress Free Temperature. The effectiveness of commercially available rail stress monitors manufactured by Salient Systems and the <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> measurement method to monitor rail stress in railway systems has been investigated. A field investigation of a section of track at Edungalba in Aurizon’s heavy haul coal network has enabled observation of Stress Free Temperature through several testing methods. The investigation and analysis has led to insights into track behaviour and stress state. The study concluded that the conventional <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> method is useful for general indications of track stress condition and follows a similar trend to rail stress monitor data. It was also concluded that accurate measurement of Stress Free Temperature throughout the entire network through installation of rail stress monitor modules is not a cost-effective solution for the management of rail stress. However, the modules demonstrated an effectiveness to monitor and manage rail stress in targeted problem areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of self-steering bogies in locomotives has occurred without extensive study of traction curving bogie dynamics. It is reported that these bogies {{are unable to}} steer at high tractive effort levels with the performance {{essentially the same as}} rigid bogies. This is due to the required adhesion level approaching wheel rail friction limits and causing creep saturation. Reassessment of the curve steering task in a hauling locomotive has identified that existing concepts of perfect steering [R. M. Goodall and T. X. Mei, Chapter 11 : Active suspensions, in Handbook of Railway Vehicle Dynamics, S. Iwnicki, ed., Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL, USA, 2006], [R. M. Goodall, S. Bruni, and T. X. Mei, Concepts and prospects for actively-controlled railway running gear, Vehicle Syst. Dynam. 44, supplement 1 (2006), pp. 60 - 70] are not appropriate for high traction loads in hauling locomotives. An extensive parametric simulation study has been conducted on steering bogie designs for hauling locomotives. Testing of passive steering bogie designs have shown superior performance from forced steering bogies where steering is only partially dependant on wheel <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> forces. New active steering bogie designs have been proposed [S. Simson, Railway bogie, Australian Provisional Patent Application No. 2007900891, 2007] where steering control is independent of wheel <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> forces. The new designs combine force steering of wheelsets with secondary yaw activation. The parametric study shows that new active steering bogie designs give superior steering performance under traction...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring the {{longitudinal}} rail movement or <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> {{is regarded as}} one of the effective ways to understand the rail-stress states in critical locations such as fixed structures (level crossings,turnouts and fixed top bridges), in sags at the bottom of gradients or any track segment with a history of buckles. However, rail stress can be changed due to thermal and mechanical loads in both longitudinal and vertical directions. Many railway companies use a fixed schedule to assess <b>rail</b> <b>creep,</b> particularly in critical locations. This may not be adequate to reduce the risk of summerbuckling and winter pull-apart problems. Current practice of creep measurement does not consider the effect of rail temperature, the vertical movement of track, inherent inaccuracy of the measurement system and any non-uniformity in track structures. In a field test, Total Station Survey equipment has been used to monitor the changes inlongitudinal and vertical displacements of the rail at points on a tangent track section in the heavy haul Blackwater system of the QR National network at Edungalba. This 26 tonne axle load track section with 1 % gradient and 60 kg/m rail was instrumented with strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress modules. The creep in this section has been quantified in terms of rail strain and rail stress with respect to the rail temperature. In this paper, a method is proposed considering {{the longitudinal}} creep data, vertical displacement of the rail and rail temperature to accurately predict the stress state of a tangent rail track...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the passive}} and active {{steering}} developments of traction bogies have been directed towards {{high speed rail}} or light rail and commuter rail applications. Previous studies ignored coupler forces and often assumed the wheel rail profiles have ample conicity for the curving task. There is little work directed towards high adhesion rates which is a critical area for freight locomotive performance. In heavy haul train operations ruling grades are often associated with tight curvatures, and steering tasks of hauling locomotives are affected by lateral components of longitudinal train forces. Haul locomotives also have a significant yaw moment from coupler forces making uneven longitudinal creeps useful in balancing these yaw forces. The use of larger diameter wheels on locomotives reduces effective steering conicity such that contact profiles may become insufficient to negotiate tight curves. The large diameter wheels make longitudinal creepage or slip inevitable and Goodall et al. [1] definition of perfect steering unattainable. A new criteria for ideal steering in these conditions is proposed. For hauling locomotives, ideal steering is defined as when the lateral <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> and contact loads of each axle in one bogie are equal and longitudinal creeps are positive to the applied traction. This definition is applicable to all curving tasks that a hauling locomotive encounters whilst still applying low wheel <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> forces. In {{most of the cases}} ideal steering can be achieved with zero lateral creep forces. The paper describes equations for quasi-static curving forces including traction and in-train forces. An analysis of curving forces for locomotives with three axle bogies is made with the equations for various curvatures and with haulage locomotives in different train configurations including pusher configuration...|$|E

40|$|Track {{buckling}} is {{a serious}} problem for railways. High longitudinal rail stresses contribute to many problems such as track buckling, rail joint failure, rail breakage and failure of turnouts. The direct and indirect costs of track buckling problems are very high. The influences of rail temperature, SFT and lateral misalignment of track on track buckling need comprehensive investigation. In this paper, an experimental design comprising strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress sensors has been implemented on the QR heavy haul 60 kg/m rail network. A new creep measurement technique using internal rail stress has been developed. The changes in rail neutral temperature due to the variation of actual rail temperature and the occurrence of <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> in straight and curved track is quantified. Modes of differences of SFT in the two rails at a location, and of SFT in straight track and in curved track are discussed. The relationship of SFT to rail temperature is also presented. Daily variation in rail temperature due to ambient air temperature is presented. Field trials showed that SFT can vary by 2 - 30 C during the day. Based on this finding and the derivation of an equation for change of SFT, an improvement in utilising <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> measurements for assessing track condition has resulted. This finding suggests {{that it is possible to}} determine the SFT throughout a day rather than just a single SFT value. This paper also presents a simple track stability management tool that is based on two major parameters, namely rail stress and track resistance. Each parameter in the tool has been given three levels of value to determine the required preventive measures. Overall, the tool decides the need for speed restriction during hot weather based on the quantified parameters from the field trials and rail standards...|$|E

40|$|Buckling of {{railroad}} track {{continues to be}} problematic for railway engineers and maintenance personnel across all railway networks. Thermal forces are the principal longitudinal load on railroad track. In an effort to ensure track stability under dynamic loads, the magnitude to which longitudinal thermal stresses develop {{is controlled by the}} choice of an appropriate Design Neutral Temperature (DNT). The longitudinal movement of rail, referred to as creep, causes a deviation of the rails’ neutral temperature (RNT) from that of the DNT. It is crucial that the RNT is maintained at or near the DNT to provide the necessary leeway for dynamic traffic loads and ensure lateral stability of the track. However, techniques for monitoring the RNT are very limited and difficult to employ. Railway networks generally rely on preventative measures, such as track strengthening work, to control the risk of buckles occurring. This approach to managing the risk of track buckles is resource hungry and time consuming. This project develops a recursive methodology for identifying situations where the longitudinal movement of rail is likely to result in the accumulation of longitudinal stresses, which is conducive to buckling. The methodology has been developed for the Western and South-Western systems of Queensland Rail. The approach presented in this paper focuses on identifying certain trends in <b>rail</b> <b>creep</b> observed at locations that result in the development of stress condition that are conducive to buckling. The trends in the rate and extent of creep displayed at the locations and the locations’ proximity to fixed track structures are used to predict potential high stress areas...|$|E
