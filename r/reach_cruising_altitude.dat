40|$|The {{results of}} a design study {{resulting}} in the proposed CONDOR aircraft are presented. The basic requirements are for the aircraft to maintain continuous altitude at or above 45, 000 feet {{for at least a}} 3 -day mission, be able to comfortably support a two-man crew during this period with their field of vision not obstructed to a significant degree, carry a payload of 200 pounds, and provide a power supply to the payload of 2000 watts. The take-off and landing distances must be below 5000. feet, and time to <b>reach</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude</b> must not exceed 3 hours. The subjects discussed are configuration selection, structural analysis, stability and control, crew and payload accomodations, and economic estimates...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>reached</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>altitude,</b> {{flight level}} 310 (FL310), 22 minutes after departure and attained its target speed of 280 knots (IAS). About two minutes later, {{it began to}} gradually lose speed, and, though the speed did eventually drop to 200 knots, the aircraft maintained FL310. After an unspecified length of time had passed, the aircraft began to descend, and the speed dropped to about 160 knots. Afterwards, the aircraft entered a left-hand turn and began to lose altitude more rapidly, thus spiralling down. The flight data recording stopped at 1:47; at the time, the aircraft was {{at an altitude of}} 1600 ft and a speed of 380 knots. It crashed into the ground at 270 m above sea level about a second later.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{airborne}} {{and having}} <b>reached</b> the <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude,</b> the pilot moves the mixture control from auto rich to auto lean. [...] This reduces fuel flow by closing the passageway through the rich jet. [...] The resulting reduction of flow unbalances the fuel metering diaphragm, causing the {{fuel metering valve}} to change position, thereby reducing fuel flow to the auto lean flow setting.|$|R
50|$|The design {{consisted}} of a fairly conventional autogyro layout, but the wing was disk-like instead of the more traditional helicopter-like bladed assembly. The disk had airfoils formed out of fabric {{on the inside of}} the rim, and four small solid surfaces on the outside. In forward motion the airstream blowing across the four small surfaces would spin the disk, which would provide lift from the fabric airfoils inside. On <b>reaching</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude,</b> the disk would be braked to stop it spinning, and unbraked again for a near-vertical landing. The advantage to this arrangement was that there was no theoretical limit on forward speed, whereas a conventional autogyro cannot be stopped in flight, and has a limit when the speed of the rearward moving blade approaches the stall speed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{proposed}} use for nuclear-powered ramjets {{would be}} to power a cruise missile, called SLAM, for Supersonic Low Altitude Missile. In order to reach ramjet speed, it would be launched from the ground by a cluster of conventional rocket boosters. Once it <b>reached</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> and was far away from populated areas, the nuclear reactor would be made critical. Since nuclear power gave it almost unlimited range, the missile could cruise in circles over the ocean until ordered [...] "down to the deck" [...] for its supersonic dash to targets in the Soviet Union. The SLAM as proposed would carry a payload of many nuclear weapons to be dropped on multiple targets, making the cruise missile into an unmanned bomber. After delivering all its warheads, the missile could then spend weeks flying over populated areas at low altitudes, causing tremendous ground damage with its shock wave and radiation from its unshielded reactor. When it finally lost enough power to fly, and crash-landed, the engine would {{have a good chance}} of spewing deadly radiation for months to come.|$|R
50|$|After {{taking off}} from Heathrow at 19:52, Flight BD 092 was {{climbing}} through 28,300 feet to <b>reach</b> its <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> of 35,000 feet when a blade detached from the fan of the port (left) CFM International CFM56 engine. While the pilots {{did not know the}} source of the problem, a pounding noise was suddenly heard, accompanied by severe vibrations. In addition, smoke poured into the cabin through the ventilation system and a burning smell entered the plane. Several passengers sitting near the rear of the plane noticed smoke and sparks coming from the left engine.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fully {{understand}} the orientation behaviour of migrating birds, {{it is important to}} understand when birds set their travel direction. Departure directions of migratory passerines leaving stopover sites are often assumed to reflect the birds' intended travel directions, but this assumption has not been critically tested. We used data from an automated radiotelemetry system and a tracking radar at Falsterbo peninsula, Sweden, to compare the initial orientation of departing songbirds (recorded by radiotelemetry) with the orientation of songbird migrants in climbing and level flight (recorded by radar). We found that the track directions of birds at high altitudes and in level flight were more concentrated than the directions of departing birds and birds in climbing flight, which indicates that the birds adjust their travelling direction once aloft. This was further supported by a wide scatter of vanishing bearings in a subsample of radio-tracked birds that later passed an offshore radio receiver station 50 km southeast of Falsterbo. Track directions seemed to be more affected by winds in climbing compared with level flights, which may be explained by birds not starting to partially compensate for wind drift until they have <b>reached</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>altitudes...</b>|$|R
50|$|On Thursday 19 July 1951 Eastern Airlines Flight 601 {{departed}} Newark International Airport {{bound for}} Miami International Airport at 14:15. As it passed Philadelphia, at 14:52, the Lockheed Constellation <b>reached</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> of 18000 feet. For the next 25 to 30 minutes violent turbulence accompanied by intermittent periods of hail were encountered. The flight continued past Philadelphia {{for a few}} minutes toward Dover and the captain made a turn to the west in an attempt to avoid as much of the storm area as possible. The flight broke out in a clear area at about 15:17. The flight was able to continue VFR and descended to 8,000 feet. A second squall was encountered in the vicinity of Lynchburg at 15:50. The aircraft was slowed to 185 mph IAS, light turbulence and buffeting were experienced. After breaking out of the storm at 15:54, the buffeting became so severe that the crew believed the aircraft would disintegrate before they could reach Byrd Field (now Richmond International Airport) to attempt an emergency landing. Airspeed was further reduced, but the buffeting continued. Two minutes later, and only a few miles short of the runway, the captain radioed an emergency and the flight descended.|$|R
50|$|The report {{concluded}} that the air start access door is {{what led to the}} vibrations.

The first officer contacted the Northwest Airlines radio operator at 3:05 PM Mountain Standard Time to advise that Flight 2 had <b>reached</b> the <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> of 9,000 feet at 2:53 PM. Ground witnesses reported that as it passed over the Bridger Mountain range (which at the point the aircraft passed over reaches a height of approximately 8,500 feet MSL) the aircraft immediately dropped, went into a stall, glided for a short time, then spun into the ground. The wreckage burst into flames. All aboard died immediately.|$|R

At 19:00, controllers asked Flight 2286 whether {{they wanted to}} make an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach to Durango's runway 2, or a visual approach to Durango's runway 20. From Flight 2286's location, making the ILS landing would have required backtracking to make the approach to runway 2, adding 10 minutes to the flight versus a more direct approach into runway 20. Captain Stephen Silver, who had a reputation as a pilot who could {{make up for lost time}} and attempt to arrive on schedule, chose the visual approach to runway 20 because it would save time. Silver allowed First Officer Ralph Harvey to fly the approach into Durango.|$|R

The pilot in command and the first officer were having a rest at the time. Visibility was good, and the pilots followed the flight of the rocket for more than half a minute. At first they thought it was a Soviet weather rocket on its way to the troposphere, but when it had <b>reached</b> the <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude</b> of the aircraft, it turned and came straight at it.

The doubler plate had a brown nicotine stain {{all the way around}} it that could have been detected visually by any of the engineers when they inspected the plane. The stain would have suggested {{that there might be a}} crack caused by metal fatigue behind the doubler plate, as the nicotine slowly seeped out due to pressure that built up when the plane <b>reached</b> its <b>cruising</b> <b>altitude.</b> The stains were apparently not noticed and no correction was made to the doubler plate.

At 16:10, the air traffic controller informed the flight that it was abeam Palembang and instructed the aircraft to maintain FL350 and to contact Singapore Control upon reaching PARDI. First Officer Ward acknowledged this call. At 16:11, nearly six minutes after the CVR ceased recording, the flight data recorder (FDR) also stopped recording. Mayday shows that Tsu is thought of as having likely came up with an excuse to get Duncan out of the cockpit.
