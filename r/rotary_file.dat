50|$|Rotary filing long predated milling. A <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> by Jacques de Vaucanson, circa 1760, is well known. It {{is clear}} that milling {{machines}} as a distinct class of machine tool (separate from lathes running rotary files) first appeared between 1814 and 1818. The centers of earliest development of true milling machines were two federal armories of the U.S. (Springfield and Harpers Ferry) together with the various private armories and inside contractors that shared turnover of skilled workmen with them.|$|E
50|$|A nickel {{titanium}} (NiTi) <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> is an engine-driven tapered {{and pointed}} endodontic instrument made of nickel titanium alloy with cutting edges used to mechanically shape and prepare the root canals during endodontic therapy or {{to remove the}} root canal obturating material while performing retreatment. The first NiTi file {{was introduced to the}} market in 1991. Superelasticity and shape memory are the properties that make Niti files very flexible. The high flexibility of Niti files makes them superior to stainless steel files for the purpose of rotary root canal preparation. The use of NiTi rotary files in dentistry is a common practice.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEndodontic {{treatment}} in primary teeth {{can be challenging}} and time consuming, especially during canal preparation, which {{is considered one of}} the most important steps in root canal therapy. The conventional instrumentation technique for primary teeth remains the “gold-standard” over hand instrumentation, which makes procedures much more time consuming and adversely affects both clinicians and patients. Recently nickel–titanium (Ni–Ti) <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> have been developed for use in pediatric endodontics. Using rotary instruments for primary tooth pulpectomies is cost effective and results in fills that are consistently uniform and predictable.

Not until 1776 did the Wyatt brothers have a wood-screw factory up and running. Their enterprise failed, but new owners soon made it prosper, and in the 1780s they were producing 16,000 screws a day with only 30 employees—the kind of industrial productivity and output volume that would later be characteristic of modern industry but was revolutionary at the time.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Using one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> {{can result}} in a faster canal preparation. This can be done with several file systems and endodontic motors. In the present study, a newly single file {{technique}} (one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique) with available <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> systems is introduced. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate centering ability and remaining dentin thickness of 2 rotary nickel-titanium systems (Mtwo versus RaCe) and instrumentation techniques (conventional versus one <b>rotary</b> <b>file)</b> by cone-beam computed tomography. Materials and Methods: A total of 76 mandibular molar teeth were selected and divided to 4 groups (n = 19 teeth with 57 canals). The teeth were mounted in resin and pre-instrumentation scans were prepared by Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). The canals instrumented with Mtwo and RaCe rotary files either in conventional or one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique (ORF). After cleaning and shaping of distal and mesial canals, post instrumentation scans were performed by CBCT in the same position as pre instrumentation scans. Centering ability and remaining dentin thickness were evaluated by Planmeca Romexis viewer. The data were analyzed with analysis of variance and post hoc t test (P 0. 05). However, in a few cross-sections, conventional technique and/or RaCe showed higher centering ability. One <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> technique with either RaCe or Mtwo was significantly faster than conventional technique (P = 0. 02). There was no significant difference among groups regarding file fracture. Mesiolingual canals showed more transportation compared with mesiobuccal and distal canals.

40|$|Objectives : Cleaning {{and shaping}} {{of the root}} canal system is an {{important}} step in endodontic therapy. New instruments incorporate new preparation techniques that can improve the efficacy of cleaning and shaping. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of Mtwo and RaCe <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> systems in straightening the canal curvature using only one file or the conventional method. Materials and Methods: Sixty mesial roots of extracted human mandibular molars were prepared by RaCe and Mtwo nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary files using the conventional and only one <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> methods. The working length was 18 mm and the curvatures of the root canals were between 15 - 45 °. By superimposing x-ray images before and after the instrumentation, deviation of the canals was assessed using Adobe Photoshop CS 3 software. Preparation time was recorded. Data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test. Results: There were no significant differences between RaCe and Mtwo or between the two root canal preparation methods in root canal deviation in buccolingual and mesiodistal radiographs (P> 0. 05). Changes of root canal curvature in > 35 ° subgroups were significantly more than in other subgroups with smaller canal curvatures. Preparation time was shorter in one file only technique. Conclusion: According to the results, the two rotary systems and the two root canal preparation methods had equal efficacy in straightening the canals; but the preparation time was shorter in one file only group. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Calcium {{hydroxide}} (Ca(OH) 2) is {{the most}} commonly used intracanal material; it needs to be removed in entirety before obturation. Several techniques have been used for the same including use of various hand and rotary files. Aim: This study was carried out to compare the efficacy of Hand K files and single and multiple <b>rotary</b> <b>file</b> system in removal of Ca(OH) 2. Methodology: Distobuccal root of 45 maxillary molars were {{selected on the basis of}} specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. They were divided into three groups - Group 1 (H and K file), Group 2 (HERO Shaper), and Group 3 (One Shape). Biomechanical preparation (BMP) was carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions; 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite was used as the irrigant and 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as the penultimate irrigant. Ca(OH) 2 powder was mixed with normal saline to obtain a paste; canals were filled with this paste using a Lentulo spiral and were sealed. After 7 days, Ca(OH) 2 was removed, using the same file system as that used for BMP. Samples were sectioned longitudinally and evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis of the obtained data was carried out using one-way analysis of variance test. Results: HERO Shaper displayed better removal of Ca(OH) 2 than One Shape and Hand K file. Moreover, removal was better in the middle third of canal than apical third.

The main objective was to investigate the nature of these irregularities and how they might influence the use and fracture of <b>rotary</b> <b>files</b> during root-canal treatments. The files were examined pre-operatively using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to analyze surface imperfections and the presence of particles. Mesial roots of forty extracted mandibular molars were selected. Each instrument was used to prepare one of the mesial canals. The files were then rinsed with alcohol, and autoclaved and analyzed again. Of the 80 files used in this study, five files fractured, five files unwound and seven files were curved or bent and they all belonged to the PTU group. Irregularities and debris could be visualized with the SEM on both unused PTU and PTN files. Most of the debris was found associated with deeper milling grooves and defects on the surface of the metal. Surface analysis of the files that were used and sterilized were performed and the SEM images demonstrated organic debris, metal flash, and crack formation and initiation of fractures for both file types. All files showed machining grooves, metal flash, debris, and defects on cutting edges. These irregularities appear to be critical in the accumulation of debris and initiation of fatigue and crack propagation within the NiTi alloy.

A total of 36 extracted mandibular molar teeth were selected. The lengths of the mesio-buccal canals to the major foramina were measured directly using a size 10 K-file introduced in the canal until the tip was visible under a loupe and then 0. 5 mm was subtracted from the recorded lengths as the actual working lengths (AWLs). Subsequently, the teeth {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups and embedded in an alginate model. Auto-stop function of the EALHs was preset at " 0. 5 " mark and then electrical working lengths (EWLs) in groups 1 and 2 were recorded by VDW GOLD and Dentaport ZX, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA, 1 -way) and Tukey pairwise multiple comparison intervals (0. 05) were used to compare the accuracy of the two electronic devices. For VDW GOLD, 61. 1 % of the measurements were within ± 0. 5 mm and 88. 9 % were within ± 1 mm of the AWL.
