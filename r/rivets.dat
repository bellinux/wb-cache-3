40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{self-piercing}} <b>riveting</b> (SPR) method {{which uses a}} flange pipe <b>rivet.</b> This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique <b>rivet</b> and incorrect <b>rivet</b> position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe <b>rivet.</b> The lap shear strength of the joint with a flange pipe <b>rivet</b> is higher than that of a joint with a conventional <b>rivet.</b> In this research, a flange pipe <b>rivet</b> was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a punch <b>riveting</b> machine. The flange pipe <b>rivet</b> moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a flange pipe <b>rivet</b> was done by DEFORM software. The simulated joint cross-section shapes were observed, and the influence of the flange pipe <b>rivet</b> parameters on joint quality was analyzed. Simultaneously, some <b>riveting</b> experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different <b>rivet</b> heights and chamfer angles. The results show that the joining surface is smooth and the simulated joint cross-section shapes are in good agreement with the experimental results. The joining property with a chamfer angle of 45 ° and a <b>rivet</b> height of 5 mm is found to be the best in joining the Al 6063 aluminum alloy sheets with a thickness of 2. 4 mm by using the SPR with a flange pipe <b>rivet...</b>|$|R

5|$|Three {{attempts}} to sabotage the ship {{were discovered in}} 1904. On 31 March, <b>rivets</b> on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a 1⅜in (3.5cm) bolt was found driven into the launching way, where it protruded some 5in (11cm). Shortly after the Connecticut was launched on 29 September, a hole 1in (2.5cm) in diameter was discovered drilled through a ⅝in (1.6cm) steel keel plate. The ship's watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to shoot to kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} other AJ-2 was {{purchased}} and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose <b>rivets</b> on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting to separate from the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|E

40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable <b>riveting</b> parameters, mainly squeeze force, <b>rivet</b> length, <b>rivet</b> diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed <b>rivet.</b> The quality of a formed <b>rivet</b> is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” <b>rivet.</b> The study is performed using finite element simulation of the <b>riveting</b> process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed <b>rivet</b> head geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of <b>riveting</b> and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed <b>rivet</b> head. The results demonstrate that the correct formation of <b>rivet</b> head geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of <b>rivet</b> head is not enough to determine the quality of a <b>riveted</b> joint, because the countersunk <b>rivet</b> head does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose <b>rivet.</b> The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of <b>rivet</b> has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R
40|$|<b>Riveting</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} technology in the manufacturing of aeronautical structures {{as well as in}} the automotive industries. Despite its simplicity, the <b>rivet</b> presents a local stiffness that is not easy to properly model within a large finite element analysis. However, precision in the local stiffness evaluation is essential to perform any structural analysis when several <b>rivet</b> are applied in a joint structure. The result is that any <b>rivet</b> requires a local mesh refinement or, and this is the most common case, a drastic simplification of its structural modelling characteristics. In the present paper the structural behavior of a <b>riveted</b> lap joint connection was investigated experimentally and numerically using a new <b>rivet</b> finite element. The <b>Rivet</b> Element, based on a closed-form solution of a theoretical model of the <b>rivet</b> joint, is able to precisely evaluate, in FE analysis, both local and overall stiffness of <b>riveted</b> joints with a very low contribution of dofs.

40|$|Discharge voltage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parameters in electromagnetic <b>riveting.</b> The effect of discharge voltage on the deformation of Ti Grade 1 <b>rivet</b> was investigated by experiment from macro and micro-scales in low voltage electromagnetic <b>riveting.</b> The result shows that the amplitude of the discharge current, the <b>riveting</b> force and the <b>rivet</b> deformation increases with the discharge voltage. The deformation in the <b>rivet</b> head is inhomogeneous and there are three deformation zones, viz., large, small and difficult deformation zones. The deformation in <b>rivet</b> shaft is quite uniform. The deformation of Ti Grade 1 <b>rivet</b> is an adiabatic process and the deformation mechanism is adiabatic shearing deformation. With the increase of discharge voltage, adiabatic shear band gets more and more obvious and the grains inside the adiabatic shear band are elongated severely and re-arranged along the direction of the adiabatic shear band. A model for the modeling of grain deformation inside the adiabatic shear band is proposed. When the adiabatic temperature does not affect the flow of the material, the process of microstructure evolution mechanism of Ti Grade 1 <b>rivet</b> in electromagnetic <b>riveting</b> is mainly the twinning deformation. With the increase of <b>rivet</b> deformation, it is the sub-grain rotation to complete the dynamic recrystallization.
