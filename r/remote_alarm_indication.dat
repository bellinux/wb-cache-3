5000|$|The <b>remote</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>indication</b> (RAI) is {{sent in the}} NFAS of {{the return}} frames, with bit 3 set to [...] "1".

5000|$|Yellow alarm, {{also known}} as <b>remote</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>indication</b> (RAI), {{indicates}} reception of a data or framing pattern that reports the far end is in [...] "red alarm". The alarm is carried differently in SF (D4) and ESF (D5) framing. For SF framed signals, the user bandwidth is manipulated and [...] "bit two in every DS0 channel shall be a zero." [...] The resulting loss of payload data while transmitting a yellow alarm is undesirable, and was resolved in ESF framed signals by using the data link layer. [...] "A repeating 16-bit pattern consisting of eight 'ones' followed by eight 'zeros' shall be transmitted continuously on the ESF data link, but may be interrupted for a period not to exceed 100-ms per interruption."

40|$|An earnest attempt {{has been}} made to devise a {{multifunctional}} system for Security. This portable system can be efficiently used for security against leakage of LPG, intruder detection and overheating. Some innovative power saving techniques has been implemented through the use of PIR sensor. Moreover, GSM acknowledgement of the parameters is achieved through the use of “SIM 900 GSM MODEM ” and a “BUZZER ” is used for local alarm. The readings and the status of the parameters are displayed on an LCD screen interfaced with the 8051 (AT 89 S 52) Micro-controller. A panic switch has been used for the emergency situation. When it is pressed, it will give both local and <b>remote</b> <b>alarm.</b> The panic switch along with the portable security system can be hidden by masking it with ordinary objects like portrait. If gas or intruder is detected or the room temperature exceeds a certain temperature limit or if the panic switch is pressed, local and <b>remote</b> <b>alarm</b> will be obtained.

50|$|Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had Carrier Group Alarms {{by which}} {{the failure of a}} pilot signal was alerted to {{telephone}} exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent plesiochronous and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards.As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M function has {{led to the development of}} a similar Ethernet <b>alarm</b> <b>indication</b> signal (EthAIS).|$|R
50|$|Not all radio {{transmissions}} are prohibited {{in the core}} of the Radio Quiet Zone. For example, emergency service (police, fire, and ambulance) radios and Citizen's Band radio are permitted. However, large transmitter owners must typically coordinate their operations with the NRAO.

Downstream intermediate elements of the transport circuit propagate the AIS onwards to the destination element.|$|R
