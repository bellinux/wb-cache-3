40|$|Under National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project, a {{range of}} climate smart {{agricultural}} practices were evaluated with on-farm demonstrations during 2011 – 2013 in eight climatically vulnerable villages of Andhra Pradesh, India. Proven climate smart practices viz <b>residue</b> <b>recycling,</b> soil, water and nutrient management, afforestation and feeding + breeding practices in livestock were implemented in annual and perennial crops, irrigated rice, horticulture, fodder, forestry and livestock. An EX-ante carbon-balance tool (EX-ACT) developed by the FAO was used {{with a combination of}} various climate smart interventions to know the mitigation potentials in eight climatically vulnerable villages of Andhra Pradesh, India. Based on our observations, EX-ACT model had shown that these practices were effective to mitigate CO 2 emissions apart from enhancing soil productivity. In Nacharam, Yagantipalli, Sirusuwada and Matsyapuri villages, climate smart practices implemented in annual crops along with crop <b>residue</b> <b>recycling,</b> crop and water management practices resulted in negative carbon (C) balance by − 16, 410, − 8851, − 7271 and − 6125 t CO 2 e, respectively. The EX-ACT model predicted positive carbon balance with irrigated module in the rice-growing villages of Sirusuwada and Matsyapuri villages. The negative values suggest a sink, and positive values a source for CO 2 emissions. In Chamaluru village, although there were CO 2 emissions (source) due to livestock and non-forest and land use changes, there was a carbon sink due to other activities as predicted by the model.

40|$|Olive can be {{considered}} a paradigm species for Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. In conventional olive growing, adopted by the majority of the farmers, frequent soil tillage has reduced soil microbial diversity and microbiota complexity that strongly contribute to the overall soil fertility. Therefore, the conventional agronomic practices should evolve in a more sustainable olive management addressed to improve soil microbial diversity. A better understanding of the ecology of soil microorganisms could lead to identify agricultural management practices that stimulate and select the soil microorganisms having beneficial purposes in agriculture, such those interested in nitrogen cycle. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of sustainable practices (grass cover and pruning <b>residues</b> <b>recycling)</b> on soil microbioligical quality in a Mediterranean olive orchard. The trials were carried out in a mature olive grove (Olea europaea L. – cv Maiatica) located in Basilicata Region (Southern Italy.) and managed for 13 years (medium-term) according to two different soil management systems: the sustainable treatment (ST) and the conventional treatment (CT). Soil microorganisms in the two systems were monitored by both microbiological cultural-dependent and molecular methods, and by microscopy. In the ST olive orchard, soil microbiota showed a higher complexity and metabolic diversity. The adoption of ‘innovative’, sustainable, agricultural practices had positive effects on soil microbiota and its biodiversity, which in turn can influence soil fertility and plant growth by increasing nutrients availability and turnover. The results of this study encourage the use of sustainable agricultural practices able to enhance physico-chemical and microbial soil fertility and promote good-quality fruit production without detrimental effects on water and soil resources.

40|$|Abstract Entire {{livelihood}} {{of farmers}} in plains of Tripura {{is dependent on}} rice based farming systems (RBFS). A good rice crop brings smile to the family and locality and a poor crop brings misery and makes farmers debt ridden. Traditionally, about 5 - 10 % of available farm area is given for water harvesting for life saving irrigation during dry season and most importantly for growing fish and domestic use. The water harvested in ponds is used for lifesaving irrigation of vegetables (15 - 20 % farm area) fruits, etc. grown around rice fields or adjacent to home yards. Lowland rice fields and lungas (depressed area in between hills/lowlands) are major ecosystems for indigenous small fish species. The demand and taste of indigenous fish are {{much better than the}} improved fishes like Indian major carps, exotic carps etc. Rice ecosystem is also the major habitat for crabs, eels, edible snails, roots etc. that provides nutrition to thousands in northeastern region. Livestock like cattle, buffaloes, poultry etc. are the integral part of the RBFS. The animal component not only contributes to the manure stock and livelihood of small and marginal farmers but also empowers women and children. The fertility of rice fields are maintained over the centuries through efficient <b>residue</b> <b>recycling,</b> livestock penning, application of organic manure and composts etc. The strength of the indigenous RBFS is that there is hardly any case of starvation death or suicide in the state or in the region which is frequent news {{in other parts of the}} country.

40|$|Each year, {{more than}} 50 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the end}} of their service life throughout the world. More than 95 % of these vehicles enter a comprehensive recycling infrastructure that includes auto parts recyclers/dismantlers, remanufacturers, and material recyclers (shredders). Today, about 75 % of automotive materials are profitably recycled via (1) parts reuse and parts and components remanufacturing and (2) ultimately by the scrap processing (shredding) industry. The process by which the scrap processors recover metal scrap from automobiles involves shredding the obsolete automobiles, along with other obsolete metal-containing products (such as white goods, industrial scrap, and demolition debris), and recovering the metals from the shredded material. The single largest source of recycled ferrous scrap for the iron and steel industry is obsolete automobiles. The non-metallic fraction that remains after the metals are recovered from the shredded materials (about 25 % of the weight of the vehicle) [...] commonly called shredder residue [...] is disposed of in landfills. Over the past 10 to 15 years, a significant amount of research and development has been undertaken to enhance the recycle rate of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), including enhancing dismantling techniques and improving remanufacturing operations. However, most of the effort has focused on developing technology to recover materials, such as polymers, from shredder residue. To make future vehicles more energy efficient, more lighter-weight materials [...] primarily polymers and polymer composites [...] will be used in manufacturing these vehicles. These materials increase the percentage of shredder residue that must be disposed of, compared with the percentage of metals. Therefore, as the complexity of automotive materials and systems increases, new technologies will be required to sustain and maximize the ultimate recycling of these materials and systems at end-of-life. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), in cooperation with the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP) and the American Plastics Council (APC), is working to develop technology for recycling materials from shredder residue. Several other organizations worldwide are also working on developing technology for recycling shredder residue.

40|$|In {{conventional}} fruit growing, {{adopted by}} the majority of the farmers, frequent soil tillage strongly reduces the complexity and diversity of soil microbiota. For this reason, the conventional, non-sustainable, agronomic practices should evolve in a more sustainable management (e. g., grass cover, pruning <b>residues</b> <b>recycling,</b> organic matter inputs, etc.) addressed to ameliorate the ecological networks in which soil microorganisms are involved. A better understanding of soil microbial communities can lead to identify agricultural management practices that stimulate and select specific soil microorganisms having beneficial purposes in agriculture, such those involved in the biogeochemical cycles or with antagonistic effects against plant pathogens. The trials (approximately 20 years) were carried out in different experimental orchards (olive, peach, apricot, kiwifruit and grapevine) located in Basilicata Region (Southern Italy) and managed according to two different soil management systems: the sustainable treatment (ST) and the conventional, non-sustainable, treatment (CT). Soil microbiological quality in the two systems was continuously monitored by microscopic, cultural-dependent and molecular microbiological methods. In the sustainable orchards, soil microbiota always showed a higher complexity and metabolic diversity. The medium-term adoption of ‘innovative’, sustainable, agricultural practices caused positive effects on soil microbiota and its biodiversity, that in turn can significantly influence soil fertility and plant growth by increasing nutrients availability/turnover and contrast plant pathogens. The role of some of the identified microorganisms of agricultural relevance in the soil microbial network is discussed. The results of our studies encourage the use of sustainable agricultural practices able to enhance soil microbiological fertility. The practical goal is to convince farmers to adopt a sustainable farming system as a whole, not just as individual elements, in order to promote good-quality fruit production without negative effects on the environment...|$|R
40|$|This work {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} impact of a municipal solid waste incinerator with energy recovery in Forlì-Cesena province (Emilia-Romagna region, Italy). The methodology used is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). As the plant already applies the best technologies available in waste treatment, this study focuses on the fate of the residues (bottom and fly ash) produced during combustion. Nine scenarios are made, based on different ash treatment disposing/recycling techniques. The functional unit is the amount of waste incinerated in 2011. Boundaries are set from waste arrival in the plant to the disposal/recovery of the residues produced, with energy recovery. Only the operative period is considered. Software used is GaBi 4 and the LCIA method used is CML 2001. The impact categories analyzed are: abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, global warming, human toxicity, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, terrestrial ecotoxicity and primary energy demand. Most of the data are taken from Herambiente. When primary data are not available, data from Ecoinvent and GaBi databases or literature data are used. The whole incineration process is sustainable, due to the relevant avoided impact given by co-generator. As far as regards bottom ash treatment, the most influential process is the impact savings from iron recovery. Bottom ash recycling in road construction or as building material are both valid alternatives, even if the first option faces legislative limits in Italy. Regarding fly ash inertization, the adding of cement and Ferrox treatment results the most feasible alternatives. However, this inertized fly ash can maintain its hazardous nature.

In a mixed-farming system in southern Senegal, patterns of C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) allocation in the plant-soil system (down to a 40 cm soil depth) were compared at harvest in 14 plots, six being under semi-permanent cultivation with groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), others being under continuous cultivation with millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), maize (Zea mays L.) or rice (Oryza sativa L.). Carbon stored in the plant-soil system amounted to 25. 0, 27. 4, 34. 9 and 71. 9 t per ha, respectively, in groundnut, millet, maize and rice fields. Ninety percent of C and P (total in plant P-t, available P in soil (POD)) and 95 % of N of the whole ecosystem were stored in the soil. The high C and nutrient amounts found in rice plots were attributed to the clayey texture of the soil and to seasonal flooding. The lower values for C, N and POD found in soils in the bush ring (groundnut crops) compared {{to those of the}} compound ring (millet and maize crops) stemmed from land management. Higher values for C, N and POD in soils in the compound ring were maintained under continuous cultivation thanks to higher organic and nutrient inputs originating from crop <b>residue</b> <b>recycling,</b> manuring and, in the maize plots, spreading of household wastes. In the compound ring, the amount of C stored seemed to depend as much on the amount of C input as on the chemical richness of organic inflow. The effect of land management (bush versus compound ring) on soil properties was generally restricted to the 0 - 20 cm layer (except for P, cations and pH), and the better soil status in the compound ring was linked to nutrient depletion of the bush ring. From the perspective of global change, the estimated potential of the WAS for C sequestration under continuous cultivation was found to be low. From a methodological point of view, soil carbon status may be considered as a relevant indicator for the fertility of agro-ecosystems in the WAS belt, provided that its biotic components are included, and that both the quality and dynamics of soil organic matter (assessment of seasonal variations, and C flows) and soil texture are characterised.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{world population}} has exerted unprecedented {{pressure on the}} world’s natural ecosystems through both the production and consumption of various products. Human behaviour is having a destructive impact on the environment, and waste generation and disposal {{represents one of the}} key sources of this negative impact. To tackle the problem, a systematic transition towards a circular economy, which is largely built on the possibilities of waste recycling, has been initiated. The continually increasing waste recycling rates can only be achieved by exploiting the advanced waste treatment technologies that are available. However, the operation of such technologies often requires substantial amounts of energy or materials, thereby potentially eliminating the benefits of waste recycling. The primary goal of the research presented in this dissertation was to examine the contribution of the waste pretreatment (PT) activities on the overall environmental impact of waste recycling. An analysis of this nature has not previously been performed on a systematic basis across a variety of waste types and environmental impact categories. The specific objectives of this research study were as follows: (i) to quantify the environmental impact of waste PT activities, (ii) to identify the factors that make the most significant contribution to the impact of the PT activities, (iii) to compare the cumulative induced environmental impact caused by waste PT activities and the final recovery process versus the cumulative avoided impact caused by the conventional disposal of waste and product substitution, and (iv) to identify the potential conditions in which break-even points can be achieved. The goal and the objectives set for this research were achieved by conducting six life cycle assessment (LCA) studies in accordance with the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 international standards. The impact of the recycling or recovery of multiple waste types via a wide number of recycling methods was assessed in terms of the global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP), and human toxicity potentials (HTP). The results of the research reveal that, in general, the need to pretreat waste does not increase the environmental impact of waste recycling activities when compared to the conventional disposal in the majority of scenarios and impact categories; however, a significant variation in the relative importance of the PT activities amongst the alternative studies and the impact categories was identified. The lowest relative importance of the PT of 0. 44 - 0. 52 % was achieved for the carcinogenic HTPC in the scenario in which a mineral fraction from the treatment of the municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash (MSWI BA) was recycled via either a road construction or garden stone production process. On the contrary, the highest relative importance of the PT activities of 64 % was recorded for the GWP in the scenario in which phosphorous was recovered from sewage sludge ash. The results of the GWP analysis revealed that the PT activities incorporating advanced waste treatment methods had a significant contribution of 29 - 64 % to the overall impact of the entire waste management systems. On the contrary, the low contribution of PT activities of 0. 3 - 3. 7 % to the overall GWP was recorded when conventional disposal processes that have a high impact on the GWP, such as landfilling of organic waste, were avoided. Furthermore, PT activities could have a low impact on GWP when waste recycling results in the substitution of materials that have substantial carbon footprints; e. g., burned lime or cement. In terms of the ADP, the significant importance of the PT, which ranged from 21 - 36 %, could be expected when the PT activities require a comparatively high amount of fuels, while also having a low impact on conventional disposal and product substitution. On the contrary, the PT activities may have a low contribution of 0. 24 - 1. 2 %, when waste recycling results in the substitution of materials or fuels that have a high impact on the ADP; e. g., phosphorous or cement. Straightforward results were achieved for the carcinogenic HTPC, in which only a low (0. 44 - 0. 52 %) and low-to-moderate (3. 7 - 5. 0 %) share of the overall impact was associated with the PT activities since the toxicity was mainly related to the release of heavy metals during thermal <b>residue</b> <b>recycling</b> processes. On the contrary, a moderate (1. 9 - 9. 2 %) and a significant (12 - 41 %) share of the non-carcinogenic HTPNON-C was associated with the PT activities in situations in which the major contributors were the consumption of fuels required for transporting and incorporating the waste in the final recovery process. The factors that have the largest impact on the contribution of PT activities varied across the studies; however, the variation of the factors studied in the sensitivity analysis revealed that break-even points are seldom achieved. One break-even point was achieved for the GWP in the scenario in which nitrogen recovery was incorporated into the thermally drying of sewage sludge. In this case, the GWP increased from the avoided impact of 18 % to the induced impact of 2. 6 %. Another break-even point was identified for the non-carcinogenic HTPNON-C in the scenario in which the mineral fraction obtained during the treatment of MSWI BA in the garden stone production process was recycled. In this scenario, the avoided HTPNON-C of 14 % transformed into the additional impact of 17 %. It is important to acknowledge an anticipated variation in the inventory data used in the study, which might alter the results achieved. Furthermore, some significant environmental areas of concern were not considered in the research due to limitations in the scope of the study and the inventory data available. Finally, the impact of the system boundaries on the relative importance of the PT should be studied in more depth to achieve comprehensive insights into the relationship between PT activities and environmental impact throughout the entire life cycle of a product...|$|E
40|$|Biodegradation {{of plant}} {{biomass is a}} {{feasible}} path for transformation of crop <b>residue</b> and <b>recycling</b> of nutrients for crop growth. The need to model the effects of factors associated with recycling of plant biomass resulting from hydroponic sweet potato production has led to investigation of natural soil isolates with the capacity for starch hydrolysis. This study sought to use nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to characterize the proteins present in filtered effluent from bioreactors seeded with starch hydrolyzing bacterial culture used in the biodegradation of senesced sweet potato biomass. The study determined the relative molecular weight of proteins in sampled effluent and the protein banding pattern was characterized. The protein profiles of effluent were similar for samples taken from independent runs under similar conditions of starch hydrolysis. The method {{can be used as}} a quality control tool for confirmation of starch hydrolysis of crop biomass. In addition, this method will allow monitoring for presence of contaminants within the system-protein profiles indicative of new enzymes in the bioreactors...|$|R
40|$|The DI {{water is}} {{commonly}} used to rinse production wafers to remove mechanical and chemical residue without any problematic chemical reaction in rinse process. The semiconductor industry wants to save their manufacture cost and reduce the industrial <b>residue</b> by <b>recycling</b> the deionized water during CPM process. The conductivity in recycled DI water is integrated over the time period. The Drain Diverter, deionized wafer filtering system, is the automated system that detects the level of ions and controls the drain system by using conductive probes. The system contains hysteresis loop, valve feedback, relay circuit, and facility interlock. The recycled water valve is immediately closed when the contaminated water is detected by the conductive probes. The Drain diverter is the project designed for the semiconductor equipments company, and is currently integrated and operating in semiconductor manufacture facility of a chip maker, filtering contaminated DI water from the chamber. And the time delay of the recycled water valve responses is 140 mSec for 60 PSI of flow pressure...|$|R
40|$|The key {{principle}} {{behind the}} concept of sustainability is {{meeting the needs of}} the present without compromising the needs of future generations. If natural resources such as soil, nutrients and water are used up at a rate faster than they are replenished, then the farming system becomes unsustainable. Another key concept of sustainability is to maintain a high level of biodiversity also by adopting sustainable pest management (integrated pest management) strategies in order to reduce at minimum the risk for {{human health and the environment}} (EU directive 128 / 2009). Vineyards and fruit trees are some of the most important and extensive crops in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. In conventional farming systems, adopted by the majority of the farmers in Southern Italy, frequent soil tillage enhances soil erosion and loss of soil fertility, and often reduces soil microbial diversity and soil microbiota complexity, that strongly contribute to the overall soil fertility. For these reasons, these conventional agronomic practices should evolve in a more sustainable management (e. g., grass cover, pruning <b>residues</b> <b>recycling,</b> organic matter inputs) addressed to improve soil organic matter. Under semi-arid climatic conditions, the application of endogenous organic matter can be a key factor to enhance soil quality and fertility and to preserve natural resources, mainly soil and water, avoiding detrimental effects on the environment. Furthermore, agricultural practices can play an important role in carbon sequestration. The carbon stock can be viewed as measure of the relative contribution to biomass to the carbon cycle, and the capacity to store organic carbon depends to a great extent upon climate and soil properties, although the cultivation system can play a considerable part. Together with the soil management, other critical points for a sustainable horticulture are the fertilization and the irrigation system which could influence water use efficiency, yield quality, and pest and soil management. Results of experiments carried out in the last two decades will be presented. The final goal is to encourage farmers to adopt a sustainable farming system as a whole, not just as individual elements, in order to promote good-quality fruit production without negative effects on the environment...|$|R

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{leaching}} residue are released into tailings dams from mines, and their acid content can cause environmental pollution. The {{aim of this}} study was to research the feasibility and value of a leaching <b>residue</b> backfill <b>recycling</b> method. The combination of property detection, laboratory tests (the neutralization method, strength test and diffusivity test) and numerical simulation methods (3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of pipeline transportation properties) were used to assess the performance of the leaching residue backfill. The results show that backfill body with the cement:sand mass ratio of 1 : 3, the leaching residue:classified tailings ratio of 1 : 6, and slurry mass concentration of 71 wt % can meet the strength and pipeline self-flowing transportation requirements of mine backfill. The leaching residue is a good backfill aggregate, and its recovery ratio can reach 19. 5 wt %. In addition, the <b>recycling</b> of leaching <b>residue</b> effectively alleviates the problem of mine waste emissions and protects the ecological environment surrounding the mining area. This study serves as a guide for the recycling of fine tailings and the environmental governance of the mining area...|$|R
40|$|Cellulosic biomass {{is being}} {{promoted}} {{for use in}} future bioenergy production systems as a better alternative to current grain-based systems. Cropping systems and partial or total corn biomass removal in addition to grain harvest changes crop P needs, crop <b>residue,</b> and P <b>recycling.</b> Both sediment and water losses may also be altered and these changes could result in increased P loss from fields. Livestock production results in the generation of large quantities of manure that is a valuable nutrient source for producing high biomass yield. Manure {{can be used to}} minimize use of inorganic fertilizers and enhance production efficiency. Therefore, this study evaluated the impacts of several crop and corn biomass harvest systems on P loss with surface runoff as affected by management based on fertilizers or liquid swine manure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this study, an {{alternative}} method for <b>recycling</b> <b>residues</b> of labels and stickers (parings) containing biaxically oriented polypropylene (BOPP) and polyurethane-based glue was discussed. The recycling {{of this type}} of material is complicated, once the separation and the milling processes are difficult to be accomplished, due to the presence of a large amount of glue. In this study, sugarcane bagasse ash was used to enable the milling process of stickers residues. Composites were prepared with post-consumer polypropylene extrusion with different polypropylene/parings ash ratio. These materials were analyzed by tensile, three point flexural, hardness, density, water absorption, Izod impact tests, thermogravimetric analysis, environmental exposure and scanning electron microscopy. Addition of sticker residues/ash to the polypropylene matrix makes the material more rigid and does not affect significantly thermal and degradation properties. Thus, the recycling process proposed in this paper is environmentally and economically viable...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE) is large and rapidly increasing, and even though WEEE is recycled today there are still valuable <b>residues</b> left after <b>recycling,</b> ending up in landfills. This paper shows how microwave pyrolysis can be a plausible way to recycle the residues. Six different fractions (from light dust to particles sized 7 – 12 mm) of landfill waste were analysed and pyrolysed. The process was successful producing oil, gas and a solid residue, and the mass reduction was determined as a function of process time. Mass reduction seemed to be rather stable, independent of the temperature scatter during pyrolysis and a substantial reduction was observed for all of the materials. The major part of mass reduction was observed in the heating phase already above 100 °C, and the heating rate was slower for the particulate material...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} {{of sewage sludge}} to agricultural land, a common practice to recycle nutrients in the past, is currently prohibited in organic farming due {{to the risk of}} soil contamination from pollutants (e. g. toxic and potentially toxic elements, persistent organic pollutants, etc.). Incineration or disposal to landfill of dewatered sludge is costly, leads to greenhouse gas emissions, and eliminates the possibility of nutrient recovery, especially phosphorus. Options to treat dry organic matter are combustion and gasification, among other technologies to produce ashes or chars and to recover the <b>residues</b> for nutrient <b>recycling.</b> Dependent on the technology applied as well as the input material, nutrient concentrations and concentration of contaminants vary widely. Due to organic matter degradation, non-volatile elements including mineral nutrients like phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and calcium are enriched in ashes and chars. Thermal processes have high P recovery rates of 80 to 90...|$|R
40|$|A waste {{material}} from an aggregate producing quarry {{has been used}} to make an inexpensive lunar simulant called BP- 1. The feedstock is the Black Point lava flow in northern Arizona. Although {{this is part of the}} San Francisco volcanic field, which is also the source of the JSC- 1 series feedstock, BP- 1 and JSC- 1 are distinct. Chemically, the Black Point flow is an amygdaloidal nepheline-bearing basalt. The amygdules are filled with secondary minerals containing opaline silica, calcium carbonate, and ferric iron minerals. X-ray diffraction (XRD) detected approximately 3 % quartz, which is in line with tests done by the Kennedy Space Center Industrial Hygiene Office. Users of this material should use appropriate protective equipment. XRD also showed the presence of significant halite and some bassanite. Both are interpreted to be evaporative <b>residues</b> due to <b>recycling</b> of wash water at the quarry. The size distribution of BP- 1 may be superior to some other simulants for some applications...|$|R
