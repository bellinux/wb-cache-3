60|$|Many {{carnivorous}} animals, as they crawl {{towards their}} prey {{and prepare to}} rush or spring on it, lower their heads and crouch, partly, as it would appear, to hide themselves, and partly {{to get ready for}} their rush; and this habit in an exaggerated form has become hereditary in our pointers and setters. Now I have noticed scores of times that when two strange dogs meet on an open road, the one which first sees the other, though at the distance of one or two hundred yards, after the first glance always lowers its bead, generally crouches a little, or even lies down; that is, he takes the proper attitude for concealing himself and {illust. caption = for making a rush or FIG. 4.--Small dog watching a cat on a spring, although the <b>road</b> <b>table.</b> From a photograph taken is quite open and The distance Mr. Rejlander.} great. Again, dogs of all kinds when intently watching and slowly approaching their prey, frequently keep one of their fore-legs doubled up for a long time, ready for the next cautious step; and this is eminently characteristic of the pointer. But from habit they behave in exactly the same manner whenever their attention is aroused (fig. 4). I have seen a dog {{at the foot of a}} high wall, listening attentively to a sound on the opposite side, with one leg doubled up; and in this case there could have been no intention of making a cautious approach.|$|E
50|$|I-80 and US 30 {{continue}} {{east from}} Rock Springs {{parallel to the}} Union Pacific's Rawlins Subdivision and Bitter Creek. The Interstate has interchanges with WYO 370, which leads south to Rock Springs - Sweetwater County Airport; and WYO 371, which heads north toward Superior; and WYO 372 at Point of Rocks. At Point of Rocks, I-80 and US 30 veer away from the railroad and Bitter Creek and cross the Red Desert. Within the desert, the Interstate has interchanges {{with a string of}} minor roads: Black Butte Road, Red Hill Road, Bitter Creek Road, Patrick Draw <b>Road,</b> <b>Table</b> Rock Road, Bar X Road, BLM Road, GL Road, Tipton Road, an exit simply labelled Red Desert, and Rasmussen Road. The only place of significance within this stretch is Table Rock, where the highway rejoins the railroad and enters the Great Divide Basin, an endorheic basin between two branches of the Continental Divide. I-80 and US 30 pass by the only town in the basin, Wamsutter, which is accessed by an interchange with Kelly Street. The freeway has a junction with Continental Divide Road and an interchange with WYO 789, which joins the Interstate eastbound.|$|E

40|$|This {{creative}} {{project was}} proposed {{to develop a}} GIS model for transportation planning purposes with the ARC/INFO software. The urban street network in the GIS model was based on urban arterial systems {{in the city of}} Muncie, Indiana. The model was also expected to demonstrate the applicability of GIS technology in transportation planning. Several transportation planning techniques were tested with the model which included road and traffic data inventory, optimum pathing, road capacity analysis, traffic shift study modeling, and graphic presentation. The case study was targeted on road capacity analysis of urban arterial network as well as study of alternative traffic route for the urban route of State Road 32 in Muncie. The project began with an discussion of GIS technology, GIS application in planning, and ARC/INFO software programs. Then an urban street information model was developed in form of digital network in the computer database which could perform the functions of data inventory, spatial traffic analysis, and mapping manipulation. Finally the case studies were performed to demonstrate the application of this GIS network model. The findings and analysis results generated by GIS operation were used to evaluate the traffic conditions as well as to determine the feasibility of alternative route for State <b>Road</b> <b>tables,</b> ARC/INFO macro programs, traffic maps, and print-out of analysis results.
