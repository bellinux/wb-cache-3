2500|$|The engine has {{increased}} crankcase breathing, a low-pressure fuel return {{system and a}} baffled oil sump, to prevent engine lubricant cavitation at high engine speeds and high-G cornering. It has four valves per cylinder (instead of five on the earlier variant) and two overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank (so it is 'quad cam') and these are driven by <b>roller</b> <b>chains</b> with variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts, along with a cast magnesium alloy fixed tract length intake manifold with adjustable tumble flaps (to improve low engine speed combustion). On 98RON (93AKI) Super-Unleaded petrol it produces [...] at 7,800rpm giving it a specific power output of [...] per litre. [...] Based on a kerb weight of , {{this results in a}} power-to-weight ratio of 0.184 kW per kilogram. This engine also produces [...] of torque at 5,500rpm, 90percent of the total torque being available between 2,250 and 7,600rpm. (Using lower 95RON (91AKI) standard unleaded fuel slightly reduces engine output, and therefore performance, and slightly worsens fuel economy). Exhaust gas escapes through two '4-into-2-into-1' fan-branch alloy steel exhaust manifolds and four high-flow metallic sports catalytic converters, into twin oval tail pipes with integral dynamic silencer/muffler valves. [...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards. The saloon version produces 322-329grams of CO2 per kilometre (g/km), and the Avant starts from 324g/km.|$|E

5000|$|German {{inventor}} Karl Benz patented the world's first automobile in 1886. It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones) with a {{four-stroke engine}} {{of his own}} design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition [...] and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator. Power was transmitted by means of two <b>roller</b> <b>chains</b> to the rear axle.

50|$|While {{some of the}} {{earliest}} self-lubricating bearings were developed by Chrysler {{the earliest}} self-lubricating chains were bushed chains, which consisted of pins, plates, and sintered bushes. The loss in strength of the bush required it to be made extra thick. This made the outer diameter so large that it did not allow enough room for a <b>roller.</b> These bushed <b>chains</b> suffer from the drawback of lower allowable load and tensile strength compared to regular <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> and the outer diameter of the bushes do not rotate when engaging a sprocket and may suffer faster wear and damage. While various chain manufacturers offered self-lubricating bushed chain designs based on sintered-bush technology since the 1950s, the world's first self-lubricating <b>roller</b> <b>chain</b> was developed and launched by a Japanese chain manufacturer in 1988. After they made further improvements to the oil impregnation and sintering technologies, they received a patent for their lube-free <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> as evidenced by Patent #JP20070237969. In the new design, advancements in powder metal bush technology allowed engineers to design a bush that had a smaller diameter yet was stronger, which allowed room for rollers. These rollers improved performance by allowing the chain to articulate more smoothly into sprockets and protect the sintered bushes. Because of these advancements, the self-lubrication style chains achieved strength on par with regular <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> with the added benefit of being lube-free. Powdered metal sintered bearings (in the case of <b>roller</b> <b>chain,</b> the bushes) are self-lubricating because their porosity is impregnated with lubricants during the manufacturing process. In use, frictional heat causes the lubricant to expand and flow out of the pores, forming a film between mating parts. Low coefficients of friction, minimal maintenance and trouble-free service life, low cost, and simple installation are the chief advantages of powdered metal bearings.|$|R
