25|$|Time is {{a natural}} force from which {{none of us is}} immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume {{everyone}} in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths {{in the context of the}} play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. <b>Regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|E

2500|$|The CMP has a {{point system}} that {{competitors}} use {{to work their way}} towards [...] "distinguished status." [...] Starting in 2015, the CMP began awarding achievement pins based on the score one earns at a given match. [...] For example, to earn a bronze, silver, or gold CMP [...]22 Rimfire Pistol Achievement Pin, one must achieve a score of 235-249, 250-264, or 265+ respectively in the authorized excellence category of competition. [...] Also in 2015, the CMP established minimum cut scores that must be achieved for a given weapon in the authorized excellence category of competition before one can earn credit points (also referred to as [...] "leg points") towards a distinguished marksmanship badge. [...] Once the minimum cut score has been achieved or exceeded (260-300 for [...]22 rimfire pistol, 250-300 for service pistol, and 455-500 for service rifle), the shooter becomes eligible to earn leg points. [...] The number of leg points that can be earned are {{based on the number of}} competitors, one's score, one's ranking, and you must fall within the top 10% of all match shooters <b>regardless</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> minimum cut score. [...] Typically, the highest one-sixth of the top 10% earn ten leg points, the next highest two-sixths earn eight, and the remaining three-sixths earn six. [...] Depending on the awarding organization, competitors must earn between one and six leg points to be awarded their first excellence-in-competition badge. [...] Everyone must earn at least 30 leg points to reach [...] "distinguished status" [...] and be awarded one of the distinguished marksmanship badges. [...] Leg points accumulate throughout a competitor's lifetime until [...] "distinguished status" [...] is attained.
