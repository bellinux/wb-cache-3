2500|$|Baron Badlesmere excused his wife's bellicose actions at Leeds {{with his}} {{declaration}} {{that when he}} had left Margaret in charge of Leeds, {{he had given her}} strict instructions not to admit anyone inside the castle without his specific orders. This, he had insisted, included the Queen, with the words that [...] "the royal prerogative of the King in the case of <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> should not be assumed to provide a legal right for the Queen, who was merely his wife". As a result of Margaret's imprisonment, Badlesmere remained firmly aligned with the King's opponents; shortly afterwards he participated in the Earl of Lancaster's rebellion. Badlesmere was captured after taking part in the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322 which had ended with a royalist victory. Following trial at Canterbury, he was executed at Blean on 14 April 1322.|$|E

However, only two cars ran sufficient speeds {{to be added}} to the field, and 35 cars lined up to start the race.

40|$|Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs), where injecting {{drug users}} (IDUs) can use pre-obtained drugs in a {{hygienic}} and professionally supervised low threshold setting, aim to engage high risk IDUs, reduce public drug use, injecting-related morbidity and mortality, and improve access to drug treatment. This thesis evaluates the service demand, accessibility, utilisation, and coverage of Australias first DCR, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), {{located in an}} area {{with a history of}} illegal shooting gallery operation. MSIC impact on injecting practices and injecting related health, and referral to drug treatment were also examined. Methods included cross-sectional IDU surveys, key informant interviews, staff focus groups, analysis of client registration and surveillance data and routinely collected data on needles and syringes - including multiple indirect prevalence estimation, and prospective follow-up of MSIC referrals. Shooting gallery users expressed demand for and willingness to use the MSIC. Injecting episodes previously occurring in shooting galleries appear to have been transferred to the MSIC, although shooting galleries continued to operate at a reduced level. The MSIC service model was accessible, with few <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> high levels <b>of</b> client satisfaction and limited non-use for reasons relating to the model. MSIC engaged high risk IDUs - regular injectors, sex workers, and those injecting in public places and shooting galleries - who {{were also more likely to}} be frequent attendees. MSIC clients were more likely than other IDUs to inject in public places and shooting galleries, be HCV seropositive, have riskier injecting practices and more severe injecting related health problems. MSIC achieved good coverage of the local IDU population (70. 7 %, range 59. 1 %- 86. 7 %) and modest coverage of their estimated total injecting episodes during its operating hours (8. 8 %, range 7. 3 %- 10. 8 %). MSIC use was associated with improvements in injecting practices and health. Frequent MSIC use was also associated with higher rates of referral to drug treatment than less frequent use. Drug treatment referral uptake was positively associated with a recent history of daily injection and sex work and negatively associated with a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment and/or self harm. This research was confounded by substantial changes in heroin availability during the study period but provides new evidence on DCR coverage, impact on injecting practices and health, and referral to drug treatment. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
