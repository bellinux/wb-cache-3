40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor</b> units. Traditionally, {{the operation of}} <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor</b> units is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller of refrigerant temperature or pressure. Due {{to the lack of}} scientific, systematic and optimum logic basis, it is difficult to optimize the operation of {{refrigeration system}} and control the excessive energy consumption with these methods. On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each compressor unit within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit. The results reflect that the system optimization method can obtain the optimum solution and increase the coefficient of performance of the original refrigeration system by 7. 83 %.

The process is meant for use onboard LNG fuelled ship different from LNG carriers, equipped with LNG fuel tanks at atmospheric pressure and 2 -strokes engines with high pressure gas injection, which is considered the most efficient propulsion arrangement for medium-large vessels. The studyis based on a patented concept from the norwegian companyLNG New Technlogies, within the thesis this concept is evolved to a more complex process layout, its distinctive features are low temperature suction of the heat pump <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor,</b> absence of heat discharge {{to the environment and}} condensation of the Boil-Off-Gas via recirculation of subcooled LNG. Four different operating scenarios of the process are simulated with the commercial software HYSYS&# 174;, the results of the simulations are presented in the form of case studies, sensitivity analyses, thermodynamic diagrams and tables, and analized in detail. Anumber of modifications to the selected layout are evaluated, e. g. Boil-Off-Gas feed to the Auxiliaryengine and compressor intercooling. Based on the simulation results a preliminary selection ofthe process equipment is outlined, with focus on the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor.</b> The results prove that the proposed heat pump process can effectively refrigerate the LNG tank if the ship is operating in the normal mode or at half of the main engine load, however at lower engine loads, especially when the main engine is shut down, the system can not produce the required refrigeration effect. In this scenario the excess Boil-Off-Gas would be fed to the Auxiliary engines, or in the worst case burnt in Gas Combustion Units. The heat pump efficiency for the normal operation is 2 - 3 times higher than for commercial on-board Boil-Off-Gas reliquefaction processes, but the maximumreliquefaction capacity is intrinsically lower.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} refrigeration {{is one of}} {{the more}} promising alternatives to conventional electronics cooling techniques, especially at high ambient temperature. For the use of refrigeration in electronics cooling, a miniature-scale, low cost, and reliable <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor</b> is needed. ^ An electrostatically actuated diaphragm compressor is a promising concept for this application. The compressor consists of a flexible circular diaphragm clamped at its circumference inside a conformal chamber. The membrane and the chamber surfaces are coated with metallic electrodes. A potential difference applied between the diaphragm and the chamber pulls the diaphragm towards the chamber surface progressively from the outer circumference towards the center. This zipping actuation reduces the volume available to the refrigerant gas, thereby increasing its pressure. ^ A segmentation technique is proposed for analysis of the compressor by which the domain is divided into multiple segments for each of which the forces acting on the diaphragm are estimated. The pull-down voltage to completely zip each individual segment is thus obtained. The required voltage for obtaining a specific pressure rise in the chamber can thus be determined. Predictions from the model compare well with other simulation results from the literature, as well as to experimental measurements of the diaphragm displacement and chamber pressure rise in a custom-built setup. ^ A dynamic compressor model is also developed in which the dynamic forces induced due to the finite-time deflection of the diaphragm are taken into consideration using the segmentation approach developed in the quasi-static model. Results from the analytical model compare favorably with those from a detailed numerical simulation as well as with experimental measurements available in the literature. A finite element quasi-static model is also developed for further validation of the analytical model. ^ Based on the simulation model predictions, the design of the diaphragm compressor is optimized for the maximum performance. Since the desired cooling performance is not possible with a single compressor unit, a 3 -D array for boosting the pressure rise and the volume flow rate is proposed. Finally, suggested future work on diaphragm compressors is outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|In a bus air {{conditioning}} system, the working load is relatively high {{in comparison to}} a passenger car. As such, {{the size of the}} compressor used is also relatively large due to high refrigerant flow rate required to meet the demand for high cooling capacity. For high refrigerant flow rate, reciprocating piston-cylinder concept has been known to operate successfully. The present work carried out is also based on the pistoncylinder compression concept but attempt was made {{to reduce the size of}} the compressor so that it is more compact and stable. This thesis reports the actual effort of introducing a novel concept of compression mechanism of the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor</b> for a bus {{air conditioning}} system. The development of prototypes is based on experience and knowledge gained through reverse engineering on several existing compressor models in the market such as the swash plate compressor and the wobble plate compressor. Literature reviews were carried out to keep up with the latest technology that is available in the market and to acquire more state of the art knowledge required to design a better compressor. In parallel, an experimental rig was developed based on international standard to test and evaluate both existing and newly developed compressors. Tests were conducted by varying the compressor speed from 800 rpm to 1800 rpm. The performance of the compressors were studied in terms of coefficient of performance (COP), volumetric efficiency (v Î·) and mechanical efficiency (mech Î·). For the existing compressor model, the highest COP obtained was 4. 1 at 800 rpm while the highest volumetric and mechanical efficiencies are 71 % at 1400 rpm and 74 % at 800 rpm. Similar data were planned to be obtained from the test of the newly developed prototypes. However, the new prototypes were not fully developed and data obtained from the test carried out were not enough to make a conclusive comparison with the performance of the existing model. The compressor managed to get a pressure ratio of 3 which was enough for an air conditioning system to work.

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{model of}} an axial piston-type machine with a so-called wobble plate and Z-shaft mechanism is presented. The overall {{aim is to}} design and construct an oil-free piston expander demonstrator {{as a first step}} to realizing an advanced and compact small-scale steam engine system. The benefits of a small steam engine are negligible NOx emissions (due to continuous, low-temperature combustion), no gearbox needed, fuel flexibility (e. g., can run on biofuel and solar), high part-load efficiency, and low noise. Piston expanders, compared with turbines or clearance-sealed rotary displacement machines, have higher mechanical losses but lower leakage losses, much better part-load efficiency, and for many applications a more favourable (i. e., lower) speed. A piston expander is thus feasible for directly propelling small systems in the vehicular power range. An axial piston machine with minimized contact pressures and sliding velocities, and with properly selected construction materials for steam/water lubrication, should enable completely oil-free operation. An oil-free piston machine also has potential for other applications, for example, as a refrigerant (e. g., CO 2) expander in a low-temperature Rankine cycle or as a <b>refrigerant</b> <b>compressor.</b>   An analytical rigid-body kinematics and inverse dynamics model of the machine is presented. The kinematical analysis generates the resulting motion of the integral parts of the machine, fully parameterized. Inverse dynamics is applied when the system motion is completely known, and the method yields required external and internal forces and torques. The analytical model made use of the “Sophia” plug-in developed by Lesser for the simple derivation of rotational matrices relating different coordinate systems and for vector differentiation. Numerical solutions were computed in MATLAB. The results indicate a large load bearing in the conical contact surface between the mechanism’s wobble plate and engine block. The lateral force between piston and cylinder is small compared with that of a comparable machine with a conventional crank mechanism.   This study aims to predict contact loads and sliding velocities in the component interfaces. Such data are needed for bearing and component dimensioning and for selecting materials and coatings. Predicted contact loads together with contact geometries can also be used as input for tribological rig testing.
