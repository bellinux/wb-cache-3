5|$|Older {{versions}} of Norton were hard and slow to uninstall, leaving many traces and sometimes completing with errors.

5|$|On December 9, 2010, Symantec {{released}} the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this update was later pulled due to numerous {{reports on the}} Norton forums that the update is causing system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this update are advised to uninstall the product, run the Norton <b>Removal</b> <b>Tool,</b> and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed the bugs and re-{{released the}} update.|$|E

25|$|On January 6, 2005, Microsoft {{released}} a Beta version of Microsoft AntiSpyware, {{based upon the}} previously released Giant AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006, Microsoft AntiSpyware became Windows Defender {{with the release of}} Beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users who have genuine copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of Windows Vista and 7. In Windows 8, Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials have been combined into a single program, named Windows Defender. It is based on Microsoft Security Essentials, borrowing its features and user interface. Although it is enabled by default, it can be turned off to use another anti-virus solution. Windows Malicious Software <b>Removal</b> <b>Tool</b> and the optional Microsoft Safety Scanner are two other free security products offered by Microsoft.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. Cases that are loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case <b>removal</b> <b>tool</b> to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E

2500|$|The Commander has {{its origins}} with Emerson's CQC-8 or [...] "Banana" [...] folding {{fighting}} knife {{based on the}} Bob Taylor Warrior Knife and the Bill Moran ST-23: a knife designed with the blade in line for reverse grip or sabre grip fighting. [...] This knife became popular among the British SAS and the US Navy SEALs, however the SEALs wanted something more aggressive so Emerson developed the SSRT(Silent Sentry <b>Removal</b> <b>tool)</b> model: a larger, hooked blade with a serrated, doubled-edged spine. [...] This blade's profile resembled the horn of a Rhinoceros and its more popular name is the Rhino. [...] The blade folded {{below the level of}} the handle scales so the user could not be cut by this extra edge, a small hole drilled through both handle scales and liners allowed the blade to be held in place so it would not open on a parachute jump and cause harm to the operator. [...] Although the knife functioned perfectly in the field, its final design was too specific for the Navy.|$|E

2500|$|Manual {{removal of}} a rootkit is often too {{difficult}} for a typical computer user, {{but a number of}} security-software vendors offer tools to automatically detect and remove some rootkits, typically as part of an antivirus suite. , Microsoft's monthly Windows Malicious Software <b>Removal</b> <b>Tool</b> is able to detect and remove some classes of rootkits. [...] Also, Windows Defender Offline can remove rootkits, as it runs from a trusted environment before the operating system starts. [...] Some antivirus scanners can bypass file system APIs, which are vulnerable to manipulation by a rootkit. Instead, they access raw filesystem structures directly, and use this information to validate the results from the system APIs to identify any differences that may be caused by a rootkit. There are experts who believe that the only reliable way to remove them is to re-install the operating system from trusted media. This is because antivirus and malware removal tools running on an untrusted system may be ineffective against well-written kernel-mode rootkits. Booting an alternative operating system from trusted media can allow an infected system volume to be mounted and potentially safely cleaned and critical data to be copied off—or, alternatively, a forensic examination performed. Lightweight operating systems such as Windows PE, Windows Recovery Console, Windows Recovery Environment, BartPE, or Live Distros can be used for this purpose, allowing the system to be [...] "cleaned". Even if the type and nature of a rootkit is known, manual repair may be impractical, while re-installing the operating system and applications is safer, simpler and quicker.|$|E
