5|$|A <b>radiation</b> {{accident}} {{occurred in}} Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 <b>radiation</b> source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing <b>radiation.</b> Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of <b>radiation</b> sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect <b>radiation</b> injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the <b>radiation</b> source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the <b>radiation</b> source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for <b>radiation</b> injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>radiation</b> sources can be {{precisely}} positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy {{enables a}} high dose of <b>radiation</b> {{to be applied}} to a small area. Furthermore, because the <b>radiation</b> sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the <b>radiation</b> sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of <b>radiation.</b> It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon <b>radiation.</b> After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the <b>radiation</b> decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic <b>radiation</b> {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background <b>radiation.</b> The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} has {{variety of}} <b>radiations</b> but broadly divided into natural and artificial <b>radiations</b> enhanced by human activity. The natural <b>radiations</b> are {{taken care of}} naturally and show little or no variation with time. The present work focuses on microwave <b>radiations</b> that has risen many folds for past 30 years. One of the basic reason for this increase {{is the use of}} moder...|$|R
40|$|Many factors control <b>radiations</b> on islands, {{but some}} general {{patterns}} do emerge. Bird <b>radiations</b> are mostly found on oceanic archipelagos {{far from the}} continental coast line. Mammal <b>radiations</b> are mostly know from island arcs, which are somewhat easier to reach though still isolated enough to allow evolutionary lineages to develop and diverge. In contrast to birds, strong mammal <b>radiations</b> seem possible on a single island...|$|R
40|$|The {{microwave}} oven is a kitchen appliance {{which is used}} in day to day life. After long use of oven there is leakage of microwave <b>radiations</b> takes place. These <b>radiations</b> are hazardous to human being. Number of people use {{microwave oven}}s every year and make themselves vulnerable to risk. This system detects the leaked <b>radiations.</b> It checks those leaked <b>radiations</b> for the threshold value. If these <b>radiations</b> {{are found to be}} above the threshold value, then the system informs to their respective owner and manufacturer about leakage. So they can take appropriate action regarding the issue...|$|R
5|$|Because denser {{materials}} absorb more radioactive emissions than lighter ones, {{heavy metals}} {{are useful for}} <b>radiation</b> shielding and to focus <b>radiation</b> beams in linear accelerators and radiotherapy applications.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of <b>radiation</b> are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma <b>radiation</b> are all forms of {{ionizing}} <b>radiation.</b> Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including <b>radiation</b> sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha <b>radiation</b> can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta <b>radiation</b> can penetrate human skin, but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma <b>radiation</b> can go all the way through the body.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic <b>radiation</b> to a {{noteworthy}} degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of <b>radiation</b> per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong <b>radiation</b> belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of <b>radiation</b> taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural <b>radiation</b> levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{devices have}} become a very {{important}} part of everyone’s life, as these devices give some benefits of use on the other hand they are risky in their use. These devices emit <b>radiations</b> which are harmful for the human beings as well as for the environment. In this paper we have discussed about the sources of electromagnetic <b>radiations,</b> tolerable level of <b>radiations,</b> some effects that can be caused by electromagnetic <b>radiations</b> and the effect on the environment. Also some precautions are discussed which can reduce the effect of <b>radiations</b> to some extent. At the end of the paper we found out that the electromagnetic <b>radiations</b> produced from cell phones, computers and related equipment, microwave ovens, radio and TV transmitters and other electrical and electronic appliances are analogous to the cigarettes of 21 th century...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns of plant species <b>radiations</b> are largely unknown. I used a nonlinear regression to estimate speciation and extinction rates from all relevant dated clades. Both are surprisingly high. A high species richness can {{be the result of}} either little extinction, thus preserving the diversity that dates from older <b>radiations</b> (a ‘mature radiation’), or a ‘recent and rapid radiation’. The analysis of <b>radiations</b> from different regions (Andes, New Zealand, Australia, southwest Africa, tropics and Eurasia) revealed that the diversity of Australia may be largely the result of mature <b>radiations.</b> This is in sharp contrast to New Zealand, where the flora appears to be largely the result of recent and rapid <b>radiations.</b> Mature <b>radiations</b> are characteristic of regions that have been climatically and geologically stable throughout the Neogene, whereas recent and rapid <b>radiations</b> are more typical of younger (Pliocene) environments. The hyperdiverse Cape and Neotropical floras are the result of the combinations of mature as well as recent and rapid <b>radiations.</b> Both the areas contain stable environments (the Amazon basin and the Cape Fold Mountains) as well as dynamic landscapes (the Andes and the South African west coast). The evolution of diversity can only be understood {{in the context of the}} local environment...|$|R
50|$|Here, the turnover-pulse {{hypothesis}} {{and other}} concepts are {{integrated into the}} theory of evolutionary <b>radiations</b> in general, and adaptive <b>radiations</b> in particular, and different types of evolutionary <b>radiations</b> are identified, including geographic <b>radiations.</b> Showing that several separate clades are radiating during a commonly experienced episode of climate change is powerful evidence {{that it is not}} the individualistic, biotic characteristics of each of these clades that is spurring the diversification, but rather the common Earth history factors. Indeed, this signifies the important connection between the turnover-pulse hypothesis and phylogenetic biogeography.|$|R
5|$|However, a {{burst of}} intense neutron and gamma <b>radiation</b> came {{directly}} from the fireball. Its lethal radius was , covering {{about half of the}} firestorm area. An estimated 30% of immediate fatalities were people who received lethal doses of this direct <b>radiation,</b> but died in the firestorm before their <b>radiation</b> injuries would have become apparent. Over 6,000 people survived the blast and fire, but died of <b>radiation</b> injuries. Among injured survivors, 30% had <b>radiation</b> injuries from which they recovered, but with a lifelong increase in cancer risk. To date, no radiation-related evidence of heritable diseases has been observed among the survivors' children.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to relatively long-wavelength <b>radiation,</b> Jupiter also emits synchrotron <b>radiation</b> (also {{known as the}} Jovian decimetric <b>radiation</b> or DIM <b>radiation)</b> with frequencies {{in the range of}} 0.1–15GHz (wavelength from 3m to 2cm), which is the bremsstrahlung <b>radiation</b> of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner <b>radiation</b> belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100MeV, while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1–20MeV. This <b>radiation</b> is well understood and was used {{since the beginning of the}} 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and <b>radiation</b> belts. The particles in the <b>radiation</b> belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Intraoperative <b>radiation</b> therapy (IORT) {{delivers}} <b>radiation</b> at {{the same}} time as the surgery to remove the tumour (lumpectomy). An applicator is placed in the cavity left after tumour removal and a mobile electronic device generates <b>radiation</b> (either x-rays or electrons) and delivers it via the applicator. <b>Radiation</b> is delivered all at once and the applicator removed before closing the incision.|$|E
50|$|Flavonoid {{synthesis}} {{in plants}} is induced by light color spectrums at both {{high and low}} energy <b>radiations.</b> Low energy <b>radiations</b> are accepted by phytochrome, while high energy <b>radiations</b> are accepted by carotenoids, flavins, cryptochromes in addition to phytochromes. The photomorphogenic process of phytochome-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis has been observed in Amaranthus, barley, maize, Sorghum and turnip. Red light promotes flavonoid synthesis.|$|R

Results demonstrate that microwave <b>radiations</b> can be profitably exploited to improve reaction kinetics in solid phase peptide synthesis when both chemical and biocatalytic strategies are used...|$|R
40|$|Application of high-LET <b>radiations</b> {{in cancer}} therapy {{is based on}} radiobiological {{arguments}} : great efficiency against hypoxic cancer cells, or cells in resistant phases of the mitotic cycle or quiescent. However, from a clinical point of view, {{the problem of the}} selection of patients who could benefit from high-LET <b>radiations</b> is not solved. Clinical observation shows that high-LET <b>radiations</b> bring a benefit for certain types of rumours : salivary glands, antrum, prostate, sarcomas, etc. These rumours are, in general, slowly growing, well differentiated and resistant to conventional x-rays as well as chemotherapy. Among high-LET <b>radiations,</b> fast neutrons have been most widely used. Today, neutrons can be applied in technical conditions, and with a allow the radiotherapist to apply high-LET <b>radiations</b> with an excellent physical selectivity. Unfortunately, the complexity of the equipment and mainly the cost prevented the development of the technique...|$|R
5|$|On December 1, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 had detected the first Lyman-alpha <b>radiation</b> originating from the Milky Way galaxy. Lyman-alpha <b>radiation</b> had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the <b>radiation</b> from the Milky Way was not detectable.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with <b>radiation,</b> EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with <b>radiation</b> recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and <b>radiation</b> are also performed. <b>Radiation</b> therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and <b>radiation,</b> and abdominal recurrences are treated with <b>radiation</b> and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E

40|$|Explosive" {{adaptive}} <b>radiations</b> on islands remain one of {{the most}} puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <b>radiations</b> remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <b>radiations</b> suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus Schiedea (Caryophyllaceae), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian Schiedea. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <b>radiations...</b>|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most common}} <b>radiation</b> sources, polonium-210 emits very little gamma <b>radiation,</b> but {{large amounts of}} alpha {{particles}} which do not penetrate even {{a sheet of paper}} or the epidermis of human skin, and is therefore invisible to normal <b>radiation</b> detectors. This explained why tests conducted by doctors and Scotland Yard at the hospital with Geiger counters were negative. Both gamma rays and alpha particles are classified as ionizing <b>radiation</b> which can cause <b>radiation</b> damage. An alpha-emitting substance can cause significant damage only if ingested or inhaled, acting on living cells like a short-range weapon. Hours before his death, Litvinenko was tested for alpha-emitters using special equipment.|$|E
5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} <b>radiation</b> frequently has {{specific requirements}} for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing <b>radiation</b> can cause <b>radiation</b> damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from <b>radiation</b> damage, by freezing the crystal at liquid nitrogen temperatures (~100 K). However, synchrotron <b>radiation</b> frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal. This is critical in experiments such as SAD and MAD.|$|E
5|$|Whereas some {{acronyms}} are logical, such as N3 (N for natural, i.e. {{observed in}} natural diamond) or H3 (H for heated, i.e. observed after irradiation and heating), many are not.

5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of <b>radiation</b> from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews were exposed to an absorbed dose of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an equivalent dose of 14.75cSv, or 1133µSv per day. This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background <b>radiation</b> on Earth in two years. The <b>radiation</b> environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased <b>radiation</b> dose, and the strength of <b>radiation</b> shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> they release is almost a minor side-effect. Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> is {{a tiny fraction of the}} total energy released during the event.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} <b>radiation</b> to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle {{environment}} around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of <b>radiation</b> was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the <b>radiation</b> belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the <b>radiation</b> had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the <b>radiation</b> levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's <b>radiation</b> dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The <b>radiation</b> also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
