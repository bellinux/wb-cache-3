40|$|A {{non-linear}} structure preserving matrix method for the computation of a structured low rank approximation S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar)</b> of the Sylvester resultant matrix S(f, g) of two inexact polynomials f = f(y) and g = g(y) is considered in this paper. It is shown that considerably improved results are obtained when f (y) and g(y) are processed {{prior to the}} computation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar),</b> and that these preprocessing operations introduce two parameters. These parameters can either be held constant during the computation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar),</b> {{which leads to a}} linear structure preserving matrix method, or they can be incremented during the computation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar),</b> which leads to a {{non-linear structure}} preserving matrix method. It is shown that the non-linear method yields a better structured low rank approximation of S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar)</b> and that the assignment of f (y) and g(y) is important because S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar)</b> may be a good structured low rank approximation of S(f, g), but S((f) over <b>bar,</b> (<b>g)</b> over <b>bar)</b> may be a poor structured low rank approximation of S (g f) because its numerical rank is not defined. Examples that illustrate the differences between the linear and non-linear structure preserving matrix methods, and the importance of the assignment off (y) and g(y), are shown. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a highly efficient architecture for the hardware implementation of context-free grammar (CFG) parsers. Its efficiency stems from an innovative combinatorial circuit that implements the fundamental operation of Earley's parsing algorithm in time complexity O(log(2) vertical <b>bar</b> <b>G</b> vertical <b>bar).</b> where vertical <b>bar</b> <b>G</b> vertical <b>bar</b> {{is the size}} of the CFG. Using this hardware architecture in a template form. we have developed an automated synthesis tool that, given the specification of an arbitrary CFG. generates the HDL (Hardware Design Language) synthesizable source code of the hardware parser for the given grammar. The generated source has been simulated for validation, synthesized and tested on a Xilinx FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) board. Our method increases the performance by a factor of one to two orders of magnitude, compared to previous hardware implementations. {{depending on the size of}} the grammar and the input string length. The speedup. compared to the pure software implementation. varies from two orders of magnitude for toy-scale grammars to six orders of magnitude for large real life grammars. This makes it particularly appealing for applications where (syntactic) pattern recognition response is a crucial aspect. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|When F is a p-adic field, and G = G(F) is {{the group}} of F-rational points of a {{connected}} algebraic F-group, the complex vector space H(G) of compactly supported locally constant distributions on G has a natural convolution product that makes it into a C-algebra (without an identity) called the Hecke algebra. The Hecke algebra is a partial analogue for p-adic groups of the enveloping algebra of a Lie group. However, H(G) has drawbacks such as {{the lack of an}} identity element, and the process <b>G</b> <b>bar</b> right arrow H(G) is not a functor. Bernstein introduced an enlargement H(G) of H(G). The algebra H(G) consists of the distributions that are left essentially compact. We show that the process <b>G</b> <b>bar</b> right arrow H(G) is a functor. If tau: G -> H is a morphism of p-adic groups, let F(tau) :H(G) -> (H) (H) be the morphism of C-algebras. We identify the kernel of F(tau) in terms of Ker(tau). In the setting of p-adic Lie algebras, with g a reductive Lie algebra, m a Levi, and tau: g -> m the natural projection, we show that F(tau) maps G-invariant distributions on G to N(G) (III) -invariant distributions on III. Finally, we exhibit a natural family of G-invariant essentially compact distributions on g associated with a G-invariant non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form on g {{and in the case of}} SL(2) show how certain members of the family can be moved to the group...|$|R

The zeros all lie on a circle, according to the Riemann Hypothesis for curves, and their angles are uniformly distributed. Moreover, the number of angles inside a fixed symmetric interval I is asymptotically a sum of (l - 1) / 2 identical independent Gaussian random variables, each of which comes naturally from a Dirichlet character and has mean 4 <b>g</b> vertical <b>bar</b> I vertical bar/(l - 1) and variance (4 /pi(2)) log(2 <b>g</b> vertical <b>bar</b> I vertical bar).
