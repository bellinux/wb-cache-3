40|$|South Africa faces a raft {{of social}} problems, the enormity of which make it {{impossible}} for the government to tackle alone. This has necessitated private sector involvement through socially responsible investments (SRI) and charity. Despite the growth of the SRI industry and years of charitable contributions, social investment into the high-impact areas that need it most remains far too low. This study seeks to understand what is holding back social investment, and how to address this. Using grounded theory methodology, the research finds that traditional SRI investors are inappropriate sources of funding and that charitable funds have largely been deployed inefficiently. The proposed solution is for more use to be made of charitable funders, with the disbursement process employing some commercial investment principles in order to facilitate the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> resulting in the growth of social investment over time...|$|E
40|$|We {{claim that}} the stock market {{encourages}} business creation, innovation, and growth by allowing the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> ``informed'' <b>capital.</b> Due to incentive problems, financing new innovative businesses requires entrepreneurs either to sustain a tight relationship with monitors (banks, venture capitalists) whose ``informed'' capital is in limited supply or to undertake an irreversible reorganization that makes the firm transparent enough to access the stock market. We characterize the financial life cycle of firms, showing why they choose to be initially financed through informed capital, reconsidering whether to go public once some uncertainty is resolved. We examine the efficiency properties of the competitive equilibrium and identify the factors that lead to the emergence of a stock market for young fast growing firms, facilitate the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> informed <b>capital,</b> and encourage business creation. We also show how the rate of technological progress affects and is affected by stock market development. ...|$|R

40|$|Cement based {{materials}} {{have a very}} special presence amongst building and construction materials, and therefore their <b>recycling</b> is <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> importance. In this research, concrete wastes were used as replacement of natural aggregates in cement and cement-lime mortars. The mortars were cured for 28 -days with an increasing substitution of fine natural aggregates with recycled aggregates and have been prepared as well as characterized. The results show that, as expected, cement mortars always have better mechanical properties than the corresponding cement-lime mortars. A worsening of mechanical properties is observed upon {{increasing the amount of}} recycled aggregates in the cement mortars; on the contrary, cement-lime mortars show an improvement in mechanical properties of up to 60 % when increasing the amount of recycled aggregates. The experimental results suggest that this improvement could arise from a synergic effect of lime hydraulicity and the filler effect due to the fine fraction of recycled aggregates within the mix, that lead to better densification of the lime mortars by blocking the capillary pores...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} and/or {{performance}} analysis of an energy conversion system, {{there are two}} factors other than the thermodynamic operation of the system which play an important role. They are the economis <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> equipment used in the cycle and the past effects of the cycle (i. e., the construction <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> equipment) and present and future effects of the cycle (i. e., its operation and the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> any used-up <b>capital</b> equipment) on the environment. All three factors - the thermodynamics, the economics and the environmental effects - are presently taken into account to some degree or another at different stages {{in the analysis of}} such a system. However, they are only considered separately or in some limited combination or not at all, since a consistent methodoligy which combines all of them into a single entity or tool is lacking. The purpose of our proposal is to develop such a methodology, providing a framework simple enough to be practical yet sufficiently consistent with good engineering practice and the complexities involved in this type of modelling. As a base, we will use some of the extensive work which has already been done in the literature by the authors themselves and others...|$|R
50|$|In the {{financial}} literature, sterilization {{is a term}} commonly {{used to refer to}} operations of a central bank that mitigate the potentially undesirable effects of inbound capital: currency appreciation and inflation. Depending on the source, sterilization can mean the relatively straightforward <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> inbound <b>capital</b> to prevent currency appreciation and/or a range of measures to check the inflationary impact <b>of</b> inbound <b>capital.</b> The classic way to sterilize the inflationary effect of the extra money flowing into the domestic base from the capital account is for the central bank to use open market operations where it sells bonds domestically, thereby soaking up new cash that would otherwise circulate around the home economy. A central bank normally makes a small loss from its overall sterilization operations, as the interest it earns from buying foreign assets to prevent appreciation is usually less than what it has to pay out on the bonds it issues domestically to check inflation. In some cases, however, a profit can be made. In the strict textbook definition, sterilization refers only to measures aimed at keeping the domestic monetary base stable; an intervention to prevent currency appreciation that involved merely buying foreign assets without counteracting the resulting increase of the domestic money supply would not count as sterilization. A textbook sterilization would be, for example, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $1 billion in foreign assets. This would create additional liquidity in foreign hands. At the same time, the Fed would sell $1 billion of debt securities into the US market, draining the domestic economy of $1 billion. With $1 billion added abroad and $1 billion removed from the domestic economy, the net capital inflow that would have influenced the currency's exchange rate has undergone sterilization.|$|R
