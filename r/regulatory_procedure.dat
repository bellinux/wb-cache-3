40|$|AIMS To {{facilitate}} {{and improve}} clinical research within Europe, the European Union (EU) adopted in 2001 the Clinical Trials Directive (EUCTD). The {{aim of this}} study was to compare duration between submission of a clinical drug trial application and approval by regulatory authorities in EU countries regulated by EUCTD vs. EU countries regulated by local legislation and, second, to compare the duration of regulatory approval in Europe vs. the USA and Australia. METHODS Application for clinical drug trial initiation was submitted to the regulatory authorities of 14 European countries, to the USA and to Australia. In Europe, 10 countries were regulated by EUCTD and four by local legislation. RESULTS In Europe, the median duration of <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedures</b> was longer in EUCTD countries compared with countries following local legislation (75 vs. 59 days; P 60 days (maximum within EUCTD rules). The long duration of <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedures</b> was the consequence of (i) sequential instead of simultaneous submission of trial application to regulatory authorities, and (ii) involvement of local ethics committees in procedures that should be followed only by central ethics committees. The duration of <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedures</b> was similar in Australia (67 vs. 68 days, P = 0. 388), but significantly shorter in the USA (67 vs. 15 days, P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS In this early stage of implementation, EUCTD appears not to shorten the duration of <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedures</b> for clinical trial initiation. Furthermore, Europe lags behind the USA in speed of <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of modern Form-Based Codes {{was started by}} architects, urban designers, and physical planners frustrated by the ineffectiveness of past criticisms of sprawl development {{and the failure of}} critics to propose realistic alternatives. These professionals, used to thinking physically about community problems, began the search for systematic physical solutions in the 1970s. Architect Christopher Alexander published A Pattern Language in 1977, a compendium of physical rules for designing humane buildings and places. Ian McHarg developed systematic mapping tools to encourage deliberate development patterns sensitive to local environmental conditions. Traditional Neighborhood Development ordinances were drafted beginning in the early 1990s as sets of development regulations to promote traditional neighborhood forms in new development projects. TND ordinances were typically adopted as an optional <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedure</b> that developers could request in place of conventional zoning [...] But their design regulations were not mapped to parcels or streets in advance, so lacked predictability of outcomes; TND ordinances proved to be an instructive effort, but showed few results.|$|E

5000|$|It is the {{confusing}} {{number of}} committees {{that gave rise}} to the term [...] "comitology". A report from the British House of Lords said, [...] "There is no definitive list of comitology committees, their functions, activities and membership"; however, since the European Commission started to maintain a list, it states that [...] "A list of 'comitology' committees ... is published as an Annex to the Annual reports on the work of these Committees ... {{as well as in the}} Register of Comitology." [...] Moreover, the strongest criticism pertained to the fact that the elected European Parliament (EP) had no right to block implementing measures: only the comitology committees could do so, and if they did, the proposal was referred to Council alone, even when the initial delegation of powers was through an act adopted jointly by both Parliament and Council under the co-decision procedure. Parliament argued that the system lacked transparency and democratic control. After years of complaint by Parliament, a significant reform placing Parliament and Council on an equal footing was to be introduced by the Constitutional Treaty. Since the latter did not get ratified, the Parliament insisted that the envisaged changes would be introduced through secondary law. An agreement was reached in 2006 and a new procedure, the <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedure</b> with scrutiny, was introduced, to be used when non-essential elements of EU legislation adopted under the co-decision procedure required amendment or supplementation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Just as {{a stream}} of genetically {{modified}} crops looked set to be approved for commercial production in the European Union, the approval procedure appears to have become bogged down once again by disagreements among and within member states. Old controversies have resurfaced in new forms. The intractability of the issues suggests that the <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedure</b> has had too narrow a focus, leaving outside its boundary {{many of the more}} fundamental aspects that cause people in the European Union most concern. Regulators have come under considerable pressure to ensure their risk assessment decisions are soundly science-based. Ethical issues have been deemed to lie beyond the scope of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>procedure,</b> as a matter to be considered separately by professional ethicists. Yet {{it has been suggested that}} all environmental controversies at root involve disputes about fundamental ethical principles. This paper examines how the ethical issues are currently suppressed or sidelined. It discusses how an appreciation of systems thinking and a check on the values that underpin decisions, using boundary testing questions, might contribute to a more constructive regulatory dialogue, with ethical issues considered as integral in a way that takes better account of people’s concerns...|$|E

In addition, RAC and SEAC are requested to comment whether the suggested measures are appropriate to reduce the risks, and on the socio-economic impact.
