All these are also preconditions for the demographic <b>renewal</b> of <b>rural</b> areas. Changes in the structure of work and functions in rural settlements and family farms also demand rational changes in the morphology of the farm and <b>rural</b> settlements. <b>Renewal</b> includes many legal alterations, too, for example modifications in the spatial plans of settlements and regions.

50|$|Commercial {{activities}} were pursued during the Roman and Byzantine Empires, {{yet they were}} sufficiently prosperous as to attract pirates' attention. The participants of the Fourth Crusade divided the Byzantine Empire among themselves and the Cyclades entered the Venetian orbit.

The Duchy was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, which allowed the islands a certain administrative and fiscal autonomy. Economic prosperity continued despite the pirates. The archipelago had an ambiguous attitude towards the war of independence. Having become Greek in the 1830s, the Cyclades have shared the history of Greece since that time. At first they went through a period of commercial prosperity, still due to their geographic position, before the trade routes and modes of transport changed.

40|$|Natural resource-dependent {{societies}} {{in developing countries}} are facing increased pressures linked to global climate change. While social-ecological systems evolve to accommodate variability, there is growing evidence that changes in drought, storm and flood extremes are increasing exposure of currently vulnerable populations. In many countries in Africa, these pressures are compounded by disruption to institutions and variability in livelihoods and income. The interactions of both rapid and slow onset livelihood disturbance contribute to enduring poverty and slow processes of <b>rural</b> livelihood <b>renewal</b> across a complex landscape. We explore cross-scale dynamics in coping and adaptation response, drawing on qualitative data from {{a case study in}} Mozambique. The research characterises the engagements across multiple institutional scales and the types of agents involved, providing insight into emergent conditions for adaptation to climate change in rural economies, The analysis explores local responses to climate shocks, food security and poverty reduction, through informal institutions, forms of livelihood diversification and collective land-use systems that allow reciprocity, flexibility and the ability to buffer shocks. However, the analysis shows that agricultural initiatives have helped to facilitate effective livelihood renewal, through the reorganisation of social institutions and opportunities for communication, innovation and micro-credit. Although there are challenges to mainstreaming adaptation at different scales, this research shows why it is critical to assess how policies can protect conditions for emergence of livelihood transformation.

40|$|Conventionally, {{urban renewal}} {{initiated}} {{by the private sector}} is not that different from other trading activities. A developer purchases property rights from the suppliers, who are the property owners of the renewal site, in the open market for a price. Once the deal is done, the suppliers are out of the picture and the developer moves on to the renewal project and starts replacing the existing structure with new buildings for a better use. The developer would prefer not to have the individual owners involved in the renewal process for various reasons such as management problems and profit sharing. From an institutional economic perspective, this {{is a classic example of}} market governance structure as the asset is non-specific to a certain extent and the developer is not integrating the supplier (property owners) into the firm. However, on some rare occasions, the developer may adopt a bilateral firm governance structure by incorporating the individual property owners. This, in the context of <b>rural</b> land <b>renewal,</b> has been known as the land readjustment model. Based on the theoretical framework of institutional economics and transaction cost theory, this paper explores the rationale behind the developer and even the public authority choosing to adopt this model in the process of urban renewal by examining two examples in two very different cities in China. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Youths in their numerical, energy, and creative strength are the most reliable change agents. Unemployment in any form globally propels youth restlessness, crime and associated vices and the attendant threats to nation building, peace and security. In a bid to tackle unemployment and other fundamental problems, the State Government of Osun under the visionary leadership of Mr. Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola embarked on six action-packed people programmes that guarantee development with citizens’ participation in the Education, <b>Rural</b> and Urban <b>Renewal,</b> Infrastructural Development, Agriculture, Health, Entrepreneurship and Job creation-christened Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme (OYES) to fast track development and banish hunger and poverty.

First, I focus on a conception of country-side and after on The <b>Rural</b> <b>Renewal</b> Program, which is realized under the competancy of the Ministry of Regional Development. From this program I choosed the competition "Village of a year". I am dealing with its history, development, conditions, organization, particular evaluations and I also mention some similar competitions abroad. In the next part of my work I am using a concrete municipality to find out, which activities led to its success in the competition. After, how did the municipality use the financial resour-ces gained from the competition and whether did it benefit in any other way...|$|E
