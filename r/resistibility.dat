40|$|The {{development}} of crosslinkable {{materials for the}} fabrication of solution processable OLEDs presents challenges, especially regarding the adjustment of the glass transition (Tg), which has a significant influence on crosslinking kinetics and device life-time. Crosslinkable hole transport materials based on poly(N, N-bis(4 -(9 H-carbazol- 9 -yl) phenyl) - 4 -vinylaniline) (poly-TCTA) with covalently attached plasticizers for Tg control and azide functionalities for azide-alkyne crosslinking are presented. These polymers have an optimal T-g of around 150 degrees C and show superior crosslinking performances and solution <b>resistibilities.</b> Incorporation of electron-pushing alkoxides to the pendant groups combines the Tg adjustment approach with a systematic tuning of the HOMO level from - 5. 7 to - 5. 3 eV. All presented polymers have good charge transport and injection properties and are ideal for applications in phosphorescent OLEDs due to their high triplet energies (> 2. 8 eV). The new crosslinkable poly-TCTA-based materials are applied as hole-transport layers (HTLs) in fully solution-processed OLEDs.

5000|$|Both Calvinism and Arminianism {{agree that}} the {{question}} of the <b>resistibility</b> of grace is inexorably bound up with the theological system's view of the sovereignty of God. The fundamental question is whether can God allow individuals to accept or reject His grace and yet remain sovereign. If so, then grace can be resistible. If not, then grace must be irresistible. This different understanding of sovereignty is often attributed to an improper understanding of total depravity. However, both Calvin and Arminius taught total depravity. Total depravity is expressly affirmed in Article III of the Five articles of Remonstrance. Nevertheless, Calvinist Charles Hodge says, [...] "The (Arminian) and (Roman Catholic) doctrine is true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it is false if that system be erroneous. If the (Calvinistic) doctrine concerning the natural state of man since the fall, and the sovereignty of God in election, be Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient grace does not become efficacious from the cooperation of the human will.".|$|E
