25|$|In {{some cases}} FAP can {{manifest}} {{higher in the}} colon than usual (for example, the ascending colon, or proximal to the splenic flexure, or in the gastric or duodenal tracts) where they show no symptoms until cancer is present and greatly advanced.

As the mutation causing FAP is genetic, it can be inherited hereditarily from either parent, and passed to children. A genetic blood test of the APC gene exists that can determine whether it is deficient, and therefore can predict the possibility of FAP. Individuals at risk (due to family links or genetic testing) are usually offered <b>routine</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the intestinal tract every 1 – 5 years for life, from early adulthood, to detect the slow-forming polyps and act if found, before they can pose a threat. International polyposis registries exists that track known cases of FAP or APC gene defects, for research and clinical purposes. Mutation of APC also occurs commonly in incident cases of colorectal carcinoma, emphasizing its importance in this form of cancer.|$|E

40|$|Background: In health care, {{the use of}} {{physical}} parameters to monitor physical disease progress is common. In mental health care, the periodic measurement of a client's functioning during treatment, or <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring,</b> has recently become important. Online delivery of questionnaires {{has the potential to}} reduce clinicians' resistance to the implementation of <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring.</b> Online delivery enables clinicians to receive results on a questionnaire in a graphic directly after data entry. This gives them insight into the progress of a client at a single glance. Objective: To explore clinicians' perspectives on a <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring</b> procedure where questionnaires and feedback on scores were delivered online. Questionnaires could also be filled out on paper and then entered into the online system by a research assistant. Methods: In 2009 we sent an online survey, consisting of five yes-or-no questions and six open-ended questions, to all clinicians in the 14 mental health care organizations working with the <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring</b> system in the Netherlands. Of the 172 clinicians contacted, 80 (47 %) opened the link and 70 of these 80 (88 %) clinicians completed the survey. Results: Clinicians seldom used the graphical feedback from the Web-based system, which indicates that direct feedback on scores did not enhance the implementation of <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring.</b> Integration into the electronic patient record and more training on interpretation and implementation of feedback in daily practice were seen as the primary points for further improvement. It was mainly the availability of a research assistant that made the <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring</b> procedure feasible. Conclusions: Without a research assistant and training in the interpretation of outcomes, software programs alone cannot ensure effective implementation of monitoring activities in everyday practice. © Marjolein A Veerbeek, Richard C Oude Voshaar, Anne Margriet Pot...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2017 Psychotherapy has {{repeatedly}} {{been shown to}} be an acceptable form of treatment for a variety of psychiatric conditions. However, despite the success of psychotherapy, not all patients improve during a course of treatment. In fact, research has suggested that some patients actually become worse while engaged in psychotherapy. Thus, it becomes important to identify patient deterioration and provide this information back to therapists. Additionally, the ability to detect patient deterioration cannot be solely the result of clinician judgment. Research has shown that utilizing actuarial methods of identifying patient non-responders is superior to that of clinician judgment alone. In turn, the field has moved toward implementing <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring</b> tools/management systems to assist in the process of identifying patients who are failing to respond to treatment. The present study explored potential relationships between <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring,</b> deliberate practice, and routine clinical supervision. Results suggest {{that the vast majority of}} practicing therapists do not utilize <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring</b> tools/management systems as part of their daily practices of psychotherapy, and most do not incorporate feedback results into their personal clinical supervision experiences. Additionally, results suggest that therapists who have received formalized training with <b>routine</b> outcome <b>monitoring</b> tools and/or are required to engage in weekly supervision, are more likely to monitor their patient outcome as part of their daily practices of psychotherapy. Moreover, self-assessment bias seems to be present within the sample in regards to identifying patient improvement, non-response, and deterioration. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed, along with limitations and future directions...|$|R

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of routine}} viral load (VL) monitoring of HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) depends on various factors that differ between settings and across time. Low-cost point-of-care (POC) tests for VL are in development and may make <b>routine</b> VL <b>monitoring</b> affordable in resource-limited settings. We developed a software tool {{to study the}} cost-effectiveness of switching to second-line ART with different monitoring strategies, and focused on POC-VL monitoring. We used a mathematical model to simulate cohorts of patients from start of ART until death. We modeled 13 strategies (no 2 nd-line, clinical, CD 4 (with or without targeted VL), POC-VL, and laboratory-based VL monitoring, with different frequencies). We included a scenario with identical failure rates across strategies, and one in which <b>routine</b> VL <b>monitoring</b> {{reduces the risk of}} failure. We compared lifetime costs and averted disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). We developed an Excel tool to update the results of the model for varying unit costs and cohort characteristics, and conducted several sensitivity analyses varying the input costs. Introducing 2 nd-line ART had an ICER of US$ 1651 - 1766 /DALY averted. Compared with clinical monitoring, the ICER of CD 4 monitoring was US$ 1896 -US$ 5488 /DALY averted and VL monitoring US$ 951 -US$ 5813 /DALY averted. We found no difference between POC- and laboratory-based VL monitoring, except for the highest measurement frequency (every 6 months), where laboratory-based testing was more effective. Targeted VL monitoring was on the cost-effectiveness frontier only if the difference between 1 st- and 2 nd-line costs remained large, and if we assumed that <b>routine</b> VL <b>monitoring</b> does not prevent failure. Compared with the less expensive strategies, the cost-effectiveness of <b>routine</b> VL <b>monitoring</b> essentially depends on the cost of 2 nd-line ART.
