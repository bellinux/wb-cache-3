40|$|Releases of the GDP {{are subject}} to {{revisions}} over time. This paper examines the predictability <b>of</b> German GDP <b>revisions</b> using forecast rationality tests. Previous studies of German GDP covering data until 1997 finds that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are predictable. This paper uses a newly available real-time data to analyze the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonal adjusted GDP, of nominal unadjusted GDP, of the seasonal pattern, and of the GDP deflator for the period between 1992 and 2006. We find that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the nominal unadjusted GDP are unpredictable, but that the <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the price adjustments are predictable. Nevertheless, <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> real seasonally adjusted GDP are hardly predictable and less well predictable compared to earlier studies. This lower predictability seems {{to be linked to}} the finding that <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> seasonal adjustments are hardly predictable, too, and that their predictability decreased over time...|$|R
