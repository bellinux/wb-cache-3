5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) {{and highly}} electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by electron transfer, a process thermodynamically understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} can {{be produced}} from their constituent ions by evaporation, precipitation, or freezing. <b>Reactive</b> <b>metals</b> such as the alkali metals can react directly with the highly electronegative halogen gases to form an ionic product. They can also be synthesized {{as the product of}} a high temperature reaction between solids.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing basic ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Ionic compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. Ionic compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a solid-state reaction, or the electron transfer reaction of <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> with reactive non-metals, such as halogen gases.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
5|$|Platinum {{is one of}} {{the least}} <b>reactive</b> <b>metals.</b> It has {{remarkable}} resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, {{but it was not until}} Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, major {{advances}} {{were made}} in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{the least}} <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> {{catalyst}} for epoxidations, vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols. Early work done by Sharpless shows its preference for reacting with alkenes with allylic alcohols over more substituted electron dense alkenes. In this case, Vanadium showed reverse regioselectivity from both m-CPBA and the more reactive molybdenum species. Although vanadium is generally less <b>reactive</b> than other <b>metal</b> complexes, {{in the presence of}} allylic alcohols, the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum, the most <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> for epoxidations.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group; chemical properties of both actinium and especially lawrencium are not well-characterized. The remaining elements of the group (scandium, yttrium, lutetium) are <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> with high melting points (1541°C, 1526°C, 1652°C respectively). They are usually oxidized to the +3 oxidation state, even through scandium, yttrium and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states. The reactivity of the elements, especially yttrium, is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. Scandium(III) oxide, yttrium(III) oxide, lanthanum(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide are white high-temperature-melting solids. Yttrium(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide exhibit weak basic character, but scandium(III) oxide is amphoteric. Lanthanum(III) oxide is strongly basic.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier {{published}} {{a list of}} 33 chemical elements, grouping them into gases, metals, nonmetals, and earths. Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner observed {{that many of the}} elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. Lithium, sodium, and potassium, for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, <b>reactive</b> <b>metals.</b> Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third; this became known as the Law of Triads. German chemist Leopold Gmelin worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. Jean-Baptiste Dumas published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are all shiny, soft, highly <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> at {{standard}} temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They {{can all be}} cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and {{in the case of}} lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.|$|E

40|$|The slow bend precracked Charpy {{fracture}} toughness and tensile behavior of arc-melted and hot-rolled Fe- 12 Ni alloys containing up to 4 atomic percent <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> additions were determined at - 196 C and 25 C after water quenching from three annealing temperatures. The {{fracture toughness}} of Fe- 12 Ni at - 196 C was improved by {{small amounts of}} Al, Ce, Hf, La, Nb, Ta, Ti, V, Y, and Zr, but not by Si. Cryogenic toughness was improved up to 7. 5 times that of binary Fe- 12 Ni and varied with the <b>reactive</b> <b>metal,</b> its concentration, and the annealing temperature...|$|R
25|$|Dilute {{sulfuric acid}} reacts with metals via a single {{displacement}} reaction {{as with other}} typical acids, producing hydrogen gas and salts (the metal sulfate).

25|$|Alcohols, like water, {{can show}} either acidic or basic {{properties}} at the -OH group. With a pKa of around 16-19, they are, in general, slightly weaker acids than water, {{but they are}} still able to react with strong bases such as sodium hydride or <b>reactive</b> <b>metals</b> such as sodium. The salts that result are called alkoxides, with the general formula RO− M+.|$|E

50|$|Rieke <b>metals</b> {{are highly}} <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> powders {{prepared}} by the methods developed by Reuben D. Rieke. Rieke <b>metals</b> are highly <b>reactive</b> because they have high surface area and lack surface oxides that can retard reaction of bulk materials.|$|R
50|$|Chromium is {{a highly}} <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> present in many iron alloys. Chromium may react with glass, {{reducing}} the silicon and forming crystals of chromium silicide growing into the glass and anchoring together the metal and glass, improving the bond strength.|$|R
500|$|With <b>reactive</b> <b>metals,</b> such as tungsten, carbon forms either {{carbides}} (C) or acetylides (...) to form alloys {{with high}} melting points. These anions are {{also associated with}} methane and acetylene, both very weak acids. With an electronegativity of 2.5, carbon prefers to form covalent bonds. A few carbides are covalent lattices, like carborundum (SiC), which resembles diamond. Nevertheless, even the most polar and salt-like of carbides are not completely ionic compounds.|$|E
500|$|The {{reactivity}} of niobium with oxygen requires {{it to be}} worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production. [...] Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and electron beam melting (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other <b>reactive</b> <b>metals.</b> [...] The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 {{with as many as}} 256 experimental niobium alloys in the [...] "C-series" [...] (possibly from columbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet. [...] Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade zirconium alloys, that it wanted to put to commercial use. [...] The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included turbine engines and liquid metal heat exchangers. [...] Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.|$|E

Three kinds of <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> (Ti, Mo, Pd) have been tested {{in the form of}} PVD thin film and diffusion-bonded metal contacts. Silver contacts used as references in these experiments give resistivities among the best reported in the literature.

40|$|Ceramic-metal {{composites}} {{are being}} developed as engineering materials because of their high stiffness-to-weight ratios, good fracture toughness, and because their electrical and thermal properties can be varied through control of their compositions and microstructures. Wider use of ceramic-metal composites requires improvements in synthesis and processing so that high-performance parts can be produced more economically. Over {{the past three years}} <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> penetration {{has been shown to be}} a promising technique for making ceramic and metal-matrix composites to near-net-shape with control of both composition and microstructure. It appears that <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> penetration could be an economical process for manufacturing many of the advanced ceramic composites that are needed for light-weight structural and wear applications for transportation and energy conversion devices. Near-net-shape fabrication of parts has the additional advantage that costly and energy intensive grinding and machining operations are significantly reduced, and the waste generated from such finishing operations is minimized. The goals of this research and development program are: (1) to identify compositions favorable for making composites by <b>reactive</b> <b>metal</b> penetration; (2) to understand the mechanism(s) by which these composites are formed; and (3) to control and optimize the process so that composites and composite coatings can be made economically...|$|R
