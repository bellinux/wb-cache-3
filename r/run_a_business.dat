25|$|The {{first step}} in his {{argument}} is that when people engage in trade, <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> or work in a job, they adopt and personify (personally represent) a certain function, role or behaviour pattern which is required of them to serve their obligations; their consent to the applicable rules is assumed, as a necessity {{to succeed in the}} activities. They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour. People have to conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks {{which is part of the}} job.|$|E
500|$|From {{an early}} age Hutson was {{interested}} in business. [...] "At the university , I was the only athlete in the business school," [...] he said. [...] "The only reason I wanted to play pro sports was to get a stake." [...] While both were students at Alabama, he partnered with Bear Bryant to operate a laundromat in Tuscaloosa called Captain Kidd Cleaners. However, neither were educated in laundering, and they sold the business after two years. While in Green Bay, Hutson opened the Packer Playdium bowling alley, which proved so successful that he twice considered retirement from football to fully dedicate his time to its operation. He then started the Hutson Motor Car Co. dealership and in 1951 purchased Chevrolet and Cadillac agencies in Racine, Wisconsin. [...] "I never aimed for automobiles," [...] said Hutson. [...] "That {{just happened to be}} the thing I got into. I just wanted to <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>business,</b> any business.|$|E

2500|$|Although guilds {{had been}} formed around {{specific}} trades, by {{the eighteenth century}} many of the London guilds, known as Livery Companies, no longer had monopoly control of their indicated trades. [...] Only a few companies by this time specified the actual trade to be practiced by its members, so members of the company could practice a trade completely unrelated to the named trade of the company.

2500|$|Wharton wrote {{extensively}} on economic matters, including protective tariffs and business cycles. [...] In {{the last half}} of the 19th century, business education typically consisted mainly of training on the job or an apprenticeship. Wharton conceived of a school that would teach how to develop and <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>business,</b> and to anticipate and deal with the cycles of economic activity. In 1881 Wharton donated $100,000 to the University of Pennsylvania to found a [...] "School of Finance and Economy" [...] for this purpose. He specified that the Wharton School faculty advocate economic protectionism, as he had when lobbying for American businesses in Washington. However, the school soon began broaden its outlook to a global one and to teach other disciplines such as politics and the developing social sciences, and introduced the teaching of business management and finance as these disciplines gradually coalesced. The Wharton School was the first to include such a practical focus on business, finance, and management. During its first century through the present day, it was and is widely known as one of the most prominent schools of business in the world.|$|E
60|$|The Heartbreak people {{neither could}} nor would do {{anything}} of the sort. With their heads as full of the Anticipations of Mr H. G. Wells as the heads of our actual rulers were empty even of the anticipations of Erasmus or Sir Thomas More, they refused the drudgery of politics, and {{would have made a}} very poor job of it if they had changed their minds. Not that they would have been allowed to meddle anyhow, as only through the accident of being a hereditary peer can anyone in these days of Votes for Everybody get into parliament if handicapped by a serious modern cultural equipment; but if they had, their habit of living in a vacuum would have left them helpless end ineffective in public affairs. Even in private life they were often helpless wasters of their inheritance, like the people in Tchekov's Cherry Orchard. Even those who lived within their incomes were really kept going by their solicitors and agents, being unable to manage an estate or <b>run</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> without continual prompting from those who {{have to learn how to}} do such things or starve.|$|E
