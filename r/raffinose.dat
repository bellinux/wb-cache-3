25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other fruit wines in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and <b>raffinose</b> and metabolize glucose, sucrose, <b>raffinose,</b> maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} soluble carbohydrates {{of mature}} soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide <b>raffinose</b> (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides <b>raffinose</b> and stachyose protect {{the viability of}} the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.|$|E
25|$|Since soluble soy {{carbohydrates}} {{are found}} in the whey and are broken down during fermentation, soy concentrate, soy protein isolates, tofu, soy sauce, and sprouted soybeans are without flatus activity. On the other hand, there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting oligosaccharides such as <b>raffinose</b> and stachyose, namely, encouraging indigenous bifidobacteria in the colon against putrefactive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and <b>raffinose.</b> Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, <b>raffinose,</b> as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{controversy}} surrounding Splenda, a sucralose sweetener, is focused not on safety but on its marketing. It has been marketed with the slogan, [...] "Splenda is made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar." [...] Sucralose is prepared from either of two sugars, sucrose or <b>raffinose.</b> With either base sugar, processing replaces three oxygen-hydrogen groups in the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.|$|E
2500|$|LC-MS is {{also used}} for the {{analysis}} of natural products and the profiling of secondary metabolites in plants. In this regard, MS-based systems are useful to acquire more detailed information about the wide spectrum of compounds from a complex biological plant sample. LC-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) {{is also used}} in plant metabolomics, but this technique can only detect and quantify the most abundant metabolites. LC-MS has been useful to advance the field of plant metabolomics, which aims to study the plant system at molecular level providing a non-biased characterization of the plant [...] metabolome in response to its environment. The first [...] application of LC-MS in plant metabolomics [...] was the detection [...] {{of a wide range of}} [...] highly polar metabolites, oligosaccharides, amino acids, amino sugars, and sugar nucleotides from Cucurbita maxima phloem tissues. Another example of LC-MS in plant metabolomics is the efficient separation and identification [...] of glucose, sucrose, <b>raffinose,</b> stachyose, and verbascose from leaf extracts of Arabidopsis thaliana.|$|E
2500|$|Star-like waxy {{flowers are}} {{produced}} on [...] inflorescences {{arising from the}} stem from June to September in the wild with most flowers wilting by August. When cultivated in Europe however, the plant flowers between December and January. This flowering habit is what lends the orchid several of its common names, such as [...] "Comet orchid" [...] due {{to the shape of}} its flower and [...] "Christmas orchid" [...] due to the timing of its flowering. Each flower opens up with a green coloration, but eventually turns white with tones of light green. The amount of green in each flower can vary from plant to plant. It is claimed that the age-dependent color change is more pronounced in wild A.sesquipedale than in greenhouse-grown plants. The sepals tend to stay green for a longer time than the petals. As the flower ages further it goes from white to yellowish and then from orange to brown as it begins to wilt. As the wilting progresses the dorsal sepal bends down and then the lateral sepals bend inward with the lip remaining fairly stationary. Finally the entire flower closes in on itself. A distinctive feature of the flowers is that they have a long green spur attached. The spur of the flower is [...] from its tip to the tip of the flower's lip. The specific epithet sesquipedale is Latin for [...] "one-and-a-half-feet-long," [...] referring to the distance between the end of the spur and {{the very top of the}} dorsal sepal. At the end of the spur is a small amount of nectar usually about 40–300µl in volume. In general, longer spurs tend to have greater concentrations of nectar. This nectar fills the spur up to within [...] from the bottom of the spur. The nectar has been found to contain the sugars fructose, sucrose, glucose, and <b>raffinose.</b> The flowers produce an extremely intense spicy scent that can easily fill a room; this fragrance is only present during the night and is reminiscent of lily and some nocturnally flowering Nicotiana species. The scent has been found to be composed of approximately 39 different chemical constituents with its greatest concentration consisting of isovaleraldoxime, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, isovaleronitrile, benzyl benzoate, phenylethyl alcohol, isovaleraldehyde, and phenylacetaldoxime. Usually 1 to 5 flowers are produced at a time.|$|E
5000|$|This {{family also}} {{includes}} <b>raffinose</b> synthase proteins, {{also known as}} seed inhibition (Sip1) proteins. <b>Raffinose</b> (O-alpha- D-galactopyranosyl- (1-->6)- O-alpha- D-glucopyranosyl-(1<-->2)- O-beta- D-fructofuranoside) is a widespread oligosaccharide in plant seeds and other tissues. <b>Raffinose</b> synthase [...] is the key enzyme that channels sucrose into the <b>raffinose</b> oligosaccharide pathway.|$|E
50|$|Procedures {{concerning}} cryopreservation {{have used}} <b>raffinose</b> to provide hypertonicity for cell desiccation prior to freezing. Either <b>raffinose</b> or sucrose {{is used as}} a base substance for sucralose.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of glycosyltransferases, to be {{specific}} the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is raffinose:raffinose alpha-D-galactosyltransferase.

5000|$|The <b>raffinose</b> {{family of}} {{oligosaccharides}} (RFOs) are alpha-galactosyl derivatives of sucrose, {{and the most}} common are the trisaccharide <b>raffinose,</b> the tetrasaccharide stachyose, and the pentasaccharide verbascose. RFOs are almost ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, being found in a large variety of seeds from many different families, and they rank second only to sucrose in abundance as soluble carbohydrates.|$|E
50|$|Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, <b>raffinose,</b> and two products, 1F-alpha-D-galactosylraffinose and sucrose.|$|E

50|$|<b>Raffinose</b> is a {{trisaccharide}} {{composed of}} galactose, glucose, and fructose. It {{can be found}} in beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, other vegetables, and whole grains. <b>Raffinose</b> can be hydrolyzed to D-galactose and sucrose by the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL), an enzyme not found in the human digestive tract. α-GAL also hydrolyzes other α-galactosides such as stachyose, verbascose, and galactinol, if present. The enzyme does not cleave β-linked galactose, as in lactose.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are alpha-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-1D-myo-inositol and sucrose, whereas its two {{products are}} myo-inositol and <b>raffinose.</b>|$|E

50|$|FODMAPs {{are short}} chain {{carbohydrates}} that are poorly {{absorbed in the}} small intestine. They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose (fructans) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS, stachyose, <b>raffinose),</b> disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols), such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol.|$|E
50|$|In {{standard}} {{tests of}} physiological characteristics, the bacterium {{was able to}} hydrolyse starch, but not casein nor gelatin, and {{it was able to}} produce acid from both of the sugars lactose and <b>raffinose.</b> It does not have the ability to reduce nitrate.|$|E
5000|$|Stachyose is a {{tetrasaccharide}} {{consisting of}} two α--galactose units, one α--glucose unit, and one β--fructose unit sequentially linked as gal(α1→6)gal(α1→6)glc(α1↔2β)fru. Together with related oligosaccharides such as <b>raffinose,</b> Stachyose occurs naturally in numerous vegetables (e.g. green beans, soybeans and other beans) and other plants.|$|E
50|$|Not {{all natural}} {{oligosaccharides}} occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Some, {{such as the}} <b>raffinose</b> series, occur as storage or transport carbohydrates in plants.

50|$|Oligosaccharides, such as {{stachyose}} and <b>raffinose,</b> {{are reduced}} in higher amounts during germination than during cooking. Minerals and B vitamins are retained more effectively during germination than with cooking. Phytic acids are reduced significantly, but trypsin inhibitor, tannin, and saponin reduction is less effective than cooking.|$|E
50|$|Eating {{too much}} cabbage {{may lead to}} {{increased}} intestinal gas which causes bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide <b>raffinose,</b> which the small intestines cannot break down.
