5000|$|The Privacy Act of 1974 ( [...] , [...] ), a United States federal law, {{establishes}} a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, {{and dissemination of}} personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records {{is a group of}} records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires that agencies give the public notice of their systems of records by publication in the Federal Register. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent of the written consent of the subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. The Act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements.

40|$|Independent medical {{evaluations}} Ebrahim and colleagues, 1 identify impor-tant {{ethical and}} legal concerns relating to independent medical evaluations (IMEs). The authors 1 {{question whether the}} patient (examinee) has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> receive {{a copy of the}} independent medical evalua-tion report. However, the current clinical standard in Canada, which is reinforced by legislation, is that patients do have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> their health information. For example, the Personal Information Pro-tection and Electronic Documents Act and the corresponding provincial acts guarantee that the patient has access to health information and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> ask for <b>corrections</b> <b>to</b> be made where necessary. Also, the assumption is that the patient has given consent for the collec-tion of the health information. One might want to consider whether giving free consent is possible for patients, when the consequence of withholding consent is the loss of disability benefits. The authors 1 also emphasize that physicians undertaking an IME are not in a treatment relationship with the patient. Therefore, it becomes problem-atic when these physicians make treat-ment recommendations, because this runs contrary to medical practice regu-latory requirements...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a perturbative approach {{to solving the}} time dependent Schroedinger equation, named adiabatic perturbation theory (APT), whose zeroth order term is the quantum adiabatic approximation. The small parameter in the power series expansion of the time-dependent wave function is the inverse {{of the time it}} takes to drive the system's Hamiltonian from the initial to its final form. We review other standard perturbative and non-perturbative ways of going beyond the adiabatic approximation, extending and finding exact relations among them, and also compare the efficiency of those methods against the APT. Most importantly, we determine APT <b>corrections</b> <b>to</b> the Berry phase by use of the Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. We then solve several time dependent problems allowing us to illustrate that the APT is the only perturbative method that gives the <b>right</b> <b>corrections</b> <b>to</b> the adiabatic approximation. Finally, we propose an experiment to measure the APT <b>corrections</b> <b>to</b> the Berry phase and show, for a particular spin- 1 / 2 problem, that to first order in APT the geometric phase should be two and a half times the (adiabatic) Berry phase.

25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society.
