5|$|In the Modern Age and Renaissance, European herbals diversified and innovated, {{and came}} to <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> direct {{observation}} than being mere adaptations of traditional models. Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes by Leonhart Fuchs (1542, with over 400 plants), the astrologically themed Complete Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper (1653), and the Curious Herbal by Elizabeth Blackwell (1737).|$|E
5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state of mind which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New Orleans to be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north where the state came to <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E
25|$|In other words, natural {{deduction}} and sequent calculus systems are particular distinct kinds of Gentzen-style systems. Hilbert-style systems typically {{have a very}} small number of inference rules, <b>relying</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> sets of axioms. Gentzen-style systems typically have very few axioms, if any, <b>relying</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> sets of rules.|$|R

5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be less aggressive about this and will <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E
5|$|As Islamic {{regulations}} {{stated in}} the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action. According to Sunni schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus, {{the exact nature of}} which bears no consensus itself; analogical reason; pure reason; seeking the public interest; juristic discretion; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims; and local customs. Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead. Shafi'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others. Among Shia, Usuli school of Ja'fari jurisprudence uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the intellect. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. Akhbari Ja'faris <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> tradition and reject ijtihad. According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E
50|$|Correia owns {{a career}} 44% groundball rate. Between 2005-2012, Correia relied on his slider and fastball. In 2013, Correia is now <b>relying</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his cutter, {{throwing}} it 36% {{of the time}} and adding a split finger to his arsenal. Correia is <b>relying</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his sinker and his cutter than his fastball, which he is throwing just 13% of the time in 2013. He also throws a curveball.|$|R
50|$|Intuitive {{decision-making}} can be {{contrasted with}} deliberative decision-making, {{which is based}} on cognitive factors like beliefs, arguments, and reasons, commonly referred to as one's explicit knowledge. Intuitive decision-making is based on implicit knowledge relayed to the conscious mind at the point of decision through affect or unconscious cognition. Some studies also suggest that intuitive decision-making <b>relies</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the mind's parallel processing functions, while deliberative decision-making <b>relies</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> sequential processing.|$|R

25|$|Campanian cuisine varies {{within the}} region. While Neapolitan dishes centre on seafood, Casertan and Aversan ones <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> fresh {{vegetables}} and cheeses. The cuisine from Sorrento combines the culinary traditions from both Naples and Salerno.|$|E
25|$|The larger {{municipalities}} <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> {{loans and}} on internal cash generation, while {{the smaller ones}} depend more on grants and other sources of funding.

25|$|Cairns was a {{destructive}} batsman who could hit sixes {{straight down the}} ground and in his earlier days was an intelligent fast-medium bowler. Since then, persistent injuries have forced him to drop his pace and <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> his hard-to-read slower ball.|$|E
25|$|After the {{perceived}} {{poor performance in}} battles in Malaya and Burma in 1942, {{it was decided that}} the existing infantry divisions were over–mechanised. To counter this, the 17th and 39th divisions were selected to become light divisions, of only two brigades which would <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> animal and four-wheel-drive transport.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Sabathia's {{velocity}} decrease {{has caused}} {{him to be a}} pitcher that had to <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> location rather than velocity. On July 3, 2013, Sabathia collected his 200th career win against the Minnesota Twins. His season ended early due to a strained hamstring, finishing with a 14–13 record and a career-high 4.78 ERA.|$|E
25|$|After the Hama uprising, the Islamist insurrection was broken, and the Brotherhood {{has since}} {{operated}} in exile while other factions surrendered or slipped into hiding. Government attitudes in Syria hardened considerably during the uprising, and Assad would <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> repression than on political tactics {{for the remainder}} of his rule, although an economic liberalization began in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Some principalities taxed windows, doors, or {{cabinets}} {{to reduce}} consumption of imported glass and hardware. Armoires, hutches, and wardrobes {{were employed to}} evade taxes on doors and cabinets. In some circumstances, taxes are also used to enforce public policy like congestion charge (to cut road traffic and encourage public transport) in London. In Tsarist Russia, taxes were clamped on beards. Today, one of the most-complicated taxation systems worldwide is in Germany. Three quarters of the world's taxation literature refers to the German system. Under the German system, there are 118 laws, 185 forms, and 96,000 regulations, spending €3.7 billion to collect the income tax. In the United States, the IRS has about 1,177 forms and instructions, 28.4111 megabytes of Internal Revenue Code which contained 3.8 million words as of 1 February 2010, numerous tax regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations, and suppmentary material in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. Today, governments in more advanced economies (i.e. Europe and North America) tend to <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> direct taxes, while developing economies (i.e. India and several African countries) <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> indirect taxes.|$|E

50|$|A {{right-handed}} sinkerball pitcher, Ross <b>relies</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> weak {{contact and}} groundouts than strikeouts. He also throws a slider, curveball, and changeup that he mixes in as off-speed pitches.|$|R
50|$|Smith is a changeup specialist, <b>relying</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> {{off speed}} pitches and {{deception}} rather than velocity. His fastball tops out between 86-88 MPH {{and he also}} throws a curveball.|$|R
25|$|The use {{of vocal}} and visual {{communication}} {{has been shown}} to vary by location, based on elements such as noise pollution and the amount of open space. For instance, populations living in large cities generally <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> the visual signals, due to the generally louder environment with more areas without much visual restriction. However, in heavily wooded areas, vocal signals are used more often due to the relatively lower noise levels and a dense canopy restricting visual range.|$|E
25|$|Proposition 13 reduces {{property}} tax revenue for municipalities in California. They {{are forced to}} <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> state funding and therefore may lose autonomy and control. The amount of taxes available to the municipality {{in any given year}} largely depends on the number of property transfers taking place. However, since existing property owners have an incentive to remain in their property and not sell, there are fewer property transfers under this type of {{property tax}} system.|$|E
25|$|The Chechens {{had become}} {{increasingly}} radicalized. Former Soviet Army officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov have been succeeded {{by people who}} <b>rely</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> religious ideology, rather than the nationalistic feelings of the population. While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of {{the independence of the}} Chechen Republic Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole North Caucasus, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups.|$|E
