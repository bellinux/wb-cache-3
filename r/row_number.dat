25|$|By equivocating certain columns with {{parameters}} to be estimated, Plackett–Burmans {{can also}} be used to construct mixed categorical and numerical designs, with interactions or high order effects, requiring no more than 4 runs more than the number of model parameters to be estimated. Sort by a-1 columns assigned to categorical variable A and following columns, where A=1+int(a'i /(max(i)+0.00001)), i = <b>row</b> <b>number</b> and a = A's number of values. Next sort on columns assigned to any other categorical variables and following columns, repeating as needed. Such designs, if large, may otherwise be incomputable by standard search techniques like D-optimality. For example, 13 variables averaging 3 values each could have well over a million combinations to search. To estimate the 105 parameters in a quadratic model of 13 variables, one must formally exclude from consideration or compute |X'X| for well over 106C102, i.e. 313C105, or roughly 10484 matrices.|$|E
