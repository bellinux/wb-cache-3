We have cloned a transmembrane semaphorin, Sema W, that belongs to the class IV subgroup of the semaphorin family. The mouse and rat forms of Sema W show 97 % amino acid sequence identity with each other, and each shows about 91 % identity with the human form. The gene for Sema W is divided into 15 exons, up to 4 of which are absent in the human cDNAs that we sequenced. Unlike many other semaphorins, Sema W is expressed at low levels in the developing embryo but was found to be expressed at high levels in the adult central nervous system and lung. Functional studies with purified membrane fractions from COS 7 cells transfected with a Sema W expression plasmid showed that Sema W has growth-cone collapse activity against retinal ganglion-cell axons, indicating that vertebrate transmembrane semaphorins, like secreted semaphorins, can collapse growth cones. Genetic mapping of human SEMAW with human/hamster <b>radiation</b> <b>hybrids</b> localized the gene to chromosome 2 p 13.

40|$|Summary We have {{constructed}} a <b>radiation</b> <b>hybrid</b> (RH) map of chicken chromosome (GGA) 15. This map {{can be used}} as a resource to efficiently map genes to this chromosome. The map has been developed using a 6000 rad chicken–hamster whole-genome <b>radiation</b> <b>hybrid</b> panel (ChickRH 6). In total, six microsatellite loci, 18 sequence tagged sites (STSs) from BAC end sequences and 11 genes were typed on the panel. The initial framework map comprised eight markers, and an additional 23 markers were then added to generate the final map. The total map length was 334 centiRay 6000 (cR 6000). The estimated retention frequency for the data set was 18 %. Using an estimated physical length of 21 Mb, the ratio between cR 6000 and physical distance over GGA 15 was estimated to be 0. 063 Mb/cR 6000. The present map increases the marker density and the marker resolution on GGA 15 and enables fast mapping of new chicken genes homologous to genes from human chromosomes 12 and 22.
