25|$|Light taut wire, LTW or LWTW. The oldest {{position}} <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> {{used for}} DP {{is still very}} accurate in relatively shallow water. A clumpweight is lowered to the seabed. By measuring the amount of wire paid out and {{the angle of the}} wire by a gimbal head, the relative position can be calculated. Care should be taken not to let the wire angle become too large to avoid dragging. For deeper water the system is less favourable, as current will curve the wire. There are however systems that counteract this with a gimbal head on the clumpweight. Horizontal LTW’s are also used when operating close to a structure. Objects falling on the wire are a risk here.|$|E
25|$|Most {{recently}} in the 1950s, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell has reviewed and indexed the site and surrounding features. Earlier excavations by Sir Richard Colt Hoare and William Cunnington in the 1800s revealed most of the various finds and interments. However, as the three-age system {{had not yet been}} introduced, they were unable to date their finds and therefore were at a disadvantage when trying to interpret them. The following table includes for details of the nearby surrounding tumuli, barrows, and other ancient features. The tumuli and barrows are referenced by Grinsells <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> which uses the original parish name. Only the Knook referenced sites are shown here although there are many other Grinsell referenced tumuli also to be found nearby which fall into the adjacent parishes of Chitterne, Codford, and Heytesbury; some of which form part of the Aston Valley Barrow Cemetery, some 2000m to the southeast of the hillfort.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that the aircraft {{was the subject of}} a large number of complaints by pilots, called write-ups in the aviation industry. The highest number of complaints concerned the captain's side vertical speed indicator, which informs the air crew of the rate (in ft/min: Feet Per Minute) at which the aircraft is ascending or descending. In all, 48 complaints were made regarding the instrument in the three months before the crash. The aircraft's left right inertial <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> which informs pilots what direction the aircraft is turning in, was complained about a total of thirty times. The International Herald Tribune reported that this may be of particular significance. The third most-complained about instrument was a fuel differential light, which received fifteen write-ups. Numerous complaints were also received about inoperative cockpit instrument lights, as well as multiple other malfunctions. Several complaints were made that the flaps, which modify drag and lift during take-off and landing, were jamming at twenty-five degrees upon landing, and there were two complaints that the weather radar was faulty.|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} this paper is a {{discussion}} of the meaning of the Newtonian concept of a reference frame showing no rotation with respect to a set of distant celestial objects in the framework of general relativity. Because of the properties of Newtonian absolute space and time and the existence of global inertial <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> in Newton's theory the theoretical construction of such a globally nonrotating reference frame is obvious. This definitively no longer is the case in a relativistic framework. There exist no global inertial <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> and one faces the necessity to give the notion of nonrotating frames a rigorous meaning. Considering possible definitions of nonrotating reference frames in both Newtonian and relativistic physics, we conclude that the concept of relative spatial rotation between <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> plays a fundamental role in defining nonrotating astronomical reference frames. It turns out that the property of two relativistic <b>reference</b> <b>systems</b> to show no [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Since {{one might}} not travel faster than light, one might {{conclude}} that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then {{never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of time dilation, the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the speed of light (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> of the Solar System, but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed c, their proper speed (distance as seen by Earth divided by their proper time) can be much greater than c. This is seen in statistical studies of muons traveling much further than c times their half-life (at rest), if traveling close to c.|$|E

30|$|The {{processing}} {{took place}} in two steps—data processing and geoprocessing using GIS. The first step involved data processing in a spreadsheet environment for the extracted projects data. This comprised data cleaning, data validation, and sorting. Data cleaning is concerned with identifying and removing errors and inconsistencies from data {{in order to enhance}} the quality of data (Rahm and Do 2000). Most of the data-processing tasks involved data cleaning. A new field was also created to query the highway inventory database for GIS-compatible linear reference values for project records. This was done by cross referencing the other location <b>referencing</b> <b>systems</b> to a central and comprehensive linear <b>referencing</b> <b>system</b> known as the “Distance from Origin (DFO) system. The PMIS of TxDOT contains three different linear <b>referencing</b> <b>systems</b> for each discretized pavement section for the entire highway network. Accordingly, after the DFO system was selected as the main LRS for integration purposes, all the other <b>referencing</b> <b>systems</b> were converted to the DFO system. Given that all the <b>referencing</b> <b>systems</b> are linear, intermediate values were interpolated. In a few instances (less than 5 %) where only qualitative location descriptions were given, the authors used the “Statewide Planning Map” (Texas Department of Transportation 2016 a) developed by TxDOT to extract the DFO values of project limits.|$|R
