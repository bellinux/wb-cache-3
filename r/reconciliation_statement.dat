40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that two balance sheets, one {{at the beginning and}} one {{at the end of the}} period, and an income statements, together with its related retained earnings <b>reconciliation</b> <b>statement,</b> are raw materials for preparing the funds flow statement. The author has developed a new practice of preparing the statement directly from the accounts record, without balance sheets and other financial statements, for the purpose of presenting a method of reporting the flow of funds over any shorter period than a fiscal year A trial balance is prepared over a period on which the fund flow statement is intended to be made that consists of only entries of increase and decrease in every account based upon transactions taken place over the period. This trial balance may be called a " Funds Flow Trial Balance," which is defferent from the trial balance prepared under the usual accounting practice in that the former does not involve the figure of the beginning balance in each account The funds flow trial balance is the basic data with which the funds flow statement is provided, because this trial balance involves the same figures as the comparative balance sheet figures with which the funds flow statement is prepared under the traditional method. The funds flow trial balance can be prepared at any time, even in the middle of the fiscal year wherever the accounts record is available, without making financial statements, while it is only after the financial statements have been made that the comparative balance sheet figures can be provided. This method can be applied to the preparation of the fiscal fund flow statement, and it opens the way of determining the net income for the year from the fiscal funds flow statement. The author illustrates this process on a work sheet through which the reader may understand in more real feature the relationship between the flow of funds and of the income in a certain business entity. If the flow of funds could be presented with the revenue and expense on the financial statements, the latter would more clearly disclose the process of coming out the net income than they do at present and the more real extent of distributable amount of income would be measured. The author illustrates a form of combining the funds statement with the income statement and the retained earnings <b>reconciliation</b> <b>statement,</b> and combining the "Changes of Working 1 Capital" with the balance sheet...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} extent to which the {{adoption}} of International Accounting Standards has affected the small and growing companies quoted on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). Following the 2002 EU regulation, companies listed on the main London Stock Exchange have adopted International Accounting Standards from 2005, while for AIM companies this requirement to comply with international standards was extended until 2007. At the same time, these companies were allowed to follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on a voluntary basis from 2005, resulting in the provision of a unique setting to investigate the pre and post mandatory regime. In addition, AIM companies are comparatively different with respect to size, regulation, and ownership structure. It has been observed in previous literature that accounting rules will provide different :esults in different economic and institutional settings. This study takes this opportunity to analyse the importance and magnitude of implications of the International Accounting Standards to the companies quoted on the Alternative Investment Market by using -a dual theoretical lens: positive accounting theory and decision usefulness theory. A multi-method approach IS applied 111 the pursuit of discovering the implications of international accounting standards on small quoted companies. A questionnaire survey was used as the main research tool for collecting data from the senior financial executives of the sampled companies. This was followed by analysis of the reconciliation statement: a mandatory transitional document produced upon each company's adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Finally, semi-structured interviews were conducted to supplement and check the reliability of the findings of the questionnaire survey and the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>statement</b> analysis. Both parametric and non-parametric statistics were applied to examine any variation between the opinions of the respondents. The results suggest that the senior financial executives of the sampled companies perceive the introduction of International Accounting Standards as nothing more than a technical accounting exercise, due to its effects on the outside world. The findings also reveal that the companies have not observed the purported benefits of reporting under IFRS. Moreover, the results demonstrate that voluntary adopters, relatively bigger in size, have been benefiting to some extent. On the other hand, most of the companies who waited until the adoption of IFRS became obligatory consider it as an additional burden and a costly exercise for very little or no benefit. More specifically, the results suggest that these implications are closely associated with the size of companies and conclude that size matters in both the adoption and implications of IFRS. These results would be useful for non-listed small and medium size entities and large private entities likely to use IFRS on a mandatory basis on or after 2014. As later evidence than 2005 listed companies, implementation reflects system learning and increased regulatory convergence of the UK and IFRS. This study therefore contributes to the impact of adoption in terms of compliance costs and improved disclosures rather than just reporting measurement differences for AIM quoted companies. As such, this study provides cost-benefits information on a major change in accounting regulations, which may inform future regulatory changes, including the introduction of IFRS for private companies.

40|$|From 1 January 2005, all EU-listed {{firms are}} {{required}} to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS) (EU, 2002). This requirement {{represents one of the}} most fundamental changes to affect financial reporting in recent times. This dissertation is an examination of the introduction and impact of IFRS on the annual report and accounts of UK companies in an attempt to investigate the decision-usefulness of the new IFRS disclosures. This examination is facilitated in three ways: (i) a content analysis is undertaken to investigate the magnitude and nature of the changes in IFRS-related disclosure presented in annual report and accounts produced prior to and following the introduction of IFRS; (ii) an analysis of the Reconciliation Statements produced upon first-time adoption of IFRS included in corporate annual reports to examine the impact on both profit and equity {{as a result of the}} transition from previous national GAAP to reporting in accordance with IFRS; and, (iii) an assessment of the new IFRS disclosures against the qualitative characteristics outlined in the IASB Decision-Usefulnessfr amework. In other words, it is an investigation of whether the claims of the IASI 3 about the usefulness of the mandated IFRS disclosures for decision-makers are supported in practice with the contents of corporate annual reports and accounts in the UK. The results of the content analysis indicate that the implementation of IFRS had a significant impact on the content of the annual report and accounts of UK companies. The amount of disclosure in company annual reports increased significantly following the introduction of the new reporting regime. Furthermore, there was a large increase in the physical size of the annual reports for the vast majority of the firms surveyed. The scale of the impact varied from standard to standard, however, the nature and magnitude of the information presented in UK-published annual reports has been fundamentally impacted by the introduction of IFRS. The <b>Reconciliation</b> <b>Statement</b> analysis results reveal that profit disclosed under UK GAAP increased by 105. 85 per cent following the implementation of IFRS. In addition, the results show that the introduction of IFRS had a significant impact on reported equity; however, there was an almost even split between those which experienced a favourable impact following the transition and those disclosing a negative effect on the balance sheet post-IFRS adoption. The main IFRS standards which impacted reported results under previous national GAAP were IAS 10, IAS 12, IAS 19, IAS 40 and the IFRS 3 / 1 AS 36 /IAS 38 group of standards. The assessmenot f the decision-usefulness of the new IFRS information reveals that the widespread variation in impact on reported results, the complexity of the supplementary narrative disclosures, absence of company-specific and forward-looking information, uncertainty about the long-term impact of the changeover and the lack of comparability between the Reconciliation Statements will likely have constrained the usefulness of the new disclosures for users and therefore their investment decisions. Thus, one of the aims of the standard setters does not seem to have been achieved as users of UK corporate annual reports were not supplied with more useful information about these companies compared to what was previously disclosed under UK GAAP.

40|$|LONG ABSTRACT § INTRODUCTION § One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} changes to affect the financial reporting of EU-quoted firms in recent times has been introduction of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) since 2005. Therefore, in the European Union (EU), the basis underpinning the preparation of the annual report as well as the components, formats and presentations of the financial reporting have been changed. Many concerns have been raised about IFRS, some real and some serious. An independent assessment was, therefore, required to examine IFRS implementation in different EU countries and to assist future adopters of the IFRS. PURPOSE § This study examines the implementation of IFRS in three countries: the UK, Italy and Ireland. The study focused on these three countries because it was expected that companies in countries with a similar national accounting environment, such as the UK and Ireland, would experience similar reporting changes following the adoption of IFRS, and that companies in countries with a very different reporting environment, legal system and culture, such as Italy, would be affected differently by the adoption of IFRS. For example, the UK and Ireland are common law countries with accounting standards that focus primarily on the needs of shareholders, while Italy has a legal system based on civil law where traditionally creditors are viewed as being the most important users of financial statements. Thus, it was expected that the implementation of IFRS, with its shareholder focus, would require more of a cultural change in Italy than in the UK or Ireland. The following research objectives are addressed in this study: • To quantify {{the nature and extent of}} the changes in financial reporting that have been experienced as a result of IFRS adoption. In particular, the study examines the increase in disclosure relating to these new accounting standards as well as the changes to net profit and equity when comparing national Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to IFRS GAAP. • To assess the costs associated with the production and publication of the new information. • To identify the standards which have caused the greatest challenges for preparers and users to implement, reflecting education and training needs, changes to valuation models and the need for a general understanding of the accounting requirements and concepts. • To examine the usefulness of IFRS information from the perspective of preparers and users of financial statements, both from the usefulness of the contents being mandated as well as the formats in which the additional information must be disclosed. • To review whether the information required under IFRS is decision-useful for stakeholders. DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY § The above research objectives are considered within the framework of decision-usefulness to assess whether IFRS is more useful to users than national GAAP for making investment decisions, after consideration of the costs involved for both preparers and users. Three different methods of analysis were used to examine the introduction of IFRS to address the above research aims: • a content analysis of financial statements (in total 175 pre-IFRS annual reports and 175 -post IFRS annual reports were analysed); • an analysis of the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>statement</b> between IFRS and national GAAP using a ‘conservatism’ index (in total 125 reconciliation statements were analysed); and • a multiple-stakeholder perspective on the adoption of IFRS using interviews with preparers, auditors, analysts and regulators (in total 32 subjects were interviewed). Each of these three methods provides an international comparison on the adoption of IFRS between the UK, Italy and Ireland. FINDINGS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS § The findings from the content analysis comparison of company annual reports pre-IFRS and post-IFRS suggest that companies in Italy were more affected by the adoption of IFRS; the size of Italian annual reports grew far more significantly than those published in the UK or Ireland, although even in the latter two countries the annual reports increased substantially post-IFRS. With reference to the impact of IFRS on profit and equity the following results were found: the implementation of IFRS increased the reported profit of companies in the UK, Italy and Ireland such that national GAAP profit was only 66...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} changes to affect financial reporting {{in recent years has been}} the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This paper aims to examine the nature of the Income Statement and Net Equity IFRS adjustments for a sample of companies from the UK, Ireland and Italy following the introduction of IFRS. Design/methodology/approach – A sample of IFRS <b>Reconciliation</b> <b>Statements</b> are examined to identify the most significant IFRS adjustments. Using an index of conservatism, these amounts are further analysed to assess their impact on the accounting numbers reported under previous national GAAP. Findings – For all three countries, the IFRS profit was greater than that reported under previous national GAAP. IFRS also had a significant effect on net worth; while UK and Italian companies experienced an increase in equity upon the adoption of IFRS, the Irish firms in the sample recorded a decrease. The analysis also indicated that the impact of IFRS on profit and net worth was primarily attributable to a few core standards including IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 5, IAS 10, IAS 12, IAS 16, IAS 17, IAS 19, IAS 38 and IAS 39. Practical implications – A multi-country perspective for future IFRS research is required as the impact of individual IFRS varies in importance from one country to another. Originality/value – By analysing the IFRS that have had a significant impact on accounting numbers prepared under previous national GAAP, opportunities for future research are identified.

Design/methodology/approach – In line with recent literature, the paper employs Gray's comparability index. The sample consists of 238 Greek companies, representing 75 per cent of the companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange at the end of March 2006. Findings – Implementation of IFRS {{had a significant impact on}} financial position and reported performance as well as on gearing and liquidity ratios. On average, impact on shareholders' equity and net income was positive while impact on gearing and liquidity was negative. Only companies with non-Big 4 auditors faced significant impact on net profit and liquidity. They also faced a significantly greater impact on gearing than companies with Big 4 auditors. A large number of companies with material negative changes is identified, suggesting that transition to IFRS and the fair value option does not necessarily result in higher shareholders' equity figures. Many companies provided inadequate transitional disclosures. This is significantly related to auditor size.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{issues relating to}} the mandatory adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by Greek listed companies. Initially, the impact of transition, {{as a result of}} differences between IFRS and Greek GAAP, on the first IFRS financial statements in 2005 is assessed. Then, a disclosure index is constructed, containing all the disclosure items mandated by the IFRS extant at the end of April 2006. Based on this research instrument, and two disclosure index methods, compliance with IFRS mandatory disclosures in their first year of implementation is examined. A review of disclosure theories, the features of the Greek financial reporting system, and considerations regarding the timing of the research are used as a basis for establishing a priori expectations and testing the potential factors explaining compliance with IFRS mandatory disclosures. Subsequently, any change in the value relevance of accounting information before and immediately after IFRS mandatory implementation is examined. Whether the <b>reconciliation</b> <b>statements</b> required by IFRS 1 provided value relevant information to investors is also explored. Finally, the valuation implications of IFRS mandatory disclosures are explored. The above analyses indicate the following. Greek listed companies’ financial statements were affected significantly by the adoption of IFRS. The average level of compliance with IFRS mandatory disclosures approximates to 80 %. The impact on net income and shareholders’ equity, {{as a result of the}} transition to IFRS, as well as audit firm size, are significantly associated with the extent to which companies comply. No change in the value relevance of accounting information between 2004 and 2005 is identified. Reconciliation adjustments are incrementally value relevant and levels of mandatory disclosures do have valuation effects. Based on the findings of the above analyses, the study contributes to the relevant literature and discusses policy implications. It also concludes with suggestions for further research and recommendations on the methods for measuring compliance with IFRS mandatory disclosures.

40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in the past decade converging national Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), including United States (U. S.) GAAP, with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Furthermore, many countries have adopted, or partially adopted, IFRSs as their national GAAP. The globalisation of accounting standards motivates this study to examine the usefulness of U. S. GAAP reconciliation information over time. With the expectation that converged accounting standards decrease the usefulness of reconciliation information over time, this study examines the market reactions around the release of reconciliation information during 2002 – 2007. Decreasing usefulness of reconciliation information is expected because of accounting standards becoming increasingly similar to U. S. GAAP. This study shows that market reactions (abnormal returns and abnormal trading volume) to the release of reconciliation information are greater in the earlier period (2002 – 2004) than in the later period (2005 – 2007). This study also investigates how the usefulness of reconciliation information is affected by country-level attributes, namely, investor protection, earnings quality, and earnings and the book value of equity differences between U. S. and domestic GAAP. With the exception of earnings differences, results indicate support for the country-level attributes being associated with market reactions to the release of U. S. GAAP reconciliation information, when measured by abnormal trading volume. When market reactions are assessed using abnormal returns, no associations are found. The results of sensitivity analysis generally support the main results. Therefore, this study finds that the convergence of accounting standards leads to the decreasing usefulness of reconciliation information, indicating that the similarity of accounting standards is priced by the market over time. This study also finds some support for country-level factors impacting the usefulness of reconciliation information, as indicated by a positive association between abnormal trading volume and foreign registrants’ home country investor protection, earnings quality, and book value of equity differences. These results support the claims of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the usefulness of reconciliation information has decreased. This was a factor considered by the SEC when removing the requirement for <b>reconciliation</b> <b>statements</b> for foreign registrants preparing financial reports using IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The results also inform the SEC’s deliberations on continuing the reconciliation requirement for companies preparing financial reports using GAAP other than IFRSs as issued by the IASB...|$|R

The empirical data consisted of eighty-four US GAAP <b>reconciliations</b> of income <b>statements</b> and shareholders' equity, disclosed in Swedish annual reports during 1981 - 90. Prior qualitative research has suggested that Swedish accounting practice is conservative compared with that in the USA. However, the empirical analysis of profits and return on equity provided little support for this hypothesis. Instead, there were indications of a less conservative accounting treatment in the Swedish accounts compared with US GAAP. The most material differences between Swedish profits and those calculated using US GAAP were caused by differences in treatment of foreign currency translation, income taxes, sale and leaseback transactions and business combinations. ...|$|R

40|$|In this {{analysis}} of the retold experiences of 27 survivors {{of the war in}} northwestern Bosnia, the aim is to describe the informants’ portrayal of “war violence”, “victimhood”, and “reconciliation” as a social phenomenon as well as analyzing the discursive patterns that contribute to constructing the category “victim” and “perpetrator”. The violence practice during the war is portrayed as organized and ritualized and this creates a picture that the violence practice became a norm in the society, rather than the exception. When, after the war, different categories claim a “victim” status, it sparks a competition for victimhood. All informants are eager to present themselves as victims {{while at the same time}} the other categories’ victim status are downplayed. The stories of reconciliation are connected to the past; the interactive consequences of war-time violence are intimately linked to the narrator’s war experiences.

40|$|We aim {{to provide}} insight into the {{observed}} equity home bias phenomenon by analyzing the determinants of U. S. holdings of equities across a wide range of countries. In particular, we explore the role of information costs in determining the country distribution of U. S. investors' equity holdings using a comprehensive new data set on U. S. ownership of foreign stocks. We find that U. S. holdings of a country's equities are positively related to the share of that country's stock market that is listed on U. S. exchanges, even after controlling for capital controls, trade links, transaction costs, and historical risk-adjusted returns. We attribute this finding to the fact that foreign firms that list on U. S. exchanges are obliged to provide standardized, credible financial information, thereby reducing information costs incurred by U. S. investors. This obligation stems from U. S. investor protection regulations, which include stringent disclosure requirements, <b>reconciliation</b> of financial <b>statements</b> to U. S. standards, and an investor-friendly regulatory environment. Our results support the hypothesis that information costs are an important source of home bias: Foreign countries whose firms do not alleviate information costs by listing on a U. S. exchange are more severely underweighted in U. S. equity portfolios. Stock market; Investments, Foreign...|$|R
40|$|In this {{analysis}} of the retold experiences of 27 survivors {{of the war in}} northwestern Bosnia, the aim is to describe the informants’ portrayal of “victimhood”, “forgiveness” and “reconciliation” as a social phenomenon as well as analyzing the discursive patterns that contribute to constructing the category “victim” and “perpetrator”. When, after the war, different categories claim a “victim” status, it sparks a competition for victimhood. All informants are eager to present themselves as victims {{while at the same time}} the other categories’ victim status are downplayed. In this reproduction of competition for the victim role, all demarcations that were played out so successfully during the war live on. The stories of forgiveness and reconciliation are connected to the past; the interactive consequences of war-time violence are intimately linked to the narrator’s war experiences. The interviewees distance themselves from some individuals or described situations. It is common that the portrayal of possible forgiveness and reconciliation is transformed into a depicted implacable attitude, thus the interviewees negotiate their stances: they articulate between <b>reconciliation</b> and implacability <b>statements.</b> In these stories, “the others” are presented as external actors in the context. Throughout their narrations, some individuals can make a confession or exert a certain self-esteem; others can take the chance to explain for themselves and the audience, to express regret over their actions and possibly restore their social status. Without this type of processing, war victims risk living an existence without confession, and the war perpetrators risk becoming permanently bound to their acts – clearly an unstable future foundation for a post-war society...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{redressing}} wrongs of the past, the importance of acknowledgement is often urged. It figures significantly, for instance, in the final report of South Africa 2 ̆ 7 s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in the 1996 Canadian Royal Commiss ion Report on Aboriginal Peoples. In both documents a central theme is that acknowledging wrongs {{of the past is}} a key first step towards healing and <b>reconciliation.</b> Several recent <b>statements</b> about public apology also urge that moral apologies are signif icant because {{of the ways in which}} they acknowledge wrongdoing and responsibility. However, there seem to be few explanations of what, exactly, acknowledgement amounts to and why one would expect it to be an important stage in the healing of victims or in the reconciliation between victim and perpetrator groups. I suggest that ackno wledgement is a kind of spelling out, or articulation, of something that we already know or are in a position to know. When we acknowledge something we avow or accept it as something attached to ourselves. I distinguish between granted acknowledgement, received acknowledgement, and self-acknowledgement. Often acknowledgement is partial and compromised, a situation which may be confusing and harmful to those who have been wronged. I propose explanations as to why the acknowledgement that they are worth y human beings who were wronged and deserved better tends to be profoundly important to groups such as Blacks in South Africa and native peoples in Canada. I also address difficulties which we face when we are pressed to acknowledge injustice and wrongdo ing which we would rather not accept as part of our social history...|$|R
