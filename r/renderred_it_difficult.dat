60|$|The tears {{which stood}} in Mrs. Andrews' eyes <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{for her to}} read the inscription.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a kind}} of awe {{about the}} place, which would have <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to speak in any other manner. Gabriel whispered 'Yes,' and {{followed}} him upstairs.|$|R
60|$|As soon {{as night}} fell the Boers opened fire again, this time aiming entirely {{at the end}} of the waggons nearest the water, evidently with the {{intention}} of <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to procure water from the stream.|$|R
60|$|His {{patience}} was rewarded. In {{the half}} hour which he waited the night had fallen, and a thick fog which was rising over the swamps <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to discern anything at the distance of a few paces.|$|R
6000|$|The soldier, whose {{ideas were}} in that happy state of {{confusion}} that <b>renders</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to command the one most needed, but who still, from long discipline, had them under a wonderful control for the disorder of his brain, answered, with great promptitude: ...|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneous tissues are {{frequently}} collected (e. g. blood, tumor etc.) from humans or model animals. Therefore mRNA-Seq samples are often heterogeneous {{with regard to}} those cell types, which <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to distinguish whether gene expression variation reflects a shift in cell populations, a chang...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} grown widely in Brisbane and thrives in Sydney and Melbourne, yet is shy to flower in Cairns. Frosts <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to grow in}} Canberra. It can be {{propagated}} from seeds or cuttings of hardened new growth. Its flowerheads attract birds and insects.|$|R
60|$|Here Thousandacres {{stopped to}} laugh again, for he {{generally}} indulged in this way, in so hearty and deep a tone, as to <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{to laugh and}} talk in the same breath. As soon as through, however, he did not forget to pursue the discourse.|$|R
60|$|The bee-hunter assented to this proposal, remarking, as {{they moved}} forward, {{that he did not}} think the {{stranger}} of the tribe just named; though he admitted that the use of paint was so general and loose among these warriors, as to <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to decide.|$|R
60|$|The {{breaking}} {{out of the war}} between the United States and Great Britain multiplied the hazards and embarrassments of the enterprise. The disappointment as to convoy <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep up reinforcements and supplies; and the loss of the Lark added to the tissue of misadventures.|$|R
60|$|He {{flicked the}} team again, and the jolting <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for Winifred to ask any more questions. The prairie sod was soft with the thaw, and big lumps of it {{stuck to the}} wheels, which {{every now and then}} plunged into ruts the other {{vehicles}} had made.|$|R
30|$|Blockchain {{technology}} enforces a distributed {{consensus and}} cryptographic transactions, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to compromise {{the integrity of}} its records without being noticed by an entire network. Many advocates believe that it can completely prevent such malicious activities as double-spending and hacking (Baxter 2016; Camp 2016). However, others still remain skeptical.|$|R
50|$|Although {{executive}} agencies are usually charged with executing, not promulgating a regulatory scheme, {{the breadth and}} depth of regulation today <b>renders</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult,</b> if not impossible, for legislatures to specify the details of modern regulatory schemes. As a result, the specification of these details are mostly delegated to agencies for rulemaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he {{said when}} Dick had finished, [...] "you have made a very bad mess of things and it is, of course, {{impossible}} that you should remain here. In fact, you have <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for me to meet my neighbors and take my usual part in public affairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rose plainly {{saw that}} her lady was under {{feelings}} of excitation, which might <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for her to take a wise and prudent view of her own situation. She endeavoured gradually to awaken her {{to a sense of}} it. [...] "Dearest lady," [...] said Rose, [...] "will it please you to take my mantle?" ...|$|R
60|$|Captain Vane was right. When Alf had tumbled some of {{the heavier}} {{portions}} of lading off the sledge, it burst away like a wild-horse let go free, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> at first for Chingatok to steady it. In a few minutes, however, he had it again under control, and they soon reached the berg.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Courthon," [...] said he--and {{he felt a}} {{flush of}} shame {{mounting}} to his brow, and realized that it may need more courage to avoid an encounter than to engage in one--"there is something that {{in the heat of}} passion I forgot; something that <b>renders</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for me to meet your friend at present." ...|$|R
50|$|On a website, an IP address block {{can prevent}} a {{disruptive}} address from access, though a warning and/or account block {{may be used}} first. Dynamic allocation of IP addresses by ISPs can complicate incoming IP address blocking, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to block a specific user without blocking many IP addresses (blocks of IP address ranges), thereby creating collateral damage.|$|R
60|$|His French {{was quite}} {{good enough to}} pass in the salon of the marquis, but his ignorance of the Parisian slang spoken among the working-classes would have <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for him to keep up his assumed {{character}} among them, and would have needed the fabrication {{of all sorts of}} stories as to his birthplace and past history.|$|R
50|$|Although the act's {{passage through}} Congress seemed to {{indicate}} a growing federal commitment {{to the cause of}} civil rights, the legislation was limited. The alterations to the act <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to enforce and by 1960, black voting had increased by only 3%. Passage of the bill showed the willingness of national leaders to support, to varying degrees, the cause of civil rights.|$|R
50|$|Much {{of what we}} {{know about}} Robert-Houdin comes from his memoirs—and his {{writings}} were meant more to entertain than to chronicle, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to separate fact from fiction. Robert-Houdin would have readers believe that a major turning point in his life came when he became apprenticed to the magician Edmund De Grisi, Count's son and better known as Torrini.|$|R
60|$|Our history {{must now}} {{look a little}} backwards; and {{although}} it is rather foreign to our natural style of composition, it must speak more in narrative, and less in dialogue, rather telling what happened, than its effects upon the actors. Our purpose, however, is only conditional, for we foresee temptations which may <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for us exactly to keep it.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{pathological}} diagnosis was obtained in 22 out of 25 cases (88 %). The reason for difficult histopathological interpretation {{in the remaining}} three cases {{may be attributed to}} their vascular nature that necessitates excessive coagulation. Although initial coagulation may be helpful to decrease the risk of bleeding, it may risk the histo{{pathological diagnosis}} by masking the biopsy sample, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to establish a diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Mòcheno {{is closely}} related to Bavarian and is {{variously}} classified either as a Southern Bavarian dialect or a separate language of its own. It has also been posited that it may be descended from Lombardic. Mòcheno speakers reportedly partially understand Bavarian, Cimbrian, or Standard German. However, many essential differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for speakers of standard German to understand.|$|R
50|$|Ramadas lies at an {{altitude}} of 3800 m and is formed by a 3 x 4 km wide amphitheatre like structure, which has been interpreted as a tuff ring. Much of the volcano is buried by more recent rocks, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to visualize. A rhyolitic lava dome-like structure with dimensions of 100 - 50 m is located at the centre. Presently, streams cross the areal.|$|R
5000|$|Gesner {{himself was}} humble about his {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} the petroleum industry. In his Practical Treatise, he said that [...] "the progress of discovery in this case, as in others, has been slow and gradual. It has been carried on by the labours, not of one mind, but of many, so as to <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to discover to whom the greatest credit is due." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{went out}} on to the {{platform}} and opened fire. They knew that their chance of hitting one of the Indians was small indeed; {{the other side of}} the valley was a quarter of a mile away, and the height at which they were standing <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to judge the elevation necessary for their rifles. However, they fired as fast as they could load.|$|R
60|$|But now an {{unforeseen}} difficulty {{came in the}} way of the bloody-minded Bullers. In {{the group}} which had been formed by the friendly evolutions of their foes, the women chanced to have placed themselves exactly between them and the men, thus <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to shoot the latter without great risk of injury, if not death, to the former, for none of them felt sufficiently expert to emulate William Tell.|$|R
60|$|Passing {{over this}} ridge, and {{descending}} {{into a wide}} valley which was fertilised and beautified by a moderately-sized rivulet, Kambira led his followers towards a hamlet which lay close to the stream, nestled in a woody hollow, and, like all other Manganja villages, was surrounded by an impenetrable hedge of poisonous euphorbia--a tree which casts a deep shade, and <b>renders</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for bowmen to aim at the people inside.|$|R
500|$|This bird is {{a species}} of least concern to the IUCN, with an {{estimated}} range of [...] and between 10,000 and 100,000 wild individuals. However, {{there is evidence that}} suggests a decline in population, though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed. This decline is due primarily to habitat destruction and poaching. Although distinctive, its habit of perching in tall trees and flying at altitude <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to monitor.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{independent}} ellipsis mechanisms that occur in the than-clauses of comparative constructions: gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, and verb phrase ellipsis. These mechanisms are independent of comparative clauses because they also occur when the comparative is not involved. The presence of these ellipsis mechanisms in than-clauses complicates the analysis considerably, since they <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to discern which aspects of the syntax of comparatives are unique to comparatives.|$|R
50|$|Without the {{guidance}} of a properly implemented data architecture design, common data operations might be implemented in different ways, <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> to understand and control the flow of data within such systems. This sort of fragmentation is highly undesirable due to the potential increased cost, and the data disconnects involved. These sorts of difficulties may be encountered with rapidly growing enterprises and also enterprises that service different lines of business (e.g. insurance products).|$|R

But, {{we are now in}} situations," [...] she added, smiling so sweetly, as to <b>render</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for me to refrain from {{catching}} her in my arms, and folding her to my heart; [...] "that place both of us above the necessity of receiving aid of this sort." ...|$|R
60|$|Lothair, though inexperienced, {{and very}} ingenuous, was not devoid {{of a certain}} instinctive {{perception}} of men and, things, which <b>rendered</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> {{for him to be}} an easy prey. His natural disposition, and his comparatively solitary education, had made him a keen observer, and he was one who meditated over his observations. But he was naturally generous and sensible of kindness; and this was a favorite companion--next to Bertram, his most intimate.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is hot," [...] Mr. Goodenough said, as the enemy's slugs {{and bullets}} whizzed {{in a storm}} {{over the edge of}} the parapet, killing many of the defenders, and <b>rendering</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> for the others to take {{accurate}} aim. This, however, the Abeokutans did not try to do. Stooping below the parapet, they fitted their arrows to the string, or loaded their muskets, and then, standing up, fired hastily at the approaching throng.|$|R
50|$|This bird is {{a species}} of least concern to the IUCN, with an {{estimated}} range of 14 e6km2 sq mi and between 10,000 and 100,000 wild individuals. However, {{there is evidence that}} suggests a decline in population, though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed. This decline is due primarily to habitat destruction and poaching.
