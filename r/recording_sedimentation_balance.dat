40|$|This article {{presents}} a simple physical concept of aeolian dust accumulation, {{based on the}} behaviour of the subprocesses of dust deposition and dust erosion. The concept is tested in an aeolian dust wind tunnel. The agreement between the accumulation curve predicted by the model and the accumulation curve obtained in the experiments is close to perfect and shows {{that it is necessary}} to discriminate between the processes of aeolian dust deposition and aeolian dust accumulation. Two important thresholds determine the accumulation process. For wind speeds below the deflation threshold, the aeolian accumulation of dust increases linearly with the wind speed. For wind velocities between the deflation threshold and the accumulation limit, the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> is above unity and there is still accumulation, though it rapidly drops once the deflation threshold has been exceeded. At wind speeds beyond the accumulation limit, the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> is below unity and there will no longer be an accumulation of dust. The thresholds have been determined in a wind tunnel test at friction velocity u(*) = 0. 34 m s(- 1) (deflation threshold) and u(*) = 0. 43 in s(- 1) (accumulation limit), but these values are only indicative since they depend heavily on the characteristics of the accumulation surface and of the airborne grains.

40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution and mean {{particle size}} {{are the most important}} characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure {{particle size distribution}}s. For solid-liquid systems, the particle size distributions have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The Andreasen pipette method, <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> method, centrifugal <b>sedimentation</b> method, etc. have been used to measure the particle size distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then particle size is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the particle size distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the particle size distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the particle size distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of particle size distributions by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in particle size distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in particle size distribution measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others particle size analyzer, such as <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> method, Andreasen pipette method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling particle size distribution and the floating particle size distribution. The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the particle size distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The particle size distribution obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to estimate the smaller particle size by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean particle size was defined. Beside, the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to determine the mean particle sizes for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry. Similar to other methods to analyze particle size, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is accurate in an initially homogeneous suspension. Because the buoyancy weighing-bar method apparatus can be made by hand, it is also economical. Additionally, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is easier to be implemented compared to other sedimentation particle analysis methods. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|R

40|$|On a {{timescale}} {{of years}} to decades, vegetated foredunes may show various modes of morphological development. Vegetation {{is one of the}} factors that determine the sedimentation pattern and thus morphology on the foredune. In turn, the vegetation pattern may be controlled by the sedimentation pattern. Although these effects have been quantified for short timescales, there is relatively little information on the interaction between vegetation and sedimentation for timescales of over a year. For the island of Ameland, the Netherlands, elevation measurements and aerial photographs between 2002 and 2012 were used to derive changes in elevation and vegetation patterns on a year-to-year basis. This was done for a range of stable to accreting foredunes. Sedimentation increases from the beach to a maximum halfway up the seaward slope of the foredune, and then decreases again when going landward. This trend is further modified by the vegetation's spatial pattern. On a timescale of years, there is no correlation between the density of vegetation cover and the amount of accretion. However, by accounting for the gradual depletion of the sand load over the foredune, a relationship can be defined between vegetation cover and its trapping efficiency. Foredune vegetation spreads mainly by lateral expansion of existing patches. No strong effect was found of the <b>sedimentation</b> <b>balance</b> on the expansion of vegetation. It is suggested that other growth-limiting factors are of similar importance, masking any possible dependency of vegetation growth on sand accretion...|$|R

The subsurface stratigraphy in both caves captures snapshots of the deglacial evolution of the Western Floridian aquifer, but radiocarbon dating indicates that a punctuated sediment supply and budget hampers the temporal continuity of the paleoenvironmental <b>records.</b> <b>Sedimentation</b> in both caves is dominated by fine-grained iron and manganese oxide and oxyhydroxide minerals.

Within this study, the sedimentological and structural evolution of a subglacial to subaerial (ice-marginal/proglacial) drainage system is examined. Particular emphasis is placed upon the genetic development and preservation of upper flow regime bedforms and specifically recognising them within a subglacial meltwater context.

The carbonates are a thin, somewhat condensed succession of echinoid and bryozoan-rich limestones that record accumulation in the complex of islands and seaways and progressive burial of the Ridge through time. The rocks are grainy to muddy bioclastic packstones, grainstones and floatstones, composed of infaunal echinoderms, bryozoans, coralline algae and benthic foraminifera, with lesser contributions from molluscs and serpulid worms. Locally {{as much as half}} of these skeletal components are Fe-stained, relict grains that imbue the lithologies with a conspicuous yellow to orange hue. This variably lithified succession is partitioned into metre-scale, firmground-bounded and hardground-bounded beds textured by extensive Thalassinoides burrows. Dominant lithologies are interpreted as temperate seagrass facies. Limestones contain attributes indicative of both seagrass-dominated palaeoenvironments and carbonate production and accumulation on unconsolidated, barren sandflat palaeoenvironments. Together these two depositional systems are thought to have generated a single multigenerational, amalgamated facies <b>recording</b> <b>sedimentation</b> within a complex temperate seagrass environment.

The Santo Onofre Group occurs exclusively in the Paramirim corridor, and is composed of quartzite and minor carbonaceous or Mn-rich phylite. These units <b>record</b> <b>sedimentation</b> in shallow to deep-water marine settings related to rift basins, and were deformed and metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions during the Brasiliano orogeny. Here we present 427 new detrital zircon U-Pb ages, which constrain the maximum depositional ages of ca. 971 Ma for the Santo Onofre Group, ca. 912 Ma for the Canabravinha Formation, and ca. 965 Ma for the Formosa Formation of the Rio Preto Group. Our data suggests that the Santo Onofre and the Rio Preto Groups accumulated in two distinct basin settings. The latter, composed mostly of sandy rocks, would represent a relatively stable, shallow-marine shelf environment. The Rio Preto Group, with metadiamictite, quartzite, pelitic and rhythmitic rocks, represents a shallow to deep marine environment influenced by gravity flows. Both groups were probably deposited in the Late Tonian, and are potential correlatives of the lower (pre-glacial) units of the Macaúbas Group of the Araçuaí belt...|$|R
40|$|Orbital {{perturbations}} of Barremian/Aptian climate traceable by sedimentological, {{biological and}} chemical proxies have been studied in Mt. Rochovica (Western Carpathians, Pieniny Klippen Belt) sedimentary sequence. This pelagic carbonate sequence represents a <b>record</b> of <b>sedimentation</b> on a distal edge of the Paleoeuropean shelf. Pelagic carbonate deposition was influenced by clastic input from the elevated Czorsztyn Ridge (microbreccia of Tithonian/Berriasian limestones) and by fluxoturbidites derived from unknown carbonate buildups. Interruption of carbonate deposition by the terrigeneous Konhora Formation has been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} a humid event in the initial stage of the mid-Cretaceous Greenhouse climate. Three anoxia models (depositional, productivity and stagnant one) have been distinguished in the depositionary regime...|$|R
50|$|The Green River Formation is an Eocene {{geologic}} formation that <b>records</b> the <b>sedimentation</b> {{in a group}} of intermountain lakes in three basins along the present-day Green River in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, a dark layer during the growing season and a light-hue inorganic layer in the dry season. Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm.|$|R

An 8 meter-thick, delta-plain succession temporarily accessible in the subaerial delta plain was sub-divided into four units (A to D), which constitute a shallowing upwards sequence <b>recording</b> <b>sedimentation</b> from shoreface at the bottom (Unit A) to lacustrine settings at the top (Unit D). Unit B basically comprises gravelly, coarse-grained sandy lenticular bodies (up to 20 m wide, up to a few decimetres thick), within a homogenous, medium-grained sandy background, interpreted as prograding foreshore bars. 3 D facies models, built by using the sequential conditional indicator simulation method, reproduced the sedimentary heterogeneities identified in Unit B, using as input data the sedimentary body geometry and its correlation with sandstone grain size values, with the grain size modes taken as a continuous, quantitative proxy for facies distribution. The simulations not only reproduced satisfactorily the significant sedimentary heterogeneities generated by the facies arrangement, but also predicted and described the spatial relation and the three-dimensional shape of sedimentary bodies accurately. Quality of the models should be ensured by a consistent prior analysis of the spatial structure of the grain size mode based on semivariogram models. Llobregat delta. Physical properties.
