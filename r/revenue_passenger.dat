25|$|United Continental Holdings, Inc. (formerly UAL Corporation) is a {{publicly}} traded airline holding company headquartered in the Willis Tower in Chicago. UCH owns and operates United Airlines, Inc. The company is the successor of UAL Corporation, which agreed to change its name to United Continental Holdings in May 2010, when a merger agreement was reached between United and Continental Airlines. Its stock trades under the UAL symbol. To effect the merger, Continental shareholders received 1.05 shares of UAL stock for each Continental share, effectively meaning Continental was acquired by UAL Corporation; {{at the time of}} closing, it was estimated that United shareholders owned 55% of the merged entity and Continental shareholders owned 45%. The company or its subsidiary airlines also have several other subsidiaries. Once completely combined, United became the world's largest airline, as measured by <b>revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> miles.

25|$|The tax was {{supported}} by environmental groups, student groups and nearly every local government. Opposition to the tax was headed by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who drew the public's attention to purported misuse of funds by TransLink. A widely circulated statistic {{was the fact that}} TransLink had the highest cost per <b>revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> of the major Canadian transit agencies. Supporters countered with other analyses that showed TransLink to be ranked first by cost per service hour, service hours per $1 million and service hours per capita. The Yes campaign outspent the No campaign by $5.8 million to $40,000. Surveys conducted by Insights West showed the Yes side ahead in December 2014, but support dropped to 37 per cent the week before the ballots were mailed. In July 2015, the tax was rejected, with 62% of 700,000 voters in opposition and a majority opposed in 23 out of 25 voting regions.|$|E
25|$|Detailed {{surveying}} of the Trondhjem–Støren Line {{started in}} September 1858. Groundwork started in August 1859, initially near Trondheim were the plans were clear. Work {{on the three}} southerly sections commenced the following year, after the routes had been finalized. By 1861 the number of construction workers had risen to 900. The most challenging part was between Lundamo and Hovin, where the route had to be cut into hilly terrain. Compared to other contemporary Norwegian railways, the line had many large bridges, built of wood. There were several fatal accidents during the work. The first two locomotives were delivered in 1862, allowing ballast to be hauled by rail. Construction ended at 2.86 million kroner, just under budget. The first revenue freight train ran on 23 January 1864. <b>Revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> trains started running on 1 April. The line initially received three locomotives, sixty freight cars and ten passenger cars. The official opening took place on 5 August.|$|E

25|$|On October 19, 1926, {{the portion}} of the line between Valley Stream and Franklin Avenue in Garden City was {{electrified}} and it was inaugurated with a special train. New through service running between Valley Stream and Mineola began on the West Hempstead Branch the next day. The freight sidings, however, were not electrified until 1927 and 1928.The connection to the Oyster Bay Branch was severed in 1928, while the portions of the line between Mineola and Country Life Press and between Country Life Press and West Hempstead were taken out of <b>revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> service in June 1935 due to the costly grade crossing elimination improvements imposed upon the LIRR by the Interstate Commerce Commission, as well as the New York Public Service Commission. This meant that no more through service between Valley Stream and Mineola could operate. It was anticipated that the Oyster Bay Branch would be electrified next, and in November 1928, railroad officials investigated the possibility. However, due to high costs, with the electrification of the branch necessitating grade-crossing elimination, the plan was shelved.|$|E
25|$|The {{findings}} of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were released on March 2, 1993. Ultimately the investigation determined that the crew lost situational awareness, and though unsure of the air traffic control services being provided or their position, began an approach to Runway 5 from an excessive altitude and airspeed without completing the published approach procedures. Though critical of the performance of the flight crew, the report ultimately concluded that the probable cause was the failure of senior management of GP Express to provide adequate training and operational support for the startup of the southern operation, which resulted in the assignment of an inadequately prepared captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer in <b>revenue</b> <b>passenger</b> service and the failure of the flight crew to use approved instrument flight procedures, which resulted in a loss of situational awareness and terrain clearance. Contributing to the cause of the accident was GP Express’ failure to provide approach charts to each pilot and to establish stabilized approach criteria. Also contributing were the inadequate crew coordination and a role reversal {{on the part of the}} captain and first officer.|$|E
