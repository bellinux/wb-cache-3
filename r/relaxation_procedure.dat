25|$|Meditation {{techniques}} {{have also been}} used by Western theories of counseling and psychotherapy. Relaxation training works toward achieving mental and muscle relaxation to reduce daily stresses. Jacobson is credited with developing the initial progressive <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure.</b> These techniques are {{used in conjunction with}} other behavioral techniques. Originally used with systematic desensitization, relaxation techniques are now used with other clinical problems. Meditation, hypnosis and biofeedback-induced relaxation {{are a few of the}} techniques used with relaxation training. One of the eight essential phases of EMDR (developed by Francine Shapiro), bringing adequate closure to the end of each session, also entails the use of relaxation techniques, including meditation. Multimodal therapy, a technically eclectic approach to behavioral therapy, also employs the use of meditation as a technique used in individual therapy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite the {{attention}} that optimal control problems involving time delays have received {{over the last two}} decades, little {{attention has been paid to}} the important question of how such problems should be relaxed in order to assure existence of minimizers. Recently, Warga has proposed a <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> for fully nonlinear problems with delays in the state and control variables and showed that the resulting relaxed problem has a solution. Nevertheless, the effect of this relaxation may reduce the infimum cost as we show through an example which belongs to a class of problems with “commensurate” delays; i. e., the quotient of any two delays is rational. For problems of this nature we provide a new <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> for which the extension is “proper”; i. e., the infimum costs coincide. We also present an abstract <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> applicable to problems with possibly noncommensurate delays...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{deal with}} the problem of finding a proper <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> (in the sense that relaxed minimizers can be {{approximated}} with ordinary controls) for optimal control problems involving delays in the control variables. For systems involving commensurate delays {{it is well known that}} a ‘strong’ model provides a proper <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure.</b> For the noncommensurate case, however, the question of how to properly relax delayed controls has remained open and a natural candidate has been a modified version of the strong model, which we call the ‘weak’ procedure, first introduced by Warga. In this paper, we show by means of two examples that this procedure may fail to be proper for systems with either commensurate or noncommensurate delays. It is expected that these examples will provide some insight into the problem of finding a proper <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> applicable to the general case...|$|E

The procedure is based on separating the velocity potential into steady and unsteady parts and linearizing the resulting unsteady differential equation for small disturbances. Solutions are obtained using <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedures.</b> It is determined {{that there is a}} limit on reduced frequency, which is a function of Mach number and size of mesh region, above which the <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedures</b> will not converge.

Von Neumann (Fourier-mode) stability analysis {{is used to}} find bounds of relaxation factors. The bounds depend on local Mach number and local mesh aspect ratio. Long wave instability of Murman-Cole implicit method is indicated. Two new <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedures</b> are introduced. Both employ central differencing exclusively. Group velocities of Fourier modes are used to study signal propagation. It was found necessary to avoid or to damp out signals propagating upstream in supersonic zones {{in order to obtain}} physically meaningful transonic solutions. It appears that requirements of high rate of convergence, of stability and accuracy, are in conflict, and that a combination of relaxation methods must be used in order not to compromise the requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{systems of}} hyperbolic balance laws governing flows of an arbitrary number of components equipped with general equations of state. The components {{are assumed to}} be immiscible. We compare two such models; one in which thermal equilibrium is attained through a <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure,</b> and a fully relaxed model in which equal temperatures are instantaneously imposed. We describe how the <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> may be made consistent with the second law of thermody-namics. Exact wave velocities for both models are obtained and compared. In particular, our formulation directly proves a general subcharacteristic condition: For an arbitrary number of components and thermodynamically stable equations of state, the mixture sonic velocity of the relaxed system can never exceed the sonic velocity of the relaxation system...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} relationships between relaxability and various aspects of suggestibility and influenceability. The Jacobson Progressive Muscle <b>Relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> was used to induce relaxation. Tests of direct suggestibility, relating to the susceptibility of overt suggestions, and indirect suggestibility, referring to indirect hidden influence, as well as self-description questionnaires on suggestibility and the tendency to comply were used. Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List, measuring various kinds of activation and used as a pre- and posttest, determined {{the efficacy of the}} <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Indirect, direct, and self-measured suggestibility proved to be positively related to the ability to relax, measured by Thayer's subscales relating to emotions.

40|$|Three {{approaches}} that significantly improve {{the performance of}} the Hopfield network for solving optimization problems have been developed and evaluated in this work. The first approach uses a new activation function to reduce the effects of noise in the network. The second approach includes a parameter to control the relaxation process so that the network can be relaxed at a proper rate. The third approach applies a new <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> to achieve a smoother relaxation process. These approaches have been tested through a large number of simulations based on 200 randomly generated city distributions of the 10 -city traveling salesman problem. The results show that all the three approaches are capable of improving {{the performance of the}} network. Among them, the new <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> achieved the highest improvement: an increase of 185. 7 % in the percentage of valid tours and a decrease of 33. 1 % in the error rate. The performance of combining the new activation function with the other two approaches has also been evaluated, and the results reveal that the combining can further improve 3 the performance. Combining the new activation function with the new <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> resulted in a 245. 7 % increase in the percentage of valid tours and a 64. 1 % decrease in the error rate...|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the issues {{regarding}} the convergence acceleration and the memory management of unstructured data-based cell-center finite volume flow solvers. The convergence acceleration to the steady state is achieved using three implicit <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedures</b> cast in a matrix-free framework, namely, point Jacobi, symmetric Gauss–Seidel, and lower-upper-symmetric Gauss–Seidel. The formulation of the point Jacobi procedure presented {{is different from the}} symmetric Gauss–Seidel and the lower-upper-symmetric Gauss–Seidel procedures {{in the sense that the}} point Jacobi procedure is cast in terms of a face-based algorithm, whereas the other two are cell-based procedures. It is observed that the performances of all of the three implicit <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedures</b> are comparable. Inspired by the developments in the parallelization of unstructured data-based codes, we have presented a new memory-saving device called the migratory memory algorithm (MMA). It is shown that the MMA drastically reduces the memory requirement of the class of codes just mentioned. The MMA is presented in the context of the least-squares-based linear reconstruction and the point Jacobi procedures. Particularly in the case of computational-fluid-dynamics codes to be used in routine design cycle, the use of MMA can considerably increase the problem size a given machine can handle...|$|R

The set of extracted vertices S in the previous version is omitted, because the heap now contains hop-vertices.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a simple nonlinear transformation. The new approach {{was compared to}} Kirkland's φ-based method and Ross' p-based method as well as Celia's h-based method. All algorithms use the modified Picard iteration with a linear solver of the Cholesky preconditioned conjugate gradient method (2 -D) and with Thomas' method (1 -D). An adaptively optimum <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> was also proposed to improve the efficiency and the robustness for 2 -D cases. To test {{the effects of the}} transformation and the optimal relaxation. a total of 14 different 1 -D and 2 -D infiltration cases were considered. The results show that the newly introduced P(t) -based method is the most effective of the four methods and the simplest of the three transformation methods. It is several orders of magnitude faster than the h-based method and also reduces the truncation error using the same grid. The proposed adaptively optimum <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure,</b> enhances the efficiency and robustness of all four methods to different degrees. Combination of the P(t) -based method with the adaptively optimum <b>relaxation</b> <b>procedure</b> results in a very efficient and robust algorithm. Modeling water flow in variably saturated, porous media is important in many branches of science and engineering. Highly nonlinear relationships between water content and hydraulic conductivity and soil-water pressure result in very steep wetting fronts causing numerical problems. These include poor efficiency when modeling water infiltration into very dry porous media, and numerical oscillation near a steep wetting front when a traditional mass-distributed finite element method is used...|$|E
