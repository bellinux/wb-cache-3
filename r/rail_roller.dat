The straightening process is optimized by orthogonal experimentation and regression analysis. The formative mechanics and the regulation of the residual stress {{in the process of}} straightening are researched. The results of the simulation show that: whatever is on the basement of the residual stress or flatness, the new schedule is better than the real field one, residual stress is controlled within 250 Mpa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of the heavy <b>rail</b> <b>roller</b> straightening, the roller {{leveller}} only presses the plastic deformation on the web of heavy rail. Because the stiffness of flanges which are in both sides is stronger than the web, the heavy rail always has the phenomenon of web falling. In that case, we can not achieve the desired effect of straightening by the theoretic bending deflection. In this paper, a finite element model of one straightening unit was built by the ANSYS, the straightening process was simulated and the web falling affect with the bending deflection and the roller spacing was analyzed. Some pictures of curve were drew through the relationships of bending deflection and web falling, the relationships of roller spacing and web falling. In order to gain the better straightening effect, the actual bending deflection can be the sum of the theoretical bending deflection and web falling from the curve once the roller spacing was defined...|$|E

Rail materials have been optimized to reduce it, but not enough is known about how friction management products applied to the rail affect crack growth. This study presents experimental results carried out to {{explore the influence of}} different lubricants and application orders on wear and pre-existing RCF cracks in rail materials. The results indicate that the types or properties of lubricants have a vital role in the wear rate and fatigue crack growth characteristics of rail materials after conditioning with 5000 dry cycles to initiate cracks.

40|$|Effect {{of laser}} {{quenching}} on wear and damage of heavy-haul wheel/rail materials WJ Wang, J Guo, QY Liu and MH Zhu In order {{to alleviate the}} wear of heavy-haul wheel/rail materials, the wear experiments of wheel/rail rollers undergoing laser quenching were carried out using rolling-sliding testing apparatus. The results indicate that laser quenching pro-duces a hard martensite layer with a certain depth. The improvement of wear resistance of materials resulting from laser quenching markedly decreases the wear volume of wheel/rail rollers. The maximal decrease rate of wear volume of wheel and rail materials is about 92. 9 % and 89. 5 %, respectively. Furthermore, the worn surfaces of wheel/rail rollers present different surface morphology and damage mechanisms due to difference of hardness matching. When the surface hardness of wheel/rail rollers undergoing laser quenching is high, the spalling damage and adhesion wear are dominating. When a single wheel or <b>rail</b> <b>roller</b> undergoes laser quenching, the damage mechanism of wheel and rail rollers are significantly different. According to the severe wear region of the heavy-haul wheel/rail, it is proposed that the rail side and wheel flange may undergo laser quenching treatment for alleviating wear of heavy-haul wheel/rail materials. However, further work should be carried out for clarifying the fatigue characteristic of wheel/rail with laser quenching...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a comprehensive multibody model of the twin disk test rig using the modular approach. The mathematical models for electrical and mechanical components and wheel and <b>rail</b> <b>rollers</b> are implemented using SimPowerSystems, SimDriveline and Simulink toolboxes. The static and dynamic responses of the rollers are measured with load cells and strain gauges. The experimental data show that the creep forces saturate in the low and very low adhesion conditions at the points where the creepages are large enough to give saturation. Also the lateral position and yaw angle are sufficient to capture the key stability and guidance aspects of the vehicle system dynamics. There is a close correlation between the simulated and measured lateral creep forces so the proposed multibody model is validated. The model represents an important contribution to railway condition monitoring techniques and predictive maintenance methods because it can be easily employed in hardware-in-the-loop applications allowing accurate estimation of forces acting on the wheel-rail interface...|$|R

2500|$|Longliners â€“ use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include <b>rail</b> <b>rollers,</b> line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|R

The reductions of straightening rollers are taken as the main effective factor to the residual stress in the straightening process. We adopt orthogonal calculation method to obtain the main effective factor to residual stress. On the base of assurance of the straightness, we obtained the optimal regulation in which the residual stress is the smallest, so the paper makes the important theoretical and actual sense to formulate the rational straightening regulation and improve the straightening quality of rail...|$|R
50|$|Khalasis have {{a history}} dating back to over 2000 years. Derived from the Arabic word Khalas meaning release, the word Khalasi is now used both in Malayalam and in Hindi, to refer to anyone who {{releases}} a ship or boat into the water. The Khalasis of Malabar engaged in boat building and boat repair use simple but cleverly designed equipment and devices put together by ancestors that leverage muscular strength quite amazingly. Though education is hardly their strength, {{what they have in}} abundance is a natural wisdom and simple commonsense. Deceptively simple wooden winches called davars and long wooden handles called kazhas work wonders as winches, and a network of steel wires and thick coir ropes transmit torque and rotation as smoothly as any high-end machinery. Traditionally the domain of Moplah Muslims, Hindus and even Christians have since joined the cadres of this exclusive band of muscular, energetic men who trace their lineage a long way into the past.History Of BeyporeBeypore was a center of overseas commerce since ancient times. It was also a center of shipbuilding industry. Kerala had an abundant supply of wood and skilled labor which was utilized for ship building. Francis Buchanan has made a reference about the ships built at Bepore which were used for military purposes. Khalasis are a group of people traditionally involved in the construction of Urus. They are also used to draw the Urus ashore for maintenance and repair and also pushing the same back to the sea. The word Khalasi in Arabic means a dockyard worker, sailor or lascar. A member of the Muslim community in Kerala is generally known as Mappila. Since majority of the Khalasis are Muslims they came to be called a Mappila Khalasis. Beypore being an exclusive timber outlet of Kerala has been a fascination for many seafaring people, especially the Arabs. They were mainly into ship building and slowly a ship building industry developed in Beypore. Their main constructions were the Arab trading dhows (Arabic name for Uru). As the industry flourished, the demand for skilled laborers to move these ships to and from the sea increased, which in turn resulted in the rise of the Khalasis. There are many families in Beypore and Chaliam in the Kozhikode district of Kerala, who have been working as Khalasis for generations. The skills of the Khalasi community have amazed the sailors and merchants from European and Mediterranean countries, which brought them to Beypore to buy Urus. The native technique employed by Khalasis for their work is based on the principle of pulleys. The equipment consists of wooden <b>rails,</b> <b>rollers</b> and ropes. The wooden pole is moulded as windlass and pulleys and hawsers are used for leverage. As the Khalasis exert pressure on the handles with the accompaniment of their traditional work songs that fill the entire atmosphere with vigour and vitality the huge mass; be it a ship or a heavy wooden plank, moves with ease to the amusement of the watching it. Not just ships, the Idukki dam, Feroke Bridge, Vadakkumbadu Bridge and the Mahanadi Bridge in Orissa; all these huge constructions stand testimony to the amazing skills and teamwork of the Khalasi people.Their skill also had been utilised for building the huge clock in the makkah royal clock tower which possesses the world record of tallest and largest clock in the world. The incredible skill of Khalasis was also used to winch out the bogies during some of the major train accidents in India.Khalasis of Beypore and Chaliam of Kozhikode dist.|$|R
30|$|The contact {{geometry}} analysis {{deals with}} the contact point searching problem between the contacting bodies, i.e. wheel-rail and wheel-roller pairs in this case. The location of contact depends on the dynamic conditions as well as material properties of the contact pair if body deformation is considered. There are many approaches {{for the detection of}} the contact points for wheel-rail contact as documented in [11]. Most of the approaches available in the literature assume that the yaw angle of the wheelset against the track is very small and negligible when solving the geometric contact problem so as to form the so-called bi-dimensional methods [14]. This assumption largely simplifies the calculation, leading to fast solutions that can be implemented in rail vehicle online dynamics simulation. However, the replacement of the <b>rail</b> by a <b>roller</b> makes the geometric contact problem more complicated, and the traditional bi-dimensional methods may not be applicable any longer due to the considerable yaw influence on the contact location {{in the case of the}} wheel-roller contact. To deal with this problem, a three-dimensional model is needed. Some existing approaches for wheel-roller geometry contact analysis can be found in [4, 8, 15].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{increase}} the understanding of wear in rolling/sliding contacts such as the wheel-rail contact for railroads and the roller-washer contact for roller bearings. The Stockholm commuter train network {{has been the subject of}} papers A and B in this thesis in which the wear and surface cracks on rails has been observed for a period of three years. By comparing the wear depth with the crack length, equilibrium between these two damage mechanisms was found for a lubricated rail. By using a lubricant with friction modifiers the stresses was low enough to prevent crack propagation; at the same time, the rail was hard enough to reduce the wear rate. This is probably the most favourable state in terms of <b>rail</b> maintenance cost. <b>Roller</b> bearings subjected to lubricant borne particles have been the subject of papers C, D and E in this thesis. Particles in the lubricating oil can have a significant impact on the wear in lubricated contacts. Even at low concentration levels can self-generated particles cause significant wear. The here presented results shows that filtration during run-in can significantly reduce both the mass loss and the number of self generated particles. A series of experiments has been carried out to study the wear of roller bearings by ingested lubricant borne hard particles. The form of the worn profile and the length of wear scratches correspond closely to the sliding within the contact. A count of the number of wear scratches on the rolling element surface indicates that the contact concentrates particles. A novel wear model based on the observation of a single point on the contacting surface when a concentration of particles passes through it has been developed and the necessary data for the model has been determined from the experiments. Comparison of the simulation results with the experimental results shows good qualitative agreement for the form change of the washer surfaces. QC 2010101...|$|R
