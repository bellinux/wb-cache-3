5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, unlike their predecessors, <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.|$|E
5|$|On May 7, 2014, Nintendo {{announced}} that a remake of <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire, titled Omega <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Alpha Sapphire, and it was released for the Nintendo 3DS on November 21, 2014 worldwide, with the exclusion of Europe, where it was released on November 28, 2014.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} time the player defeats the Elite Four, one of the members, Lorelei, disappears. After gaining access to the Sevii Islands, an entirely new region, the player discovers Lorelei in her house and convinces her to come back with him. Once more, the protagonist must thwart the Team Rocket's plans on several occasions, recover two artifacts, the <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> the Sapphire, {{and put them in the}} main {{computer}} at One Island. After that, the player can communicate, battle, trade, etc., with <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire.|$|E

5|$|FireRed and LeafGreen {{were first}} {{announced}} in September 2003 as upcoming remakes {{of the original}} Pocket Monsters Red and Green games that were released in Japan in 1996. Game director Junichi Masuda stated the new titles would be developed around the idea of simplicity, as the game engine was a slightly {{modified version of the}} one used in Pokémon <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire. As a result, FireRed and LeafGreen were made fully backward compatible with <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire, allowing players to trade Pokémon between games.|$|E
5|$|His career prospering, in 1838 Mallory courted and wed Angela Moreno, {{a member}} of a wealthy Spanish-speaking family living in Pensacola. Their {{marriage}} produced nine children, five of whom died young; surviving into adulthood were daughters Margaret ("Maggie") and <b>Ruby,</b> <b>and</b> sons Stephen R. Jr. ("Buddy"), and Attila ("Attie"). Buddy followed his father into politics, and he would eventually also serve as U.S. Senator from Florida.|$|E
5|$|Like other Pokémon games, <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphires {{gameplay}} is linear; {{the main}} events {{occur in a}} fixed order. The protagonist of Pokémon <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire is {{a child who has}} recently moved to a small town called Littleroot Town. At the beginning of the games, the player chooses either Treecko, Torchic, or Mudkip to protect Professor Birch, the regional Professor, from an attacking wild Pokémon. After defending the Professor, the player is taken to his lab and receives the chosen Pokémon as his or her starter Pokémon. His or her friend, the protagonist's rival, is also a Pokémon Trainer and occasionally battles the player. The games' two main goals are defeating the eight Gym Leaders, proving oneself worthy of challenging the Elite Four and Champion to become the new Champion and completing the Pokédex by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 202 Pokémon (It is possible to obtain all 386 Pokémon, but this requires trading with Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).|$|E

5|$|The King Charles Spaniel (also {{known as}} the English Toy Spaniel) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type. In 1903, the Kennel Club {{combined}} four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed {{one of the four}} colours available in the breed.|$|E
5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E

5|$|During the post-Civil-War period, {{leaders such}} as George T. <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Norris Wright Cuney, who headed the Texas Republican Party and {{promoted}} civil rights for freedmen, helped to dramatically improve educational and employment opportunities for blacks in Galveston and in Texas. Cuney established his own business of stevedores and a union of black dockworkers to break the white monopoly on dock jobs. Galveston was a cosmopolitan city {{and one of the}} more successful during Reconstruction; the Freedmen's Bureau was headquartered here. German families sheltered teachers from the North, and hundreds of freedmen were taught to read. Its business community promoted progress, and immigrants stayed after arriving at this port of entry.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, <b>ruby,</b> <b>and</b> odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E

Linda's {{stepfather}} Shorty Lungkarta Tjungarrayi was a significant influence on her early painting. Short Lungkata was also the father of artist Wintjiya Morgan Napaltjarri (known as Wintjiya No. 2 and no relation to yet another artist, Wintjiya Napaltjarri). Linda married Musty Siddick, had two children <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Irene, and in the 1970s they were living in a Northern Territory Pintupi community called Yayayi. After Musty's death she remarried.|$|E

5|$|Pokémon Box: <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire, {{or simply}} Pokémon Box, is a {{spin-off}} Pokémon {{game for the}} GameCube console, bundled with a Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable and a Memory Card 59. It was released in Japan on May 30, 2003 and in North America on July 11, 2004, but only through the New York Pokémon Center and its online store. It is no longer available in either location. The game was released {{in some parts of}} Europe as Pokémon Memory Magic due to translation problems, and Europeans only could get the game by using points from Nintendo of Europe's loyalty program, or by buying the Pokémon Colosseum Mega Pack.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire {{was first}} {{revealed}} at E3 2003 for the Game Boy Advance.

It is based on Pokémon <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire, and features Pokémon available in those games. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2003, and in North America on August 25 of the same year. The North American date coincided with the five-year anniversary of Pokémon Red and Blue's North American release. It was released in PAL regions several months later on November 14.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon <b>Ruby</b> <b>and</b> Sapphire {{take place}} in the Hoenn region, located some {{distance}} from the Kanto and Johto regions featured in previous games. The design of Hoenn was based on the Japanese island and region of Kyushu; however Hoenn is rotated 90° relative to Kyushu, as Junichi Masuda felt that it would provide a better gameplay balance. Like Kyushu, Hoenn possesses many smaller islands, and part of the region is dominated by sea routes, several of which contain areas where the player can dive underwater.|$|E
