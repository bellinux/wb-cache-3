The study was able to show that this effect is substantially greater for combined (estrogen-progestogen) HRT than for estrogen-only HRT; and that the effects were similar for all specific types and doses of estrogen and progestogen, for oral, transdermal and implanted HRT, and for continuous and sequential patterns of use.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{enrolled}} in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) may not reflect those seen in real-life practice. Our {{goal was to}} compare patients eligible for enrollment but not {{enrolled in}} contemporary RCTs of reperfusion therapy with patients {{who would have been}} ineligible and also with patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) participating in RCTs. METHODS: Consecutive patients with AMI (n = 8469) enrolled in the GRACE registry (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) were divided into 3 groups: RCT participants (11 %; n = 953), eligible nonenrolled patients (55 %; n = 4669), and ineligible patients (34 %; n = 2847). Our main outcome measures were hospital mortality rates. RESULTS: Based on baseline characteristics or GRACE risk-score distribution, RCT participants had the lowest a priori risk of death; eligible patients had a higher risk; and ineligible patients had the highest risk. Actual hospital mortality showed a similar gradient (3. 6 %, 7. 1 %, and 11. 4 %, respectively) (P<. 001). Multivariable analysis adjusting for baseline <b>risk,</b> <b>use</b> and type of reperfusion therapy, and delay from symptom onset to admission consistently showed a higher mortality rate for eligible nonenrolled patients than for RCT participants (odds ratio, 1. 61; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 06 - 2. 43; and odds ratio, 1. 97; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 24 - 3. 13, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AMI participating in RCTs have a lower baseline risk and experience lower mortality than nonenrolled patients, even when they are trial eligible. This difference is not entirely explained by differences in baseline <b>risk,</b> <b>use</b> and type of reperfusion therapy, and/or delays in presentation.

The results of numerous clinical trials confirm that patients benefit from judiciously managed anticoagulation and that physicians can take various approaches to minimize <b>risk.</b> <b>Use</b> of stratification scores for patient selection and accurate estimation of stroke risk may improve outcomes; bleeding risk {{is less important than}} stroke risk. Adoption of newer anticoagulants with simpler regimens may help physicians allay their fears of anticoagulant use in patients with atrial fibrillation.

40|$|Abstract—The work {{described}} in this paper was motivated by a perceived increase in the frequency at which power system operators are encountering high stress in bulk transmission systems and the corresponding need to improve security monitoring of these networks. Online risk-based security assessment provides rapid online quantification of a security level associated with an existing or forecasted operating condition. One major advantage of this approach over deterministic online security assessment is that it condenses contingency likelihood and severity into indices that reflect probabilistic <b>risk.</b> <b>Use</b> of these indices in control room decision making leads to increased understanding of potential network problems, including overload, cascading overload, low voltages, and voltage instability, resulting in improved security-related decision making. Test results on large-scale transmission models retrieved from the energy-management system of a U. S. utility company are described.

Complete blockade of angiotensin II (Ang II) action with the highly selective Ang II receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan, both as monotherapy and in combination with ACE inhibitors, is well-tolerated and efficacious in patients with renal failure.
