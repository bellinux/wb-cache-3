5000|$|The {{comparison}} in {{the table}} below is only meant to give approximate indications of <b>radioresistance</b> for different species and should be taken with great caution. There are generally big differences in <b>radioresistance</b> for one species among experiments, due to the way radiation affects living tissues and to different experimental conditions. We should for example consider that because radiation impedes cell division, immature organisms are less resistant to radiations than adults, and adults are sterilized at doses much lower than that necessary to kill them. For example, for the insect parasitoid Habrobracon hebetor, the LD50 for haploid embryo during cleavage (1-3 hours of age) is 200 R, but about 4 hours later it is of 7,000 R (for X-ray intensity of 110 R/minute), and haploid (= male) embryos are more resistant than diploid (= female) embryos. The mortality of adults H. hebetor exposed to a dose of 180,250 R is the same to this of a non-irradiated control group (food was not provided to either groups) (for 6,000 R/minute). However, a lower dose of 102,000 R (for 6,000 R/minute) is sufficient to induce a state of lethargy in H. hebetor that is manifested by a complete cessation of activity, including cessation of feeding, and these individuals eventually let themselves starve to death. And an even lower dose of 4,858 R (for 2,650 R/minute) is sufficient to sterilize adult female H. hebetor (sterility arises 3 days post-exposure). Other important factors that influence the level of <b>radioresistance</b> include: The length of time during which a dose of radiation is delivered—with doses delivered during longer periods, or at time intervals, being associated with greatly reduced negative effects;The feeding state of individuals—with pre-fed and post-fed individuals being more resistant to radiations compared to starved individuals; The type of radiation used (e.g., tardigrades Milnesium tardigradum irradiated with heavy ions have a higher survival than when irradiated with gamma rays, for a same irradiation dose); The physiological state of individuals (e.g., the tardigrade species Richtersius coronifer and Milnesium tardigradum are more resistant to gamma-ray radiation when in the hydrated state, and Macrobiotus areolatus is more resistant to X-ray radiation when in the anhydrobiotic state). The way lethality is measured is also source of variation for the estimated <b>radioresistance</b> of a species. Irradiated specimens are not instantly killed, unless exposed to a very high dose (acute dose). Therefore, irradiated specimens die over {{a certain period of}} time and lower irradiation doses correspond to longer survival. This means that the radiation dose LD50 fluctuates with the time at which it is measured. For example, the β radiation dose that causes 50% mortality in the American cockroach at 25 days post-exposure is 5,700 R, but to reach 50% mortality at 3 days post-exposure, 45,610 R are needed. 25 days can represent a long survival period for short lived species, such as insects, but would represent a very short survival time for long lived species, such as mammals, so comparing survival of different species after the same amount of time post-exposure also poses some challenges of interpretation. These examples illustrate the many issues associated with comparison of <b>radioresistance</b> among species and the need for caution when doing so. ∗ While an LD50 has been reported for wild type C. elegans individuals, an upper lethal limit has not been established, rather [...] "nearly all animals were alive with no indication of excess lethality up to 800 Gy, the highest dose... measured." ...|$|E

Three specimens of M. tardigradum survived. The M. tardigradum is able to cope with high amounts of environmental stress by initiating cryptobiosis. It is found that during this state, the internal organic clock of the M. tardigradum halts, thus the cryptobiotic state does not contribute to the aging process.|$|E
50|$|Quantitative data on {{the effects}} of {{ionizing}} radiation on human health is relatively limited compared to other medical conditions because of the low number of cases to date, and because of the stochastic nature of some of the effects. Stochastic effects can only be measured through large epidemiological studies where enough data has been collected to remove confounding factors such as smoking habits and other lifestyle factors. The richest source of high-quality data comes from the study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. In vitro and animal experiments are informative, but <b>radioresistance</b> varies greatly across species.|$|E

Pretreatment with Kojic acid has been shown to protect Chinese hamster ovary cells against ionizing radiation-induced damage.

50|$|The {{presence}} or absence of oxygen has a strong influence on the biological effect on ionizing radiation.

Radioresistant esophageal cancer cells were generated from normal esophageal cancer cells via fractionated irradiation, and expression levels of related proteins were determined by Western blot. Radiosensitivity of cells was established by clonogenic cell survival assays, and cell cycle distribution was evaluated by flow cytometry.

40|$|Abstract Background Transmission {{electron}} microscopy images of Deinococcus radiodurans R 1 {{suggest that the}} nucleoid of this species exists as a "ring-like" body, and have led to speculation that this structure contributes to the <b>radioresistance</b> of the species. Since extreme <b>radioresistance</b> is characteristic of six other species of Deinococcus, we have attempted to correlate nucleoid morphology and <b>radioresistance</b> by determining whether the genomic DNA {{of each of these}} species exhibit similar structures. Results The nucleoid morphologies of seven recognized species of Deinococcus, the radioresistant bacterium Rubrobacter radiotolerans, and the more radiosensitive deinococcal relative Thermus aquaticus were evaluated using epifluorescence and deconvolution techniques. Although the nucleoids of Deinococcus murrayi, Deinococcus proteolyticus, Deinococcus radiophilus, and Deinococcus grandis have structures similar to D. radiodurans, the majority of nucleoids found in Deinococcus radiopugnans and Deinococcus geothermalis lack any specific organization. The nucleoid of R. radiotolerans consists of multiple highly condensed spheres of DNA scattered throughout the cell. The genomic DNA of Thermus aquaticus is uniformly distributed throughout the cell. Conclusion There is no obvious relationship between the shape of a species' nucleoid and extreme <b>radioresistance.</b> However, the genomes of all extremely <b>radioresistance</b> species examined are highly condensed relative to more radiosensitive species. Whether DNA in this tightly packed configuration contributes to the <b>radioresistance</b> of these bacteria remains unknown, but this common structural feature appears to limit diffusion of fragments generated post-irradiation even in cells incapable of repairing strand breaks. </p...|$|E

Lately, the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) -related tumors has shown a significant increase, and HPV-related tumors show distinctive features if compared with the HPV-negative counterpart. Locally advanced HNSCC can be treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy, but early recurrences sometimes occur. Relapses are often related to an intrinsic <b>radioresistance</b> of the tumors. Alterations in intracellular pathways, primarily involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, can lead to <b>radioresistance.</b> Preclinical and clinical evidence highlighted that 3 main pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the phosphotidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the p 53 signaling cascades, {{play a crucial role}} in <b>radioresistance</b> development.
