40|$|We {{consider}} a secure source coding problem with side information (S. I.) at the decoder and the eavesdropper. The encoder has a source that it wishes to describe with limited distortion through a rate limited {{link to a}} legitimate decoder. The message sent is also observed by the eavesdropper. The encoder aims to minimize both the distortion incurred by the legitimate decoder; and the information leakage rate at the eavesdropper. When the encoder {{has access to the}} uncoded S. I. at the decoder, we characterize the rate-distortion-information leakage rate (<b>R.</b> <b>D.</b> <b>I.)</b> region under a Markov chain assumption and when S. I. at the encoder does not improve the rate-distortion region as compared to the case when S. I. is absent. When the decoder also has access to the eavesdroppers S. I., we characterize the <b>R.</b> <b>D.</b> <b>I.</b> region without the Markov Chain condition. We then {{consider a}} related setting where the encoder and decoder obtain coded S. I. through a rate limited helper, and characterize the <b>R.</b> <b>D.</b> <b>I.</b> region for several special cases, including special cases under logarithmic loss distortion and for special cases of the Quadratic Gaussian setting. Finally, we consider the amplification measures of list or entropy constraint at the decoder, and show that the <b>R.</b> <b>D.</b> <b>I.</b> regions for the settings considered in this paper under these amplification measures coincide with <b>R.</b> <b>D.</b> <b>I.</b> regions under per symbol logarithmic loss distortion constraint at the decoder.
