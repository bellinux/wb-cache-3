50|$|The {{three most}} common types of {{incandescent}} lamps are standard incandescent lamps, tungsten halogen lamps, and <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps.</b> Standard incandescent lamps have an efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watts and {{a lifetime of}} 750-2500 hours. Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours. Finally <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps</b> have an efficacy of 12-19 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-3000 hours.|$|E
50|$|Halogen {{multifaceted}} reflector bulbs {{are widely}} available. The most common format is MR16, {{which is available}} in 10-50 W power ratings (150-800 lumens).Low voltage lamps use the MR16 and similar bi-pin bases, whereas mains voltage lamps use the same caps as normal mains tungsten filament lamps, or a special GU10/GZ10 base. The GU10/GZ10 bases are shaped to prevent dichroic <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps</b> being used in luminaires intended for aluminised <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps,</b> which could cause overheating of the fitting. Higher efficiency LED versions {{of all of these}} lamps are now available, but these have widely varying light output and quality.|$|E

5000|$|The 100 watt {{version of}} a {{reflector}} lamp is typically called a RUVA (Reflector UVA) or less commonly HO-R (High Output - Reflector). The 160 watt version are called VHO-R (Very High Output - Reflector). The name [...] "VHR" [...] describe 160 W <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps</b> and is a registered trademark of Cosmedico, Ltd. There are many other variations of low-pressure tanning lamps including 26 watt, 80 watt, and 200 watt to name a few.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reflector</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are used}} when light is only desired to be emitted {{in a single}} direction, or when an {{application}} requires {{the maximum amount of}} light. For example, these lamps can be used in tanning beds or in backlighting electronic displays. An internal reflector is more efficient than standard external reflectors. Another example is color matched aperture lights (with about 30° of opening) used in the food industry for robotic quality control inspection of cooked goods.|$|E
25|$|Raylite reflectors can {{be added}} to PAR64 and PAR56 lamp {{housings}} to achieve a narrow spot effect. A conventional quartz halogen lamp is used in place of the <b>reflector</b> <b>lamp.</b> A spider or bulb shield may optionally be added, which enhances the parallel nature of the beam and makes it more visible when used with smoke or fog effects. Raylites are generally less rugged than sealed beam bulbs. The lamp can easily shake loose of the lampholder in transit.|$|R

50|$|Lightbulb sockets, {{light sockets}} lamp sockets or lampholders provide {{electrical}} {{connections to the}} lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of sockets allows lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for these lampholders, created by de facto and by various standards bodies. A general coding system is a letter or abbreviation followed by a number. Some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to wires; some <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps</b> have screw terminals for wire connections.|$|E

There are also downlights with internal reflectors designed to accept common 'A' lamps (light bulbs) which are generally less costly than <b>reflector</b> <b>lamps.</b> Downlights can be incandescent, fluorescent, HID (high intensity discharge) or LED.|$|E
