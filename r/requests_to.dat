5|$|Dostoyevsky wrote {{articles}} and essays outside the Diaries collection. These include the 1863 travelogue Winter Notes on Summer Impressions, {{in which he}} satirised and criticised European life. Other articles were written in response or as a criticism to a literary work, a person's view, <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> the military during the imprisonment period, announcements, notes and explanations. Some of them were written for different journals or almanacs.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

5000|$|Again all proposals, {{including}} the <b>request</b> <b>to</b> join NATO, were {{rejected by the}} UK, US, and French governments shortly after. Emblematic was the position of British General Hastings Ismay, supporter of NATO expansion, who said that NATO [...] "must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella." [...] He opposed the <b>request</b> <b>to</b> join NATO made by the USSR in 1954 saying that [...] "the Soviet <b>request</b> <b>to</b> join NATO is like an unrepentant burglar <b>requesting</b> <b>to</b> join the police force".|$|R
50|$|Before leaving Mantua for Innsbruck, in Austria, Anna Caterina {{asked that}} her father fulfill some requests.

5|$|The Fringe team {{is brought}} to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) {{who had died in}} 1985, as well as {{evidence}} of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> speak to Walter.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Walter telling Olivia her brain waves {{are going back}} to normal, and that Scott's {{memories}} are fading from her mind.

She bids farewell to his consciousness, which has finally left her own.|$|E
5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' <b>Requests</b> <b>to</b> the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E

3000|$|If an InP {{can only}} {{partially}} embed a VN request, {{it will have}} to forward the rest of the <b>request</b> <b>to</b> other InPs in the controller network in order to complete the VN request. An InP should take care to not forward a VN <b>request</b> <b>to</b> another InP already in the InPSet to avoid cycles.

5|$|After the Navy {{closed its}} investigation, Thompson {{continued}} his own {{research into the}} explosion and its aftermath. Thompson was assisted by Snyder and other former Navy personnel, including Iowa crewmen and Navy headquarters staff members. Family members of the victims as well as staff members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees also helped Thompson. In addition, he obtained information via Freedom of Information Act <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> the Navy. Furthermore, Thompson accessed depositions taken from Navy leaders and investigators during {{a lawsuit against the}} Navy by Hartwig's family.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|An {{estate agent}} {{receives}} a video {{recording of the}} murders in the post, leaving Black puzzled. That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> show it to Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E
50|$|At a meeting, {{members may}} want to obtain {{information}} or <b>request</b> <b>to</b> do something that requires permission from the assembly. These requests and inquiries are in order when another has the floor if they require immediate attention. The requests and inquiries include a parliamentary inquiry, request for information, <b>request</b> for permission <b>to</b> withdraw or modify a motion, <b>request</b> <b>to</b> read papers, and request for any other privilege. Also, a member could <b>request</b> <b>to</b> be excused from a duty.|$|R

5|$|At the secured facility, Fauxlivia is able {{to clear}} Peter, Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Walter from the lab {{in order to allow}} Ray access to the lab. Ray {{continues}} to avoid shifting to a new body. Walter returns to the lab to confirm a theory and is interrupted by Ray. Ray successfully removes the data device, knocks out Walter, and flees to give it to Newton. When Ray <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> be able to return to his family, Newton kills him near his home, but by this time, the Fringe division has identified Ray and have converged on his address. On spotting Newton, they engage in a car chase, eventually damaging Newton's car. Fauxlivia recovers Van Horn's data disc from Newton and hides it before taking Newton into custody.|$|E
5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance, one example being the <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> end the export of ball bearings (an important component in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E
5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, {{the station}} was {{constructed}} with bellmouth provisions to allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of both ends of this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. The station would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue Terminal station and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. <b>Requests</b> <b>to</b> convert the station were also put forward by the local community shortly after the station opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding into the station and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E

5|$|By 1900, Rodin's artistic {{reputation}} was entrenched. Gaining exposure from a pavilion of his artwork set {{up near the}} 1900 World's Fair (Exposition Universelle) in Paris, he received <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> make busts of prominent people internationally, while his assistants at the atelier produced duplicates of his works. His income from portrait commissions alone totaled probably 200,000 francs a year. As Rodin's fame grew, he attracted many followers, including the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and authors Octave Mirbeau, Joris-Karl Huysmans, and Oscar Wilde.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{are able}} to request Steam keys of their {{products}} to use as they see fit, such as to give away in promotions, to provide to selected users for review, or to give to key resellers for different profitization. Valve generally honors all such requests, but clarified that they would evaluate some <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> avoid giving keys to games or other offerings {{that are designed to}} manipulate the Steam storefront and other features. For example, Valve said that a request for 500,000 keys for a game that has significantly negative reviews and 1,000 sales on Steam is unlikely to be granted.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
