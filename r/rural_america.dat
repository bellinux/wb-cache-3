25|$|The New Deal {{programs}} {{to relieve the}} Depression are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending unemployment. At the time many New Deal programs - especially CCC - were popular. Liberals hailed them for improving {{the life of the}} common citizen, and for providing jobs for the unemployed, legal protection for labor unionists, modern utilities for <b>rural</b> <b>America,</b> living wages for the working poor, and price stability for the family farmer. Economic progress for minorities, however, was hindered by discrimination, an issue often avoided by Roosevelt's administration.|$|E

She wrote, [...] "On some level Brandon's story, while cleaving to its own specificity, needs to remain an open narrative—not a stable narrative of FTM transsexual identity nor a singular tale of queer bashing, not a cautionary fable about the violence of <b>rural</b> <b>America</b> nor an advertisement for urban organizations of queer community; like the narrative of Billy Tipton, Brandon's story permits a dream of transformation." [...] Christine Dando argued that [...] "masculinity is associated with outside and femininity with interior spaces." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 86th United States Congress, McGovern was {{assigned}} to the House Committee on Agriculture. The longtime chair of the committee, Harold D. Cooley, would subsequently say, [...] "I cannot recall a single member of Congress who has fought more vigorously or intelligently for American farmers than Congressman McGovern." [...] He helped pass a new food-stamp law. He was one of nine representatives from Congress to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly conferences of 1958 and 1959. Along with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, McGovern strongly advocated a reconstruction of Public Law 480 (an agricultural surplus act which had come into being under Eisenhower) with a greater emphasis on feeding the hungry around the world, the establishment of an executive office to run operations, and the goal of promoting peace and stability around the world. During his time in the House, McGovern was regarded as a liberal overall, and voted in accordance with the rated positions of Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) 34 times and against 3 times. Two of the themes of his House career, improvements for <b>rural</b> <b>America</b> and the war on hunger, would be defining ones of his legislative career and public life.|$|E

500|$|Alexander Hamilton (January 11, 1755 or 1757July 12, 1804) was an American statesman {{and one of}} the Founding Fathers of the United States. He was an {{influential}} interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the founder of the nation's financial system, the Federalist Party, the United States Coast Guard, and The New York Post newspaper. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration. He took the lead in the funding of the states' debts by the Federal government, as well as the establishment of a national bank, a system of tariffs, and friendly trade relations with Britain. [...] His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch, a strong commercial economy, with a national bank and support for manufacturing, plus a strong military. [...] This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who formed a rival party, the Democratic-Republican Party. They favored strong states based in <b>rural</b> <b>America</b> and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy. They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general, and too oriented toward cities, business and banking.|$|E
500|$|Kripke instead {{favored the}} [...] "unique and {{structurally}} interesting" [...] self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes {{arose from the}} writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that [...] "clowns in a context where they're {{not supposed to be}} are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology. This decision made the clown [...] "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to Supernatural, noting, [...] "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty back roads of <b>rural</b> <b>America,</b> and it's got great music." [...] However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would [...] "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.|$|E
