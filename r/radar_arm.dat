500|$|Due {{to heavy}} loss rates of U.S. {{aircraft}} (commencing with Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965), studies {{were conducted on}} ways of alleviating those air losses {{while at the same}} time delivering the ordnance payloads required by the escalation of the war. On 31 May 1967 the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara authorized a study aimed at determining what would be required to get New Jersey reactivated in her present condition, and when the results of the submitted study proved favorable toward the reactivation he took action. In August 1967 the Secretary of Defense made the decision to recommission a battleship [...] "for employment in the Pacific Fleet to augment the naval gunfire support force in Southeast Asia". New Jersey was selected for this task because she was in better material condition than her sisters, having received an extensive overhaul prior to decommissioning. Upon her reactivation she underwent a period of modernization during which the 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft guns on the battleship were removed, and she received improved electronic warfare systems and improvements to her <b>radar.</b> <b>Armed</b> as such New Jersey was formally recommissioned 6 April 1968 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Captain J. Edward Snyder in command. During sea trials following her modernization, New Jersey set the battleship world speed record by achieving a speed of 35.2 knots (62.5 kph/40.5mph), maintaining this speed for six hours.|$|R

25|$|Folland {{sought to}} develop more capable {{versions}} of the Gnat; {{one of the more}} substantial of these proposals was tentatively designated as the Gnat Mk.5. This model was to be capable of supersonic speeds and was intended to be made available in both single-seat and twin-seat configurations, enabling its use in the trainer and interceptor role. The Gnat 5 was to be powered by either a pair of Rolls-Royce RB153R engines or two Viper 20 engines instead; in the air interceptor role, it would be also equipped with a Ferranti AI.23 Airpass <b>radar</b> and <b>armed</b> with a pair of de Havilland Firestreak air-to-air missiles. Featuring an estimated maximum speed around Mach 2 and a time to 50,000ft of 3 minutes, Folland estimated that a prototype could be flown as early as the end of 1962 and that the Gnat 5 could be readied for operational service within four or five years.|$|R

50|$|Avionics {{production}} Factory (APF), {{formerly known}} as Kamra Avionics and Radar Factory (KARF) was initiated as Radar Maintenance Centre (RMC) in 1983 to overhaul and rebuild ground-based radar systems. In 1989, RMC was expanded to become Kamra Radar & Avionics Factory (KARF). APF has the facilities to assemble and overhaul airborne as well as ground-based radar systems, electronics and avionics. Currently the only ISO 9002 certified facility among PAC, the factory was involved in upgrading the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Chengdu F-7P interceptor fleet by replacing the original Italian built FIAR Grifo-7 radar with the more capable FIAR Grifo-7 mk-II radar, which was assembled under licence by APF. More recently, radar production involved the license assembly of the latest upgrade variant of the FIAR Grifo-7, the Grifo-7MG <b>radar,</b> which <b>arms</b> the Chengdu F-7PG combat aircraft of the PAF.

40|$|The use of forward {{models as}} an {{alternative}} approach to compare models with observations contains advantages and challenges. Radar Doppler spectra simulators are not new; their application in high- resolution models with bin microphysics schemes could help to compare model output with the Doppler spectra recorded from the vertically pointing cloud <b>radars</b> at the <b>ARM</b> Climate Research Facility sites. The input parameters to a Doppler spectra simulator are both microphysical (e. g., particle size, shape, phase, and number concentration) and dynamical (e. g., resolved wind components and sub-grid turbulent kinetic energy). Libraries for spherical and non-spherical particles are then used to compute the backscattering cross-section and fall velocities, while the turbulence is parameterized as a Gaussian function with a prescribed width. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is {{used to determine the}} amount of noise added throughout the spectrum, and the spectral smoothing due to spectral averages is included to reproduce the averaging realized by cloud radars on successive returns. Thus, realistic Doppler spectra are obtained, and several parameters that relate to the morphological characteristics of the synthetically generated spectra are computed. Here, the results are compared to the new ARM microARSCL data products in an attempt to validate the simulator. Drizzling data obtained at the SGP site by the MMCR and the AMF site at Azores using the WACR are used to ensure the liquid part and the turbulence representation part of the simulator are properly accounted in the forward model...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a study on}} the sensitivity of two satellite cloud height retrievals to cloud vertical distribution. The difference in sensitivity is exploited by relating the difference in the retrieved cloud heights to cloud vertical extent. The two cloud height retrievals, performed within the Freie Universität Berlin AATSR MERIS Cloud (FAME-C) algorithm, are based on independent measurements and different retrieval techniques. First, cloud-top temperature (CTT) is retrieved from Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) measurements in the thermal infrared. Second, cloud-top pressure (CTP) is retrieved from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) measurements in the oxygen-A absorption band and a nearby window channel. Both CTT and CTP are converted to cloud-top height (CTH) using atmospheric profiles from a numerical weather prediction model. First, a sensitivity study using radiative transfer simulations in the near-infrared and thermal infrared was performed to demonstrate, in a quantitative manner, the larger impact of the assumed cloud vertical extinction profile, described in terms of shape and vertical extent, on MERIS than on AATSR top-of-atmosphere measurements. Consequently, cloud vertical extinction profiles will have a larger influence on the MERIS than on the AATSR cloud height retrievals for most cloud types. Second, the difference in retrieved CTH (ΔCTH) from AATSR and MERIS are related to cloud vertical extent (CVE), as observed by ground-based lidar and <b>radar</b> at three <b>ARM</b> sites. To increase the impact of the cloud vertical extinction profile on the MERIS-CTP retrievals, single-layer and geometrically thin clouds are assumed in the forward model. Similarly to previous findings, the MERIS-CTP retrievals appear to be close to pressure levels {{in the middle of the}} cloud. Assuming a linear relationship, the ΔCTH multiplied by 2. 5 gives an estimate on the CVE for single-layer clouds. The relationship is stronger for single-layer clouds than for multi-layer clouds. Due to large variations of cloud vertical extinction profiles occurring in nature, a quantitative estimate of the cloud vertical extent is accompanied with large uncertainties. Yet, estimates of the CVE provide an additional parameter, next to CTH, that can be obtained from passive imager measurements and can be used to further describe cloud vertical distribution, thus contributing to the characterization of a cloudy scene. To further demonstrate the plausibility of the approach, an estimate of the CVE was applied to a case study. In light of the follow-up mission Sentinel- 3 with AATSR and MERIS like instruments, Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) and (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) OLCI, respectively, for which the FAME-C algorithm can be easily adapted, a more accurate estimate of the CVE can be expected. OLCI will have three channels in the oxygen-A absorption band, possibly providing enhanced information on cloud vertical distributions...|$|R
