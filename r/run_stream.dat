50|$|Pimmit Run forms {{south of}} Leesburg Pike (State Route 7), in Idylwood, Virginia, near George C. Marshall High School. The run flows {{underground}} until it crosses Leesburg Pike, then flows openly past Pimmit Hills. Originally, {{the part of}} the run South of Leesburg Pike flowed above ground as well, but development gradually forced it underground. The portion of the stream that borders Pimmit Hills was widened and lined with concrete in the early 1970s to prevent flooding. From Pimmit Hills, Pimmit Run flows northeast through Pimmit <b>Run</b> <b>Stream</b> Valley Park and then under the Dulles Toll Road into Devon Park and Chesterbrook Gardens neighborhoods. Pimmit Run continues on its northeastern course meandering through Pimmit <b>Run</b> <b>Stream</b> Valley Park. At Westmont, the stream is joined by Little Pimmit Run before paralleling the George Washington Memorial Parkway and flowing southeast into Arlington. The stream parallels Chain Bridge Road as it bisects the Arlington Bluff and empties into the Potomac just downstream of the bridge.|$|E
5000|$|In Exec 8, work is {{organized}} into jobs, called [...] "runs," [...] which are scheduled {{based on their}} priority and need for lockable resources such as Uniservo tape drives or Fastrand drum files. The control language syntax uses the [...] "@" [...] symbol (which Univac called [...] "the master space") as the control statement recognition symbol. It was immediately followed by the command or program name, then a comma and any option switches. After a space character, {{the remainder of the}} statement differed for particular commands. A command to compile a FORTRAN program would look like [...] "@FOR,options sourcefile, objectfile". Input data for an application could be read from a file (generally card images), or immediately follow the @ command in the <b>run</b> <b>stream.</b> All lines until the sentinel command [...] "@END" [...] were assumed to be input data, so forgetting to insert it led to the compiler interpreting subsequent commands as program data. For this reason, it was preferable to process data in files rather than inputting it in the <b>run</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

After much negotiating, he relinquished his rights in 1888. In 1891, the Oregon Legislature authorized the city to sell bonds {{to pay for the}} Bull Run project, which began delivering water to Portland in 1895.|$|E

After this natural pond was damaged, it was maintained by channeling water to the area through a pipe. A fountain was installed in the pond to increase water circulation. Drinking water had also been used to fill the pond. Eventually the basin of the pond was damaged beyond repair, and the pond was finally drained in 2009.|$|E

50|$|A {{structure}} chart {{is also used}} to diagram associated elements that comprise a <b>run</b> <b>stream</b> or thread. It is often developed as a hierarchical diagram, but other representations are allowable. The representation must describe the breakdown of the configuration system into subsystems and the lowest manageable level. An accurate and complete {{structure chart}} {{is the key to the}} determination of the configuration items (CI), and a visual representation of the configuration system and the internal interfaces among its CIs(define CI clearly). During the configuration control process, the structure chart is used to identify CIs and their associated artifacts that a proposed change may impact.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the most}} popular of {{recreational}} activities at the Potomac River adjacent to Difficult Run. Whitewater boating (kayak/canoe) is commonly exercised as the rapids found in Great Falls Park are rated from class II (moderately easy) to class VI. Class VI rapids are considered extremely dangerous, as they are highest category of all rapid classes. A series of rapids starting at the Difficult Run Georgetown Pike entrance will lead to directly into the Potomac River. These rapids along the Difficult <b>Run</b> <b>stream</b> range from class III to class V. The Potomac River has many challenging currents, standing waves, and hydraulics. Swimming, wading, and tubing are not allowed in the river.|$|E
