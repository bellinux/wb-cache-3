The deposition calculations are made for the years 1986, 1994 and 2000 using the expected development of emissions in The Netherlands and surrounding countries. For the situation in 1986 the deposition target of 4000 eq H+/ha/y, proposed for the year 1994, is exceeded in all <b>receptor</b> <b>areas</b> in both provinces. In 1994 in Gelderland in 64 % of the receptors the target value is exceeded; in Noord-Brabant the atmospheric acid input is strongly reduced (from an average value of 7050 eq H+/ha. y it drops to 5150 eq H+/ha. y) but the deposition target is still exceeded in all receptors. In the year 2000 in Gelderland in 92 % of the receptors the target proposed for this year is exceeded, in Noord-Brabant in all receptors exceedance is expected. In a number of scenario calculations the effectivity of regio-oriented NH 3 abatement policy has been investigated. In Noord-Brabant extremely high emissions reductions (more than 90 % with respect tot the 1986 emissions) are needed to approach the deposition targets for potential acid and total nitrogen.

The method was implemented to calculate the SO 2 flow rate from continental Asia to northeast Asia and the Northwest Pacific Ocean. For the high SO 2 events when SO 2 was transported from continental Asia to Japan via the Korean Peninsula on 22 – 24 December 2006, the long-range transported SO 2 flow rates were 14. 0 (21. 0) Mg·h− 1 OMI·gird− 1 at Gangneung (Seoul) in Korea and 4. 2 (5. 3) Mg·h− 1 OMI·gird− 1 at Hiroshima (Kumamoto) in Japan.

We have recorded the resoonses of 61 neurons in the lamb NTS to stimulation of the caudal tongue, palate and epilottis with mechanical, chemical and thermal stimuli and mapped receptive field location. Although there was some overlap in the areas of the NTS from which neurons with oral cavity and epiglottal receptive fields could be recorded, a significant differences was observed in the mean recording sites of the two groups of neurons. Neurons with oral cavity receptive fields were located more rostral, lateral and ventral in the NTS than neurons with receptive fields on the epiglottis. Little convergence of sensory input onto single cells in the NTS was observed between the oral cavity and the epiglottis. Only one NTS neuron had a receptive field in both of these <b>receptor</b> <b>areas.</b> In contrast, a largenumber of neurons with oral cavity receptive fields received input from two <b>receptors</b> <b>areas.</b> These neurons had a receptive field on the tongue which was located directly beneath the receptive field on the palate. Mechanical stimuli were the most effective for neurons with either oral cavity or epiglottal receptive fields and thermal stimuli were the least effective. Neurons which responded to mechanical stimuli responded better to a moving stimulusthan to a punctate one, and large increases in the strength of a punctate stimulus were required to elicit significant increases in response frequency. Most NTS neurons responded to more than one of the stimulus modalities. However, a significant difference in the mean number of stimulus modalities which elicited responses was observed between neurons with oral cavity and epiglottal receptive fields. The number of multimodal neurons with epiglottal receptive fields was higher than those with oral cavity receptive fields. The multimodal nature of neurons which responded to epiglottal or oral cavity stimulation combined with their location in reflexogenic areas of the NTS suggests that these neurons could be important in the integration of afferent input from the oral cavity and upper airway. If these NTS neurons are involved in the control of oral and upper airway reflexes it would be important for them to respond to as many of the stimulus cues as possible and the majority of these neurons do just that...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the Dutch Priority Program on acidification, the DAS model (Dutch Acidification System model) has been developed. This model describes the entire causal chain from emissions of acidifying components to their effects on ecosystems on a regional scale. In the atmospheric module of DAS the transport and deposition of acidifying species is described by means of so-called source-receptor relations. Assuming that the physical and chemical processes in the atmosphere may be approximated as first order, linear processes, the relation between an emission quantity in a source area and the resulting deposition flux in a <b>receptor</b> <b>area</b> can be described with a single transfer coefficient. In the Netherlands 20 receptor areas are defined. The number of source areas in the Netherlands and foreign countries is 39. The source-receptor relations are {{based on the results of}} the atmospheric transport model TREND. For the components NOx and SO 2 different sets of transfer matrices are calculated for three emission height classes. This improves the calculation of the contribution to the deposition of sources at relatively short distances. As ammonia emissions take place at the surface or at low heights, no discrimination in emission heights is made for this component. By using the transfer matrices the calculation of atmospheric deposition is reduced to a simple matrix multiplication. In this way the computer time consuming applications of the TREND model can be avoided. However, during the procedure of calculating the transfer matrices, a number of assumptions and choices had to be made which limit the application of the matrices. In principle the assumption of a linear relation between emission and deposition is violated for all three acidifying components. Interactions between the compounds play a (sometimes important) role in atmospheric processes. As model parameters are validated for the present situation, deviations from a linear behaviour will become larger with increasing deviations from the present emission conditions. Next to limitations inherent to the method, there are some practical limitations. Only an average deposition value for a <b>receptor</b> <b>area</b> can be obtained. There is no information on the spatial variations in deposition within a <b>receptor</b> <b>area.</b> Detailed calculations with TREND show that the variation may be large. The meteorological conditions and the removal parameters are pre defined for the TREND calculations. Changes in these parameters require a re-calculation of the matrices. Nevertheless, it may be assumed that the error introduced by the assumptions of a linear emissiondeposition relation is acceptable in view of the uncertainties in the other modules of the DAS-model. ...|$|E

Dopamine also manages to stimulate the area postrema, since this part of the brain contains a high density of dopamine <b>receptors.</b> The <b>area</b> postrema is very sensitive to changes in blood toxicity and senses the presence of poisonous or dangerous substances in the blood.

Nitrogen dioxide and hydrocarbons are the two primary contaminants known to contribute significantly to the accumulation of ozone in the photochemical process. An examination of recorded data, measuring each of these contaminants and the recorded values for ozone found in the USCRV, indicates low concentrations of primary contaminants. Yet significant episodes of air pollution in terms of ozone occur in the USCRV; the California standard for ozone (0. 10 ppm/hr.) was exceeded on an average of 149 days per year there in the 1970 - 1973 period. Clearly the low concentrations of primary contaminants cannot account for the high concentrations of ozone monitored. This implies that ozone comes from a source other than the USCRV. This study, through analysis of air quality data and atmospheric transport patterns, shows that the USCRV air basin is a prime <b>receptor</b> <b>area</b> for Los Angeles Basin atmospheric contaminants and that its air quality suffers accordingly...|$|E

One of the major challenges in carrier design for targeting cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is that carriers must be able to navigate the circulation system and efficiently marginate to the endothelium in order to interact with the target <b>receptors.</b> <b>Areas</b> covered: This review draws on studies that have focused on the role of particle size, shape, and density (along with flow hemodynamics and hemorheology) on the localization of the particles to activated endothelial cell surfaces and vascular walls under different flow conditions, especially those relevant to atherosclerosis. Expert opinion: Generally, the size, shape, and density of a particle affect its adhesion to vascular walls synergistically, and these three factors should be considered simultaneously when designing an optimal carrier for targeting CVD. Available preliminary data should encourage more studies to be conducted to investigate the use of nano-constructs, characterized by a sub-micrometer size, a non-spherical shape, and a high material density to maximize vascular wall margination and minimize capillary entrapment, as carriers for targeting CVD...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between hemagglutination and hemolysis by the mumps virus {{has been studied}} under conditions which affect (a) the receptors of chicken red cells and (b) the adsorption and subsequent elution of the virus from these cells. The {{results show that the}} hemolytic action of the virus appears to involve some of the same <b>receptor</b> <b>areas</b> of erythrocytes that are implicated in hemagglutination. Materials such as allantoic fluid, egg white, and red cell extract, which inhibit the agglutination of chicken red cells by mumps virus, also interfere with its hemolytic activity. Of these inhibitors, egg white and red cell extract, which are readily destroyed by the virus during incubation at 37 °C., exert a greater antagonistic effect on hemagglutination than on hemolysis. Heated mumps virus or unheated influenza virus interferes with the hemolysis of red cells by untreated mumps virus. Though hemolysis takes place during elution of the virus after its adsorption on the red cell, the processes are apparently distinct. The hemolytic activity is easily affected by certain conditions of pH and temperature which have no effect on the ability of mumps virus to adsorb on and elute from red cells...|$|R
