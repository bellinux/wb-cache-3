25|$|This Soviet plug, still {{widely used}} in modern Russia, has pin {{dimensions}} and spacing equal to the Europlug, but lacks the insulation sleeves. Unlike the Europlug, it is rated 6A. It has a round body like the French CEE 7/6 or flat body with a <b>round</b> <b>base</b> like CEE 7/17. The <b>round</b> <b>base</b> has no notches. The pins are parallel and do not converge. The body is made of fire resistant thermoset plastic. The corresponding 6A socket accepts the Europlug, but not others as the 4.5mm holes {{are too small to}} accept the 4.8mm pins of CEE 7/4, CEE 7/6 or CEE 7/7 plugs.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} moulded rubber plugs {{available}} for devices up to 16A similar to CEE 7/17, {{but with a}} <b>round</b> <b>base</b> without any notches. They could be altered to fit a CEE 7/5 or CEE 7/3 socket by cutting notches with a sharp knife.|$|E
500|$|The katholikon of Nea Moni, {{a monastery}} {{on the island}} of Chios, was built some time between 1042 and 1055 and {{featured}} a nine sided, ribbed dome rising [...] above the floor (this collapsed in 1881 and was replaced with the slightly taller present version). The transition from the square naos to the <b>round</b> <b>base</b> of the drum is accomplished by eight conches, with those above the flat sides of the naos being relatively shallow and those in the corners of the being relatively narrow. The novelty of this technique in Byzantine architecture has led to it being dubbed the [...] "island octagon" [...] type, in contrast to the [...] "mainland octagon" [...] type of Hosios Loukas. Speculation on design influences have ranged from Arab influence transmitted via the recently built domed octagon chapels at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem or the Al-Hakim Mosque in Islamic Cairo, to Caucasian buildings such as the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Later copies of the Nea Moni, with alterations, include the churches of Agios Georgios Sykousis, Agioi Apostoli at Pyrghi, Panagia Krina, and the Church of the Metamorphosis in Chortiatis.|$|E

In two-piece construction, one piece is a flat top {{and the other a}} deep-drawn cup-shaped piece that combines the (at least roughly) cylindrical wall and the <b>round</b> <b>base.</b> Transition between wall and base is usually gradual.

Lewis chose to [...] "whitewash" [...] the facial features of her female figures, removing all facial features associated with [...] "colored" [...] races. Lewis pushed the limits with the accuracy of her sculptures. She wanted to be as realistic as possible.|$|E

He found stone items including [...] "sling-stones", [...] "warrior's clubs" [...] and a [...] "sugar-loaf-shaped stone with a well-cut base" [...] long, [...] <b>round</b> <b>base,</b> [...] round centre and [...] round top. [...] The most interesting stone object was [...] "a slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares", which Lacy {{believed to be}} some kind of gaming board. Among the miscellaneous items found were a plough socket, an iron ring, some coins and a bead.|$|E
2500|$|The figure {{stands on}} a round {{pedestal}} decorated with palm branches and four cinerary urns. Low relief numbers on the urns refer to the four years of the American Civil War (1861, 1862, 1863, and [...] "1864-5"). Beneath the round pedestal is a round plinth {{in the form of}} a wreath of wheat. Below the plinth is a <b>round</b> <b>base</b> on which is inscribed: [...] "And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks." [...] It is a partial quotation from Isaiah 2:4.|$|E

From a basic {{column of}} colored marble, about whose base disport three bronze amorini, one with wings and drunk, and another {{uplifting}} a wreath, rises an emaciated and strongly modelled bronze figure of an aged man, crowned with a bird's nest at whose edge two doves bill and coo. He {{stands on a}} base, bearing a woman's head and hand and a colossal frog. He holds in one hand a rose {{and in the other}} nothing. About the <b>round</b> <b>base</b> circle 18 heads, including those of the Saviour and the Virgin, and others, crowned and uncrowned, but nearly all grotesquely ugly. Inspired by the early art of the Chinese the work is a bitter satire on life, sardonic and rather horrible, if somewhat fascinating." ...|$|E

[...] The north arcade is from the late 13thcentury and has octagonal piers. [...] The tower arch dates from the late 12thcentury, and the chancel arch from the 13thcentury.

2500|$|In Macroneuropteris, each {{individual}} leaflet or pinnule {{of the compound}} frond were also notably large. In fact, the species [...] M. scheuchzeri's pinnules were the largest of any seed plant of the Carboniferous Period. Individual pinnules are typically lanceolate with a <b>round</b> <b>base.</b> They {{have been found to}} be as long as 12cm. These individual leaflets are often found fossilized by themselves separated from the frond. They have been inferred by some to be deciduous. In the famous Mazon Creek Fossil Beds of Illinois, these leaflets are one of the most commonly found plant fossils. The leaves have thick cuticles, sunken stomata, dense trichomes, and large hair-like structures. These foliar characteristics combined with the spiny stem structure where the leaflets drop, and the potential deciduous nature have led to many authors suggesting a xeromorphic tendency in the tree. Such adaptations may have allowed the genus to dominate the late Carboniferous landscape as other plants like Lepidodendrales steadily declined.|$|E
2500|$|Tanner Amphitheater is {{oriented}} toward the dais {{on the north}} side of the structure. The dais is [...] wide and [...] deep, and is large enough to seat 300 people. The dais is constructed of brick, with decorative blind corbel arches on all four sides. A four-tread set of stone steps provides access on the east and west sides. Twelve smooth, round columns, made of brick, support a trellis overhead. Each column is topped by an Ionic capital. Each column has a two-stepped, <b>round</b> <b>base</b> with egg-and-dart decoration, below which is a simple square plinth. The capitals and bases are made of cast iron, and the brick columns clad in smooth stucco. The trellis above the dais is formed by beams, which are made of two [...] planks bolted together. Two beams form a girder. Girders run east and west and north and south, connecting all the columns together. Joists made of [...] planks connected to the top of the girders with halved joints. These joists form most of the trellis structure on which plants climb. [...] There are six joists between each east-west column, and one between each north-south column. The deck of the dais consists of stone pavers over fill earth. A low, simple, wrought-iron railing surrounds the dais on the east, west, and north sides.|$|E

2500|$|Rushed into construction, a {{work group}} {{consisting}} of 23 carpenters, 12 bricklayers, and 30 general laborers built the amphitheater in just 28 days. A [...] "Colonel Curtis" [...] oversaw the work, {{under the supervision}} of General William Myers (the quartermaster in charge of the Washington, D.C., quartermaster's depot). A bowl was dug in the earth and the removed soil used to create a [...] high berm on which the pergola was erected. Excavation work was accomplished by contractor Harvey Bell. Bricklaying was done by the firm of Carroll & Shaw, and the carpentry work by contractor D.J. McCarty. Plastering, stuccoing, and painting of the pergola columns was done by contractor Joseph Beckert, while painting of the wooden trellis was accomplished by James Hudson. Sod was provided by Harvey Bell. At the time of its completion, no shrubs, trees, or vines had yet been planted at the amphitheater. A dais in the northern side of the amphitheater provided a platform for speakers and guests. The dais supported 12 round, smooth columns. To reinforce the dais and the trellis above it, the A. Schneider firm made and affixed metal braces. The dais columns were topped by Ionic capitals. The double base consisted of a two-stepped, <b>round</b> <b>base</b> with egg-and-dart decoration, below which was a simple square plinth. The capitals and bases were made of cast iron, and manufactured by James Hudson.|$|E
