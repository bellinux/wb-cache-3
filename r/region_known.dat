5|$|In 907, the Khitan {{chieftain}} Abaoji {{succeeded in}} getting himself appointed khaghan of all Khitan tribes in the north, laying the foundations to what would officially become the Liao dynasty. In 936, the Khitan supported the Shanxi rebel Shi Jingtang in his revolt against the Shatuo Turkic Later Tang, which had destroyed the usurpers of the Tang in 923. The Khitan leader, Abaoji's second son Yelü Deguang, convinced Shi to found a new dynasty (the Later Jin, 936946), and received the crucial border <b>region</b> <b>known</b> as the Sixteen Prefectures in return. With the Sixteen Prefectures, the Khitan now possessed all the passes and fortifications that controlled access to the plains of northern China, including the main Great Wall line.|$|E

The Red River Flood of 1997 devastated the city. Originally called Les Grandes Fourches by French fur traders from Canada, who had long worked and lived in the region, {{steamboat}} captain Alexander Griggs platted a community after being forced to winter there. The Grand Forks post office was established in 1870; and the town was incorporated on February 22, 1881. The city was named for its location at the fork of the Red River and the Red Lake River.|$|E

It shares a Lake Superior water border with Michigan and a land and water border with Wisconsin to the east. Iowa is to the south, North Dakota and South Dakota are to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba are to the north.

5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a <b>region</b> <b>known</b> as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E

50|$|Global regions {{distinguishable}} from space, and {{are therefore}} clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However, they have been generally recognised as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into largest of land <b>regions,</b> <b>known</b> as continents, and the largest of water <b>regions</b> <b>known</b> as oceans. There are also significant regions that {{do not belong to}} either classification, such as archipelago regions that are littoral regions, or earthquake regions that are defined in geology.|$|R

The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse <b>region</b> <b>known</b> as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across.

In Kerwon, south of Dalmasca, the lands are arid at lower altitudes, though the higher elevations are the only places in the <b>region</b> <b>known</b> to receive snow. The north of Kerwon is heavily forested, home to the dense Golmore Jungle, within which lies the magical Feywood.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which {{would come to}} be known as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural <b>region</b> <b>known</b> as the Ardennes.|$|E

5|$|Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, {{was from}} a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a <b>region</b> <b>known</b> for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the {{governor}} of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom was then a vassal state of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's governorship of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 {{as head of the}} department of correspondence during Mahmud's governorship of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to chief accountant and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj.|$|E
5|$|Coloman routed two {{bands of}} crusaders (the {{perpetrators}} of the Rhineland massacres) who were plundering the Western borderlands and defeated Petar Svačić in Croatia. The late 14th-century Pacta conventa states that Coloman was crowned king of Croatia after concluding {{an agreement with}} twelve local noblemen. Although most probably a forgery, the document reflects the actual status of Croatia proper, which was never incorporated into Hungary. In contrast, the <b>region</b> <b>known</b> as Slavonia, between the Petrova Mounts and the river Dráva, became closely connected to Hungary. Here many Hungarian noblemen received land grants from the monarchs. Zadar, Split and other Dalmatian towns also accepted Coloman's suzerainty in 1105, but their right to elect their own bishops and leaders remained unchained. In Croatia and Slavonia, the sovereign was represented by governors bearing the title ban. Likewise, a royal official, the voivode, administered Transylvania, the eastern borderland of the kingdom.|$|E
