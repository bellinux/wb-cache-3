40|$|INTRODUCTION: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} is {{a serious}} public health problem that requires global control strategies, especially with respect to factors that may intervene in reducing the incidence of endemicity. In this work, <b>rainfall</b> <b>density</b> and temperature were correlated with the incidence of human cases in an area endemic for leishmaniasis in São Luis do Maranhão, Northeastern Brazil. METHODS: Notification of human cases by the National Health Foundation/Regional Coordination of Maranhão (FUNASA/COREMA) from 2002 to 2010 was used. Ecological data (mean temperature and <b>rainfall</b> <b>density)</b> were provided by the Meteorological Office of State. RESULTS: A significant association was verified {{between the number of}} VL cases and rainfall rate but not in the analysis concerning mean temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the control actions in visceral leishmaniasis should be performed during rainy season in the State of Maranhão, which is {{in the first half of}} the year...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{determinants of}} hemontiagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in low-lying areas of China, the authors studied Chuigang and Wanggang communities in Anhui Province. These adjacent farming communities have {{a population of}} about 100, 000. Data were collected from the two communities in 1961 - 1977 and from Yingshang County in 1983 - 1995; information covered the incidence of HFRS, amount of precipita-tion, differences in the water level of the Huai River, density ofApodemus agrarius, autumn crop production, and areas of inundated farmland. Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate the relation between seasonal <b>rainfall,</b> <b>density</b> of mice, occupational factors, and occurrence of the disease. Associations were observed between the incidence of HFRS and the amount of precipitation, the water level of the Huai River, and the areas of inundated farmland in Chuigang community. The smaller the water-level difference, the less farmland was inundated and the higher the incidence of HFRS. In Wanggang community, the density of A. agrarius (r, = 0. 63, p = 0. 02), the water-level difference in the Huai River (r 2 =- 0. 81, p = 0. 007), and crop production (r 3 = 0. 96, p = 0. 005) were correlated with the incidence of HFRS. The regression analyses based on Wanggang community suggested that these indexes could be used as predictive variables, and the results from the model were well calibrated with the actual incidence of HFRS in that community (R 2 = 0. 88, p < 0. 01) and Yingshang County (ft 2 = 0. 91, p < 0. 01).

For theAfrican buffalo (Syncerus caffer Sparrman) population inhabiting the Mara–Serengeti ecosystem, rinderpest was the primary regulatory factor up to the mid- 1960 s. Following reduction of rinderpest and buffalo population increase, interspecific competition for food, notably with cattle and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus Burchell), was thought to be the primary regulatory factor in the ecosystem. Aims. We analysed buffalo population trends and the relationship between buffalo population growth and <b>rainfall</b> and <b>density</b> dependence in the Mara–Serengeti ecosystem and discuss the findings {{in the context of the}} key ecosystem processes governing buffalo population dynamics in African savannas, namely, food limitation, competition, predation, disease and land use changes. Methods. We analysed buffalo population dynamics in the Mara–Serengeti ecosystem in relation to <b>rainfall</b> and <b>density</b> dependence feedback between 1984 and 2010. Key results. Buffalo population growth was both significantly density-dependent and positively correlated with the dry season rainfall after, but not before, a severe drought in 1993.

40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of environmental factors on population dynamics is fundamental to many areas in biology. Survival is a key factor of population biology, as it {{is thought to be}} the predominant driver of growth in long-lived passerines, which can be influenced by both biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. We used mark-recapture methods and generalized linear mixed models to test {{the influence}} of density and climatic variation, measured at a regional and local scale (Southern Oscillation Index [SOI] and rainfall, respectively), on seasonal variation in survival rates of an insular population of Silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus), during a 15 -year study period, off the east coast of Australia. We found overall high survival rates for adults and juveniles (81 % and 59 %, respectively). Local scale climate (i. e. <b>rainfall)</b> and <b>density</b> were the principal environmental factors influencing their survival, both with a negative relationship. A significant interactive effect of <b>density</b> and <b>rainfall</b> influenced survival as they both increased. However, survival remained low when density was at it highest, independent of the amount of rainfall. Nestling survival was negatively influenced by <b>rainfall</b> and <b>density,</b> positively by SOI, and chicks that hatched later in the breeding season had higher survival rates. The regional scale climate variable (i. e. SOI) did not explain survival rates as strongly as rainfall in any age class. Our results contribute to the understanding of insular avian population dynamics and the differential effects of environmental factors across age classes. Climatic predictions expect El Niño events to increase, meaning dryer conditions in eastern Australia, potentially increasing Silvereye survival across age classes. However, the long-term effect of lower rainfall on food availability is unknown; consequently, the outcome of lower rainfall on Silvereye survival rates is uncertain...|$|R

Conclusions: Recovery of buffalo numbers to pre-drought levels took 8 – 9 years after the 1984 – 85 drought but was much slower, with buffaloes numbering merely 36 % of their 1993 population (12 895 animals) 18 years after the 1993 – 94 drought despite intermittent periods of high rainfall, probably due to demographic and/or reproductive factors, heightened competition with livestock, land use changes in the adjoining pastoral ranches, lion predation and recurrent severe droughts. Implications: Our findings demonstrate how food limitation caused by droughts associated with the hemispheric El Niño–Southern Oscillation can cause severe declines in and threaten the persistence of large ungulate populations.

We have developed a RVFV transmission model comprising two hosts—cattle as a separate host and sheep and goats as one combined host (herein after referred to as sheep) —and two vectors—Aedes species (spp) and Culex spp—and used it to predict the impacts of: (1) reactive vaccination implemented at various levels of coverage at pre-determined time points, (2) targeted vaccination involving {{either of the two}} host species, and (3) a periodic vaccination implemented biannually or annually before an outbreak. Methodology/Principal Findings The model comprises coupled vector and host modules where the dynamics of vectors and hosts are described using a system of difference equations. Vector populations are structured into egg, larva, pupa and adult stages and the latter stage is further categorized into three infection categories: susceptible, exposed and infectious mosquitoes. The survival rates of the immature stages (egg, larva and pupa) are dependent on <b>rainfall</b> <b>densities</b> extracted from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) for a Rift Valley fever (RVF) endemic site in Kenya over a period of 1827 days. The host populations are structured into four age classes comprising young, weaners, yearlings and adults and four infection categories including susceptible, exposed, infectious, and immune categories. The model reproduces the 2006 / 2007 RVF outbreak reported in empirical surveys in the target area and other seasonal transmission events that are perceived to occur during the wet seasons. Mass reactive vaccination strategies greatly reduce the potential for a major outbreak. The results also suggest that the effectiveness of vaccination can be enhanced by increasing the vaccination coverage, targeting vaccination on cattle given that this species {{plays a major role in}} the transmission of the virus, and using both periodic and reactive vaccination strategies.

The results showed nonlinear interactions among the processes driven by <b>rainfall,</b> tides, and <b>density</b> gradients. Rainfall-induced infiltration increased the yearly averaged fresh groundwater discharge to the ocean but reduced the extents of the saltwater wedge and upper saline plume as well as the total rate of seawater circulation through both zones. Overall, the net effect of the interactions led to an increase of the SGD. The nearshore groundwater responded to individual rainfall events in a delayed and cumulative fashion, as evident in the variations of daily averaged SGD and salt stored in the saltwater wedge (quantifying the extent of SWI). A generalized linear model (GLM) along with a Gamma distribution function was developed to describe the delayed and prolonged effect of rainfall events on short-term groundwater behavior.

Geographic Information System (GIS) data on <b>density</b> and <b>rainfall</b> and climate change scenarios are combined in order to identify areas which will be subject to increased pressures stemming from excessive population, given their precipitation levels. We first describe the empirical relationship existing between average yearly <b>rainfall</b> and <b>density</b> over sub-Saharan Africa. The limit of 900  mm of annual rainfall appears to define the threshold below which water constitutes a binding constraint to higher densities. Above that threshold, <b>density</b> and <b>rainfall</b> are not spatially correlated. In a second stage, we identify areas subject to water stress. In our framework, those are defined as zones belonging to the right end of the distribution of densities conditional on average rainfall. In a last step, localized population projections and changes in rainfall predicted by two mainstream climate change scenarios are utilized to assess the respective impacts of those two factors on the changes in extent and distribution of high-stress zones over the continent between 2000 and 2050. If population growth follows projected trends, density increases across the continent should lead to {{a significant increase in the}} extent of such zones, especially around the Sahel belt and in Eastern Africa. The impact of changes in rainfall is more difficult to assess, because climate models differ locally as regards projections of yearly rainfall, especially in intermediate zones such as the Sahel. If, according to the predictions of most climate models, the Sahel were to experience average rainfall increases, these would ease, though not offset totally, the pressure stemming from demographic growth in that region. In contrast, in most of Eastern Africa, predicted drops in average rainfall would work in the same direction as demographic changes to increase the pressure on significant parts of the territory. In Southern Africa, demographic stagnation is likely to mitigate significantly the impact of climate change. ...|$|R

It was, therefore, investigated whether the black rhino population of Pilanesberg National Park had become regulated by resource limitation 22 years after introduction in 1979. Inter-calving intervals (which are not restricted to yearly time increments, due to asynchronous reproduction) decreased with an increase in rainfall, while the percentage of male calves born increased with increasing rainfall. The percentage of reproductive cows achieving maternal success increased with increasing density until 0. 085 rhinos/km 2,after which it decreased. This positive relationship at low densities is largely due to changes in the female age structure and the adult female/male ratio.

At a given Relative Density, stands with a lower stem density of large trees grew more volume and were more efficient than stands with many small trees. In addition, stands with more variation in tree size were more efficient than were more uniformly sized stands. The effect of stand structure overrode the effect of topography on growth and efficiency with two exceptions: stand volume growth and efficiency were higher on southerly than on northerly aspects and in areas of higher rainfall. In these areas, stands of a given density carried more leaf area, which may help to explain why growth was better there. In the regression analyses, stand volume growth correlated positively with Douglas-fir stand basal area, average annual <b>rainfall,</b> Relative <b>Density,</b> and an aspect variable that indicated better growth on southerly aspects. Stand volume growth correlated negatively with stem density of Douglas-fir. Stand leaf area correlated positively with stand basal area, average annual <b>rainfall,</b> stem <b>density,</b> and south aspects. Stand stem growth efficiency (volume growth per unit of leaf area) correlated positively with Relative Density, individual tree size variance, and southerly aspects, and correlated negatively with stem density and leaf area. Individual tree growth was mostly determined by the tree basal area, {{although there was a}} small negative effect of increasing stand basal area. The more dominant a tree was in a stand the greater was its growth, but suppressed trees were the most efficient, whether efficiency was calculated in terms of stem volume growth per unit individual tree leaf area or basal area growth per unit individual tree basal area. The presence of hardwoods of the small size and low densities in this study had no effect on absolute growth, however Douglas-fir grew more efficiently in pure stands than when mixed with hardwoods...|$|R
40|$|A biophysical model WAVES, {{developed}} by CSIRO, {{has recently been}} implemented as the modelling engine to provide recharge input and discharge output to an integrated regional groundwater model for the Perth region, namely, the Perth Regional Aquifer Modelling System (PRAMS). Application of the WAVES model over such a large area requires an extensive set of data that are not known with certainty. This paper describes a method based on the mean value first order reliability analysis method to determine the parameters that significantly affect uncertainty in the recharge estimates. The fraction of model output (recharge) variance (FOV) contributed by each basic parameter is determined using the sensitivity coefficients and uncertainty (measured by the variance or the coefficient of variation) of the model parameters. The FOV provides a quantitative means to rank the order of importance of parameters that affect {{the reliability of the}} recharge estimate and can be used to prioritise data collection to improve the estimate. Application of the proposed method to the local conditions on the Gnangara Mound found that the critical parameters for WAVES in the modelling framework of PRAMS are: <b>rainfall,</b> vegetation <b>density</b> measured by leaf area index, soil water holding capacity of the soil root zone, maximum root depth and maximum carbon assimilation rate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) {{remains one}} of health {{problems}} in all provinces in Indonesia including West Java. Bandung as the capital of West Java province has dengue prevalence that is above the average prevalence of all provinces. This study aimed to describe the pattern of dengue incidence rate, annual <b>rainfall,</b> population <b>density,</b> and larval free index {{as well as the}} implementation of prevention program in sub-districts with the highest incidence rate in Bandung between 2008 and 2011. Methods: A descriptive retrospective study was conducted in September 2012 using secondary data during the period of January 2008 to December 2011. The incidence rate was calculated based on DHF patients who live in Bandung. Data were analyzed using computer and Arc View 3. 3. Pattern of incidence rate was characterized with red, yellow, and green region respectively. Results: The highest incidence rate of DHF occurred in 2009. Incidence increased in January to February and declined in the end of the year. Subdistricts with highest incidence had no highest annual rainfall and the population density below the average of population density in Bandung. The highest implementation of fogging program was not only performed in high incidence subdistricts but also in area with larval free index less than 95...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous studies, {{conducted}} in the urban of Antananarivo, showed low rate of confirmed malaria cases. We used a geographical and environmental approach to investigate the contribution of environmental factors to urban malaria in Antananarivo. Methods: Remote sensing data were used to locate rice fields, which {{were considered to be}} the principal mosquito breeding sites. We carried out supervised classification by the maximum likelihood method. Entomological study allowed vector species determination from collected larval and adult mosquitoes. Mosquito infectivity was studied, to assess the risk of transmission, and the type of mosquito breeding site was determined. Epidemiological data were collected from November 2006 to December 2007, from public health centres, to determine malaria incidence. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out on dried blood spots from patients, to detect cases of malaria. Rapid diagnostic tests were used to confirm malaria cases among febrile school children in a school survey. A geographical information system was constructed for data integration. Altitude, temperature, <b>rainfall,</b> population <b>density</b> and rice field surface area were analysed and the effects of these factors on the occurrence of confirmed malaria cases were studied. Results: Polymerase chain reaction confirmed malaria in 5. 1 % of the presumed cases. Entomological studies showe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{identify}} patterns of Aedes (Stegomya) L. aegypti, vector of dengue disease in cities of São Paulo state between 2003 - 2011. The studied cities were Araçatuba, Bauru, Campinas, Marília, São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Santos, Sorocaba, Ribeirão Preto and Presidente Prudente in Brazil. The statistical technique of Cluster Analysis {{was used to}} classify these cities, where the variables related to dengue vector were chosen. The annual variables adopted were mean maximum temperature, mean minimum temperature, rainy days, average <b>rainfall,</b> population <b>density,</b> index of house infestation (IIP), resistance to temephos, rate of indigenous and imported dengue cases, {{as well as the}} altitude as fixed variable. The results showed that the patterns of dengue are dynamic throughout the studied period for the cities in focus. Cities were grouped into three more permanent groups, although there are changes in formation of these groups over studied time. The most consistent groups indicated a relation to the climatic classification of Köppen-Geiger, showing that the climate affects the dengue vector and its epidemiology. The city of Santos was classified as the only group in each year to present a distinct profile for bioecology and resistance to temephos in Ae. aegypti and dengue consecutivel...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{discusses}} {{the availability of}} biomass in Brazil to supply charcoal to the steel industry on the bases of an initial global assessment of land potentially available for plantations and of Brazilian data that allows refining the assessment and specifying the issue of practical availability. Technical potentials are first assessed {{through a series of}} simple rules against direct competition with agriculture, forests and protected areas, and of quantitative criteria, whether geo-climatic (<b>rainfall),</b> demographic (population <b>density)</b> or legal (reserves). Institutional, social and economic factors are then identified and discussed so as to account for the practical availability of Brazilian biomass through six criteria. The ranking of nine Brazilian States according to these criteria brings out the necessary trade-offs in the selection of land for plantations that would efficiently supply charcoal to the steel industry...|$|R
