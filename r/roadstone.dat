Occasionally coastal trading vessels enter the Cumberland Basin to be loaded with large steel silos manufactured by Braby Ltd at their nearby Ashton Gate works.|$|E
5|$|Limestone traffic {{continued}} on the Tiverton section. Only two boats were working the canal by 1904, {{and the last}} commercial traffic was <b>roadstone</b> from Whipcott quarry to Tiverton, {{where there was a}} crushing plant. Around 7,000tons per year were transported up to 1925. After this the only income was from the washing of sheep, for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep, and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal. In the 1930s, dams were built at both ends of a section near Halberton, where persistent leakage could not be cured.|$|E

50|$|Grooves in France {{date from}} the Neolithic and are called polissoirs. Those in l’Aube date from c. 2500 to 2000 BCE. People who built dolmens, erected menhirs and made grooves {{supported}} an archaeological culture known as Seine-Oise-Marne. The l’Aube district had more than 130 monuments from this period including 49 grooves before 1927. Today there are only 34 including 16 grooves. Many stones were cut into <b>roadstones</b> or building blocks for homes.|$|R

25|$|During {{its long}} {{existence}} the works produced huge quantities {{of a variety}} of products, including pig iron, tunnel castings, (used in projects such as the London Underground), pipes and street furniture as well as bitumen, <b>roadstone,</b> chemicals and munition casings. It is likely that if you live in the UK, you are not far away from a S manhole cover or lamp post.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{quarries}} {{around the}} western side of Threlkeld Knotts have worked the microgranite. In addition to the large Threlkeld Quarry there are smaller workings at Birkett Bank, Hilltop Quarries and Bramcrag Quarry. Threlkeld Quarry was opened in 1870 to supply railway ballast for the Crewe to Carlisle railway line. Production increased in the 1890s with material for Thirlmere Reservoir and for <b>roadstone.</b> The quarry closed in the 1980s and now houses the Threlkeld Quarry and Mining Museum.|$|E
25|$|The Great Northern {{did little}} {{maintenance}} of the canal, and its condition slowly deteriorated. In 1916, the canal still carried 123,488 tons of traffic, with general merchandise accounting for 31,887 tons, coal at 17,133 tons, gravel at 16,819 tons, <b>roadstone</b> at 16,166 tons and manure at 14,731 tons. Tolls generated by this traffic were £1,028, {{but the majority of}} it was short-haul traffic, passing from the Trent to the Nottingham wharves, or using the Beeston Cut. There were regular complaints about a lack of water in the section from Lenton to Trent Lock, but the Great Northern did nothing to address the issues. Commercial traffic on the upper reaches above Lenton Lock ceased in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Many of the craggy {{rocks of}} Charnwood Forest are of {{volcanic}} origin {{and are very}} old, dating back through 600 million years to Precambrian times. It {{was the site of}} the first ever recorded discovery of Charnia masoni, the earliest known large, complex fossilised species on record. It was discovered in 1957 by a local schoolboy named Roger Mason (thus masoni) who, with friends, was exploring a quarry near the Charnwood village of Woodhouse Eaves. The rocks of Charnwood Forest remain the only place in Western Europe where these Precambrian fossils have been found. Along the western edge of Charnwood Forest the rocks are mainly Precambrian igneous Diorites. These formed from molten lava deep within the sedimentary rocks, cooling slowly to produce hard, blocky rock with large crystals. This is extensively quarried for <b>roadstone</b> around Groby, Markfield and Whitwick, and is known as granite (formerly also called Markfieldite). The central area of the forest has older rocks still. These are sedimentary and are very variable in character, They were formed by material from volcanoes, settling in deep water, and it is in these beds that the fossils are found. Uplifting, tilting and erosion have produced the distinctive jagged exopsures found across the highest parts of Charnwood. On the eastern side, a much more recent series of rocks are found. Again igneous Diorites, that formed deep underground, but these are Ordovician, from a mere 450 million years ago. These are extensively quarried in the areas near Mountsorrel.|$|E
500|$|Vessels used on {{the river}} were Rye sailing barges, which were about [...] in size, with a draught of [...] A {{pamphlet}} published in 1802 announced that there were 16 barges operating on the river, whereas there had only been three some ten years earlier. The main cargoes were manure, fuel and <b>roadstone,</b> and the places served by the river were listed as Appledore, Reading Street, Maytham Wharf, Newenden, Bodiam and Small Hythe. Boats also worked along part of the Newmill Channel towards Tenterden. The river {{did not have a}} towing path, and the boats were bow-hauled by men. Scots Float Sluice was descripted as being [...] "very inconvenient and ill-adapted to the present vessels which navigate the Rother" [...] by the civil engineer John Rennie in 1804.|$|E

In 1964, now group managing director, Martin acquired key quarrying assets, including Cliffe Hill Granite, Rowley Regis Granite and Hillhead Hughes.|$|E
5000|$|The State's Comptroller and Auditor General {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} the sale and found that the competing bid fell [...] "far short of" [...] the <b>Roadstone</b> offer and that [...] "The Department acted at all times in the best commercial interests of the State" [...] (Section 9.6). It did also note [...] "even though {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>Roadstone</b> offer would have been bettered. The attraction of concluding the sale at what was considered a good price outweighed the imperative to act evenhandedly which is a basic principle when the State is doing business" [...] It was noted by the Department's Accounting Officer that the <b>Roadstone</b> offer [...] "was more than 50% above the only alternative offer received", that another bidder [...] "was afforded every opportunity" [...] to make a better offer and that given subsequent delays and planning issues [...] "In retrospect the deal had proved to be exceptional".|$|E
