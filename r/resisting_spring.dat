40|$|Elastic energy plays {{important}} roles in biology across scales, from the molecular to organismal level, and across the tree of life. The ubiquity of elastic systems in biology {{is partly due to}} the variety of useful functions they permit such as the simplification of motor control in running cockroaches and the efficient recycling of kinetic energy in hopping kangaroos. Elastic energy is also responsible for ultrafast movements; the fastest movements in animals are not powered directly by muscle, but instead by elastic energy stored in a spring. By demonstrating that the power required to generate ultrafast movements exceeds the limits of muscle, many studies conclude that energy storage is necessary; but, what these studies do not explain is how the properties of a biological structure affect its capacity for energy storage. In this dissertation, I test the general principles of energy storage by investigating elastic systems at three hierarchical levels of organization: a single structure, multiple connected structures, and a spring system connected to muscle. By using a multi-level approach, my aim is to demonstrate, at each of the mentioned levels, how properties of the spring system affect where or how much energy is stored in the system as well as how these conclusions can be combined to inform our understanding of the biomechanics of hierarchical elastic systems. When considering spring systems at the level of a single structure, morphology is one major structural aspect that affects mechanics. Continuous changes in morphology are capable of dividing a structure into regions that are responsible for the two contradicting functions that are essential for spring function: energy storage (via deformation) and structural support (via resistance to deformation). Using high quality micro computed tomography scans, I quantify the morphology of the mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda) merus, a single structure of the raptorial appendage hypothesized to store the elastic energy that drives ultrafast strikes. Comparing the morphology among the species, I find that the merus in smashers, species that depend heavily on elastic energy storage, have relatively thicker ventral regions and more eccentric cross-sections than spearers, species that strike relatively slower. I also conclude that differential thickening of a region can provide structural support for <b>resisting</b> <b>spring</b> compression as well as facilitate structural deformation by inducing bending. This multi-level morphological analysis offers a foundation for understanding the evolution and mechanics of monolithic systems in biology. When two or more structures are connected, their relative physical properties determine whether the structures store energy, provide structural support, or some combination of both. Although the majority of elastic energy is stored via large deformations of the merus in smashers, some spearer species show relatively little meral deformation, and it is unclear whether elastic energy is stored in these systems. To determine whether the apodeme (arthropod tendon) provides energy storage in species that exhibit low meral deformation, I measure the physical properties of the lateral extensor apodeme and the merus to which it is connected. Comparisons of these properties show that in the spearer species I tested, the merus has a relatively higher spring constant than the apodeme, which results in the merus providing structural support and the apodeme storing the majority of elastic energy. Comparing the material properties of the apodemes with those of other structures reveals that apodemes and other biological spring systems share similar material characteristics. This study demonstrates that {{in order to understand the}} biomechanics of spring systems comprised of connected structures, it is necessary to compare their relative mechanical properties. Finally, because muscles are responsible for loading spring systems with potential energy, muscle dynamics can affect elastic energy storage in a spring system. Although spring systems can circumvent the limits imposed by muscle via power amplification, they are not entirely independent from muscle dynamics. For example, if an organism has relatively low time to prepare and stretch the spring prior to the onset of movement, the limits of muscle power can dominate energy storage. To test the effects of muscle dynamics on spring loading, I implement a mathematical model that connects a Hookean spring model to a Hill-type muscle model, representing the muscle-tendon complex of the hindlimbs of American bullfrogs, in which the muscle dynamics are well understood and the duration of spring loading is low. I find that the measured spring constants of the tendons nearly maximize energy storage within the duration of in vivo spring loading. Additionally, the measured spring constants are lower than those predicted to produce maximal energy storage when infinite time is available for spring loading. Together, these results suggest that the spring constants of the tendons of American bullfrogs are tuned to maximize elastic energy for small durations of spring loading. This study highlights the importance of assessing muscle dynamics and their effect on energy storage when assessing the functional significance of spring constants. Dissertatio...|$|E

5000|$|Several {{designs were}} tried, {{including}} a small bladder of pressurized {{air in the}} propeller hub providing the necessary force to <b>resist</b> a <b>spring</b> that would drive the blades from fine pitch (take-off) to coarse pitch (level cruising). At a suitable airspeed a disk {{on the front of}} the spinner would press sufficiently on the bladder's air-release valve to relieve the pressure and allow the spring to drive the propeller to coarse pitch. These [...] "pneumatic" [...] propellers were fitted on the DH88 Comet aircraft, winner of the famed long distance 1934 Mac Robertson race and in the Caudron C.460 winner of the 1936 National Air Races, flown by Michel Detroyat. Use of these pneumatic propellers required presetting the propeller to fine pitch prior to take-off. This was done by pressurizing the bladder with a bicycle pump, hence the whimsical nickname Gonfleurs d'h√©lices (prop inflater boy) given to the aircraft ground mechanics in France up to this day.|$|R
25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be <b>resisted</b> by the <b>spring,</b> and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it will get worse, and it wastes gas.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} better the fracture processes in cement-based materials, {{it is essential}} to predict the evolution of damage in cement paste. A recently proposed site-bond model is developed further {{to take into account the}} key microstructure data, such as pore size distribution, porosity, and size distribution and volume fraction of anhydrous cement grains obtained from high resolution X- ray tomography. The grains are associated with lattice sites linked by deformable bonds. The bonds are bundles of elastic-brittle <b>springs,</b> <b>resisting</b> normal and shear relative displacements between grains with potential for failure. The model length scale and thence spring constants are controlled by grain statistics. The spring failure properties are controlled by pore statistics. Macroscopic damage develops by a succession of local failures, represented by spring removal. The model is used to simulate the stress-strain response and damage in cement paste under uniaxial tensile loading. The influence of porosity on tensile strength and damage evolution is estimated in a quantitative manner. The predictions of the model are in a very good agreement with the available experimental data...|$|R
40|$|GTP-dependent {{microtubule}} polymerization dynamics {{are required}} for cell division and are accompanied by domain rearrangements in the polymerizing subunit, Œ±Œ≤-tubulin. Two opposing models describe the role of GTP {{and its relationship to}} conformational change in Œ±Œ≤-tubulin. The allosteric model posits that unpolymerized Œ±Œ≤-tubulin adopts a more polymerization-competent conformation upon GTP binding. The lattice model posits that conformational changes occur only upon recruitment into the growing lattice. Published data support a lattice model, but are largely indirect and so the allosteric model has prevailed. We present two independent solution probes of the conformation of Œ±Œ≤-tubulin, the 2. 3 ‚Ñ´ crystal structure of Œ≥-tubulin bound to GDP, and kinetic simulations to interpret the functional consequences of the structural data. These results (with our previous Œ≥-tubulin:GTPŒ≥S structure) support the lattice model by demonstrating that major domain rearrangements do not occur in eukaryotic tubulins in response to GTP binding, and that the unpolymerized conformation of Œ±Œ≤-tubulin differs significantly from the polymerized one. Thus, geometric constraints of lateral self-assembly must drive Œ±Œ≤-tubulin conformational changes, whereas GTP plays a secondary role to tune the strength of longitudinal contacts within the microtubule lattice. Œ±Œ≤-Tubulin behaves like a bent <b>spring,</b> <b>resisting</b> straightening until forced to do so by GTP-mediated interactions with the growing microtubule. Kinetic simulations demonstrate that resistance to straightening opposes microtubule initiation by specifically destabilizing early assembly intermediates that are especially sensitive to the strength of lateral interactions. These data provide new insights into the molecular origins of dynamic microtubule behavior...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral sanding {{is used by}} {{occupational}} therapists as {{a therapeutic}} exercise technique, however, to-date no data have been available identifying the musculature involved in the activity nor the extent of that involvement. The dual purpose of this pilot study was to; (a) delineate the activity of selected shoulder muscles during bilateral sanding, and (b) determine whether the method used would be feasible {{in the analysis of}} other therapeutic activities. For this investigation, a quadriplegic individual was matched for height and weight with a normal subject and both were tested under several controlled conditions of bilateral sanding. Right shoulder complex musculature was electromyographically (EMG) investigated and the muscles studied were: pectoralis major, biceps brachii, the three heads of deltoid, and the lateral and medial heads of t riceps brachii. EMG data for the two subjects were normalized and represented as percentages of the maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) relative for each muscle. This technique allowed intra- and inter-subject comparisons of muscle activity. Recognizing the limitations of the study with the major one being the small number of subjects, useful information was obtained from the results. The quadriplegic individual appeared to be more inefficient in his muscle usage than the normal subject. This may be related to trunk instability in the quadriplegic subject. All three heads of the deltoid appeared to be the most highly used of monitored muscles in both the normal and the quadriplegic with t riceps being only moderately active in the quadriplegic individual. <b>Spring</b> <b>resisted</b> bilateral sanding produced the most EMG activity in all muscles studied in both subjects. Further investigations employing a larger number of subjects may further elucidate EMG activity during bilateral sanding. It would appear that EMG investigations of therapeutic activities offer an informative method of physical activity analysis...|$|R
40|$|The periplasmic loop of MscL, the mechanosensitive {{channel of}} large conductance, {{acts as a}} <b>spring</b> <b>resisting</b> {{the opening of the}} channel. Recently, a {{high-throughput}} functional screening of a range of MscL structural mutants indicated that the substitution of residue glutamine (Q) 65 with arginine (R) or leucine (L) leads to a wild-type (WT) -like and a loss-of-function (LOF) phenotype, respectively (Maurer and Dougherty J. Biol. Chem. 278 (23) : 21076 - 21082, 2003). We used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, single-channel recording and in vivo experiments to investigate further the effect of R and L mutation of Q 65 on the gating mechanism of MscL. Structural analysis of Q 65 R and Q 65 L was carried out by coupling the site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) with EPR spectroscopy. A SDSL cysteine mutant of the isoleucine 24 residue (124 CSL) in the first transmembrane domain, TM 1, of MscL served as a reporter residue in EPR experiments. This was due to its strong spin-spin interaction with the neighboring 124 C-SL residues in the MscL channel pentamer (Perozo et al. Nature 418 : 942 - 948, 2002). The effects of bilayer incorporation of lysophosphatidylcholine on the MscL mutants were also investigated. Functional analysis was carried out using patch-clamp recordings from these mutants and WT MscL reconstituted into artificial liposomes. Although our data are largely in agreement with the high-throughput mutational analysis of Maurer and Dougherty, this study shows that Q 65 R and Q 65 L form functional channels and that these mutations lead to partial gain-of-function (GOF) and LOF mutation, respectively. Overall, our study confirms and advances the notion that the periplasmic loop plays a role in setting the channel mechanosensitivity...|$|R
5000|$|The design {{featured}} a belt clutch and a transmission {{which could be}} engaged to spin the rotor blades to high speed before take-off to produce short takeoff runs. A lever on the rear cockpit wall would select the drive position for the transmission. A single [...] "spin-up lever" [...] on the cockpit left side would then be pressed downward, operating as a collective pitch control to put the blades into flat pitch while simultaneously tensioning the belt clutch. The rotor could be spun to over 500 rpm before takeoff, well above the normal flight range (typically 425 rpm). Release of the spin-up lever would disengage both the clutch and the transmission, while placing the blades into flight pitch. After a very brief takeoff run (typically 25 to 200 feet, depending upon load and winds) adequate flight airspeed would be attained, while the rotor speed decayed to the normal flight range. The rotor was not engine-driven in flight. A strong <b>spring</b> <b>resisted</b> accidental depressing of the spin-up lever while airborne. Dual controls were provided for all functions except the spin-up lever, which was accessible only from the left seat. The aircraft enjoyed nimble handling with light control forces, but suffered from a shallow climb gradient.Early versions were equipped with a two-bladed wooden Sensenich propeller. A later [...] "Super J-2" [...] variant employed a three-bladed Hartzell controllable-pitch propeller, accompanied {{by an increase in}} allowable gross weight. Baggage of up to 95 pounds, to the extent permitted by gross weight considerations, could be carried in a large bay under the seat. Fuel was carried in tanks in the stub wings. A total of 24 U.S. gallons could be carried, 12 on each side, but only 20 were usable through normal flight attitudes. At a typical fuel burn rate of about eight gallons per hour and economy cruise at about 85 mph, with a need for a safety reserve, this limited the aircraft's range.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed during the {{production}} of [...] "The Beats Go On", a performance of beat poetry and literature directed by Dr. Linda Park-Fuller of then-Southwest Missouri State (SMSU) in 1985 at Murphy's Jazz Club. The show was a success {{and so was the}} band. Ray Castrey on vibes and percussion, Randy Luna-piano, Phil Croy on guitars, and David Nace-drums/percussion, continued to play weekly at Murphy's for over a year, and after recording the band one night and returning a week later, Richard Kittleman-bass/keyboards, joined the group during that time. Pursuing a successful musical career, Randy Luna left Springfield and Distant Relative. The band continued to play for many years at the jazz club now known as Nathan P. Murphy's, opening for numerous jazz artists such as Maynard Ferguson, Buddy Rich and Barney Kessel, who shared the stage with the band. After leaving Murphy's as the house band, Distant Relative continued to play at venues that existed in Springfield and Columbia during the 1980s such as Mustache's, St. Michael's, The Regency Showcase, Fernando's Hideaway, and Murry's. They performed a number of times for the Ozarks House Concert Series at the Frances F. Vandivort Centre and Drury University, and had an appearance on Ozarks Magazine, a television show produced by the local public television station KOZK. In the summer of 1987, Distant Relative went into the recording studio to record their first album, entitled Hide The Silver. Engineered by Lou Whitney and Jim Wunderle at Column One Studios in Springfield, the album features seven original compositions written by members of the band. The music and sound still {{stand the test of time}} and found its way to be a favorite recording among listeners and commuters in Vietnam in the late 1980s to early 1990s. Larry Rottman, a professor at then-Southwest Missouri State, took tapes of Distant Relative with him when he visited Vietnam during the winter of 1988. Rottmann, a veteran of the Vietnam War, has chronicled his return travels in Voices of Vietnam and Echos of Vietnam - multimedia programs designed to educate people about the country time tries to forget. The following May, a friend of Rottmann's reported that they were playing Distant Relative on the radio across the nation, [...] "becoming one of the most popular jazz bands in the country". The following winter upon a return visit to Vietnam, Rottmann himself recognized a Distant Relative song being played on the public transit bus radio, and a local band playing Distant Relative songs on the street. During this time, the band began a working relationship with longtime singer and producer Jim Wunderle, appearing annually at the John Lennon Imagine Concerts, and a number of appearances at the Regency Showcase. Back into the studio with Wunderle in early 1990, the band recorded a second album but found itself with a bit of a problem in the process. Things were going just a little too well for the boys in the band as three of the members became fathers within a few months of each other. Family responsibilities took precedence and the band played fewer dates with the album never being released to the public. The members made it clear that they never broke up, [...] "it's just that we were more distant than relative", explained Ray Castrey. It was only a few years that would pass before the itch to play again would become too great to <b>resist.</b> Early <b>spring</b> of 2005 found Kittleman and Castrey traveling to St. Louis to visit Phil Croy who had moved there with his family. They decided an impromptu jam session in the pavilion of a park would do them some good and that proved to be the catalyst to become more [...] "relative" [...] once again. After waiting a little while longer to grow the kids just a little bit older, the band began to appear as the season-opening act for The Rock House, a house concert series in Reeds Springs, Missouri, and again at the John Lennon Imagine Concerts. A few [...] "world" [...] tours later and the band has found itself playing their music with a few twists that make it a little different from their beginnings. What was once acoustic is now electric, and what was once electric is pretty much still electric‚Äîbut goes acoustic quite often. Currently, all of the members of the band live in southwest Missouri and the band has expanded the number of playing dates it schedules, enjoying a resurgence in popularity with many old friends and many new fans.|$|R
