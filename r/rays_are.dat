5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system. (Many cosmic <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> {{kept out of the}} Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|For natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> {{emitted by}} each of 238U atom, and also 49% by 234U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the 235U. When the Earth was young, {{probably}} about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of 234U was probably much lower than this.|$|E
5|$|Gamma ray {{astronomy}} observes astronomical objects at {{the shortest}} wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The Cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Manta <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> {{members of}} the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta {{is part of the}} eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a lesser degree, morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays lie on the underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E

5|$|Spotted eagle <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> {{found in}} warm and {{temperate}} waters worldwide. In the western Atlantic Ocean {{it is found}} off the eastern coast of United States of America, the Gulf Stream, the Caribbean, and down past {{the southern part of}} Brazil. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea. In the Western Pacific Ocean it can be found near Japan and north of Australia. In the Central Pacific Ocean, it can be found throughout the Hawaiian Islands. In the Eastern-Pacific Ocean, it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro, an area that includes the Galapagos Islands. Spotted eagle <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> most commonly seen in bays and reefs. They spend much of their time swimming freely in open waters, generally in schools close to the surface, and can travel long distances in a day.|$|E
5|$|This ray can be {{identified}} by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings. Near {{the base of the}} ray's relatively long tail, just behind the pelvic fins, are several venomous, barbed stingers. Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans, and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed. These <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> commonly observed leaping out of the water, and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats, in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys. The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks. The <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List. They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums. They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> harvested and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E

40|$|The {{solution}} of the Boltzmann transport equation using Method of Characteristics <b>ray</b> tracing can <b>be</b> accurate yet computationally expensive. <b>Ray</b> tracing would <b>be</b> inherently parallelizable with a very fine granularity if the boundary condition associated with each <b>ray</b> <b>were</b> known a priori. In practice, however, <b>ray</b> tracing <b>is</b> serial since the boundary condition for one <b>ray</b> <b>is</b> generally obtained from another ray in the problem. In the work here, an alternative implementation of <b>ray</b> tracing <b>is</b> presented that minimizes serialization and reduces the memory requirements. A new algorithm was implemented in the MOC code DeCART and demonstrated for a BWR assembly model...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ray</b> Krebbs <b>was</b> born on October 19, 1945 in Emporia, Kansas. His alleged father, Amos Krebbs, {{left him}} and his mother, Margaret Hunter Krebbs, when <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> three years old. At age 15, <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> sent off to Dallas and to the Southfork Ranch with a letter from his {{recently}} deceased mother asking Jock Ewing to help Ray out. Ray's mother, a United States Army Air Corps nurse, was a woman with whom Jock Ewing had an affair during World War II. At the time when Ray arrived on Southfork, both Jock Ewing and Miss Ellie Ewing knew that <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of the}} same woman whom Jock had an affair with in Britain during the war, but they did not know at that time that <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> Jock's son.|$|R
5|$|Sharks and <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> basal {{fish with}} {{numerous}} primitive anatomical features {{similar to those}} of ancient fish, including skeletons composed of cartilage. Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set {{on the underside of the}} head. The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales. They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder. Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs. Some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the round ribbontail ray as Vulnerable. It cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure {{due to its}} low reproductive rate, and there is widespread degradation of its coral reef habitat, including from agricultural runoff and destructive fishing practices such as blast fishing. This species is caught by commercial and fisheries throughout its range, using line gear and trawls. One region where it is heavily pressured is in Indonesian waters, where it and other large <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle netters, longliners, and trawlers operating off Java, Bali, New Guinea, and Lombok. All landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a {{marbled electric ray}} can be severe but is not directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled electric ray as bycatch; captured <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data Deficient. In the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
50|$|The sons of Arcadia, Florida natives Louise and Clifford <b>Ray,</b> <b>were</b> {{the subject}} of a federal court battle against the DeSoto County School Board to allow the {{children}} to attend public school despite their diagnosis. Although the <b>Rays</b> <b>were</b> victorious in their legal battle, the <b>Ray</b> home <b>was</b> burned down a week after the 1987 decision, forcing the family to leave Arcadia.|$|R

50|$|Through his writing, King's son, Dexter King, took up {{the cause}} to prove <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> innocent. Dexter met with Ray on March 27, 1997, at the Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility, during which {{he said that he}} {{believed}} <b>Ray</b> <b>was</b> innocent.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. The rise {{in demand for}} shark products increases pressure on fisheries. Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual. A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{from the}} Japanese sleeper ray is strong but not {{life-threatening}} to humans. There is an observation of a ray that reacted to being touched {{with a camera}} by rubbing its back against the camera port, suggesting that it may actively defend itself if disturbed. The Japanese sleeper ray adapts poorly to captivity. This and other species of electric <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> used in biomedical research because their electric organs have an abundance of ion channels and acetylcholine receptors, and {{can serve as a}} model for the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the eagle ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it is found globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-{{spotted eagle ray}} (A. laticeps). Spotted eagle <b>rays</b> <b>are</b> most commonly seen alone, but occasionally swim in groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
