While the division was disbanded in September 1943, its 1st Armoured Brigade and other units was retained as the independent 1st Armoured Brigade Group. This brigade group unit remained part of III Corps in Western Australia until its disbandment in September 1944. The 4th Armoured Brigade, which was established in March 1943 and included several regiments which had previously formed part of the 1st Armoured Division, provided all the Australian armoured units which saw action from 1943 until the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Ado-Ekiti {{dispersal}} and relocation in late 1700 and after the return of Ewi and other settlers to their original abode in mid 1800, minor modifications in the settlement arrangement occurred in communities outside Ado city wall and in the open land available occupied by royal household and other settlers apart from areas taken over by larger chieftains after the dispersal of some Ado chieftains who resettled elsewhere when Ewi returned to Ado metropolis. Most communities which returned with the Ewi re-occupied their original quarters/ settlements to rebuild them except those who moved from their original settlements outside the Ado township walls into the main town {{in order to reduce}} the direct impact of attacks by invaders on them whenever hostilities broke out.

500|$|Having {{not wanted}} {{to play in the}} Conference South {{following}} Worcester's <b>re-allocation</b> into this division, Smith signed for Conference North club Tamworth on 28 May 2008. Gary Mills, the Tamworth manager, had previously tried to sign him for Notts County and Alfreton Town. He made his Tamworth debut in a 1–1 draw with Droylsden on 9 August 2008, before scoring his first goal in a 2–1 victory away to King's Lynn on 21 October after the ball fell to him from a corner kick in a crowded penalty area. An undiagnosed groin problem meant Smith missed Tamworth's match against Hinckley on 26 December 2008, although he returned for the following match, a 5–1 defeat away to Gateshead on 11 January 2009. He was forced into a late withdrawal from Tamworth's match against Burton Albion in the Birmingham Senior Cup on 13 January 2009 after his groin problem reappeared during the warm-up. His return to the team came on 24 January 2009 in a 2–1 victory away to Hyde, during which he conceded a penalty kick after fouling Chris Simm. Smith finished 2008–09 with Tamworth winning the Conference North title, thus earning promotion to the Conference Premier. He was named the club's Players' Player of the Season, having made 42 appearances and scored two goals in the process. Following the confirmation of Tamworth's title victory, he said: [...] "We deserved to win the league though – from day one really – and full credit to the lads because they have all been superb".

500|$|The assassins had {{achieved}} their priority in killing the king but the queen, although wounded, had escaped. [...] Importantly, the six-year-old king, now James II, had been safeguarded from Atholl's control by {{the removal of}} the earl's associate, John Spens, from his role as James's custodian. Spens vanished from the records following the regicide but the <b>re-allocation</b> of his positions and lands immediately following the murder indicate his part in the plot. [...] Yet, in the chaos following the murder, it appeared that the queen's attempt to position herself as regent was not guaranteed. [...] No surviving documentation exists that suggest that there was any general feeling of horror or condemnation aimed at the murderers. It was possible that had the botched attempt at killing the queen succeeded and had Atholl taken control of the young king then his attempted coup might have succeeded. The queen's small group of loyal supporters that included the Earl of Angus and William Crichton ensured her continued hold of James. [...] This in itself greatly reinforced her situation but Atholl still had followers. By the first week of March neither side seemed to have ascendancy and the Bishop of Urbino, the pope's envoy, called for the council to pursue a peaceful outcome. [...] Despite this by the middle of March it is probable that both Angus and Crichton had mobilised to move against Atholl.

The consumers we interviewed mostly adopt problem-centered strategies: they change their food-consumption habits including shopping, purchasing, cooking, storing and obviously, eating.

40|$|Modern {{literature}} {{departs from}} time-separable constant relative risk aversion preferences to explain asset pricing facts. This deviation typically implies that wealth shocks generate transitory variations in agents’ relative risk aversion and, possibly, portfolio <b>re-allocations</b> over time. I empirically analyze this relationship using U. S. macroeconomic data and and evidence for time-variation in portfolio shares {{that is consistent}} with counter-cyclical risk aversion. These results suggest, therefore, that wealth-dependent, habit-formation or loss and disappointment aversion utility functions are a good description of preferences. Controlling for observed versus expected asset returns, I also show that: (i) wealth effects are significant (although temporary) and {{there is no evidence of}} inertia contrary to Brunnermeier and Nagel (2006); and (ii) the consumption-wealth ratio (Lettau and Ludvigson, 2001), the labor income risk (Julliard, 2004) and the labor income-consumption ratio (Santos and Veronesi, 2006) partially explain changes in the risky asset share.

40|$|As {{many other}} South African basins, the Olifants River basin is {{becoming}} more and more water stressed. One crucial goal of the recent water legislation is to achieve an equitable sharing of scarce water between users by introducing basin management and new water rights. But it is unlikely that available water resources in the basin will meet water allocations to new users, in particular emerging and small-scale farmers who have had and still have poor access to adequate water. The key issue to address is whether there are ways to increase water availability to these small farmers. The main hypothesis presented in this paper is that there are opportunities to re-allocate water from already acknowledged users to small-scale agriculture by increasing productivity of water. Using water accounting techniques and performance analysis, it is proposed to evaluate where and how much water can be saved and then investigate the technical and institutional paths towards water <b>re-allocations</b> in a sustainable way...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{implementation}} of a multi-robot cooperation framework to collectively execute inter-dependent tasks of an overall complex mission requiring diverse capabilities. Given a heterogeneous team of robots and task dependencies, the proposed framework provides a distributed mechanism for assigning tasks to robots in an order that efficiently completes the mission. The approach is robust to unreliable communication and robot failures. It is a distributed auction-based approach, and therefore scalable. In order to obtain optimal allocations, effective bid evaluations are needed. Additionally to maintain optimality in noisy environments, dynamic <b>re-allocations</b> of tasks are needed as implemented in dynamic task selection and coalition maintenance scheme that we propose. Real-time contingencies are handled by recovery routines, called Plan B precautions in our framework. Here, in this paper, we present performance results of our framework for robustness in simulations that include variable message loss rates and robot failures. Experiments illustrate robustness of our approach against several contingencies. ...|$|R

40|$|Growing water {{scarcity}} and increasing demands {{for agricultural products}} generate much debate about improving the agricultural sector's water use efficiency and productivity. Agricultural engineering traditions feed this debate with notions such as agricultural yield gaps and low water use efficiencies that draw attention to potential improvements. However, when perspectives are shifted from an irrigated field to a river basin, someone's (water) loss may be another's (water) gain. Such shifts in perspectives complicate the applications of our concepts of irrigation efficiency (IE), water use efficiency (WUE) and water productivity (WP). This paper studies the use and abuse of definitions and applications of concepts of IE, WUE and WP and examines their appropriate application for different scales and domains of water use. In this paper we argue that water management decisions are best informed by using IE and WP at the irrigation scheme and catchment level, respectively.
