40|$|The German {{open-ended}} {{real estate}} fund industry was strongly hit by massive out flows {{in the course of}} the global financial crisis. In total, 18 public and institutional {{real estate fund}}s had to stop the <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> and were ultimately forced to liquidate their portfolios. Investors of these funds either have to await the stepwise liquidation of the funds' assets, which can take up to several years, or they can opt to sell their shares on the secondary market, often at a substantial discount to the Net Asset Value (NAV Spread). This paper attempts to explain the NAV Spread of distressed German public open-ended real estate funds. The unique monthly dataset contains fund specifics and macroeconomic indicators for the entire relevant period. Fundamentals like the leverage ratio and the liquidity ratio as well as industry-wide spillover effects from fund closures affect the NAV Spread. Moreover, we detect a considerably influence of macroeconomic uncertainty explaining the discount to NAV...|$|E

3000|$|In the {{framework}} of the neoclassical financial theories; the relaxation of simplifying assumptions of Modigliani and Miller (1958) has resulted in the development of financial theories say compromise. In fact, taking into account the taxation and the costs of bankruptcy suggest the existence of an optimal ratio of debt. This theoretical current is known under the name of the theory of compromise or “The static trade-off Theory”. The second theoretical framework that helped to explain the financial behavior of firms is manifested in the theory of the hierarchical funding or “Pecking-Order-Theory” (pot). This current research initiated by Myers and Majluf (1984), consists of establishing a ranking between the funding. For example, favoring self-financing is put in the second row of the debt and is chosen as a last resort to the issuance of shares. The basic assumption that guides the financial reasoning of this theory is that of informational asymmetry. Recently, we are witnessing an emergence of a new theoretical framework initiated by the work of Becker and Wurgler (2002), known under the acronym of [...] "Market timing Theory of Capital Structure". According to the theory of market timing, firms issue shares when the courses are high and repurchase it when the courses are in decline. Distinguished by “market timing” or [...] "operation of arbitration on the net asset value"; the benefit is derived from a variance of courses. A simple concept is deducted 1; It is that the financial structure of a company is the result, not of an intelligent choice of a debt/equity capital target, but of the accumulation of decisions taken in the past in function of the financial context of the moment: issuance of shares when the valuations are high and the context awardees is good, issuance of debts and <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> when the values are low and the Fellowship is pressed (Oztekin and Flannery 2012).|$|E

The advantages of paper currency were numerous: it reduced transport of gold and silver, and thus lowered the risks; it made loaning gold or silver at interest easier, since the specie (gold or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed for a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms.

By using a data assembled from 1672 retail funds in Germany over the period March 2008 to April 2010, we are able to show that in general, both the prior fund performance and prior net redemptions have a statistically significant influence on fund outflows. Moreover, there are indications that in recent crises situations that have resulted in the withdrawal <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> investors react fast to market signals.

Our results indicate that the ETFs in China, on average, provide a slightly better return than their corresponding benchmarks when costs are not taken into consideration. Moreover, we found the ETFs in China are traded at a discount more than 55 % of the time which contradicts to the findings in other developed countries. On average, ETFs in China tracks their benchmark very closely inferring the efficiency in the creation and <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> ETF <b>shares.</b> We further examined the factors that affect the tracking error and, somehow, discovered contradicting results from our regression analysis.

40|$|Since 2008, the German {{open-ended}} {{real estate}} fund (GOEREF) industry has experienced a critical phase <b>of</b> suspensions <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> fund <b>shares,</b> announced fund terminations and, eventually, introduction of a new regulation. With assets under management of over EUR 80 billion, GOEREFs are the dominant indirect real estate investment vehicle in Germany.

Both net asset values (NAVs) and potential secondary market prices <b>of</b> the <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> funds with suspended redemptions are used. The resulting total return patterns are analysed on an index basis for fund groups that best represent the most important investor groups for GOEREFs. Groups that comprised a higher number of funds with suspended redemptions were considerably worse off and less attractive in an asset allocation context than the others given the often much lower secondary market prices. However, changes in return and risk must also be considered in terms of NAVs. The fund group comprising co-operative savings banks' funds was virtually unaffected by the liquidity crisis and continued to be deliver stable and non-volatile returns, while the other fund groups exhibited a clear shift in their respective return profiles...|$|R

The Fund’s Board of Directors considered several factors in determining to suspend <b>redemptions</b> and sales <b>of</b> <b>Shares,</b> including forecasted exit opportunities, redemption demand {{and the need to}} preserve investment and operating capital, and the long term impact of the federal government’s announcement in 2013 to phase out the 15 % federal labour-sponsored venture capital corporation tax credit on future capital raising. The Board of Directors determined that, at this time, it is {{in the best interests of}} its shareholders to preserve capital for key follow-on investments and operating commitments and therefore decided to suspend redemptions. Atlantic Fund continues to work towards maximizing the value of its holdings and focusing on realizing exit opportunities in its venture portfolio to ease increased liquidity pressures.

This article provides an overview of the key economic issues and considers the relative merits of alternative solutions to the mutual fund timing problem. In principle, the timing problem could be fully resolved by either removing predictability from NAVs (i. e., fair value pricing) or imposing barriers to its exploitation (i. e., <b>redemption</b> fees). Because <b>of</b> the practical limitations of removing predictability and the cost of imposing barriers, the most effective and efficient solution involves a balanced and modest attack on each front.

Tutkimusmenetelmä on kvalitatiivinen. Tutkielman empiirinen osuus toteutettiin haastattelututkimuksena ja sitä varten haastateltiin yhtiöoikeuden asiantuntijaa, tilintarkastajaa sekä hallituksen jäsenenä toimivaa henkilöä. Haastattelututkimuksen tulokset puretaan tutkielman teoreettisen osuuden kanssa rinnakkain. Tutkielman tulosten mukaan voidaan todeta vastuiden realisoitumisen riskin riippuvan useimmiten siitä, mikä on varojenjakoon käytetty varojen lähde. Lisäksi voidaan tulosten mukaan todeta, että vastuiden realisoitumisriski ei ole merkittävä varojenjakotilanteissa. Vastuuasioita tulee kuitenkin aina pohtia tapauskohtaisesti.
