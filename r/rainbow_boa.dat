25|$|Boa constrictors are ovoviviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. They {{generally}} breed in the dry season—between April and August—and are polygynous, thus males may mate with multiple females. Half of all females breed in a given year, and {{a larger percentage of}} males actively attempt to locate a mate. Due to their polygynous nature, many of these males will be unsuccessful. As such, female boas in inadequate physical condition are unlikely to attempt to mate, or to produce viable young if they do mate. Reproduction in boas is almost exclusively sexual. Males ordinarily have a ZZ pair of sex determining chromosomes, and females a ZW pair. In 2010, a boa constrictor was shown to have reproduced asexually via parthenogenesis. The Colombian <b>Rainbow</b> <b>boa,</b> Epicrates maurus was found to reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis resulting in production of WW female progeny. The WW females were likely produced by terminal automixis (see Figure), a type of parthenogenesis in which two terminal haploid products of meiosis fuse to form a zygote, which then develops into a daughter progeny. This is only the third genetically confirmed case of consecutive virgin births of viable offspring from a single female within any vertebrate lineage.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rainbow</b> <b>boas,</b> {{like all}} boas in the Boidae family, are non-venomous snakes that subdue their prey with constriction. Like most Boids, they have special {{heat-sensing}} pits {{on their faces}} {{that allow them to}} detect the body heat of their warm-blooded prey. While nocturnal, they may bask during the day when night-time temperatures are low. They are active at dawn and dusk and feed on small mammals, birds and lizards using their heat-sensing abilities to hunt in the low light. Most <b>rainbow</b> <b>boas</b> will never need a prey item larger than a large rat, as with most snakes, <b>rainbow</b> <b>boas</b> can expand their jaw to allow the consuming of items larger than the jaw would normally open (see snake skull). Wild <b>rainbow</b> <b>boas</b> may bite when they feel threatened, as a defense. This bite can be painful, but is not dangerous. Care must still be taken against infection. Like all snakes, when in a shed cycle they will be more unpredictable and irritable due to the added stress of shedding and clouded sight.|$|R

The young are able to develop in a thermo-regulated, protected environment and they are provided with nutrients. Young are born fully developed and independent within minutes of birth.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlthough most {{analyses}} of sexual dimorphism focus on overall body size (sexual size dimorphism), {{males and females}} {{of the same species}} may differ profoundly in their morphology, performance and behaviour even if the two sexes attain similar adult sizes. Thus, similarity in size may mask major sex-based divergences in traits such as musculature and fat stores. Although female Colombian <b>rainbow</b> <b>boas</b> Epicrates cenchria maurus are slightly longer than males, we show that males are more muscular than females and, accordingly, males outperform same-sized females in tests of strength. Musculature may enhance success in male–male combat. The two sexes also differ in body shape: the wider abdomens of females may allow more space to store fat and/or embryos. Lastly, male boas reacted more overtly to handling (via defecation and striking) than did females. These sex differences in morphology, performance and behaviour plausibly reflect ecological differences between the sexes in the wild, with males under sexual selection for increased physical strength and females under fecundity selection for enhanced reproductive output...|$|R

50|$|Size and weight- The Colombian <b>rainbow</b> <b>boa</b> is the {{smallest}} of the rainbow boas, reaching lengths of, 3 to 5 feet on average. There is clear sexual dimorphism between male and female, with females being significantly larger, in both length and girth.Coloring- Generally uniform brown in color with large dark edged vertebral rings, with light centers forming saddles, this may also appear as a slightly off-center 'S' pattern. Through a process of metachrosis, they have a day-to-night color change. Primarily noticed in that their pattern will become a lighter almost silver and have a molted silver sides and bottom. Although individuals of abnormal colors and patterns exist, for example those that exhibit pigmentation disorders such as albinism, they are very rare in the wild, but are often found in captivity where these mutations are often prized.|$|E

50|$|Included {{among the}} country's snake fauna {{are some of}} the very {{smallest}} in the world (the fossorial thread snakes in the genus Epictia and other blind snakes), to the very largest of snakes in the world (the green anaconda). Anacondas (locally called the huille) have been historically found around streams, rivers and swamps in southern and eastern Trinidad, and recently also in the Caroni River drainage system. They have not been reported from Tobago. Three other boas, namely Boa constrictor (locally called the macajuel), Corallus ruschenbergerii (a tree boa locally called the cascabel dormilon) and Epicrates maurus (a <b>rainbow</b> <b>boa)</b> are found in forest and forest edge habitats throughout both islands (with the last even being common in some urban areas). Several harmless snakes in the subfamilies Colubrinae and Dipsadinae are found throughout the islands. Some of the larger examples of the diurnal Colubrinae include Spilotes pullatus (locally called the tigre in Trinidad and the black snake in Tobago) found in forest and forest edge habitats, and the rarer more forest dwelling Drymarchon corais (or yellow-tailed cribo) can be found on both islands. Smaller well known members of the subfamily include the machete couesse (Mastigodryas boddaerti on Trinidad, and Mastigodryas dunni endemic to Tobago) and the horsewhip (Oxybelis aeneus) and are common in forest and forest edge habitats, even in some suburban areas of both islands. Among the Colubrinae, the loras Leptophis stimsoni and Leptophis haileyi are endemics to Trinidad's Northern Range and Tobago's Main Ridge respectively. Many {{of the members of the}} subfamily Dipsadinae are typically nocturnal and some of the more commonly observed species present even in suburban areas on both islands are the false mapipire (Leptodeira annulata ashmeadi) and the slug-eating snake (Sibon nebulata). Other interesting Dipsadinae include the water mapipire (Helicops angulatus) a habitat specialist of freshwater and brackish water systems of lowland Trinidad, the mainly diurnal beh belle chemin (Erythrolamprus melanotus nesos) of forest and edge habitats on both islands and the rare crepuscular red snake (Erythrolamprus ocellatus) endemic to the forest and edge habitats of northeastern Tobago. There are no dangerous venomous snakes on Tobago. There are only four dangerous venomous snakes on Trinidad. These include two vipers, and two coral snakes. The vipers (the true mapipires) are the mapipire balsain (Bothrops cf. atrox) and the mapipire zanana (Lachesis muta muta). The former is fairly common in primary and secondary forested areas of Trinidad (particularly so in the Northern Range), and the later is a very rarely encountered primary rainforest specialist in Trinidad. The two coral snakes are the small coral snake (Micrurus circinalis, and the large coral snake (Micrurus lemniscatus diutius), both associated with forested areas, and the later sometimes being associated with swampy habitats in Trinidad.|$|E

40|$|Until recently, facultative automictic {{parthenogenesis}} {{within the}} squamate reptiles exhibiting ZZ:ZW genetic sex determination {{has resulted in}} single reproductive events producing male (ZZ) or female (ZW) offspring.
