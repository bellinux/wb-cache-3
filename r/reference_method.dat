25|$|The 1980s saw {{several new}} {{technologies}} that promised {{to change the}} way creatinine testing was done. Enzymatic and ion-exchange methods provided better accuracy but had other drawbacks. Enzymatic methods reduced some interferences but other new ones were discovered. High-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC, was more sensitive and specific, and had become the new <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> endorsed by the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. HPLC addressed the shortcomings of Jaffe-based methods, but was labor-intensive, expensive, and therefore impractical for routine analysis of the most frequently ordered renal analyte in medical labs. Simple, easily automated and cost-effective, Jaffe-based methods have persisted into the 21st century, despite their imperfections.|$|E
25|$|Before Jaffe, Neubauer {{described}} a similar precipitation reaction by mixing creatinine with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and performing a Weyl's test—the addition of SNP to NaOH and then incubating with acetic acid (CH3CO2H) {{to develop a}} color change. Until Folin developed Jaffe's reaction into a clinical procedure, Neubauer's method was how creatinine was measured. As Folin's method evolved, various techniques were implemented to remove Jaffe-reacting substances, mostly protein, from the sample and increase specificity. By the 1950s, precipitated aluminum silicate, called Lloyd's reagent, was being used to remove protein from serum, further improving accuracy. Fuller's earth was also used for protein-binding, but the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> until the 1980s was adsorption with Lloyd's reagent. New concerns arose due to non-standardization of procedures; different labs were reading results at different endpoints. This problem was resolved {{with the advent of}} automated analyzers in the 1960s and 1970s, which introduced a kinetic reading of results rather than a specific endpoint. Kinetic Jaffe methods involve mixing serum with alkaline picrate and reading the rate of change in absorption spectrophotometrically at 520nm. This not only standardized the procedure, but also removed the need for sample deproteinization. It also introduced two new problems—analyzers used an algorithmic compensation to correct for pseudochromogens, and calibrations were not yet standardized between instruments.|$|E

No <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for the analysis of gallstones have been described. A literature search for manageable quantitative methods for these analyses was not successful. Among the different X-ray diffraction, infrared and chemical analyses described, we could find no well documented analyses that have been compared with <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> or proposed <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for serum.

Is bioimpedance with Impedimed SFB 7 {{consistent}} with <b>reference</b> <b>methods?</b> Author: Jakob Nilsson Supervisor: Lars Ellegård, Associate Professor, Senior Consultant Degree project, Programme in Medicine, 2016, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Background: Malnutrition and fluid imbalance are common among hospitalized patients. Bioimpedance is a manageable and inexpensive method to estimate Total Body Skeletal Muscle Mass (TBSMM), Fat Mass (FM), Total Body Water (TBW), Extracellular Water (ECW) and Intracellular Water (ICW). However, further validations against <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> are required before introducing it to everyday use in clinical practise. Aim: To validate SFB 7 bioimpedance device’s ability to measure TBSMM, FM, TBW, ECW and ICW against <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> in healthy subjects. Methods: 50 healthy adults (men, n= 25; women, n= 25) were measured with SFB 7 and reference methods: Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), Air Displacement Plethysmography (ADP), Dilution Techniques and Total Body Potassium (TBK). Paired-Samples T-Test, linear regression and Bland Altman plots {{were used to}} compare SFB 7 estimates for TBSMM, FM, TBW, ECW and ICW with <b>reference</b> <b>methods.</b> Results: The correlations between estimates by SFB 7 and <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> in men were high for TBSMM (rP= 0. 914) and ECW (rP= 0. 931), however significant differences in mean and systematic bias were found in both variables. The correlations between SFB 7 and <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for FM, TBW and ICW were not impressive. The correlations between estimates by SFB 7 and <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> in women were high for FM (rPDXA= 0. 898, rPADP= 0. 890) and ECW (rP= 0. 907). SFB 7 underestimated FM and overestimated ECW significantly. The correlations between estimates by SFB 7 and <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for TBSMM, TBW and ICW were not impressive. Conclusions: Bioimpedance by Impedimed SFB 7 by proprietary software and equations does not correctly predict TBSMM, FM, TBW, ECW and ICW in healthy men and women...|$|R

To perform the validation, the results of {{the complete}} workflow were compared, according to the ISO 16140 : 2003, with the ISO <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for detection, isolation and confirmation of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. The results showed that the relative level of detection and the limit of detection of the complete workflow and ISO <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> are in a range from 2 to 16 CFU/swab for both bacteria. The relative specificity, sensitivity and accuracy identified during this validation were all 100 % since the results obtained with the complete CoSYPS Path Food workflow and the ISO <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> were identical (Cohen's kappa index= 1. 00).

A second study evaluated the Phoenix SMIC/ID-2 panel using the API 20 Strep system as a comparator method (resolving discrepant results via 16S rRNA gene sequencing and amplification and sequencing of housekeeping genes) (5). For the VGS, 31 isolates were assayed, with only 53% concordance between the Phoenix and reference methods for S. mitis group organisms, 100% concordance for the S. anginosus group, and 75% concordance for S. sanguinis group organisms (5).|$|E
