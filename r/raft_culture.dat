When {{cells from}} normal human {{epidermis}} {{and from the}} human squamous cell carcinoma line SCC- 13 were seeded on floating rafts of collagen and fibroblasts, they stratified and underwent terminal differentiation. Although the program of differentiation in SCC- 13 cells was morphologically abnormal, the cultures resembled normal epidermal <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> by expressing the terminal differentiation-specific keratins, K 1 /K 10, and by restricting their proliferative capacity to the basal-like cells of the population. In addition, the differentiating cells of both normal and SCC- 13 <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> expressed keratins K 6 and K 16, which are not normally expressed in epidermis, but are synthesized suprabasally during wound-healing and in various epidermal diseases associated with hyperproliferation...|$|R
40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{gene expression}} in squamous epithelia is differentiation dependent in benign patient lesions and in organotypic <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> of primary human keratinocytes (PHKs). Using the lacZ reporter in <b>raft</b> <b>cultures,</b> we previously showed that this transcriptional {{regulation of the}} HPV type 11 (HPV- 11) enhancer-promoter located in the upstream regulatory region (URR) appears to have resulted from coordination between the transcription transactivators AP 1, Oct 1, and Sp 1 in differentiated upper strata and the repressor C/EBP in proliferating basal cells. We report here that trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, dramatically stimulated reporter gene activity from the wild-type HPV- 11 URR or the C/EBP mutation in PHKs grown in undifferentiated submerged <b>cultures.</b> In epithelial <b>raft</b> <b>cultures,</b> up-regulation occurred predominantly in basal and parabasal strata; this effect was promoter specific, as expression of the lacZ reporter gene driven by the murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR), the keratin 14 promoter, or the involucrin promoter was not altered, nor was expression of endogenous keratin 10 and profilaggrin affected.

40|$|Expression of {{the human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) capsid genes, L 1 and L 2, as well as amplification of viral DNA and virion assembly occur in the terminally differentiated layers of infected stratified squamous epithelium in vivo. These processes can be duplicated in the laboratory {{through the use of}} organotypic or <b>raft</b> <b>cultures.</b> When CIN 612 cells, which contain episomal copies of the high-risk HPV type 31 b, are allowed to differentiate in <b>raft</b> <b>cultures,</b> the expression of transcripts encoding the early genes E 1 [...] E 4 and E 5 is induced. These transcripts are initiated at the differentiation-dependent P 742 promoter located {{in the middle of the}} E 7 open reading frame. Exposure of <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> to activators of protein kinase C, such as phorbol esters, results in the further induction of late gene expression as well as virion assembly. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism by which activators of protein kinase C induce late gene expression. The major L 1 transcript was found to be encoded by a bicistronic E 1 [...] E 4, L 1 RNA which initiated at the differentiation-dependent promoter P 742. Additional low-level expression of L 1 -containing RNAs was also observed from the early-region promoter, P 97. The major L 2 transcripts were found to be encoded by E 1 [...] E 4, E 5, L 2, L 1 RNAs which were also initiated in the early region, probably at the differentiation-specific promoter P 742. While early and late RNAs were found to be expressed from the same promoter, they differed in utilization of splicing and polyadenylation sites. <b>Raft</b> <b>cultures</b> treated with activators of protein kinase C induced expression of late genes, but no change in the abundance of early RNAs initiated at the P 742 promoter was observed. Thus, the increase in late gene expression was likely due to changes in RNA processing or stabilization rather than an increase in the rate of transcription from P 742. Regulation of HPV late gene expression therefore occurs at two levels: differentiation-dependent induction of the P 742 promoter, which can be mimicked in vitro by growth in <b>raft</b> <b>cultures,</b> and posttranscriptional changes that can be induced by activation of protein kinase C. These posttranscriptional changes may occur through inactivation or down-regulation of splicing factors which inhibit use of the late region polyadenylation site, resulting in increased stability of late region transcripts...|$|R

The stimulation with IL- 2 +anti-CD 3 mAb induced the highest number of infiltrating cells, with the maximum lymphocyte infiltration observed after 24 h of co-culture. The lymphocyte infiltration was associated with an increased number of apoptotic cells in the organotypic cultures. The ability of PBMC and purified T cell and NK cell populations to lyse HPV-transformed keratinocytes was also investigated on monolayer cultures. As expected in an allogenic model, the highest cytotoxicity was mediated by NK cells activated by IL- 2 or IL- 2 +anti-CD 3 mAb. The cytotoxic activity of T cells was weak but, interestingly, increased in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin A (PHA), assuming that T cells were able to kill HPV-infected keratinocytes when a bridge between T cells and keratinocytes was provided.

To investigate the effects of TGF alpha on a differentiating stratified squamous epithelium and to begin to examine the molecular basis mediating this influence, we cultured human epidermal cells on a gelled lattice of collagen and fibroblasts, floating on the air-liquid interface. Under these conditions, <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> differentiate and exhibit morphological and biochemical features of human skin in vivo (Asselineau et al., 1986; Kopan et al., 1987). When 3 -wk-old <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> were treated with TGF alpha, basal cells showed a marked increase in cell proliferation. At elevated concentrations of TGF alpha, the organization of cells within the artificial tissue changed and islands of basal cells entered the collagen matrix. Biochemical analysis of the response revealed that type I collagenase and gelatinase were induced by keratinocytes within 12 h after TGF alpha treatment. In contrast, invasion of basal cells into the collagen matrix was not significant until 48 - 72 h post-treatment, suggesting that collagenase and gelatinase production may be a prerequisite to this phenomenon. These results have important implications for the possible role of TGF alpha in squamous cell carcinoma and tumor invasion...|$|R

We previously identified sequence {{elements in the}} enhancer-promoter regions of HPV types 18 and 11 important for this promoter regulation by using the bacterial LacZ reporter gene in stratified <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> of primary human keratinocytes (PHKs) or in submerged, proliferating cultures acutely transduced with recombinant retroviruses. Notably, mutations in the promoter-proximal Sp 1, Oct 1, and AP 1 sites each significantly reduce reporter activity in differentiated cells, indicating that the bound factors are transcription transactivators. In the present study, we performed further mutagenesis on distal motifs in the HPV- 11 regulatory region in PHKs in submerged and <b>raft</b> <b>cultures.</b> Mutations in an AP 2 -like site, three individual NF- 1 sites, or five NF- 1 sites collectively reduced promoter activity slightly in differentiated cells. A mutation in a putative glucocorticoid response element had no discernable effect in the presence or the absence of dexamethasone. However, mutations in a C/EBP binding site, especially the distal site, strikingly up-regulated reporter gene expression, particularly in basal and lower spinous cells, implicating bound protein as a transcription repressor. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the overall differentiation-dependent papillomaviral gene expression observedin vivoandin vitroinvolves promoter repression in the lower strata and activation in the upper, differentiated strata...|$|R
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus LMP 2 A protein was {{expressed}} in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, and effects on epithelial cell growth were detected in organotypic <b>raft</b> <b>cultures</b> and in vivo in nude mice. <b>Raft</b> <b>cultures</b> derived from LMP 2 A-expressing cells were hyperproliferative, and epithelial differentiation was inhibited. The LMP 2 A-expressing HaCaT cells were able to grow anchorage independently and formed colonies in soft agar. HaCaT cells expressing LMP 2 A were highly tumorigenic and formed aggressive tumors in nude mice. The LMP 2 A tumors were poorly differentiated and highly proliferative, in contrast to occasional tumors that arose from parental HaCaT cells and vector control cells, which grew slowly and remained highly differentiated. Animals injected with LMP 2 A-expressing cells developed frequent metastases, which predominantly involved lymphoid organs. Involucrin, a marker of epithelial differentiation, and E-cadherin, involved in the maintenance of intercellular contact, were downregulated in LMP 2 A tumors. Whereas activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was not observed, phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) -dependent activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt was detected in LMP 2 A-expressing cells and LMP 2 A tumors. Inhibition of this pathway blocked growth in soft agar. These data indicate that LMP 2 A greatly affects cell growth and differentiation pathways in epithelial cells, in part through activation of the PI 3 -kinase–Akt pathway...|$|R
