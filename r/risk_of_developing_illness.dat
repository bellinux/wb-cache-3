5000|$|Chronic {{stress is}} a term {{sometimes}} used to differentiate between acute stress. Definitions differ, and may be {{along the lines of}} continual activation of the stress response, stress that causes an allostatic shift in bodily functions, or just as [...] "prolonged stress". For example, results of one study demonstrated that individuals who reported relationship conflict lasting one month or longer have a greater <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> <b>illness</b> and show slower wound healing. Similarly, the effects that acute stressors have on the immune system may be increased when there is perceived stress and/or anxiety due to other events. For example, students who are taking exams show weaker immune responses if they also report stress due to daily hassles. While responses to acute stressors typically do not impose a health burden on young, healthy individuals, chronic stress in older or unhealthy individuals may have long-term effects that are detrimental to health.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the world}} has progressed {{in the area of}} water and sanitation, more than 2. 3 bil-lion people still live without access to sanita-tion {{facilities}} and some are unable to practice basic hygiene. Access to water and basic sani-tation has deteriorated in Chitungwiza and children are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> <b>illness</b> and missing school due to the deterioration. We sought to investigate the predisposing, enabling and reinforcing factors that are causally related to water- and sanitation- relat-ed hygiene practices among school going chil-dren. A random sample of 400 primary school children (196 males, 204 females) in four schools in Chitungwiza town, Zimbabwe was interviewed. Behavioural factors were assessed through cross examination of the PROCEED PRECEDE Model. The respondents had been stratified through the random sam-pling where strata were classes. A structured observation checklist was also administered to assess hygiene enabling facilities for each school. Children’s knowledge and perceptions were inconsistent with hygienic behaviour. The family institution seemed to play a more important role in life skills training and posi-tive reinforcement compared to the school (50 % vs 27. 3 %). There was no association between a child’s sex, age and parents ’ occupa-tion with any of the factors assessed (P= 0. 646). Schools did not provide a hygiene enabling environment as there were no learn-ing materials, policy and resources on hygiene and health. The challenges lay in the provision of hygiene enabling facilities, particularly, the lack of access to sanitation for the maturing girl child and a school curriculum that provides positive reinforcement and practical life skills training approach...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{worsening}} {{health the}} chronically ill oldest older persons have expressed feelings of inner strength, {{which can be}} understood as resilience. The objective was to describe and compare the characteristics of resilience in two different age groups of chronically ill oldest older persons living at home and who n eeded help from home nursing care. Design: Cross-sectional design was used to describe and comp are the resilience qualities between the two age groups. Methods: The inclusion criteria were 80 years or older, living at home with chronic disease, receiving help from home nursing care, and with the capacity to be interviewed. A sample of 120 oldest older women (n = 79) and men (n = 41) separated in two age groups, aged 80 - 89 and 90 + years, participated in the study. Resilience characteristics were measured by Resilience Scale. Results: The whole group of oldest older people was vulnerable in relation to the characteristics of perseverance, self-reliance, and existential aloneness. Despite reduced physical health they reported a meaningful life, and equ animity. Even if {{there were no significant differences}} between the age groups among the oldest older persons in the characteristics of Resilience Scale (RS), in the characteristic of meaning there was a tendency of interaction between age and how much help from home nursing care the participants received. Conclusions: It is important to focus on the individual aging and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> <b>illness</b> and disabilities rather than focusing on chronologic age. Possessing meaning in life and equanimity may be strengths to meet challenges through illness and growing older. </p...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the role}} of {{psychological}} attitudes in health behaviors and health care utilization {{has important implications for}} improving health and reducing health care costs. This is particularly important among the elderly, who require more and costlier health services. This dissertation explores the relationship between optimism (positive future expectation) and cynical hostility (mistrust of others) on smoking cessation, physical activity, and preventive service use in post-menopausal women. Chapter one assesses the relationship between optimism and cynical hostility on smoking cessation. Women with higher cynical hostility were less likely to quit smoking over time. Smoking cessation programs may consider incorporating attitudes measures to better target smokers who are less likely to quit on their own. Chapter two focuses on understanding {{the role of}} optimism and cynical hostility in use of screening mammograms and lipid screenings and in particular how these attitudes mediate or moderate the established relationships with race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Optimism predicts screening mammograms for some, but not all, racial/ethnic groups even when adjusting for various demographic, social, and health factors. Incorporating psychological factors such as optimism scores into health risk modeling may prove useful especially among specific racial and ethnic minority groups. Chapter three investigates the link between optimism and cynical hostility on strenuous physical activity. Women with higher optimism report higher levels of strenuous physical activity across the lifespan. Modeling reveals that much of this relationship is explained by other variables such as demographics and health status. Higher cynical hostility is associated with increased post-menopausal strenuous physical activity only in fully corrected models. This attitude may therefore play a particularly important role in activity levels depending on {{the presence or absence of}} barriers to physical activity. The public health relevance of this dissertation rests in identifying individuals at higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>developing</b> <b>illness</b> burden due to health behaviors such as smoking and physical activity and potential under-use of preventive health services. Understanding how attitudes influence these behaviors may pave the way for physicians and health systems to employ novel approaches to improve health-related quality of life and ultimately reduce costs by reducing disease burden...|$|E

Some studies suggest that a link exists between smoking and mental illness, citing the high incidence of smoking amongst those suffering from schizophrenia and the possibility that smoking may alleviate some of the symptoms of mental illness, but these have not been conclusive.
