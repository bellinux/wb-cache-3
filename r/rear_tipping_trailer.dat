500|$|The dorsal and {{pectoral}} fins are {{distinctive and}} help to distinguish the silky shark from similar species. The first dorsal fin is relatively small, measuring less than a tenth {{as high as the}} shark is long, and originates behind the free <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> of the pectoral fins. It has a rounded apex, an [...] "S"-shaped rear margin, and a free <b>rear</b> <b>tip</b> about half as long as the fin is tall. The second dorsal fin is tiny, smaller than the anal fin, with a drawn-out free <b>rear</b> <b>tip</b> up to three times as long as the fin is tall. A narrow dorsal ridge runs between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are narrow and sickle-shaped, and particularly long in adults. The anal fin originates slightly ahead of the second dorsal fin and has a deep notch in the posterior margin. The caudal fin is fairly high with a well-developed lower lobe.|$|R

50|$|The smallfin gulper has no anal fin, two dorsal fins with spines, long free <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> on {{pectoral}} fins, and {{a deeply}} notched caudal fin. Its maximum length is 98 cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{little gulper}} shark has no anal fin, two dorsal fins with spines, {{slightly}} humped back before the first dorsal fin, darker areas of coloration above gills and on dorsal fins, long free <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> on pectoral fins, and a notched caudal fin.|$|R
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free <b>rear</b> <b>tip,</b> and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free <b>rear</b> <b>tip,</b> and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer,</b> from a company’s demands andrequests to complete manufacturing documentation. The design is developed for thecompany Abexor AB in Östersund that produces <b>tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> The product issupposed to be used by Abexors customer to transport cargos of different kinds,such as gravel, stone, dirt, etc. The work commenced with a meeting at the company where demands were set. After that a pre-study was conducted to find out what traffic rules were required forthe trailer to be allowed to be driven on roads. Similar products were examined tosee how the trailer could be designed. The pre-study was followed by an idea andconcept generation. Nine different concepts were generated and the best werechosen for continued work. The concepts that were chosen resulted in a design in CAD were considerationswere taken for dimensions, traffic rules and function. Manufacturing documentationand a list of components to be bought were generated. In the section discussion and conclusions you can see what the thesis has resulted in. It’s also described what could have been done different and guidelines for futuredevelopment have been made...|$|R

5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin <b>rear</b> <b>tips.</b> The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|R
50|$|The two dorsal fins bear long spines {{and have}} {{narrowly}} rounded apexes, concave posterior margins, and short free <b>rear</b> <b>tips.</b> The first dorsal fin originates above the pectoral fin insertions; {{the second is}} smaller than the first and originates behind the pelvic fins. The pectoral fins are medium-sized with rounded tips, the pelvic fins are small, {{and there is no}} anal fin. There are lateral keels on the caudal peduncle. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a long upper lobe and a well-developed lower lobe; the trailing margins of both lobes are convex. The skin is covered by tiny, non-overlapping dermal denticles. Unlike other Squalus species, adults have a mix of one-cusped and three-cusped denticles. This species is dark brown above, darkening towards the apexes of the dorsal fins, and pale below. The dorsal fin free <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> and the caudal fin posterior margin are white. The largest known specimen measures 90 cm in length.|$|R
50|$|Adults are 12 to 22 mm long. The pronotum is {{primarily}} a pale yellow with a black spot in the center. In the southern portion of the range, the elytra are entirely black while in the northern portion they have a yellow <b>rear</b> <b>tip.</b> The elytra are shorter than {{the body of the}} beetle, leaving the tail end slightly exposed. The larvae are black and appear armored.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, Dr. Sighard F. Hoerner was {{a pioneer}} {{researcher}} in the field, having written a technical paper published in 1952 that called for drooped wingtips whose pointed <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> focused the resulting wingtip vortex away from the upper wing surface. Drooped wingtips are often called [...] "Hoerner tips" [...] in his honor. Gliders and light aircraft have made use of Hoerner tips for many years.|$|R
500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} short and pointed, with a falcate (sickle-like) shape. The first dorsal fin is medium-sized and triangular, and originates roughly over the pectoral fin free <b>rear</b> <b>tips.</b> The second dorsal fin {{is small and}} low, and originates over {{the middle of the}} anal fin base. Both dorsal fins have very long free <b>rear</b> <b>tips,</b> and there is a subtle midline ridge between them. A prominent notch is present on the caudal peduncle at the dorsal origin of the caudal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The skin is covered by overlapping, oval-shaped dermal denticles; each denticle has three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is bronze above and white below, with a barely noticeable pale band on the flanks. The pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins sometimes have lighter margins, while the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe may have darker margins. The hardnose shark reaches [...] in length.|$|R
50|$|The body wall is muscular. It {{surrounds}} a large coelom {{which leads}} to a long looped intestine with an anus at the <b>rear</b> <b>tip</b> of the body. The intestine is highly coiled, giving it a considerable length in relation {{to the size of the}} animal. A pair of simple or branched diverticula are connected to the rectum. These are lined with numerous minute ciliated funnels that open directly into the body cavity, and are presumed to be excretory organs.|$|R
5|$|The snout {{is rather}} short, broad, and rounded, without {{prominent}} flaps of skin beside the nostrils. The eyes {{are large and}} circular, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). There are 1113 tooth rows in either half of both jaws. The teeth have broad bases, serrated edges, and narrow cusps; the front 24 teeth on each side are erect and the others increasingly oblique. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long, with the third gill slit over {{the origin of the}} pectoral fins. The first dorsal fin is high and falcate (sickle-shaped). There is a low interdorsal ridge running behind it to the second dorsal fin, which is relatively large with a short free <b>rear</b> <b>tip.</b> The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the free <b>rear</b> <b>tips</b> of the pectoral fins, and that of the second dorsal fin lies over or slightly forward of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are long and narrow, tapering to a point. The dermal denticles are closely spaced and overlapping, each with five (sometimes seven in large individuals) horizontal low ridges leading to marginal teeth.|$|R
5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, so named because of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout. A small bronze-coloured shark {{reaching}} a length of , it has a slender body and a long, pointed snout. Its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated <b>rear</b> <b>tips.</b> The hardnose shark is widely distributed in the western Indo-Pacific, from Kenya to southern China and northern Australia. It inhabits warm, shallow waters close to shore.|$|R
500|$|The {{long and}} wide {{pectoral}} fins have pointed tips and nearly straight margins. The first dorsal fin originates roughly over {{the rear of}} the pectoral fin bases; it is fairly tall and falcate (sickle-shaped), with a blunt apex and a long free <b>rear</b> <b>tip.</b> The second dorsal fin is relatively large with a short free <b>rear</b> <b>tip,</b> and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. A high midline ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle has a crescent-shaped notch at the origin of the upper caudal fin margin. The caudal fin has a large lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are closely spaced but non-overlapping, such as that the skin shows between them; each is oval with three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. The coloration is gray to bronze above, with a faint pale stripe on the flank, and white below; sometimes there is a green sheen along the gills. The tips of the fins (except for the pelvic fins) are darker; this is most obvious in young sharks. Males and females grow to at least [...] and [...] long respectively; this species possibly reaches [...] in length. The maximum weight on record is [...]|$|R
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free <b>rear</b> <b>tip.</b> Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|R
40|$|A {{key element}} with which {{manufacturing}} industries should concern themselves {{in respect of}} cost and efficiency of operation is the cycle time for preparing their products. A reduction in operational time can result in dramatic improvements in both cost and efficiency. Unfortunately, cycle time problems are sometimes difficult to analyse: there are many factors related to this parameter. This paper presents a cycle time analysis of a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> frame in a heavy equipment industry. The cycle time analysis, based on the cycle time data collected by a time study, together {{with the use of}} an Arena software simulation, is outlined. From the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} manufacturing cycle time was 56 hours, and that resources were under-utilised...|$|R
50|$|The mantle is conical and {{elongated}} with {{a narrow}} <b>rear</b> <b>tip.</b> The mantle walls are thin and leathery. The funnel locking-apparatus are small and oval to spindle-shaped. A single cartilaginous tubercle is present at the mantle margins, though rarely it may be absent. The fins are long and narrow, starting at about 40 to 60% {{of the length of}} the mantle, far from where the body is the widest. They extend past the <b>rear</b> <b>tip</b> of the body, fuse with each other at the middle, and end with a pair of small lobes.The arms are short to medium length, about a fourth to half of the mantle length. In subadults and females, the third pair of arms is the longest, followed by the second, first, and the fourth pairs (length formula: III>II>I>IV). Sometimes the fourth and first pairs may be of equal or almost equal length (length formula: III>II>I=IV). Adult males may have the first and second pair of equal length (but shorter than the third pair), or the first pair may be the longest of all the arms (length formula: III>I=II>IV or I>III>II>IV). They all possess two rows of cup-shaped to globular suckers that lack hooks. The suckers on the midportion of the third and second pair of arms are greatly enlarged, exceeding the width of the arms.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has been issued by Miedema to investigate the production process of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> Since Miedema is adopting the lean philosophy, the company wonders {{whether there is a}} more ‘lean’ production process of the HST possible, and if such a solution is feasible. Another problem that Miedema faces is that it is relatively inflexible in comparison tot its competitors. Since Miedema occupies seasonal production, delivery times on certain products may be high. Miedema has indicated that it wants to explore possibilities to make the company more flexible, especially {{in the light of the}} current economic crisis. At the moment, demand is declining and the company wonders how it can cope with the declining sales and declining production. On the other hand, Miedema expects a surge in demand when the economic downturn has passed; it therefore wants to use this period to prepare itself for that moment. Flexibility is thus an important theme for Miedema, since this might win orders. At the same time the company wants to remain its other KPIs at the same level, for this meets customer expectations. The two most important of these KPIs are quality and the low cost of ownership. Given these facts, Miedema first wants to explore its possibilities, before actual changes are made. Since Miedema has ties to the Lean Operations Research Centre (LORC) of the University of Groningen, it has made the request whether such research can be conducted. Goal of the research is to provide management with an overview of possible production processes for the HST, weighted against potential problems and benefits. It therefore requires an independent research, to approach this question from a neutral perspective. It will support the decision making process for the future production of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>Trailer.</b> ...|$|R
