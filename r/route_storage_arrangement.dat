To effect data exchange between domains, domain border routers usually establish pairwise peering sessions and exchange routes at exchange points.

40|$|Abstract. In many circumstances, {{including}} e-learning, {{there is}} a need to reorganize digital resources, scattered in many places, into a coherently accessible repository. This paper introduces a methodology to do the job efficiently. Specifically, the resources that the scheme needs to handle presents the following challenges, 1) mass, 2) various data types, 3) coming out continuously, i. e., the scheme must support incremental reorganization. 4) usually existing with its own directory structures. We describe the scheme in detail, together with considerations for trade-offs. The following features are highlighted: 1) the reorganization of scattered resources is modeled as a tree-merging process, which results in a good trade-off between efficiency and quality. 2) hierarchical <b>storage</b> <b>arrangement</b> with a uniform index at each level ensures scalability.

This includes increased armor, redesigned (safer) internal <b>storage</b> <b>arrangement</b> for ammunition and equipment, engine and suspension upgrades, and {{product improvement}} of the M284 cannon and M182A1 mount. The greatest difference is the integration of an inertial navigation system, sensors detecting the weapons' lay, automation, and an encrypted digital communication system, which utilizes computer controlled frequency hopping to avoid enemy electronic warfare and allow the howitzer to send grid location and altitude to the battery fire direction center (FDC). The battery FDCs in turn coordinate fires through a battalion or higher FDC. This allows the Paladin to halt from the move and fire within 30 seconds with an accuracy equivalent to the previous models when properly emplaced, laid, and safed—a process that required several minutes under the best of circumstances. Tactically, this improves the system's survivability by allowing the battery to operate dispersed by pairs across the countryside and allowing the howitzer to quickly displace between salvos, or if attacked by indirect fire, aircraft, or ground forces.|$|R
