5|$|The {{main event}} was next, {{featuring}} The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He {{tried to put}} The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close the lid, however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close the lid. Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> opponent in to the casket and closed the lid to gain the victory.|$|E

25|$|Curry {{surpassed the}} 2000-point mark {{for his career}} on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford. On February 14, 2009, Curry <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> ankle {{in the second half}} of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career. On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99–56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing {{previous}} school leader John Gerdy. Davidson won the 2008–09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18–2 in the conference.|$|E

The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal-line, and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with the fingers of his right hand, and <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar. He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction.

500|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1990, the son of Thomas Robinson, Sr., and Dorothea Robinson. [...] Robinson began playing pee-wee {{football}} by age 10 and played the game with his shoes untied, thus earning the nickname [...] "Shoelace" [...] as a child. [...] Those who saw him play at Westside Park in Deerfield Beach recall:"Kids would go for his shoes on tackles, and he'd {{come up to the}} huddle in just socks. [...] His coach couldn't stand it at first and neither could his parents. They'd tie wristbands around his shoes. When that didn't work, they tried athletic tape. They even <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> socks over his shoes. He was a marvel, and he wasn't even finished with the sixth grade." ...|$|E

500|$|VanVleet, who {{was dealing}} with {{hamstring}} issues, <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> right ankle and saw only three minutes of action in the season opener against the Charleston Southern Buccaneers on November 13. Although {{he played in the}} next game against Tulsa, he aggravated his hamstring in the game and was expected to miss the next few games. Without a healthy VanVleet, Witchita State fell to two games below [...]500 {{for the first time since}} the 2008–09 Shockers team and endured their first three-game losing streak since VanVleet was coming off the bench as a freshman for the 2012–13 Shockers as well as the worst start to a season (24) since the 2007–08 team. VanVleet returned to the lineup on December 5 against St. Louis to stop the losing streak. His 13.5 points, 5.0 assists and 4.0 rebounds averages in wins on December 9 over UNLV and on December 12 win over #25 Utah earned him Missouri Valley Player of the Week honors on December 14. He again earned Player of the Week honors on January 11 when he led the Shockers to victories over conference co-leading Evansville on January 6 and Southern Illinois on January 9 with 11.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, 7.5 assists, and 2.5 steals averages. His 12 rebounds against Southern Illinois was a career high. [...] VanVleet was named to the January 25, 20-man Oscar Robertson Trophy midseason watch list. On January 31, VanVleet made all 15 of his free throw attempts on his way to a career high 32 points against Evansville. The following day, he earned his third MVC Player of the Week honor. On February 3 in the 1500th victory in Wichita State Shockers men's basketball history and in head coach Gregg Marshall's school record-setting 221st victory, VanVleet notched a double-double with 12 points and a career high-tying 11 assists against Southern Illinois. He was named to the 35-man midseason watchlist for the Naismith Trophy on February 11. VanVleet was included in the Wooden Award Late season Top 20 Watch List on February 12. In the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, VanVleet led the team to victories over Vanderbilt and Arizona. [...] Against Vanderbilt in the First Four round, he and fellow senior Ron Baker led an 110 run to break a 3030 tie on March 15. The pair scored all 11 points in the run and tied with a game-high 14 points. On March 17, VanVleet and Baker led 11-seed Wichita State to a victory over 6-seed and AP Poll 17th-ranked Arizona. VanVleet posted a game-high 16 points, 5 steals and 4 rebounds. With four steals in his final career game on March 19 against Miami, Van Vleet brought his career total to 225, setting a school career record.|$|E

During Australia's second innings, Andrew Hilditch picked up the ball after a return from a fieldsman and, in an attempt to be helpful, handed it to Sarfraz. Sarfraz appealed for a handling the ball dismissal, and Hilditch was given out by umpire Tony Crafter. While within the laws of the game, both dismissals were generally seen as unsportsmanlike. Hughes said of his own team's actions, [...] "It was just part of cricket" [...] while condemning the actions of Sarfraz: [...] "It just wasn't cricket". In the end, Australia won the second Test and tied the series one Test apiece. Hughes had started his Australian captaincy with a win.|$|E
2500|$|Derrick Rose {{was voted}} as an NBA All-Star starter {{for the second}} {{consecutive}} year, and was the third leading voted player overall behind Dwight Howard and Kobe Bryant. Luol Deng was also selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. This {{was the first time that}} the Bulls had two all stars since 1997, when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the duo. Derrick Rose was injured for most of the 2011–12 NBA season; however, the team was still able to finish with a 50–16 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year and the best overall record in the NBA (tied with the San Antonio Spurs). Rose suffered a new injury when he tore his ACL during the 4th quarter of the first playoff game on April 28, 2012, against the Philadelphia 76ers and missed the rest of the series. Head coach Tom Thibodeau was criticized for keeping Rose in the game even though the Bulls were essentially minutes away from their victory over the 76ers. [...] The Bulls lost the next three games, and also lost Noah to a foot injury after he severely <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> ankle stepping on Andre Iguodala's foot in Game 3; he briefly returned for part of the fourth quarter of that game, but missed the following games in the series. After winning Game 5 at home, Bulls were eliminated by the 76ers in Game 6 in Philadelphia, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to be eliminated as a first seed by an eighth seed. In Game 6, Andre Iguodala sank two free throws with 2.2 seconds left to put the 76ers up 79–78 after getting fouled by Ömer Aşık, who had missed two free throws five seconds earlier. At the end of the season, Boozer and Aşık were the only members on the Bulls' roster to have played in every game, with Korver and Brewer missing one game apiece. In the offseason, the Bulls gave up Lucas to the Toronto Raptors, Brewer to the New York Knicks, Korver to the Atlanta Hawks, Watson to the Brooklyn Nets and Aşık to the Houston Rockets, but brought back Kirk Hinrich. In addition, they added Marco Belinelli, Vladimir Radmanovic, Nazr Mohammed and Nate Robinson to the roster via free agency.|$|E
