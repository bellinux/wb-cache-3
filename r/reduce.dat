5|$|A major {{technological}} {{application of}} this information is metabolic engineering.

5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and <b>reduce</b> their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to <b>reduce</b> predation risk.|$|E
