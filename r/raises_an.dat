5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

25|$|Many {{researchers}} use self-report {{measures of}} felt emotion as a manipulation check. This <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> interesting question {{and a possible}} methodological weakness: are people always accurate when they recall how they felt in the past? Several findings suggest {{this is not the}} case. For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters were asked to describe their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Its primary focus is an impact of ASD {{diagnosis}} on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child and secondary it also introduces {{the basic principles}} of intervention, which are broadly used in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Literature review part of this thesis defines current approach of ASD. It also describes the impact of impairments in communication, social interaction and imagination on <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Important principles of intervention in <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with this diagnosis, which are individualization, structuralization, visualization and motivation, are presented there as well. The second part of this thesis presents a proposal for qualitative research that aims to point out differences between how mothers and fathers accept the diagnosis, perceive the impact on family relationships and use the principles of <b>raising</b> <b>a</b> child with ASD. Proposed research should provide hypotheses which would serve as a foundation for future research...|$|R

500|$|Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy during menopause when not balanced (or [...] "opposed") with progestin is another risk factor. Higher doses or {{longer periods of}} estrogen therapy have higher risks of endometrial cancer. Women of lower weight {{are at greater risk}} from unopposed estrogen. A longer period of fertility—either from an early first menstrual period or late menopause—is also a risk factor. Unopposed estrogen <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> individual's risk of endometrial cancer by 2–10fold, depending on weight and length of therapy. In trans men who take testosterone and have not had a hysterectomy, the conversion of testosterone into estrogen via androstenedione may lead to a higher risk of endometrial cancer.|$|E

500|$|Eddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia {{create an}} army, named [...] "Ironheade" [...] {{to fight against}} General Lionwhyte. They {{successfully}} raid Lionwhyte's [...] "Pleasure Tower" [...] and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus {{is aware of the}} presence of his spy [...] "Succoria" [...] by the smell of her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth [...] "Drowning Doom". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and finding more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.|$|E

2500|$|ASBO {{effectiveness}} {{has also}} been questioned. In a House of Commons reply it was stated that 53.7% of ASBOs were breached in England in 2005; 69.4% in 2006; 70.3% in 2007. In large cities rates could be higher: the breach rate in Manchester reached 90.2% in 2007. This level of breaching <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> interesting issue. The first test to justify the issuing of an ASBO was that ASB had been proved to the criminal standard. The second test was that the order was necessary to prevent future acts of ASB and provide protection to the victim. However the criminal standard was not applied to the second test.

2500|$|In April 2013, {{the church}} {{published}} a report entitled [...] "The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the 'Promised' Land" [...] {{which included a}} discussion of Israeli and Jewish claims to the Land of Israel.

This report is against the injustices levelled against the Palestinian people and how land is shared.

2500|$|Ismaïl [...] "is {{made up of}} eyes, sideburns, and a dress", {{tied with}} rope to a badger and {{stumbling}} down Arionoaia Street. Protected from [...] "legal responsibility" [...] in the country ("a seed-bed {{at the bottom of}} a hole in Dobruja"), the creature <b>raises</b> <b>an</b> entire badger colony: some he eats raw, with lemon; the others, once they have turned sixteen, he rapes [...] "without the smallest qualm of conscience." [...] The seed-bed is where Ismaïl also interviews job applicants, received on the condition that they hatch him [...] "four eggs each". The process is supported by his [...] "chamberlain" [...] Turnavitu, who exchanges love letters with the applicants. Ismaïl's actual residence is kept a secret, but it is presumed that he lives, sequestered from [...] "the corruption of electoral mores", in an attic above the home of his grotesquely disfigured father, only to emerge in a ball gown for the yearly celebration of plaster. He then offers his body to the workers, in hopes of thus resolving [...] "the labor issue". Whereas Ismaïl has once worked as an air fan for [...] "dirty Greek coffee houses" [...] in the Lipscani quarter, Turnavitu has a past in [...] "politics": he was for long the government-appointed air fan at the fire precinct kitchen. Ismaïl has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Ismaïl's fashion sense, and the swabbing of canola over Ismaïl's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the Balearic Islands in the form of a jerrycan, passes the common cold to Ismaïl's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide ("not before seeing to the extraction of four canines in his mouth"), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Ismaïl's dresses; the patron falls into depression and [...] "decrepitude", retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.|$|E
