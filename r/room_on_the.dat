5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most <b>room</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, or under a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E

Other than San Francisco Bay Area pride, turfing avoided becoming a fad due to local turf dance competitions and local youth programs that promote turfing {{as a form of}} physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a <b>room</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it.

During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from an explosion in time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E

These two mantels are identical to an example from Engleside (the John White House) in Warrenton, North Carolina. Mantels in <b>the</b> rear <b>rooms</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor are much simpler that those found in the two (front) primary chambers.|$|R
