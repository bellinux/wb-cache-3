500|$|Batman {{has access}} to several gadgets which he can use to explore or fight. The batarang is a {{throwing}} weapon that can temporarily stun enemies or trigger <b>remote</b> <b>devices.</b> A remotely controlled version can be steered once thrown, and the sonic batarang {{can be used to}} attract the attention of specific enemies wearing monitoring collars, or detonated to knock a nearby enemy unconscious. Explosive gel can be used on weak walls and floors, and can be remotely detonatedsending rubble crashing onto an enemy. The line launcher can be used to traverse horizontal spans. The Batclawa grappling devicecan be used to interact with remote objects such as vent covers or to grab enemies. The Cryptographic Sequencer is used to override security panels, open new paths, or disable various asylum functions. Some areas are inaccessible until Batman acquires the gadgets necessary to overcoming the obstacle. The player is encouraged to explore the game world away from the main game to find and solve riddles left by the Riddlerwho hacks into Batman's communication system to challenge him with riddles. Objects can be collected, and some of the Riddler's puzzles require the player to find areas related to the answer to a riddle and scan it with [...] "Detective Vision". The game world has 240 collectable items, such as Riddler trophies, chattering Joker teeth, interview tapes with some of Arkham's inmates, and cryptic messages left in the asylum by its founder Amadeus Arkham that discuss the facility's bleak history. The player is rewarded for solving riddles and finding collectibles with experience points and additional game content, including challenge maps that test the player's skill at the game's combat system, character biographies, and in-game statues of Arkham Asylums characters.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to authentication using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), by changing the location of authentication from a <b>remote</b> <b>device</b> (e. g. <b>remote</b> authentication server) to user device(s) that are TEE enabled. The authentication takes place locally on the user device and only the outcome is sent back to the <b>remote</b> <b>device.</b> Our approach uses existing features and capabilities of TEEs to enhance the security of user authentication. We reverse the way traditional authentication schemes work: instead of the user presenting their authentication data to a <b>remote</b> <b>device,</b> we request the <b>remote</b> <b>device</b> to send the stored authentication template(s) to the local device. Almost paradoxically, this enhances security of authentication data by supplying it only to a trusted device, and so enabling users to authenticate the intended remote entity. This addresses issues related with bad SSL certificates on local devices, DNS poisoning, and counteracts certain threats posed by the presence of malware. We present a protocol to implement such authentication system discussing its strengths and limitations, before identifying available technologies to implement the architecture...|$|R

50|$|The SDO {{protocol}} is {{used for}} setting and for reading values from the object dictionary of a <b>remote</b> <b>device.</b> The device whose object dictionary is accessed is the SDO server and the <b>device</b> accessing the <b>remote</b> <b>device</b> is the SDO client. The communication is always initiated by the SDO client. In CANopen terminology, communication is viewed from the SDO server, so that a read from an object dictionary results in an SDO upload and a write to a dictionary entry is an SDO download.|$|R
