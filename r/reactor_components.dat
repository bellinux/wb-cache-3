2500|$|The {{conventional}} deuterium + tritium ("D-T") fusion process produces energetic neutrons which render <b>reactor</b> <b>components</b> radioactive with activation products. The {{appeal of}} helium-3 fusion {{stems from the}} aneutronic nature of its reaction products. Helium-3 itself is non-radioactive. The lone high-energy by-product, the proton, can be contained using electric and magnetic fields. The momentum energy of this proton (created in the fusion process) will interact with the containing electromagnetic field, resulting in direct net electricity generation.He and Fusion Power|author=John Santarius|date=September 28, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-06}} ...|$|E
