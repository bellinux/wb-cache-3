40|$|Little {{has been}} done <b>to</b> address <b>the</b> issue of how <b>to</b> {{overcome}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in a change effort in the church world. “How <b>to</b> overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change?” {{is a question that}} requires serious consideration among church leaders. Church leaders continue to act in ways that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and ultimately failed change efforts. These actions on the part of church leaders often strengthen and reinforce <b>the</b> sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, making it very difficult for change to be accepted by church members. A literature study design was used to conduct this research. The purpose of this research was to: • Understand <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • <b>To</b> determine <b>the</b> actions of leaders that generate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine how church leaders can overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change <b>The</b> research indicates that church leaders make too many errors in a change process that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. <b>The</b> research has found eight actions of leaders that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by followers. Apart from the eight actions of leaders that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, many change agents continue to function as managers and not leaders in a change process. This results in further <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. <b>The</b> research clearly shows that for church leaders <b>to</b> effectively overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, they need to follow a multi-stage change process, which is comprehensive, sequential and one that develops naturally and addresses all <b>the</b> sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. <b>The</b> research shows that church leaders should not skip or race through the steps or fail to reinforce earlier steps in the process of overcoming <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. <b>The</b> researcher recommends nine steps that can be used by church leaders <b>to</b> overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and thus facilitate change successfully.
