5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its <b>royalty</b> <b>payments,</b> effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E
5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar should be offered for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E
5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of <b>royalty</b> <b>payments.</b>|$|E

25|$|The game's {{commercial}} success led to lawsuits initiated in 1979 regarding distribution of <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> between D co-creators Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax.

50|$|Comparing the {{structure}} and techniques of this tower with those designed and constructed by Bogardus show many similarities, especially in the method of bolting joints together. In April 1857, Bogardus sued the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of New York, claiming a patent infringement (#7,337). He cited that he was entitled to a <b>royalty</b> <b>payment</b> of $289, plus actual damages of $20,000.

25|$|Sessions in July 1942 {{produced}} nine prime sides, allowing Decca {{to stockpile}} Jordan's recordings {{as a hedge}} against the recording ban declared by the American Federation of Musicians in the same month. The ban—imposed {{in order to secure}} <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> for union musicians for each record sold—led to Jordan's enforced absence from the studio for the next year, and it also prevented many seminal bebop performers from recording during one of the most crucial years of the genre's history.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, IPC's comics {{division}} {{was sold to}} Robert Maxwell as Fleetway Publications.

25|$|Stone sued {{his former}} {{managers}} in 2010, {{accusing them of}} cheating him out of years' worth of <b>royalty</b> <b>payments</b> for the songs he had written.

A jury in Los Angeles awarded him $5 million in damages in January 2015, but in December the award was overturned because, the appellate court ruled, the trial judge had not told the jury {{to take into account the}} fact Stone had assigned his royalties to a production company in exchange for a 50% ownership stake. In May 2016, Stone's attorneys appealed that decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Ireland {{is a modern}} {{knowledge}} economy, focusing on services and high-tech industries and dependent on trade, industry and investment.
