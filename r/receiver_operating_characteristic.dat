25|$|Docking screens can be also {{evaluated}} by the enrichment of annotated ligands of known binders from among a large database of presumed non-binding, “decoy” molecules.

25|$|There {{is a high}} {{comorbidity}} {{of learning}} disorders (LDs) in children with ADHD, {{and for that reason}} the VADRS has been studied to determine if the performance item questions on the VARS can reliably predict if the child with ADHD has a comorbid LD (e.g. math, reading, spelling LDs). Results of a <b>receiver</b> <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> (ROC) analysis show that children with ADHD can be reliably ruled out from have a comorbid LD based on the performance items on the VARS. This is clinically useful because it allows those without LDs to be ruled out and therefore reduce the amount of unnecessary referrals to healthcare professionals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{accurate}} and fast sensing {{of the radio}} spectrum {{is one of the}} key requirements of any Cognitive Radio (CR) architecture. Wavelet packet-based spectrum estimator (WPSE) is a newly developed method for the detection of active users or spectrum holes in the spectral domain. Various wavelet families with different wavelet parameters exhibit different detection performances. In this article, the <b>receiver</b> <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> (ROC) is considered for the performance evaluation of wavelet packet-based spectrum estimator for a wide range of wavelet families, both orthogonal and non-orthogonal, with different wavelet parameters. Exploiting the underutilized radio spectrum, an efficient wavelet packet-based spectrum estimation model with reduced number of sensing measurements is also proposed. The developed model exhibits a significant reduction of number of sensing measurements with a good detection performance.
