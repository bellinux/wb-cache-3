40|$|Summary Recidivism of {{juvenile}} homicide offenders Serious offences against persons perpetrated by juveniles raise fundamental {{questions about the}} background, causes, and prevention of future crime. The current study addresses the potential of future crime {{of juvenile}} homicide offenders (JHOs) in The Netherlands who were incarcerated in the period 1992 - 2007. In contrast to merely descriptive former research on recidivism of this offender group, we provide an explanation for why some of the juveniles <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime,</b> while others do not. To this end, associations are investigated between recidivism behavior and risk factors. Results indicate that male JHOs and JHOs who maintain relationships with delinquents run a greater risk to reoffend. ...|$|E
40|$|What {{the author}} {{presents}} {{in this study}} are the Polish solutions concerning the estimation of the risk of <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime</b> and their counterparts in some developed western systems. Two Polish tools for risk estimation are discussed : one was specified in the directive of the Minister of Justice of 26 h February 2013 and the other was suggested by B. Hołyst in the same year. It is emphasized that in both cases there is no empirical evidence confirming their effectiveness. On the basis of the achievements of global science in this field, the evaluation is made of both Polish solutions concerning risk estimation. This brought about the conclusion that the risk estimation model suggested in the directive in some elements substantially drifts apart from the solutions applied worldwide...|$|E
40|$|The {{project of}} penal code {{is in the}} Diet {{nowadays}} and the parliamentary debate preceding its voting is far advanced. The present proposition {{is an attempt to}} suggest some important changes in provisions that regulate penalization of special recidivism. These are changes which however still do have a chance to be accepted by the parliamentary commission. The propositions in question aim at adapting in a clearer way the purposes and means of statutory penalty to the there different areas of facts resulting in <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime.</b> They also intend to adopt as a basis for punishing the recidivists first of all the character of the last crime committed and the importance of the latter rather than the category itself of perpetrators relapsing in crime. 1. Where more trivial offence is involved and within the scope where tendencies not to decree imprisonment penalties should be dominating - the provision on special recidivism permits the court to increase these penalties without opposing general trends in penal policy. 2. As far as more serious crime is concerned - j u s t for the reason of its importance and of the scale of sanctiofs - the author proposes a confinement to advising the court to take into consideration the <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime</b> when fixing up penalty of deprivation of liberty decided within the framework of statutory punishability. 3. In relation with most serious misdemeanors and their most threatening perpetrators (what more is - expecting badly for the future) the author proposes to apply here the isolating function of the punishment as an exception from the guilt principle which is accepted as a pattern for sentencing. In case of a relapse into the statutory cited crime, the court is legally bound to decree the penalty of deprivation of liberty without conditional stay of the carrying out of a sentence decided. The upper limit of the punishment may be then augmented by a half but may not exceed 15 years.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of Durban-Westville, 2002. This {{study is}} an {{exploration}} of prison learners' experiences of the educational rehabilitation programmes offered in the Westville Youth Centre School. The study {{was done in the}} Westville Youth Centre, which is situated in the Durban Management Area in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The sample consisted of eleven prison learners of the Usethubeni Youth School, nine educators from this school and one control educator (who is responsible for co-ordinating the educational rehabilitation programmes in the Durban Management Area). Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires. Interviews with learners were done at different intervals. There was an in-depth interview with one of the learners and two focus group interviews, which consisted of five learners in each session. A questionnaire was used to gather data from educators and finally an in-depth interview was conducted with the co-ordinator of educational rehabilitation programmes. Photographs of the prison classroom and the cell were taken by the researcher to illustrate {{the context in which the}} research was done. The varying methods of data collection revealed that what is referred to as "educational rehabilitation programmes" are programmes similar to any school curricular outside the prison. There is nothing unique about this curriculum. The participants felt that this curriculum was not rehabilitative because it did not include programmes that could curb recidivism (<b>relapsing</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime)</b> by empowering prison learners and helping them "unlearn faulty behaviour. " This study concludes with the recommendations for the Department of Correctional Services' policy makers and planners as well as the managers of educational rehabilitation programmes in the Durban Management area...|$|R
40|$|Sense {{of justice}} and resocialization are two {{essential}} terms pulling at each other, when politicians and experts are discussing crime and penalty. There is neither agreement upon {{the purpose of the}} penalty, nor whether it is actually working or not. The purpose of prisons is to ensure the society’s sense {{of justice and}}, at the same time, resocialize the inmates to a life without crime. Nevertheless, a great part of the former inmates return to prison. Based on interviews with Professor in Criminal Law, Eva Smith, and two former inmates, this project illustrates why we punish, when experts believe punishment does not work. The prison, as a behavioral regulation institution, must resocialize the lives of the inmates to one that does not involve crime, but in 1 / 3 of the cases the criminals <b>relapse</b> back <b>into</b> <b>crime.</b> To us, this figure seems remarkably high and based on the term criminal career, we wish to investigate whether this is a barrier to the function of the prison. Our theories are based on Howard Becker’s and Erving Goffman’s Sociology of Deviance and Michel Foucault’s analyses and discussion of the prison...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} mediation’s crime prevention effects. The question that has been answered is: which crime prevention effects mediation has had on young criminals who have participated in mediation programs? The investigation was made in relation to a comparable control group and included a reoffence analysis based on a multivariate analysis. This reoffence study mainly focuses on that the mediation prevents crime through the feelings of shame that the young perpetrator has due to the fact that the crime has been made clear and reinforced at the mediation meeting. The following hypothesis is addressed in this study: Mediation involves the trust between the young perpetrator and his/her parents and has a conflict-solving and crime-prevention effect. By committing a crime, the youth has broken the trust with his/her parents, who have condemned the action. The parents feel the shame from those around them, and because of this resume their position against the youth. The main conclusion is that the total population of youths who participated in mediation programs <b>relapsed</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime</b> to a lesser extent than the youths who did not participate in mediation. The risk for a relapse was twice as high for the youths who did not participate in mediation. A statistically significant relationship emerged between mediation and relapse with regard to party and person plaintiff status, but it is not possible to draw any conclusions whether mediation has a better or worse effect between plaintiff status. The significant effect of relapse for respective gender showed that girls relapsed to a lesser extent than boys. It was not possible to statistically determine whether the youths who were born abroad respective born i Sweden have relapsed to a greater extent. Regarding the age groups there was no statistically significant relationship as to whether youths relapsed to a greater or lesser extent depending on whether they were under or over fifteen years of age. Furthermore, it has not been possible to statistically determine whether group mediation has had a different outcome in relapse frequency as compared to individual mediation, and it has not been possible to distinguish whether compensation at mediation has had any effect. There emerged significant relationships between mediation and relapse for the crime categories ‘crime against life and health’, ‘crime against freedom and peace’, ‘burglary, robbery and other theft crimes’ and ‘vandalism’...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to get an insight of how social ability has been {{affected}} amongst people with crime history. Social ability is a collection concept for language, social network, employability and economy. In this study, the prime problem is that 41 % of convicted criminals <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime</b> and the main cause is lack of employment. Our chosen respondents are from an organization named Krami, which is a cooperation between the Swedish labor office, correctional and the current municipality. The questions at issue are: • How has the target group’s social ability been affected after participating in the Krami programme? • How does the target group of former criminals relate to the activities at Krami?  Moreover, the study contains theoretical concepts from Bourdieu theory, such as crystal habit, social field/social room and capital. Thus a qualitative method was used, which means that the questions at issue have been conducted by interviews with former criminals. Finally, the result of the study is on one hand that the social ability has been affected after the participation in Krami and on the other that the target group has related positively to the activities at the programme. Furthermore, the social ability was improved and the respondents decreased their chances of relapsing into crime. Four main factors contributed to this improvement; language, social network, employability and economy...|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{dissimilar}} stances of the Danish citizens regarding punishment, justice and rehabilitation through a quantitative questionnaire survey. The primary and recurrent {{example is the}} Danish preparatory institutions, especially the one named ‘Pension Skejby’, where criminal subjects reside with non criminals. The main purpose of these residential institutions is {{to contribute to a}} reduction of criminal activity in the Danish society. Therefore some offenders are offered a space in one of these halfway houses, most often during the last term of their incarceration, as a way to successfully rehabilitate them into society. This thesis predominantly concentrates its theoretical focus on the two classical philosophical approaches retributivism and utilitarianism and the psychological and sociological theories behind ‘Pension Skejby’. The analytical section concerns the results of the survey as well as the very unique methods that are utilized at ‘Pension Skejby’. Consequently the discussion presents miscellaneous considerations regarding the justification of utilitarianism and retributivism and debates the imaginary scenario where preparatory institutions supersedes the current Danish penal system completely. In conclusion it is demonstrated that these halfway houses are of great significance in preventing <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime.</b> The main results of the questionnaire survey are that the respondents are divided equally onto the retributivist and utilitarian conception of punishment and furthermore {{that the majority of the}} respondents adopted a more positive view on preparatory institutions after being informed on the subject. Thus it becomes pertinent to discuss and additionally reassess our entire penal system...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} based on the study {{conducted}} in years 1979 - 85 on the group of 207 young adult offenders tried in Poznań District Court. The purpose of the study Was to perform a synthesizing evaluation of efficiency of particular penal measures [...] The basis of the evaluation is an attempt to grasp the connections and dependencies between typical crime generating factors (exo- and endogenic) — grouped in 11 structures and forming sets characterized by different degrees of cumulation — and the offenders' subsequent lines of conduct, determined by the levels of their recidivism, and to determine the influence of measures applied by the courts on the above dependencies. No connnection was found between the degree of cumulation of crime generating factors and severity of the measure. The penalty of deprivation of liberty was in cases of greater cumulation of crime generating factors even less frequent than in variants with weak cumulation of these factors. It indicates that Art. 51 of Criminal Code is not always applied. (i. e. the exposition of educational aims of proceedings concerning the young adult offenders). The highest percentage of recidivism occurs after the penalty of deprivation of liberty (39, 3 %), somewhat lower after the conditional suspension of the execution of such penalty (32, 6 %), small after the penalty of restricted liberty (6, 4 %); there is no recidivism after autonomous fine and after educational and corrective measures. The relation between the recidivism and the lack of stabilization (i. e. the situation when the offender does not <b>relapse</b> <b>into</b> <b>crime</b> but nevertheless does not stabilize his situation through e. g. taking a job) is statistically significant (p< 0, 001) with correlation coefficient v = 0, 411. The above result indicates the lack of efficiency of applied penal measures and suggests the need of changes in the policy of punishing.

30|$|Now {{moving on}} from the simple {{analysis}} of relative risk based on a categorical outcome measure to a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the probability of staying euthymic will be 0.4 after 0.5  year and 0.2 (0.4 [*]×[*] 0.5) after 1.5  years in the drug group and 0.2 after 0.5  year in the placebo group. The probability of not <b>relapsing</b> <b>into</b> mania (with <b>relapses</b> <b>into</b> depression censored at 0.5  year) will be 0.8 after 0.5  year and throughout in the drug group and 0.6 after 0.5  year and throughout in the placebo group. The probability of not <b>relapsing</b> <b>into</b> depression (with <b>relapses</b> <b>into</b> mania censored at 0.5  year) will be 0.6 after 0.5  year and 0.3 (0.6 [*]×[*] 0.5) after 1.5  year in the drug group, and 0.6 after 0.5  years and throughout in the placebo group. Here {{it is assumed that}} the only censoring taking place is that due to endpoint of the opposite polarity. Thus, there is a superior probability of staying euthymic and of not <b>relapsing</b> <b>into</b> mania in the drug group, but an inferior probability of not <b>relapsing</b> <b>into</b> depression over the 2 -year study period.|$|R
