5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as <b>rituximab,</b> ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review found <b>rituximab</b> with {{methotrexate}} to {{be effective}} in improving symptoms compared to methotrexate alone. <b>Rituximab</b> works by depicting levels of B-cells (immune cell that is involved in inflammation). People taking <b>rituximab</b> had improved pain, function, reduced disease activity and reduced joint damage based on x-ray images. After 6 months, 21% more people had improvement in their symptoms using <b>rituximab</b> and methotrexate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rituximab</b> is a {{chimeric}} monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, {{developed from}} its parent antibody Ibritumomab. As with ibritumomab, <b>rituximab</b> targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma and leukaemias such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although {{the function of}} CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a calcium channel involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Other mechanisms include apoptosis and cellular growth arrest. <b>Rituximab</b> also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Ofatumumab is {{a second}} {{generation}} human IgG1 antibody that binds to CD20. It {{is used in the}} treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike <b>rituximab,</b> which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to <b>rituximab,</b> ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less immunogenicity.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the disease}} {{is known to be}} auto-antibodies mediated, B-cell {{depletion}} has been tried with the monoclonal antibody <b>rituximab,</b> showing good results.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. <b>Rituximab</b> and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} therapeutics, {{multiple}} monoclonal antibodies were under investigation in 2007. The most promising {{seemed to be}} the anti-CD20 <b>rituximab</b> and the anti-CD22 epratuzumab, while the anti-TNF-α and IFN-α seemed less effective.|$|E
25|$|The {{stimulus}} for auto-antibody production in ITP is probably abnormal T cell activity. Preliminary {{findings suggest that}} these T cells can be influenced by drugs that target B cells, such as <b>rituximab.</b>|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine-class {{drugs are}} the most common treatment; they are used for symptom relief from stiffness. Other common {{treatments}} include Baclofen, intravenous immunoglobin and <b>rituximab.</b> There has been limited but encouraging success with stem-cell treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{off-label use}} of <b>rituximab,</b> a {{chimeric}} monoclonal antibody against the B cell surface antigen CD20, may sometimes {{be an effective}} alternative to splenectomy. However, significant side-effects can occur, and randomized controlled trials are inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{introduction}} of combination therapy with concurrent <b>rituximab</b> and cladribine therapy has shown excellent results in early follow-up. As of 2016, this therapy is considered the first-line treatment of choice for many people with HCL-V.|$|E
25|$|For {{systemic}} symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, myositis and neuropathy, biologic immunosuppressant {{drugs such}} as <b>rituximab</b> and belimumab that work via B-cell pathology are often used and have less toxic profiles than traditional immunosuppressive regimens.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like azathioprine, leflunomide, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{may also help}} prevent relapse. <b>Rituximab</b> may be substituted for cyclophosphamide in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|Other {{treatments}} include <b>rituximab</b> infusion or self-injection with Interferon-alpha. In limited cases, {{the patient}} {{may benefit from}} splenectomy (removal of the spleen). These treatments are not typically given as the first treatment because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pentostatin.|$|E
25|$|The University of Toronto {{has been}} working to develop a form of {{treatment}} that improves the patient's overall quality of life while remaining economically achievable. They believe they have achieved this through fixed-dose <b>rituximab.</b> It {{has proven to be}} effective among auto-immune diseases, but the correct administration process for treating PNP is yet to be defined. The results of the study demonstrated varying levels of remission.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the {{therapeutic}} market for monoclonal antibodies has grown exponentially. In 2006, the “big 5” therapeutic antibodies {{on the market}} are bevacizumab, trastuzumab (both oncology), adalimumab, infliximab (both autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, ‘AIID’) and <b>rituximab</b> (oncology and AIID) accounted for 80% of revenues in 2006. In 2007, eight of the 20 best-selling biotechnology drugs in the U.S. are therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. This rapid growth in demand for monoclonal antibody production has been well accommodated by the industrialization of mAb manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Potentially painful cancer {{treatments}} include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, {{which can cause}} skin reactions, enteritis, fibrosis, myelopathy, bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and <b>rituximab,</b> which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia.|$|E
25|$|In adults, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} areas with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and {{has been associated with}} peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with <b>rituximab,</b> which is more expensive and less safe. In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas. Urea breath testing and stool antigen testing perform better than serology-based tests; moreover, serology may be false-positive after treatment with IVIG.|$|E
25|$|Antibody-dependent cell-mediated {{cytotoxicity}} (ADCC) requires {{antibodies to}} bind to target cell surfaces. Antibodies are formed of a binding region (Fab) and the Fc region {{that can be}} detected by immune system cells via their Fc surface receptors. Fc receptors are found on many immune system cells, including natural killer cells. When natural killer cells encounter antibody-coated cells, the latter's Fc regions interact with their Fc receptors, releasing perforin and granzyme B to kill the tumor cell. Examples include <b>Rituximab,</b> Ofatumumab and Alemtuzumab. Antibodies under development have altered Fc regions that have higher affinity for {{a specific type of}} Fc receptor, FcγRIIIA, which can dramatically increase effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Among these, {{multiple}} antibody therapies {{are approved}} in various jurisdictions {{to treat a}} wide range of cancers. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that bind to a target antigen on the cell surface. The immune system normally uses them to fight pathogens. Each antibody is specific to one or a few proteins. Those that bind to tumor antigens treat cancer. Cell surface receptors are common targets for antibody therapies and include CD20, CD274 and CD279. Once bound to a cancer antigen, antibodies can induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, activate the complement system, or prevent a receptor from interacting with its ligand, all of which can lead to cell death. Approved antibodies include alemtuzumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, ofatumumab and <b>rituximab.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{that target}} the {{autoimmune}} response are also used. Intravenous immunoglobin {{is the best}} second-line treatment for SPS. It often decreases stiffness and improves {{quality of life and}} startle reflex. It is generally safe, but there are possible serious side effects and it is expensive. The European Federation of Neurological Societies suggests it be used when disabled patients do not respond well to diazepam and baclofen. Steroids, <b>rituximab,</b> and plasma exchange have been used to suppress the immune system in SPS patients, but the efficacy of these treatments is unclear. Botulinum toxin has been used to treat SPS, but it {{does not appear to have}} long-term benefits and has potential serious side effects. In paraneoplastic cases, tumors must be managed for the condition to be contained. Opiates are sometimes used to treat severe pain, but in some cases they exacerbate symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain {{indolent}} {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent <b>rituximab</b> {{in the treatment of}} follicular lymphoma rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.|$|E

500|$|As of 2017, <b>rituximab</b> {{has been}} widely used off-label to treat {{progressive}} primary MS. [...] In March 2017 the FDA approved ocrelizumab, {{as a treatment for}} primary progressive MS, the first drug to gain that approval, [...] with requirements for several Phase IV clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|Linear IgA bullous {{dermatosis}} and IgA pemphigus are {{two examples}} of IgA-mediated immunobullous diseases. [...] IgA-mediated immunobullous diseases can often be difficult to treat even with usually effective medications such as <b>rituximab.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} The {{most common}} treatment for cladribine-resistant disease is infusing monoclonal antibodies that destroy cancerous B cells. [...] <b>Rituximab</b> {{is by far}} the most commonly used. [...] Most patients receive one IV infusion over several hours each week for four to eight weeks. [...] A 2003 publication found two partial and ten complete responses out of 15 patients with relapsed disease, for a total of 80% responding. [...] The median patient (including non-responders) did not require further treatment for more than three years. [...] This eight-dose study had a higher response rate than a four-dose study at Scripps, which achieved only 25% response rate. [...] <b>Rituximab</b> has successfully induced a complete response in Hairy Cell-Variant.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{clinical}} trials {{are studying the}} effectiveness of cladribine followed by <b>rituximab</b> in eliminating residual hairy cells that remain after treatment by cladribine or pentostatin. [...] It is not currently known if the elimination of such residual cells will result in more durable remissions.|$|E
2500|$|Most rheumatic {{diseases}} {{are treated with}} analgesics, NSAIDs (Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), steroids (in serious cases), DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs), monoclonal antibodies, such as [...] infliximab and adalimumab, and the soluble TNF receptor etanercept and Methotrexate for moderate to severe Rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agent <b>Rituximab</b> (Anti-B-Cell Therapy) is now licensed for use in refractory Rheumatoid Arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|Auto-immune and {{inflammatory}} kidney disease, such as vasculitis or transplant rejection, may {{be treated}} with immunosuppression. Commonly used agents are prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus, thymoglobulin and sirolimus. Newer, so-called [...] "biologic drugs" [...] or monoclonal antibodies, are also used in these conditions and include <b>rituximab,</b> basiliximab and eculizumab. Blood products including intravenous immunoglobulin and {{a process known as}} plasma exchange can also be employed.|$|E
2500|$|Many older {{treatment}} approaches, such as Interferon-alpha, {{the combination}} chemotherapy regimen [...] "CHOP", and common alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide showed very little benefit. Pentostatin and cladribine administered as monotherapy (without concurrent <b>rituximab)</b> provide some benefit {{to many people}} with HCL-V, but typically induce shorter remission periods and lower response rates than when they are used in classic HCL. [...] More than half of people respond partially to splenectomy.|$|E
2500|$|Single-drug {{treatment}} is typical. [...] Unlike most cancers, only one drug is normally {{given to a}} patient at a time. [...] While monotherapy is normal, combination therapy—typically using one first-line therapy and one second-line therapy—is being studied in current clinical trials and is used more frequently for refractory cases. [...] Combining <b>rituximab</b> with cladribine or pentostatin {{may or may not}} produce any practical benefit to the patient. Combination therapy is almost never used with a new patient. [...] Because the success rates with purine analog monotherapy are already so high, the additional benefit from immediate treatment with a second drug in a treatment-naïve patient is assumed to be very low. [...] For example, one round of either cladribine or pentostatin gives the median first-time patient a decade-long remission; the addition of <b>rituximab,</b> which gives the median patient only three or four years, might provide no additional value for this easily treated patient. [...] In a more difficult case, however, the benefit from the first drug may be substantially reduced and therefore a combination may provide some benefit.|$|E
2500|$|Treatments for {{autoimmune}} disease {{have traditionally been}} immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, or palliative. Managing inflammation is critical in {{autoimmune disease}}s. Non-immunological therapies, such as hormone replacement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat outcomes of the autoaggressive response, thus these are palliative treatments. [...] Dietary manipulation limits the severity of celiac disease. [...] Steroidal or NSAID treatment limits inflammatory symptoms of many diseases. IVIG is used for CIDP and GBS. Specific immunomodulatory therapies, such as the TNFα antagonists (e.g. etanercept), the B cell depleting agent <b>rituximab,</b> the anti-IL-6 receptor tocilizumab and the costimulation blocker abatacept {{have been shown to}} be useful in treating RA. [...] Some of these immunotherapies may be associated with increased risk of adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection.|$|E
2500|$|Biological agents should {{generally}} {{only be used}} if methotrexate {{and other}} conventional agents are not effective after a trial of three months. [...] They {{are associated with a}} higher rate of serious infections as compared to other DMARDs. [...] Biological DMARD agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) blockers such as infliximab; interleukin 1 blockers such as anakinra, monoclonal antibodies against B cells such as <b>rituximab,</b> and tocilizumab T cell co-stimulation blocker such as abatacept. They are often used in combination with either methotrexate or leflunomide. Abatacept should not be used {{at the same time as}} other biologics. In those who are well controlled on TNF blockers decreasing the dose does not appear to affect overall function. Persons should be screened for latent tuberculosis before starting any TNF blockers therapy to avoid reactivation.|$|E
2500|$|Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors {{can provide}} {{symptomatic}} benefit {{and may not}} fully remove a person's weakness from MG. While they might not fully remove all symptoms of MG, they still may allow a person the ability to perform normal daily activities. Usually, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are started at a low dose and increased until the desired result is achieved. If taken 30 minutes before a meal, symptoms will be mild during eating, which is helpful {{for those who have}} difficulty swallowing due to their illness. Another medication used for MG, atropine, [...] can reduce the muscarinic side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Pyridostigmine is a relatively long-acting drug (when compared to other cholinergic agonists), with a half-life around four hours with relatively few side effects. Generally, it is discontinued in those who are being mechanically ventilated as it is known {{to increase the amount of}} salivary secretions. A few high-quality studies have directly compared cholinesterase inhibitors with other treatments (or placebo); their practical benefit may be such that it would be difficult to conduct studies in which they would be withheld from some people. The steroid prednisone might also be used to achieve a better result, but it can lead to the worsening of symptoms for 14 days and takes 6–8 weeks to achieve its maximal effectiveness. Due to the myriad symptoms that steroid treatments can cause, it is not the preferred method of treatment. Other immune suppressing medications may also be used including <b>rituximab.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{pathogenic}} role of ANCA {{is still}} controversial, in vitro and animal models {{support the idea}} that the antibodies have a direct pathological role in the formation of small vessel vasculitides. MPO and PR3 specific ANCA can activate neutrophils and monocytes through their Fc and Fab'2 receptors, which can be enhanced by cytokines which cause neutrophils to display MPO and PR3 on their surface. Aberrant glycosylation of the MPO and PR3 specific ANCA enhances their ability to interact with activating Fc receptors on neutrophils. [...] The activated neutrophils can then adhere to endothelial cells where degranulation occurs. This releases free oxygen radicals and lytic enzymes, resulting in damage to the endothelium via the induction of necrosis and apoptosis. Furthermore, neutrophils release chemoattractive signalling molecules that recruit more neutrophils to the endothelium, acting as a positive feedback loop. Animal models have shown that MPO antibodies can induce necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis and systemic small vessel vasculitis. In these animal models the formation of glomerulonephritis and vasculitis can occur in the absence of T-cells, however neutrophils must be present. Although the direct pathogenic role of ANCA is the most accepted theory to date of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) pathogenesis, the theory still fails to explain the observation that [...] ANCA serum concentration does not always correlate disease activity or relapses, where high ANCA titres can be found in patients, and in some normal individuals, with no sign of vasculitis. In addition, in patients with active disease, treated with <b>Rituximab,</b> an anti-CD20 antibody which remove circulating B-cells, clinical remission [...] correlates more to the decreasing number of circulating B-cells than decrease in ANCA titre, which in some patient does not change during treatment. The same study found that clinical relapse in some patients were in association with the return of circulating B-cells. Based on the above observations and that ANCA reactive B-cells can be found in circulation in patients with AAV, an alternative hypothesis have been proposed assigning [...] a direct pathogenic role of these cells, whereby activated neutrophils and ANCA-reactive B-cells engage in intercellular cross-talk, which leads not only to neutrophil degranulation and inflammation but also to the proliferation and differentiation of ANCA-reactive B-cells. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested.|$|E
