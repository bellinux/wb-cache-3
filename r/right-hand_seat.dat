5|$|Assigned {{emergency}} roles {{called for}} Grissom, in the left-hand seat, {{to open the}} cabin pressure vent valve, after which White in the center seat was to open the plug door hatch, while Chaffee in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> was to maintain communications. Grissom was prevented from opening the valve by {{the intensity of the}} fire, which started in that region and spread from left to right. Despite this, White removed his restraints and apparently tried in vain to open the hatch, which was held closed by the cabin pressure. The increasing pressure finally burst the inner cabin wall on the right-hand side at 23:31:19 GMT. After approximately thirty seconds of being fed by a cabin atmosphere of pure oxygen at pressures of , and now fed by nitrogen-buffered ambient air, the primary fire decreased in intensity and started producing large amounts of smoke, which killed the astronauts. Chaffee lost consciousness when he experienced myocardial hypoxia, which sent him into cardiac arrest and resulted in cerebral hypoxia. He died from asphyxia due to the toxic gasses from the fire, with burns contributing to his death.|$|E
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat,</b> as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|The Karma is a range-extended {{electric}} vehicle or series hybrid {{driven by a}} pair of [...] electric motors that receive power from a 20.1 kWh lithium ion battery supplied by A123 Systems and/or an engine powered generator. The battery pack runs {{down the center of the}} car, between the pairs of left-hand and <b>right-hand</b> <b>seats,</b> preventing a rear bench and seating four rather than five passengers. Once the battery is depleted, or when the driver activates the [...] "Sport" [...] paddle on the steering wheel, the front-mounted 260-hp, 2.0-liter Ecotec four-cylinder direct-injection turbocharged gasoline engine powers a generator that sends electricity directly to the drive motors. The engine is sourced from General Motors. The battery can also be charged from the grid, making the vehicle a type of plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicle}} (PHEV).|$|R
5|$|On {{his first}} day at Edwards, Armstrong was tasked his first assignments, which were to pilot chase planes during {{releases}} of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and {{on one of these}} missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, Armstrong was in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was to air-drop a Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket. He sat in the <b>right-hand</b> pilot <b>seat</b> while the left-hand seat commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.|$|R

2500|$|In 1928 he left Stanford {{just when}} {{beginning}} law school {{as he was}} hired as captain for Maddux Airlines to fly Ford Tri-Motors, although he had no multi-engine experience. He had no co-pilot at Maddux. Instead the right hand seat was occupied by a mechanic with the title [...] "mate." [...] For aircraft checkout, he rode shotgun {{on a trip to}} San Diego, and a trip to Alameda, California. He handled the controls while in the air.

50|$|The {{suitability}} of Japan's domestically sold cars for export {{to other countries}} is constrained by various factors. Vehicles in Japan have <b>right-hand</b> drive—the driver's <b>seat</b> {{is on the right}} side of the vehicle—in accord with Japan's left-hand traffic. Some countries with right-hand traffic permit right-hand drive vehicles, though right-traffic headlamps are generally unavailable for models exclusive to Japan. Some countries with right traffic do not allow right-hand drive cars, but in some such markets the extensive labor required to convert a car to left-hand drive is economically feasible; such conversions are sometimes done by the local importers. The Philippines is an example of a market where such conversion is common, until recently, when the importation of such used vehicles (except for heavy vehicles) was banned by E0 156. Japan's automobile safety regulations also differ substantially from the ECE Regulations used throughout most of the world and the U.S. North American regulations that apply in the United States and Canada. Vehicle components such as windows and windshields, seat belts, lamps and reflectors, and mirrors, as well as design features for crashworthiness such as bumpers, fuel tanks, and structural rigidity of vehicles meant for the Japanese market may not comply with non-Japanese standards. They often lack structural reinforcements needed to meet side-impact crashworthiness standards in effect outside Japan. Moreover, entire categories of vehicle, such as Kei cars, do not exist in regulations outside Japan.|$|R
5000|$|Gear sticks {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{found between the}} front seats of the vehicle, either on the center console (sometimes even quite far up on the dashboard), the transmission tunnel (errorenously called a console shifter when the floor shifter mechanism is bolted to the transmission tunnel with the center console {{to cover up the}} shifter assembly when used with a rear or front wheel drive vehicle), or directly on the floor. Some vehicles have a column shift where the lever is mounted on the steering column—this arrangement was almost standard practice in American vehicles from about 1939 until relatively recently. It had the added benefit of allowing for a full width bench-type front seat (though some models with bucket seating as an option include it). It has since fallen out of favor, although it can still be found widely on North American-market pick-up trucks, vans, emergency vehicles (both law enforcement and EMS - the column shifter is retained where a floor shifter is unfeasible due to mounting the mobile data terminal and 2-way radio), and [...] "full-size" [...] US sedans such as the Ford Crown Victoria. A dashboard mounted shift was common on certain French models such as the Citroën 2CV and Renault 4. Both the Bentley Mark VI and the Riley Pathfinder had their gear lever {{to the right of the}} <b>right-hand</b> drive driver's <b>seat,</b> alongside the driver's door, where it was not unknown for British cars to also have their handbrake. (Left-hand drive models received a column shift.) ...|$|R
60|$|On {{either side}} of the porch was a seat, and here a {{somewhat}} remarkable sight would have been revealed to any inquisitive eye peering through the aforesaid keyhole. Upon the left-hand seat lay seven dolls, upon the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> lay six; and so varied were the expressions of their countenances, owing to fractures, dirt, age, and other afflictions, that one would very naturally have thought this a doll's hospital, and these the patients waiting for their tea.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuel tank}} is located behind the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat.</b> The {{quantity}} {{can be read}} directly through a sight gauge behind the seat. The standard tank is 70 litres (18 US gallons) with 87 litres (23 US gallons) optional. Behind the left-hand seat is a small baggage compartment, with additional baggage space above and behind both seats.|$|E
50|$|The primary camera aircraft, a North American B-25 Mitchell {{set up as}} {{a camera}} ship by Greg Board (of The War Lover fame) and flown by him, also appears in the film, {{dropping}} Bergman back into Norway. The director and former Mitchell bomber pilot Walter Grauman was delighted to fly the B-25 himself, acting as co-pilot in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1937 an air {{ambulance}} variant RWD-13S was built (prototype markings SP-BFN), with a starboard hatch for stretchers in the fuselage. There was {{also developed a}} similar universal variant RWD-13TS (or ST, or S/T), that could be converted from a touring plane to an ambulance by removing the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat.</b> By 1939, 15 RWD-13S were made, including a few RWD-13TS. A development of the RWD-13 was the five-seater RWD-15.|$|E
50|$|Management of {{individual}} {{assets in the}} airline industry is derived from the military terminology, where an executive officer or first officer, is the second in command of the aircraft. In a fixed wing aircraft, the first officer sits in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat,</b> but on a rotary wing aircraft, they sit on the left. Management of the airline as a whole is more in-line with the corporate example above.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{objective}} was a planned extravehicular activity (EVA), or [...] "space walk", by the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> Pilot. The plan {{was for him}} {{to move to the}} rear of the spacecraft and strap himself into the Air Force's Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a 'rocket pack' which would allow the pilot controlled flight, independent of the capsule's life support system. Use of the AMU was not achieved due to Cernan experiencing high cardiac stress, overheating, and fatigue during EVA.|$|E
50|$|The {{crew were}} awakened at 4:19 am EST. After brief medical exams, they ate breakfast with the backup and support crews. They then {{put on their}} spacesuits and were taken by van to the launch site, where they arrived at 6:45 am. This was about 2½ hours before launch. During the launch phase of the flight, Scott sat in the {{left-hand}} seat of the CSM, Worden in the center seat, and Irwin in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s, Flagg was {{a fixture}} on game show panels. She {{is best known}} for her {{appearances}} on the game show Match Game (normally occupying the lower <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> next to regular panelist Richard Dawson). Her acting credits include the original Broadway production of The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (succeeding Carlin Glynn) and the following films: Some of My Best Friends Are..., Five Easy Pieces, Stay Hungry, Grease, and Crazy in Alabama, as well as minor roles in various television shows.|$|E
50|$|The Ca.135's {{fuselage}} shape {{was quite}} different from, for example, that of the Fiat BR.20. If the latter resembled the American B-25 Mitchell, the Ca.135, with its low fuselage more resembled the American B-26 Marauder. Its long nose accommodated the bomb-aimer (bombardier) and a front turret (similar to the Piaggio P.108 and later British bombers). The front part of the nose was detachable to allow a quick exit from the aircraft. It also had two doors in the cockpit roof, giving the pilots the chance to escape in an emergency. The <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> could fold up to assist entry to the nose.|$|E
50|$|Both {{travel to}} the Quirino Grandstand aboard any of the Presidential cars. Following protocol, the {{outgoing}} President takes the back <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> of the vehicle, while the President-Elect is seated behind the chauffeur. At the Grandstand's parade grounds, the outgoing President will be welcomed with arrival honours, and then shake hands with the President-Elect. The outgoing President conducts a final troop review and is presented to the public before departing the Grandstand aboard their own private vehicle. Only Corazón Aquino broke with the custom of leaving the Grandstand immediately, choosing instead to stay {{until the end of}} Fidel Ramos's inaugural speech.|$|E
50|$|Those {{pilots who}} train to fly transports, tankers and other multi-engine {{aircraft}} begin with small multi-engine aircraft {{such as the}} T-44A Pegasus variant of the Beechcraft King Air. Once they have mastered this, they may begin to fly in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> of an operational type. Some airforces will seek to use a restricted number of multi-engined aircraft, with the derivatives of a basic aircraft filling different roles so that a pilot qualified on one of its types can easily convert {{to others in the}} same family. For example, the Boeing 707 was a popular airliner for conversion to tanker, transport and ELINT variants by numerous air forces.|$|E
5000|$|Certified on 11 November 1993, the T67M260 added {{even more}} {{power from the}} six-cylinder, [...] Lycoming AEIO540-D4A5 engine, three blade {{constant}} speed prop. Unusually for side-by-side light aircraft, the T67M260 was built to be flown solo from the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> to allow student pilots to immediately {{get used to the}} left-hand throttle found in most military aircraft - earlier models of the T67M had a second throttle on the left-hand sidewall of the cabin. A total of 51 T67M-260s were produced. They were used to successfully train hundreds of RAF, RN, British Army, and foreign and Commonwealth pilots through Joint Elementary Flying Training School until late 2010.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{aircraft}} typically flew with one pilot, there were positions for two. The left-hand position {{was the main}} one, with the instrument panel and a fixed seat, while the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> could be folded away to allow access to the nose gun-position via a crawl-way. An unusual feature was that the control column was not a fixed fitting in the usual way, but could be unplugged from either of two sockets at floor level. It became a habit for only one column to be in use; and when control was passed from the pilot to co-pilot or vice versa, the control column would simply be unplugged and handed over. Behind the cockpit, {{there was a small}} cabin with work stations for the navigator and radio operator.|$|E

5000|$|As well as {{maintaining}} {{the security of}} the Chamber, Galleries and Committees of the House of Commons, the Doorkeepers also have ceremonial duties. When the Commons is in session the Principal Doorkeeper and his Deputy occupy two chairs {{on either side of the}} main entrance. The Principal Doorkeeper sits in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat,</b> which contains the original division bell, though an electronic system is now is use. When house divides to vote members have eight minutes before the doorkeepers close and lock the doors to the chamber preventing anyone from entering. However at the end of each sitting the original bell is rung, and the two doorkeepers simultaneously shout [...] "Who goes home?". The Principal Doorkeeper's seat also contains a box of snuff, which has been there for the use of members and officials ever since smoking was banned in the chamber in 1693.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{version of}} the Intruder was built around the complex and {{advanced}} DIANE (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment), intended to provide {{a high degree of}} bombing accuracy even at night and in poor weather. DIANE consisted of multiple radar systems: the Norden Systems AN/APQ-92 search radar replacing the AN/APQ-88 on YA-6A, and a separate AN/APG-46 for tracking, AN/APN-141 radar altimeter, and AN/APN-122 Doppler navigational radar to provide position updates to the Litton AN/ASN-31 inertial navigation system. An air-data computer and the AN/ASQ-61 ballistics computer integrated the radar information for the bombardier/navigator (BN) in the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat.</b> TACAN and ADF were also provided for navigational use. When it worked, DIANE was perhaps the most capable nav/attack system of its era, giving the Intruder the ability to fly and fight in even very poor conditions (particularly important over Vietnam and Thailand during the Vietnam War). It suffered numerous teething problems, and it was several years before its reliability was established.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{single engine}} was an uncowled, [...] Walter-built Jupiter IV on a steel tube {{mounting}} {{and with a}} pair of long, airfoil-section fuel tanks placed on the upper wing near the ends of the centre-section. Behind its firewall the fuselage, built from steel tubes, was rectangular in section and housed a passenger cabin 3 m long fitted with six permanent and two folding seats. Each passenger in the fixed places had a window in the plywood walls. There was engine access via a hatch {{in the front of the}} cabin and a toilet at the back. Doors over the wings gave access to the cabin. The A.23 was flown from an open, side-by-side cockpit in the upper fuselage aft of the cabin, with the captain on the left and second pilot/radio operator at his right. A door below the <b>right-hand</b> <b>seat</b> gave access to the engine hatch via the cabin. The cockpit was normally accessed accessed through a low, tetragonal, port-side door.
