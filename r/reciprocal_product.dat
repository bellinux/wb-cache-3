50|$|A Robertsonian {{translocation}} {{is a type}} of translocation involving two homologous (paired) or non-homologous chromosomes (i.e. {{two different}} chromosomes, not belonging to a homologous pair). A feature of chromosomes that are commonly found to undergo such translocations is that they possess an acrocentric centromere, partitioning the chromosome into a large arm containing the vast majority of its genes, and a short arm with a much smaller proportion of genetic content. During a Robertsonian translocation, the participating chromosomes break at their centromeres and the long arms fuse to form a single, large chromosome with a single centromere. The short arms also join to form a smaller <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product,</b> which typically contains only nonessential genes also present elsewhere in the genome, and is usually lost within a few cell divisions. This type of translocation is cytologically visible, and can reduce chromosome number (from 23 to 22 pairs, in humans) if the smaller chromosome that results from a translocation is lost in the process of future cellular divisions. However, the smaller chromosome lost may carry so few genes (which are, in any case, also present elsewhere in the genome) that it can be lost without an ill effect to the individual.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{investigates the}} {{principal}} screws and their pitches of screw systems {{from the viewpoint}} of line geometry. It starts from the fact that anyn-independent screws pertaining to a specified n-screw system can be utilized to determine the system, and the pitch of a unit screw is the half of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product</b> with itself. The <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product</b> matrix of a screw matrix is therefore defined to determine the principal pitches and the directions of the principal screw axes of the system. With matrix diagonalization procedure, one can immediately obtain the principal pitches and the principal screws of a screw system. The whole procedure is straightforward and easily understood by an engineer with primary knowledge of linear algebra. Besides, the computational effort is greatly reduced and the efficiency is better compared with other methods. As a matter of fact, the pitch of any screw of a screw system can be represented by a homogeneous quadratic form of the linear combination coefficients. The homogeneous quadratic equation of the pitch of a screw system represents a conic curve in a two-system and an ellipsoid or a hyperboloid in a three-system. Therefore, this article also provides such visualizations of the principal axes in two- and three-dimensional spaces at last...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a novel geometric analysis method of the singularity and kinestatic characteristics of robots. For non-redundant robots, there exist two uniquely determined Jacobians – the screw-based Jacobian and the reciprocal Jacobian. Here, it is shown that {{if some of}} the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products</b> between the column screws of the two Jacobians are close to zero, the robot is in the vicinity of a singular configuration and the corresponding columns of the Jacobian are involved in the singularity. From this observation, an invariant measure of closeness to a singularity is presented using the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, by considering the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products</b> between the actuated joint screws and column screws of the Jacobian, this measure is extended so that the concept of the kinestatic characterization index is presented for parallel robots. Since it is defined as the ratio of <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products</b> from the uniqueness of the two Jacobians, it represents a unique invariant characteristic of robots. From the singularity analyses of the planar 4 -bar linkage and the 3 -DOF parallel manipulator with PRS-serial chains, the validity of the proposed index is examined and the concept of a kinestatically balanced configuration is introduced as well...|$|R

In previous studies on the regulation of human IgG expression, we demonstrated that interleukin 10 (IL- 10) could stimulate IgG 1 and IgG 3 secretion by human CD 40 -activated naive (sIgD+) tonsillar B cells.

Likewise 1 -naphthylamine and 2 -naphthylamine are also nonmutagenic but the N-hydroxy derivatives are mutagenic in microorganisms. Apparently these compounds require metabolism to breakdown products {{which are then}} the proximately active agents, and microorganisms lack the enzymes necessary to effect this conversion. These compounds are mutagenic in Saccharomyces after conversion to breakdown products in an in vitro hydroxylation medium. The induction of mitotic crossing over in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by breakdown products of dimethylnitrosamine, diethylnitrosamine, 1 -naphthylamine and 2 -naphthylamine formed in the Udenfriend hydroxylation medium is reported in this communication. Mitotic crossing over was detected as red sectored colonies resulting from induced homozygosity of the ade 2 marker.

40|$|A {{positive}} selection system for intrachromosomal recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been developed. This {{was achieved by}} integration of a plasmid containing an internal fragment of the HIS 3 gene into its chromosomal location. This resulted in two copies of the HIS 3 gene one with a terminal deletion at the 3 ' end {{and the other with}} a terminal deletion at the 5 ' end. Reversion of the gene disruption could be brought about by plasmid excision, unequal sister chromatid exchange or sister chromatid conversion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to define the mechanisms involved in reversion of the gene disruption. The frequency of plasmid excision could be determined by placing a yeast sequence bearing an origin of replication onto the plasmid that was subsequently integrated into the yeast genome. Unequal sister chromatid exchange and conversion could be distinguished by determining the nature of the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product</b> by Southern blotting. The results indicate that reversion might occur mainly by conversion between sister chromatids. This is because the frequency of plasmid excision was about two orders of magnitude lower than the overall frequency of reversion and no <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product</b> indicative of sister chromatid exchange was found. The findings of this presentation suggest that conversion might be an important mechanism for recombination of sister chromatids and possibly for repair of damaged DNA in S or G(2) ...|$|E

The results confirm the map order and characteristics of four loci known to be involved in segregation distortion, namely Sd, E(SD), Rspins, M(SD). However, SD- 36 carries a fifth major locus involved in distortion. This locus is near pr in 2 L and has the effect of enhancing the degree of distortion.

In order to detect putative <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product(s),</b> we have now constructed precursor polyomavirus replicons which contain two copies, instead of one copy, of the viral intergenic region, including the origin of replication as well as both promoters. Upon transfection of mouse cells, constructs containing directly repeated intergenic regions yielded distinct amplifiable products, in number depending upon the functional integrity of both intergenic regions.

Most striking, however, is the observation that promoter function is required for recombination, while the origin of replication function may be needed only for amplification of the recombination product once it has been formed. The data reported here confirm and extend previous data suggesting that (i) transcription is instrumental in recombination between direct repeats and (ii) nonconservative recombination involving direct repeats relies upon two promoters of opposing polarities. In mammalian cells, homologous recombination occurs via a mechanism which is poorly understood. Indeed, one might have expected recombination to be mostly conservative, be-cause a conservative process would allow recombination with-out loss of genetic information.

The consistency between the force/motion transmissibility and the minimum singular value of the Jacobian for singularity identification is rigorously proved.

Above indices focus on the analysis of the input power efficiency of the driving joint and the output power efficiency of the branch. The power is calculated through the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>product</b> of twist and wrench screws. Screw theory is a powerful and systematic mathematical tool.

Some mutant alleles of RAD 3 (rad 3 - 101 and rad 3 - 102) have partial defects in DNA repair {{and a strong}} hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype associated with rad 3 - 101 and rad 3 - 102 can be explained {{as a consequence of}} persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. The systems previously used to characterize the hyper-Rec phenotype of rad 3 strains do not detect the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products</b> of mitotic recombination. We have further characterized these events using a system in which the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products</b> of mitotic recombination are recovered. Both rad 3 - 101 and rad 3 - 102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100 -fold. Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs). The remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. We mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. We found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H 2 AX. In addition, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA 2 and HXT 11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. A comparison of these data with our previous analysis of spontaneous mitotic recombination events suggests that a sub-set of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.

Consistently, although resistance to γ-rays remains unaffected, MmRAD 51 stimulates whereas ScRAD 51 or SMRAD 51 prevents radiation-induced recombination. This suggests that mRAD 51 does not significantly affect the global DSB repair efficiency but controls the classes of recombination events.

Sequence analysis of these cases, which most likely represent independent duplication events, shows that breakpoints lie in the same region of inter-HERV sequence identity as do deletion breakpoints, and thus that the mechanism of duplication is indeed the reciprocal of deletion. Consideration of the accumulated Y-STR allele diversity between duplicated copies of the AZFa region indicates that one of the duplication chromosomes has been in the population for at least 17 generations, and therefore must be compatible with male fertility...|$|R
40|$|Cytogenetic {{studies have}} {{identified}} chromosome defects that are consistently associated with particular types oftumors, and therefore may represent genetic events that promote neoplastic development (1). Little {{is known about}} the mechanisms by which such chromosome abnormalities arise. Nevertheless, chromosome defects associated with lymphoid tumors frequently feature cytogenetic breakage within the Ig or TCR genes. Moreover, breakage usually occurs adjacent to the rearranging elements of these loci, e. g., the V, D, and J gene segments that recombine during normal lymphoid development (2). This phenomenon has fueled speculation that chromosome defects involving the Ig/TCR loci arise due to aberrant activity of the same recombinase that mediates normal V-J and VDJ rearrangement. Gene rearrangements within the Ig/TCR loci are directed by recombination signals that flank the rearranging gene segments and presumably serve as recognition sites for the Ig/TCR recombinase (3 - 5). During normal Ig-TCR gene rearrangment, two <b>reciprocal</b> <b>products</b> o £ recombination are generated: a "codingjoint, which constitutes the fusion of two gene segments of the rearranging locus; and a "signal joint,"...|$|R
