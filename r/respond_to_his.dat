5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, the National Liberal Ministry of Dimitrie Sturdza removed Creangă {{from his}} schoolteacher's post, and he {{subsequently}} left for Bucharest {{in order to}} petition for his pension rights. Having hoped to be granted assistance by Maiorescu, he was disappointed when the Junimea leader would not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> request, and, during his final years, switched allegiance to the literary circle founded by Nicolae Beldiceanu (where he was introduced by Gruber). Among Creangă's last works was a fourth and final part of his Memories, most likely written during 1888. The book remained unfinished, as did the story Făt-frumos, fiul iepei ("Făt-Frumos, Son of the Mare"). He died after an epileptic crisis, {{on the last day}} of 1889, his body being buried in Iași's Eternitatea Cemetery. His funeral ceremony was attended by several of Iași's intellectuals (Vasile Burlă, A. C. Cuza, Dumitru Evolceanu, Nicolae Iorga and Artur Stavri among them).|$|E
5|$|Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, then {{located in}} Zagreb, {{along with the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia, sent a {{delegation}} to 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar urging them to issue arms to workers to help defend Zagreb. Pavle Gregorić, {{who was a member}} of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković, but could not convince him to do so. On the same day, Maček, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post-Yugoslav coup d'état government of Dušan Simović, agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, but they did not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> appeal.|$|E

Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E

5|$|As secretary, Calhoun had {{responsibility}} for management of Indian affairs. He promoted a plan, adopted by Monroe in 1825, {{to preserve the}} sovereignty of eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments. In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes. Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War, which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe. The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams–Onís Treaty. A reform-minded modernizer, he attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian Department and in the Army by establishing new coastal and frontier fortifications and building military roads, but Congress either failed to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> reforms or responded with hostility. Calhoun's frustration with congressional inaction, political rivalries, and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824. The responsibilities of the bureau were to manage treaty negotiations, schools, and trade with Indians, in addition to handling all expenditures and correspondence concerning Indian affairs. Thomas McKenney was appointed as the first head of the bureau.|$|E

On November 17, 2009, Tequila sued Merriman for $1.5 million. Several weeks later, Merriman countersued, alleging intentional interference with contract, unfair competition, and trademark infringement. She declined to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> more recent actions, and a default judgment was entered in his favor for $2 million.|$|E

25|$|The current Chief Scout of The Scout Association of Australia is Sir Peter Cosgrove, {{who is the}} Governor-General of Australia. The Chief Scout of {{each state}} branch had usually been the Governor of the state. In 2015, the actor Shane Jacobson was {{appointed}} as the Chief Scout of the Victorian branch. In 1942, Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, the Governor of Queensland, resigned as The Boy Scouts Association's Chief Scout of Queensland due {{to the failure of}} the Queensland Branch to <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> call for reforms to its centralisation effort that led to the severance of the Mount Morgan Blue Boy Scouts.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} script of Shadow Complex {{was written}} by comic book writer and Star Trek novelist Peter David. The game follows Jason Flemming and his new girlfriend Claire, who opts to explore some caverns the two stumble across. When she does not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> calls, Jason follows her. He finds a massive underground complex with soldiers and high-end technology. Jason must rescue Claire and discover the plot behind the faction operating the complex. The game, inspired by the Metroid series, is a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game where the player controls Jason through the underground complex, defeating hostile forces, and finding various power-ups that enable further exploration of the complex.|$|E

25|$|Before {{boarding}} the simulators, each rider {{is assigned}} an on-board role (navigator, pilot, commander, or engineer) and given two tasks to perform during the mission (pressing a specific button when prompted). For example, {{one of the}} commander's buttons initiates the rocket's first-stage separation, and the other activates manual flight control. The spacecraft's on-board self-automated pilot will perform each task if the rider does not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> or her prompt from Mission Control or {{if there is no}} one to perform the task. Also featured are various labeled buttons and switches which the rider may play with but do nothing; they are only there to add to the realism aspect of the ride.|$|E
25|$|Mourinho {{once again}} sparked {{controversy}} in the summer with his argument with Italy national team coach Marcello Lippi. Lippi predicted that Juventus would win the Scudetto in the 2009–10 season, which Mourinho viewed as disrespectful to Inter. The previous year, Lippi predicted Inter would win the title and Mourinho did not <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> prediction. Lippi responded by saying that Mourinho was equal to Ciro Ferrara and Leonardo at Juventus and Milan, respectively, only {{that he was more}} experienced. After the row with Lippi, he clashed with Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro over Davide Santon's place in the Inter squad. Cannavaro had said that Santon might have to leave Inter to get regular playing time to gain selection for Italy in the upcoming World Cup. Mourinho responded by saying that Cannavaro was acting like a coach.|$|E
25|$|Quintana's next {{fight was}} against Nurhan Suleyman, on February 25, 2005. The card was {{organized}} in Miami, Oklahoma, and {{was scheduled for}} ten rounds. Early {{in the first round}} Quintana connected a solid punch on Suleyman's chin, and subsequently began boxing while his opponent followed him around the ring, he closed the first round connecting two combinations. This pattern continued in the second round when Quintana relied on boxing and connecting jabs, the round closed with both men trading punches. Quintana controlled the fight's tempo in the third and began the fourth round on the offensive scoring solid punches while trading combinations with his adversary, with one minute remaining in the round Quintana scored a knockdown and the fight was stopped seconds after when Suleyman didn't <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> attack.|$|E

In December, Polly's husband Richard offered to divorce her, and in February 1922, their marriage was legally ended.|$|E
