In this paper, a research involving the design of bicycle wheel that has a spring system between the hub and <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> which provide tangential suspension to the rider from bumps and potholes on the road is reported. During this research, concept sketches for the proposed design were arrived from morphological chart and then Pugh chart was used for concept selection. Material indices were arrived for bow spoke that act as spring system and suitable material was suggested. Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis was done for the proposed design concept and recommendations {{to reduce the risk}} priority number were discussed. Detailed design was carried out by considering factors that affect the stability of the bicycle. KEYWORDS...|$|E
40|$|PT. Yamaha Motor Kencana Indonesia is {{the liaison}} unit of Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd. to {{advertise}} its product in Indonesia, to compete the recent strict competition. In {{order to win}} the motorcycle competition and to dominate the selling market, Yamaha builds Yamaha Jupiter Z product with all the attributes so that the society {{would be able to}} have a various choice to manage the attitude in order to select the needed and desirable product. The purpose of the research is to acknowledge the costumer attitude upon product attribute offered by Yamaha Jupiter Z either intrinsic or extrinsic attribute. The research used descriptive research type and survey method. The taken samples were 100 respondents with the Yamaha Jupiter Z owning respondents characteristic in Semarang area. The sample method was the accidental sample. The research result shows that the overall score of the costumer attitude upon the intrinsic product attribute of Yamaha Jupiter Z was affection. Viewed from the global dimension of intrinsic attribute, there was affection for the performance attribute, affection for the durability, customary for the features, affection for the consistency, customary for the design, affection for the esthetic. While the costumer attitude upon the extrinsic attribute of Yamaha Jupiter Z was affection. Viewed from the global dimension of extrinsic attribute, there was affection for service reliability, affection for the self-expressive value attribute, affection for the effectiveness attribute, and affection for expense attribute. The conclusion of the research is that generally, the costumer attitude upon intrinsic and extrinsic attribute of Yamaha Jupiter Z brand motorcycle is affection. Despite, Yamaha still has to arrange renovation upon the global dimension, whose detail dimension has a customary attitude of the costumer, such as fuel consumption, motorcycle weight, suspension, fuel tank capacity, muffler, lamp design, panel design instrument, velg/ <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> design, seat design, and treatment expense. Besides, Yamaha should maintain and increase the costumer-adored attributes in order to increase the interest of the costumer upon Yamaha product...|$|E

5000|$|The Court {{characterized}} {{the facts as}} showing: [...] "As the Government puts it, the pattern was 'that of separate spokes meeting at a common center,' though we may add without the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wheel</b> to enclose the spokes." [...] The Court therefore held that while the indictment alleged one conspiracy the Government proved several (at least eight) conspiracies. That is, the Government failed to demonstrate the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wheel,</b> that connected the spokes to one another. [...] "Without the rim, an alleged hub-and-spoke cartel is merely a set of vertical relationships (or restraints) that result in parallel conduct and does not establish" [...] a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two aspects}} to how {{pneumatic}} tires support the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wheel</b> {{on which they}} are mounted.

40|$|Braking using brake-shoes causes tensile {{circumferential}} stresses in the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> railroad <b>wheels</b> {{and sometimes}} a growing of a heat crack till the failure <b>of</b> the <b>wheel.</b> In order to assure the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>wheels</b> {{and the safety of}} the traffic, the stress states in the rims have to be inspected periodically. Ultrasonic techniques have been optimized for that purpose. Using linearly polarized shear wave, the difference of the principal stresses acting in the circumferential and along the radial directions are evaluated as function of the distance from the rolling surface. Based on the IzfP prototype system for the automated ultrasonic time-of-flight measurement and evaluation of stress states, a system has been built and optimized for the automated data acquisition and evaluation of the profiles of the principal stress difference in <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> monoblock railroad <b>wheels...</b>|$|R

40|$|Residual tensile {{stresses}} in the <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> railroad <b>wheels</b> created by repeated applications of brakes {{have been known}} to contribute to catastrophic wheel failures. About 235, 000 potentially dangerous railroad wheels are being removed anually in the US to prevent the wheel-related accidents [1]. The current industrial standard determining the removal <b>of</b> a particular <b>wheel</b> from service is the federal regulation of a visual inspection method. In this method one determines the width of a discolored band in the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wheel</b> radially, and if the width exceeds 10 cm (4 in.) the wheel is considered potentially dangerous. Destructive test methods, e. g., hole-drilling and saw-cutting techniques, however, have shown that the visual inspection method is unreliable. Some wheels considered dangerous had no appreciable residual {{tensile stresses}}, while some considered safe (not discolored) had dangerous level of residual tensile stresses in the rim when saw-cut or hole-drilled. To improve the level of safety in railroad transportation and reduce waste, reliable NDE methods have been in great demand...|$|R

50|$|The mount/demount {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} the duckhead, swing arm, and vertical slide. The duckhead {{is at the bottom}} end of the vertical slide. The duckhead is uniquely shaped, like a tapered bill, to fit next and surround the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wheel.</b> It can either be made of metal or plastic. The duckhead mounts and demounts the tire from the wheel. The swing arm moves left and right. The purpose of the swing arm is to move the duck head near or away from the rim. The last component of the mount/demount mechanism is the vertical slide. The vertical slide moves up and down so that the duck head can fit onto the <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> different size <b>wheel</b> widths. The vertical slide has a spring and locking handle above the swing arm to set the duckhead and maintain a stable position around the rim.|$|R
