40|$|From 1995 to {{the present}} the {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) process has been under study at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). This is {{an account of the}} progressive emergence of a set of conceptual tools beginning with the discovery of the shear surface, wiping metal transfer, and the invention of a kinematic model and making possible a treatment of both metallurgical structure formation and process dynamics in friction stir welding from a unified point of view. It is generally observed that the bulk of the deformation of weld metal around the FSW pin takes place in a very narrow, almost discontinuous zone with high deformation rates characteristic of metal cutting. By 1999 it was realized that this zone could be treated as a shear surface like that in simple metal cutting models. At the shear surface the seam is drawn out and compressed and pressure and flow conditions determine whether or not a sound weld is produced. The discovery of the shear surface was followed by the synthesis of a simple 3 - flow kinematic model of the FSW process. Relative to the tool the flow components are: (1) an approaching translational flow at weld speed V, (2) a rotating cylindrical plug flow with the angular velocity of the tool, and (3) a relatively slow ring vortex flow (like a smoke ring) encircling the tool and driven by shoulder scrolls and pin threads. The <b>rotating</b> <b>plug</b> flow picks up an element of weld metal, rotates it around with the tool, and deposits it behind the tool (wiping metal transfer); it forms plan section loops in tracers cut through by the tool. Radially inward flow from the ring vortex component retains metal longer in the <b>rotating</b> <b>plug</b> and outward flow expels metal earlier; this interaction forms the looping weld seam trace and the tongue and groove bimetallic weld contour. The radial components of the translational and ring vortex flows introduce parent metal intrusions into the small grained nugget material close to the tool shoulder; if this feature is pronounced, nugget collapse may result. Certain weld features, in particular internal banding seen in transverse section as onion rings and associated surface ridges called tool marks, have long implied an oscillation flow component, but have only recently been attributed in the literature to tool eccentricity. <b>Rotating</b> <b>plug</b> shape, typically a hollow cylinder flared at the end where it sticks to the shoulder, varies as pressure distribution on the tool determines where sticking occurs. Simplified power input estimates balanced against heat loss estimates give reasonable temperature estimates, explain why the power requirement changes hardly at all over a wide range of RPM s, and yield isotherms that seem to fall along boundaries of parameter windows of operation...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{conducted}} {{to measure the}} resistance experienced by light cylinders rolling over flat beds of granular media. Sand and glass spheres are used for the beds. The trajectories of the rolling cylinders are determined through optical tracking, and velocity and acceleration data are inferred through fits to these trajectories. The rolling resistance is dominated by a velocity-independent component, but a velocity dependent drag exceeding the expected strength of air drag is also observed. The results are compared to a theoretical model based on a cohesionless Mohr- Coulomb rheology for a granular medium {{in the presence of}} gravity. The model idealises the flow pattern underneath the rolling cylinder as a plastically deforming zone in front of a rigidly <b>rotating</b> <b>plug</b> attached to the cylinder, as proposed previously for cylinders rolling on perfectly cohesive plastic media. The leading-order, rate-independent rolling resistance observed experimentally is well reproduced by the model predictions...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{decommissioning}} {{project is}} underway {{to close the}} Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) “fast” reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Materials and Fuels Complex (MFC) facility near Idaho Falls, ID. The facility was placed in cold shutdown in 1994 and work began on {{the removal of the}} metallic sodium coolant. The bulk of the sodium was drained and treated beginning in 2001. The residual sodium heel was chemically passivated to render it less reactive in 2005 using a novel carbon dioxide treatment. Approximately 700 kg of metallic sodium and 3500 kg of sodium bicarbonate remain in the facility. A RCRA Waste Treatment Permit, issued in 2002 by the State of Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, requires annual progress toward closure of the facility, and that all regulated materials be removed or deactivated, and the waste products removed by 2022. The baseline sodium removal technology would result in about 100, 000 gallons of low-level waste solution requiring treatment along with separate handling of the large components (intermediate heat exchanger, <b>rotating</b> <b>plug,</b> etc) outside of the primary tank...|$|E
40|$|A pull plug {{friction}} weld, simply defined, comprises {{inserting a}} rotating cone-shaped cylinder into a somewhat cone-shaped {{hole in a}} plate. The <b>rotating</b> <b>plug</b> makes contact {{with the edge of}} the plate and the resulting friction generates heat. The temperature of the plate material eventually reaches a magnitude that will cause the plate material {{at the edge of the}} hole to flow. This can be termed a temperature dependent plastic flow. The rotation of the plug is terminated, additional pressure is applied and the metal at the interface of the two materials cools and welding occurs. This preliminary study addresses only three aspects of a complete analysis that is multi-faceted. The transient temperature distribution for different pull plug configurations has been studied in some detail even though the initial conditions and boundary conditions may still be deemed tentative. The stress distribution within the pull plug caused by the heating pressure was studied along with a preliminary analysis of the thermoelastic stress distribution caused by friction heating. There are no definitive results for the stress analysis. Additional study will be required...|$|E

40|$|NASA fs Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has {{recently}} invested {{much time and}} effort into the process development of Friction Pull Plug Welding (FPPW). FPPW, is a welding process similar to Friction Push Plug Welding in that, {{there is a small}} <b>rotating</b> part (<b>plug)</b> being spun and simultaneously pulled (forged) into a larger part. These two processes differ, in that push plug welding requires an internal reaction support, while pull plug welding reacts to the load externally. FPPW was originally conceived as a post proof repair technique for External Tank. FPPW was easily selected as the primary process used to close out the termination hole on the Constellation Program fs ARES I Upper Stage circumferential Self] Reacting Friction Stir Welds (SR]FSW). The versatility of FPPW allows it to also be used as a repair technique for both SR]FSW and Conventional Friction Stir Welds. To date, all MSFC led development has been concentrated on aluminum alloys (2195, 2219, and 2014). Much work has been done to fully understand and characterize the process fs limitations. A heavy emphasis has been spent on plug design, to match the various weldland thicknesses and alloy combinations. This presentation will summarize these development efforts including weld parameter development, process control, parameter sensitivity studies, plug repair techniques, material properties including tensile, fracture and failure analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Assume {{that the}} wave {{generator}} is the input rotation. As the wave generator <b>plug</b> <b>rotates,</b> the flex spline teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the flex spline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flex spline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flex spline in the opposite direction.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} thermal-hydraulics related {{criteria and}} preliminary concepts {{for a small}} (300 MWt), proliferation-resistant, liquid-metal-cooled reactor system. A main objective is to assess what extent of simplification is achievable in the concepts with {{the primary purpose of}} regaining economic competitiveness. The approach investigated features lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) and a low power density core for ultra-long core lifetime (goal 15 years) with cartridge core replacement at end of life. This potentially introduces extensive simplifications resulting in capital cost and operating cost savings including: (1) compact, modular, pool-type configuration for factory fabrication, (2) 100 +% natural circulation heat transport with the possibility of eliminating the main coolant pumps, (3) steam generator modules immersed directly in the primary coolant pool for elimination of the intermediate heat transport system, and (4) elimination of on-site fuel handling and storage provisions including <b>rotating</b> <b>plug.</b> Stage 1 natural circulation model and results are presented. Results suggest that 100 +% natural circulation heat transport is readily achievable using LBE coolant and the long-life cartridge core approach; moreover, it is achievable in a compact pool configuration considerably smaller than PRISM A (for overland transportability) and with peak cladding temperature within the existing database range for ferritic steel with oxide layer surface passivation. Stage 2 analysis follows iteration with core designers. Other thermal hydraulic investigations are underway addressing passive, auxiliary heat removal by air cooling of the reactor vessel and the effects of steam generator tube rupture...|$|E
40|$|In the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process, a rotating, {{shouldered}} tool with a {{threaded pin}} is inserted under pressure along the seam of {{two pieces of}} metal which are tightly clamped together, and secured against a rigid anvil underneath. The rotating pin travels along the seam and {{through a combination of}} pressure and friction heating produces a zone of plastic deformation around the pin within the workpiece {{on either side of the}} seam. As the pin is moved in the direction of welding, the plasticised material moves around the tool and bonds together behind it. The elements of the material flow behavior are a combination of three elements. There is a rotational transport of material being carried around the tool, extrusion of material being forced around the pin on both sides into the cavity created behind it, and a lifting and dropping of material as it is stirred and mixed by the rotating action of the pin. It was assumed that rotational motion of the plastic zone is the primary mechanism for transport of material around the welding tool. A kinematic mathematical model was used to compute trajectories of material movement for various distributions of rotational slip within the plastic zone. These trajectories were then compared with the results of an experiment that produced radiographs of markers embedded in a workpiece that was welded with the FSW process. It was assumed that the copper wire markers retained their original length as the aluminum material flowed around them. The kinematic model included a constraint so that the displacements were such that the total length of the wire markers did not increase after deformation. There was good agreement between the calculated trajectories for the case of localized slip at the outer surface of the plastic deformation zone and the radiographs of the copper wire markers. The trajectories differed markedly from the radiograph traces when a distributed slip zone was assumed. It was concluded that the flow field could be described generally by a <b>rotating</b> <b>plug</b> model with slip occurring on the surface at the outer boundary of the plastic zone...|$|E
40|$|In the {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (SFR), conventional optical visual inspections cannot be applied {{due to the}} opacity of sodium coolant. An inspection technique based on the ultrasound should be employed because the opacity of sodium prevents any conventional techniques using optical devices from being applied for under-sodium viewing of SFR [1]. Recently, the 10 m long plate-type ultrasonic waveguide sensor has been developed for the under-sodium viewing of SFR [2]. In the plate-type ultrasonic waveguide sensor, an ultrasonic transducer installs above reactor head which is in a relatively cold condition, A 0 mode Lamb wave is propagated in a plate waveguide and an ultrasonic beam is radiated into hot radioactive liquid sodium. Its imaging capability was successfully demonstrated through under-sodium experiments [3]. To enable ongoing operation, the SFR requires refueling and this refueling process {{is much more difficult}} than that of a pressurized-water reactor (PWR) because the SFR uses sodium as its coolant. Sodium reacts with air or water and thus the refueling in the SFR is conducted by <b>rotating</b> the rotation <b>plugs</b> in the reactor head without opening the reactor head. And {{to ensure the safety of}} refueling process, a ranging inspection that monitors the presence of any obstacles (control rods, fuel sub-assemblies, etc.) between the reactor core and the upper internal structure, which can disturb the rotation of the rotation plugs, is essential. In this work, the plate-type ultrasonic waveguide sensor that can radiate a horizontal ultrasonic beam has been newly designed for the ranging inspection of SFR. A beam profile measurement test was carried out first to investigate the characteristics of the developed sensor. And then several under-water tests in the mockup facility using the developed plate-type ultrasonic waveguide sensor were conducted to evaluate the feasibility for ranging inspection...|$|R
50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator, a flexspline, and a circular spline. More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.The wave generator {{is made up of}} two separate parts: an elliptical disk called a wave generator plug and an outer ball bearing. The gear plug is inserted into the bearing, giving the bearing an elliptical shape as well.The flexspline is like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is thick and rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, but in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around the outside of the open end of the flexspline. The flexspline fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator <b>plug</b> is <b>rotated,</b> the flexspline deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse but does not rotate with the wave generator.The circular spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The flexspline and wave generator are placed inside the circular spline, meshing the teeth of the flexspline and the circular spline. Because the flexspline has an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with the teeth of the circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} flexspline, along the major axis of the ellipse.Assume that the wave generator is the input rotation. As the wave generator <b>plug</b> <b>rotates,</b> the flexspline teeth which are meshed with those of the circular spline change. The major axis of the flexspline actually rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point at the same rate as the wave generator. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (for example two fewer) on the flexspline than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the flexspline would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth, for example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the flexspline in the opposite direction.For a strain wave gearing mechanism, the gearing reduction ratio can be calculated from the number of teeth on each gear: For example, if there are 202 teeth on the circular spline and 200 on the flexspline, the reduction ratio is (200 − 202)/200 = −0.01Thus the flexspline spins at 1/100 the speed of the wave generator plug and in the opposite direction. This allows different reduction ratios to be set without changing the mechanism's shape, increasing its weight, or adding stages. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|R
40|$|Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) {{consist of}} a metal alloy {{reinforced}} with ceramic particles or fibers. These materials possess a very high strength to weight ratio, good resistance to impact and wear, {{and a number of}} other properties which make them attractive for use in aerospace and defense applications. MMCs have found use in the space shuttle orbiter's structural tubing, the Hubble Space Telescope's antenna mast, control surfaces and propulsion systems for aircraft, and tank armors. The size of MMC components is severely limited by difficulties encountered in joining these materials using fusion welding. Melting of the material results in formation of an undesirable phase (formed when molten Aluminum reacts with the reinforcement) which leaves a strength depleted region along the joint line. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively nascent solid state joining technique developed at The Welding Institute (TWI) in 1991. The process was first used at NASA to weld the super lightweight external tank for the Space Shuttle. Today FSW is used to join structural components of the Delta IV, Atlas V, and Falcon IX rockets as well as NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and Space Launch System. A current focus of FSW research is to extend the process to new materials, such as MMCs, which are difficult to weld using conventional fusion techniques. Since Friction Stir Welding occurs below the melting point of the workpiece material, this deleterious phase is absent in FSW-ed MMC joints. FSW of MMCs is, however, plagued by rapid wear of the welding tool, a consequence of the large discrepancy in hardness between the steel tool and the reinforcement material. This chapter summarizes the challenges encountered when joining MMCs to themselves or to other materials in structures. Specific attention is paid to the influence of process variables in Friction Stir Welding on the wear process characterizes the effect of process parameters (spindle speed, traverse rate, and length of joint) on the wear process. A phenomenological model of the wear process was constructed based on the <b>rotating</b> <b>plug</b> model of Friction Stir Welding. The effectiveness of harder tool materials (such as Tungsten Carbide, high speed steel, and tools with diamond coatings) to combat abrasive wear is also explored. In-process force, torque, and vibration signals are analyzed to assess the feasibility of in situ monitoring of tool shape changes as a result of wear (an advancement which would eliminate the need for off-line evaluation of tool condition during joining). Monitoring, controlling, and reducing tool wear in FSW of MMCs is essential to implementation of these materials in structures (such as launch vehicles) where they would be of maximum benefit. The work presented here is extendable to machining of MMCs, where wear of the tool is also a limiting factor...|$|E
