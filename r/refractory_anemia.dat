40|$|Background. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia {{is close}} to, but {{separate}} from both myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes, and shows either myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic features. We ask whether this distinction {{may have a}} molecular basis. Design and Methods. We established the gene expression profiles of 39 samples of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (including 12 CD 34 -positive) and 32 CD 34 -positive samples of myelodysplastic syndromes by using Affymetrix microarrays, and studied the status of 18 genes by Sanger sequencing and array-comparative genomic hybridization in 53 samples. Results. Analysis of 12 mRNAS from chronic myelomonocytic leukemia established a gene expression signature of 122 probe sets differentially expressed between proliferative and dysplastic cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. As compared to the former, the latter overexpressed genes involved in red blood cell biology. When applied to 32 myelodysplastic syndromes this gene expression signature was able to discriminate <b>refractory</b> <b>anemias</b> with ring sideroblasts from <b>refractory</b> <b>anemias</b> with excess of blasts. By comparing mRNAS from these two forms of myelodysplastic syndromes we derived a second gene expression signature. This signature separated the myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative forms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemias. These results were validated by using two independent gene expression data sets. We found that myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukemias are characterized by mutations in transcription/epigenetic regulators (ASXL 1, RUNX 1, TET 2) and splicing genes (SRSF 2) {{and the absence of}} mutations in signaling genes. Conclusions. Myelodysplastic chronic myelomonocytic leukemias and <b>refractory</b> <b>anemias</b> with ring sideroblasts share a common expression program suggesting {{they are part of a}} continuum, which is not totally explained by their similar but not identical mutation spectrum...|$|R

To this aim we measured sTfR and ferritin levels and their ratio (the sTfR/ferritin index) and other hematological parameters in 42 anemic children (20 with and 22 without celiac disease) vs. 22 non-anemic children with celiac disease and 31 healthy controls (age range 4 - 12 years). Hemoglobin parameters, mean cell volume, and serum iron and ferritin levels were decreased to a similar extent in the anemic patients (celiac and non-celiac).
