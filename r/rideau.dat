Uteck's successor, Stephen Wallace, resided in <b>Rideau</b> Cottage until the weekend of 24–25 October 2015, when he vacated the premises to allow then prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau and his family {{to live in the}} house while the traditional official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada, 24 Sussex Drive, was undergoing assessment for repairs and restoration.|$|E

5|$|With Canada at war for {{the first}} time since its version of the Victoria Cross was created, {{preparations}} for a physical cast of the medal were initiated in 2006, when a committee called the Victoria Cross Production Planning Group was formed under the leadership of the Chancellery of Honours at <b>Rideau</b> Hall. It originally consisted of representatives from the Department of National Defence, Veterans Affairs Canada, and the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada, and the group later expanded to include individuals from the Department of Canadian Heritage, Natural Resources Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mint, with assistance provided by the Queen and the British Ministry of Defence. Following their research and deliberations, the first Victoria Cross decoration was struck in 2007, as confirmed by Deputy Herald Chancellor Emmanuelle Sajous, and the medal was officially released to the public on 16 May 2008 by Governor General Michaëlle Jean at <b>Rideau</b> Hall. It was one of 20 cast, each of which is composed of three groupings of metals: that of a Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol (18541855), donated by Queen Elizabeth II; a Confederation Medal, created to mark Canada's confederation in 1867; and a selection of metals from each of Canada's regions. These were cast, rather than struck, continuing the tradition started in the United Kingdom when it was found the metal alloy was too brittle for striking, and finished at the Royal Canadian Mint. The first two were sent to Buckingham Palace for addition to the British Royal Collection and other specimens were kept as part of the Crown Collection at <b>Rideau</b> Hall, as well as at the Department of National Defence, Library and Archives Canada, and the Canadian War Museum.|$|E

The latter organized protests outside of <b>Rideau</b> Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rideau</b> Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different brick, added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior brick of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like brick. (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each brick and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} {{is located at}} <b>Rideau</b> Hall, the official residence of the monarch and the governor general.

The CHA is currently organized in an office called the Chancellery of Honours, the same office that issues Canadian orders and decorations, such as the Order of Canada. The deputy secretary that administers the Chancellery of Honours is also the Deputy Herald Chancellor.|$|E

He played with the <b>Rideaus</b> through the 1933-34 season, going to the Allan Cup in 1932-33 and 1933-34. He joined the Ottawa Senators and in 1934-35 he became {{property}} of the Boston Bruins and played three games for the Bruins in 1935-36, and the bulk of the season for their CAHL affiliate Boston Cubs. He returned to Ottawa after the season and did not report to the Providence Reds the following season and was suspended. He played for the Senators in 1937-38, and after another year off due to suspension of his amateur status, played for various amateur teams until 1946-47. He made it to the Allan Cup finals again in 1940-41 with the Hull Volants of the Ottawa City Senior Hockey League.|$|R

5|$|On August 25, 1996 the City of Kingston proclaimed Molly Brant Commemoration Day. The Mohawk Nation - Bay of Quinte, the Corporation of the City of Kingston, the City of Kingston Historical Board, and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada {{had agreed}} to commemorate her life with the {{creation}} of a bust representing Molly Brant, along with an historic monument at the front entrance of Rideaucrest Home on <b>Rideau</b> Street in Kingston. John Boxtel was commissioned to make the bust. The memorial sculpture was unveiled at Rideaucrest on Molly Brant Commemoration Day. The commemoration began with a service at St. George's Cathedral, a traditional Mohawk tobacco burning and a wreath-laying ceremony at St. Paul's Anglican Church, and a reception at Rideaucrest. The sculpture of Molly Brant was unveiled in the eastern courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} the OHA {{champion}} for that league's first three years. The first championship was played on March 7, 1891, at the <b>Rideau</b> rink and was won 5–0 by Ottawa over Toronto St. George's. The 1891 championship {{was the only}} OHA final played in Ottawa, as Ottawa played the 1892 final in Toronto, defeating Osgoode Hall 4–2, and in 1893 the Toronto Granites defaulted by not appearing for the championship match scheduled for Ottawa. The club resigned from the OHA in February 1894 after the OHA refused the club's demand to have the 1894 final in Ottawa and ordered Ottawa HC to play the final in Toronto. The dispute caused a permanent schism between Ottawa area teams competing in the Ottawa City Hockey League (OCHL) and the Ontario Hockey Association. Ottawa and area teams remain unaffiliated with the OHA; the official association under Hockey Canada is Hockey Eastern Ontario, a descendant of the OCHL.|$|E
