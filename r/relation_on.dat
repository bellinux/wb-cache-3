5|$|Worawongsathirat's reign was short. Within 42 days several nobles and {{government}} officials of Ayutthaya plotted to remove him from the throne. The conspirators were led by Khun Phiren Thorathep, a descendant on his father's side to the kings of Sukhothai and a <b>relation</b> <b>on</b> his mother's side to King Chairacha. The usurper was lured {{from the safety of}} the palace into the jungle with a promise of capturing a large elephant. As the usurper king, Si Sudachan and their infant daughter proceeded by royal barge, Khun Phiren Thorathep and his conspirators sprang an ambush, killing all three. Prince Thianracha was immediately invited to leave the Sangha and assume the throne as King Maha Chakkraphat. One of his first acts was to appoint Khun Phiren Thorathep as King of Sukhothai (but as a vassal to himself) with a capital at the great fortified town of Phitsanulok. The king then bestowed upon him the title Maha Thammaracha (a title used by the last four kings of Sukhothai), along with the hand of his daughter Princess Sawatdirat in marriage.|$|E

We present the inclusion diagram of the tree transformation classes induced by these restricted ground tree transducers. We show that the following four classes of term relations are the same: (i) tree transformations induced by symmetric deterministic ground tree transducers, (ii) congruence <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> term algebras induced by reduced ground term rewriting systems, (iii) congruence <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> term algebras induced by convergent ground term rewriting systems, and (iv) finitely generated congruence <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> term algebras. As a by-product of our results, we obtain a new ground completion algorithm. Moreover, we show that the following three classes of term <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> term algebras {{with at least one}} non-nullary function symbol are also the same: (i) tree transformations induced by total symmetric deterministic ground tree transducers, (ii) congruence <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> term algebras of finite index, (iii) finitely generated congruence <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> term algebras of which the trunk is the whole set of terms...|$|R

25|$|A {{function}} with these three properties {{is sometimes called}} bicontinuous. If such a function exists, we say X and Y are homeomorphic. A self-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism of a topological space and itself. The homeomorphisms form an equivalence <b>relation</b> <b>on</b> the class of all topological spaces. The resulting equivalence classes are called homeomorphism classes.|$|E
25|$|Giusto Bellavitis {{abstracted}} {{the basic}} idea in 1835 when he established the concept of equipollence. Working in a Euclidean plane, he made equipollent any pair of line segments of the same length and orientation.

25|$|Note {{that the}} {{equivalence}} relation generated {{in this manner}} can be trivial. For instance, the equivalence relation ~ generated by any total order on X has exactly one equivalence class, X itself, because x ~ y for all x and y.

40|$|AbstractFor which {{adjacency}} relations (i. e., irreflexive symmetric binary <b>relations)</b> α <b>on</b> Zn does {{there exist}} a topology τ on Zn {{such that the}} τ-connected sets are exactly the α-path-connected subsets of Zn? If such a topology exists then we say that the relation α is topological. Let l 1 and l∞, respectively, denote the 4 - and the 8 -adjacency <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> Z 2 and the analogs of these two <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> Zn (for any positive integer n). Consider adjacency <b>relations</b> α <b>on</b> Zn such that 1. For x,y∈Zn,xl 1 y⇒xαy⇒xl∞y. 2. For all x∈Zn, the set {x}∪{y|xαy} is l 1 -path-connected. Among the uncountably many adjacency relations α satisfying conditions 1 and 2 above, Eckhardt and Latecki showed that there are (up to isomorphism) just two topological <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> Z 2, and essentially showed that there are just four topological <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> Z 3. We show in this paper that for any positive integer n there are only finitely many topological adjacency <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> Zn that satisfy conditions 1 and 2, and we relate the problem of finding these relations {{to the problem of}} finding all sets of vertices of an n-cube such that no two vertices in the set are the endpoints of an edge of the n-cube. From our main theorems we deduce the above-mentioned results of Latecki and Eckhardt, and also deduce that there are (again, up to isomorphism) exactly 16 topological adjacency <b>relations</b> <b>on</b> Z 4 that satisfy conditions 1 and 2...|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, a well-order (or well-ordering or well-order <b>relation)</b> <b>on</b> a set S is a {{total order}} on S with the {{property}} that every non-empty subset of S has a least element in this ordering. The set S together with the well-order relation is then called a well-ordered set. In some academic articles and textbooks these terms are instead written as wellorder, wellordered, and wellordering or well order, well ordered, and well ordering.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} equivalence relations on any set X, when {{ordered by}} set inclusion, form a complete lattice, called Con X by convention. The canonical map ker: X^X → Con X, relates the monoid X^X of all functions on X and Con X. ker is surjective but not injective. Less formally, the equivalence relation ker on X, takes each function f: X→X to its kernel ker f. Likewise, ker(ker) is an equivalence <b>relation</b> <b>on</b> X^X.|$|E
25|$|Ordinal numbers can {{be defined}} with the same method used for {{cardinal}} numbers. Define two well-ordered sets {{to have the same}} order type by: there exists a bijection between the two sets respecting the order: smaller elements are mapped to smaller elements. Then an ordinal number is, by definition, a class consisting of all well-ordered sets of the same order type. To have the same order type is an equivalence <b>relation</b> <b>on</b> the class of well-ordered sets, and the ordinal numbers are the equivalence classes.|$|E

25|$|This {{statement}} {{implies that}} thermal equilibrium is an equivalence <b>relation</b> <b>on</b> {{the set of}} thermodynamic systems under consideration. Systems {{are said to be}} in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide if two bodies are at the same temperature, {{it is not necessary to}} bring them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time. The law provides an empirical definition of temperature and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.|$|E
25|$|Every {{countable}} limit ordinal requires {{replacement for}} its construction analogously to ω·2. Larger ordinals rely on replacement less directly. For example, ω1, the first uncountable ordinal, {{can be constructed}} as follows– the set of countable well orders exists as a subset of P(N×N) by separation and powerset (a <b>relation</b> <b>on</b> A is a subset of A×A, and so {{an element of the}} power set P(A×A). A set of relations is thus a subset of P(A×A)). Replace each well-ordered set with its ordinal. This is the set of countable ordinals ω1, which can itself be shown to be uncountable. The construction uses replacement twice; once to ensure an ordinal assignment for each well ordered set and again to replace well ordered sets by their ordinals. This is a special case of the result of Hartogs number, and the general case can be proved similarly.|$|E
