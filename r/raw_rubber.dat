The knowledge that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried only guns, chains, ordnance and explosives, but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the colony came back full of valuable products such as <b>raw</b> <b>rubber</b> and ivory, led him to the conclusion that Belgian King Leopold II's policy was exploitative.

With the increasing time of oven aging at 140 °C the decrease of both viscosity and stress relaxation rate expo-nent were observed.

2500|$|The first rubber condom was {{produced}} in 1855, and by the late 1850s several major rubber companies were mass-producing, among other items, rubber condoms. A main advantage of rubber condoms was their reusability, making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, {{by the end of}} the 19th century [...] "rubber" [...] had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world. [...] For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of <b>raw</b> <b>rubber</b> around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber. [...] The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies.|$|E
