40|$|Background: This {{study will}} present {{five years of}} {{retrospective}} data from journals concerning diabetes- 2 patients with unsatisfactory bloodglucosecontrol <b>refferred</b> <b>to</b> the Endocrinological outpatientclinic at Aker University Hospital. Data and method: Starting with refferred diabetes- 2 patients, we sorted out our population by following crieria: They needed to have had diabetes {{for more than one}} year and not be on insulin treatment {{at the time of their}} first consultation at the clinic. They had <b>to</b> have been <b>refferred</b> for unsatisfactory bloodglucosecontrol, and because of the need for successive data they had to have had three or more consultations. These criteria accumulated 97 journals. Results: Our primary interest was if the bloodglucoselevel, represented by HbA 1 c, declined following treatmentat the clinic. For asian women the average decline in HbA 1 c was 1. 14 %points, the decline amongst norvegian women was 1. 16 %points, asian men 0. 41 %points and norvegian men 1. 32 %points. In the total population HbA 1 c declined 1. 01 %points. Comparative data are collected from the start of treatment and again after 6 - 8 months. Interpretation: Patients <b>refferred</b> <b>to</b> the outpatientclinic because of unsatisfactory bloodglucose control have assumably exhausted the potential for improved control that the primary healthcare service can provide. Our study suggests a benefit from refferral to a specialist when it comes to bloodglucose control. Since this study is retrospective the instigated treatment has not quite been in accordance with the recommended treatment of today, as suggested by the FINFAT study. Even better bloodglucose control following updated treatment protocols can be expected...|$|R

The material consists of comments about eight rides, four performed by female riders and four by male riders, from two large international world cup competitions in dressage, broadcasted on SVT in 2012 and 2013. The material has been transcribed and then analyzed using content analytic method with a quantitative and a qualitative part. The results of the survey’s quantitative part showed that the male riders were <b>reffered</b> <b>to</b> by their first and last name in combination in more cases than the female riders, although ”she/he” was the type of mention most used for both male and female riders. The results of the survey’s qualitative parts showed that gender stereotypes of neither sex occurred to any great extent and that the comments about external factors, such as riders appearances, while there weren’t that many, were nevertheless used similarily for both sexes, even though the material analyzed didn’t produce many examples of comments of this sort...|$|E

Multiple regression indicated that the Elaboration by recall scale explained 3 % of test performances, but the Elaboration in daily life and the Between-item and Within-item Elaboration scales did not. The second study developed the children's scales and investigated the developmental change in elaborative learning behaviors. The subjects were 29 fourth, 39 fifth and 35 sixth graders.
