50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of <b>filaments</b> per <b>yarn</b> count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon <b>filament</b> <b>yarn,</b> but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Textile Research Journal and the definitive published version is available at:[URL] comprehensive review of the roles played by the airflow, wetting and spin finish on the air-jet texturing process is given. An experimental investigation of the air-jet texturing process using residual spin finish, yarn-to-yarn static and kinetic friction, filament strength, filament diameter, and on-line tension measurements and high-speed cine-photography is reported. <b>Filament</b> <b>yarn</b> motion in {{different regions of the}} texturing nozzle during dry and wet texturing is analysed. It is found that water acts as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the wet texturing process as the <b>filament</b> <b>yarn</b> travels through the nozzle enabling easier relative motion of the filaments resulting in enhanced entanglement. Wet texturing also reduces spin finish on the yarn surface, which in turn, causes an increase in static friction between the filaments of the textured yarn resulting in better fixing of the loops and consequently superior yarns...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single <b>filament</b> <b>yarn</b> is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more <b>filaments</b> <b>yarns</b> are fed at the same overfeed into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> are fed under different overfeeds into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower overfeed yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher overfeed yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn overfeed determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn overfeed determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn overfeed is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R

Further we have noticed that the orientation and configuration of the reinforcing fiber material is quite influenced by the handling in the further processing steps, which leads to the need of a sustainable structural stabilization.

40|$|The {{geometrical}} model of yarn currently in use {{is assumed to}} be a circular cylindrical under the bending deformation, but this assumption is not really true because the cross-section of yarn has to change to an elliptic shape when the compressive force acted on the yarn is considered. Therefore, as the first part of a series of work, the present paper considers the fact that yarn geometry changes from a circular cylindrical to an elliptical cylindrical under an external applied bending moment, and then analyzes the relationship of bending rigidity between constituent filaments and the formed yarn, which is useful in predicting or selecting specified bending property of filaments by the requirements of yarn. In the present paper, the bending and torsional energies stored in filaments are analyzed according to their deformations by the energy method. The explicit formula is then obtained to quantify the bending rigidity relationship between the <b>filament</b> and <b>yarn,</b> in which four characters are featured as the eccentricity of elliptical cross-section of yarn, the ratio of bending to torsional rigidity of filament, the helix angle of the <b>filament</b> on <b>yarn</b> surface and the number of <b>filaments</b> inside the <b>yarn.</b> Moreover, the bending rigidity of <b>filament</b> <b>yarns</b> formulated by an earlier method with a circle shape assumption can also be obtained by the proposed method with the eccentricity being equal to zero.
