50|$|IP tunnels {{are often}} used for {{connecting}} two disjoint IP networks that don't have a native routing path to each other, via an underlying <b>routable</b> <b>protocol</b> across an intermediate transport network. In conjunction with the IPsec protocol they {{may be used to}} create a virtual private network between two or more private networks across a public network such as the Internet. Another prominent use is to connect islands of IPv6 installations across the IPv4 Internet.|$|E
50|$|Brouters {{operate at}} both the network layer for <b>routable</b> <b>protocols</b> and at the data link layer for non-routable protocols. As {{networks}} continue to become more complex, a mix of <b>routable</b> and non-routable <b>protocols</b> {{has led to the}} need for the combined features of bridges and routers. Brouters handle both routable and non-routable features by acting as routers for <b>routable</b> <b>protocols</b> and bridges for non-routable protocols. Bridged protocols might propagate throughout the network, but techniques such as filtering and learning might be used to reduce potential congestion. Brouters are used as connecting devices in the networking system, so it acts as a bridge in a network and as a router in an internetwork.|$|R
50|$|Another {{misinterpretation}} is that routers cannot forward broadcasts under special circumstances. Some <b>routable</b> <b>protocols</b> {{support the}} use of internetwork-level broadcasts. If the router is configured to forward them, the broadcast domain segmentation is compromised.|$|R
5000|$|Multiprotocol router - The {{computer}} running RRAS can route IP, IPX, and AppleTalk simultaneously. All <b>routable</b> <b>protocols</b> are configured {{from the}} same administrative utility. RRAS included two unicast routing protocols, Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) as well as IGMP routing and forwarding features for IP multicasting.|$|R
50|$|The network {{controller}} implements the electronic circuitry required to communicate using a specific physical layer and {{data link layer}} standard such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel, or Wi-Fi (in the past: Token Ring, FDDI, ATM, ARCNET). This provides a base for a full network protocol stack, allowing communication among small groups of computers on the same local area network (LAN) and large-scale network communications through <b>routable</b> <b>protocols,</b> such as Internet Protocol (IP).|$|R
5000|$|Certain data-center {{applications}} (such {{as large}} computer clusters) {{require the use}} of fiber-optic interconnects due to the distance limitations inherent in copper cabling. Typically, a network-oriented standard such as Ethernet or Fibre Channel suffices for these applications, but in some cases the overhead introduced by <b>routable</b> <b>protocols</b> is undesirable and a lower-level interconnect, such as InfiniBand, RapidIO, or NUMAlink is needed. Local-bus standards such as PCIe and HyperTransport can in principle be used for this purpose, but [...] solutions are only available from niche vendors such as Dolphin ICS.|$|R
40|$|The Domain Name System (DNS) {{determines the}} major {{component}} in today's Internet, as it maps memorable names, such as www. uzh. ch into <b>routable</b> Internet <b>Protocol</b> addresses, such as 136. 105. 200. 244. Since {{the early days}} of trusted hosts in the Internet have passed, the potential of severe attacks on DNS has reached a level of higher risk, e. g. DNS Spoofing or Cache Poisoning, such that work on DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) did commence. However, the deployment of DNSSEC has not reached that large attention needed to safeguard fully future Internet communications for all services...|$|R
