5|$|This {{is a list}} of all Pacific typhoons {{that have}} had their names retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency. A total of 38typhoon names have been retired since the start of {{official}} tropical cyclone naming in the western North Pacific Ocean in 2000. Tropical cyclone names are retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in a meeting in January or February. Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. Several names were removed or altered naming list for various <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> retirement. Collectively, retired typhoons have caused over $68billion in damage (USD), as well as over 12,000deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of retiring significant names was started during 1955 by the United States Weather Bureau in the Atlantic basin, after hurricanes Carol, Edna, and Hazel struck the Northeastern United States and caused {{a significant amount}} of damage in the previous year. Initially the names were only designed to be retired for ten years after which they might be reintroduced, however, it was decided at the 1969 Interdepartmental hurricane conference that any significant hurricane in the future would have its name permanently retired. Several names have been removed from the Pacific naming lists for various <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> for causing {{a significant amount of}} death/destruction, which include being pronounced in a very similar way to other names and for political reasons.|$|E

25|$|During British rule, in the Indian subcontinent, kings {{who were}} the patrons of temples and temple arts lost their power. As a result, devadasis were left without their {{traditional}} means of support and patronage. During colonial times, reformists worked towards outlawing the devadasi tradition on grounds that it supported prostitution. Colonial views on devadasis are hotly disputed by several groups and organizations in India and by western academics. The British were unable to distinguish the devdasi from the girls who danced in the streets for the <b>reasons</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> spiritual devotion to the deity. This caused socio-economic deprivation and perusal of folk arts.|$|E
25|$|Vocabulary, {{sentence}} structure, {{employment of}} idioms and common phrases, etc. are analyzed for consistency with the author’s other known works.

Percy argued that the speech and style of Colossians more strongly resembled Pauline authorship than not.
