40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to understand the flotation behavior of copper and gold minerals after <b>regrinding</b> the rougher flotation concentrate with a high pyrite content.

A number of methods were used to provide an oxidizing condition, including pre-aeration before flotation, <b>regrinding</b> in an oxidizing condition, and addition of different oxidizing agents during <b>regrinding.</b> It was found that all the oxidizing methods improved the flotation of copper and gold, however, the effectiveness of these methods varied from case to case.

These types of laboratory data are used to investigate the effect of reagent and <b>regrinding</b> of coarse particles in an industrial flotation circuit. The addition of collector (BX) has a significant effect on the flotation response of chalcopyrite in the scavenger bank. The reconstructed recovery-time curve (combine products) is greater than that of the rougher tailings (scavenger feed) prior to reagent addition. By adding collector (BX) in the scavenger feed, the ultimate recovery of chalcopyrite increases 20 % which means an increase of 1. 7 % of chalcopyrite recovery in the scavenger feed. Meanwhile, the reagrinding of coarse particles shows a detrimental effect on the collectorless flotation of an initially hydrophobic chalcopyrite sample. Cyclone underflow, 80 % recovery at pH 7. 7, was decreased to 40 % after <b>regrinding</b> at the same range of pH. The chalcopyrite flotation response immediately after <b>regrinding</b> is severely retarded. It is assumed that the centrifugal action of the cyclone is another important factor restoring the chalcopyrite hydrophobic flotation due to the oxygenation of the slurry. Therefore, additional preconditioning time after a <b>regrinding</b> stage should have a positive change in the recovery of chalcopyrite. The overall flotation response before and after the <b>regrinding</b> stage showed that the cyclone underflow response is slightly slower compared with the combine feed in the first four minutes of flotation.

Previous laboratory test work carried out on the ore showed an improvement in the flotation recovery of oxide minerals after regrinding the sulphide rougher tails with mild steel media. However, further investigation showed that the increase in recovery was not due to increased liberation.

In the Boliden area there are many important ore fields which contain gold, zinc, copper, silver and lead. The objective of this project was to investigate and provide the guidelines for the improvement of the <b>regrinding</b> in the ball mill in the Concentrator flotation circuit having influence on metal recovery. The report follows the ore flow from the mine, through the Concentrator and finally to the end product, concentrates. The evaluation leads to conclusions which parameters may affect the concentration process negative. It was discovered that there are problems with the ore stockpiles at the mine and the segregation of the fractions in the silos. It is proposed to install a cone {{on the top of the}} silos to reduce segregation of ore fractions. To reduce this problem Boliden should install a mobile conveyor on the way to the silos and to the ore stockpiles in the mine. This method has been successfully installed at the Aitik ore stockpiles near the new Concentrator. The main task of the thesis was to analyze metal distribution in the flotation circuit, especially technical analysis of <b>regrinding</b> effects on the results of flotation. The analysis of the sampled pulp from the flotation process was done in the Mineral Processing Laboratory and in the Process Laboratory in Boliden.

This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them.

Also, different collector regimes, involving sodium iso-butyl xanthate (SIBX) and N-butoxycarbonyl-nbutyl thionocarbamate (XD 5002), have been tested. It was found that aeration of the copper rougher feed produced lower gold (71 %) and copper (95 %) recoveries than the non-aeration of the copper rougher feed (73 % Au and 98 % Cu recoveries). Fine <b>regrinding</b> of the copper rougher tails increased both gold and copper recoveries in the subsequent flotation stage, due to improved liberation. The highest gold recovery from the rougher tailings (45 %) was achieved without aeration of the reground product. However, in these conditions poor rejection of pyrite was achieved, and the concentrate gold grade was low (1. 3 g/t, versus 2. 3 g/t obtained after aerating the pulp).

However, higher gold (3. 0 g/t) and copper (1. 0 %) grades were observed with XD 5002 alone, due to better pyrite rejection.

It thus becomes important to explore newer deposits of molybdenum and develop efficient beneficiation strategies to recover the metal. A potential source of primary rnolybdenite {{has been found in}} the Ham area of Dharmapuri district in Tamil Nadu. In the present investigation, taking into consideration the importance of the problem beneficiation studies have been undertaken on core - drill molybdenite ore samples from the Hanu area. Initially, detailed characterization of the molybdenite ore has been carried out with respect to its mineralogy and chemical composition. The X-ray diffkactogam of the ore has also been recorded These studies have indicated that quartz and sericite are the major minerals followed by carbonates and feldspar. Among the sulphide minerals, pyrite is dominant with trace amounts of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite. The molybdenum content in the ore sample has been determined to be about 0. 1 %. Liberation studies have revealed that molybdenum is more or less uniformly distributed in the different size fractions from 1. 7 mm down below to 75 microns. However, mineralogical analysis of the different size fractions has indicated that about 85 % of the molybdenite is liberated. from associated silicate and carbonates below 2 12 microns. The results of the flotation kinetic tests have shown that percentage recovery and grade of molybdenum foLZow an inverse relationship with time. Studies carried out to evaluate different reagent - combinations, reveal that optimum values of grade and recovery could be achieved using kerosene and M 1 IBC. Further, these studies have shown that flotation time of 4 minutes is adequate, as beyond this time the grade of molybdenum is found to deteriorate. Detailed mesh-of-grind studies have indicated that 20 minutes of grinding yields optimum values of molybdenum and lead in the float product and this time was fixed for all subsequent experiments. Preliminary experiments conducted to evaluate djfferent depressants for galena have shown that satisfactory results are obtained only with sodium dichromate. Optimisation studies performed to arrive at the dosage of sodium dichromate have shown that the addition of 0. 25 kg/t of sodium dichromate gives optimum results with respect to overall recovery and grade of molybdenum, copper and lead in the float and tailing fractions. In a similar manner, the optimum dosage of kerosene (collector for molybdenite) has been arrived at to be 0. 8 kg/t taking a holistic view of the grades and recoveries of the different metal values of interest. Based on the studies carried out with respect to optimization of the mesh-of-grind, depressant and collector concentrations, it became apparent that a grade of about 0. 8 % Mo only could be achieved with over 80 % recovery. The redeeming feature however was that over 90 % of the feed could be rejected at the rougher flotation stage itself with a negligence loss of about 0. 02 % Mo in the tailings. It was thus considered logical to further upgrade the Mo content by <b>regrinding.</b> An extensive flotation campaign was therefore mounted, adopting the following strategies: (1) Ist stage <b>regrinding</b> and one cleaning (2) IInd stage <b>regrinding</b> and three cleanings (3) IIIrd stage <b>regrinding</b> and two cleanings Based on the first stage <b>regrinding</b> tests it was found that by <b>regrinding</b> to 100 % passing 106 microns, the Mo assay could be enhanced to over 32 % from a initial value of about 0. 1 % in the feed. The enrichment ratio at this stage corresponds to about 340. After the second stage <b>regrinding</b> followed by three stages of cleaning, close to 75 % recovery of Mo with an assay value of about 52 % could be achieved, further enhancing the enrichment ratio to about 540. A few experiments were conducted using sodium cyanide during second stage <b>regrinding</b> tests and it was found that copper assay could be brought down to 0. 3 % from about 0. 8 %, without affecting the grade of lead and molybdenum. The results of the third stage <b>regrinding</b> tests have highlighted that a final concentrate assaying about 55 % molybdenum with over 70 % recovery could be obtained. It is worthy to mention that the concentrate so produced meets the specification of metallurgical grade molybdenite. The overall enrichment ratio obtained, commencing from a feed assaying 0. 1 % Mo, corresponds to about 580. In order to explore the efficacy of organic depressants, which are more acceptable on environmental grounds, detailed flotation studies were carried out using dextrin with particular emphasis on galena depression. A series of experiments was carried out in an identical manner to those conducted using sodium dichromate. Here again, three stages of regrinding/cleanings test where carried out, akin to those performed using sodium dichromate. A dextrin concentration of 0. 01 kg/t was found to be an optimum value from the point of grade, wt. % recovery and distribution of molybdenum, lead and copper in the cleaner concentrate. It is noteworthy that after second stage <b>regrinding</b> followed by four stages of cleaning, the molybdenum assay value has significantly improved from 16 % to about 53 % with over 70 % recovery. Another notable feature is that copper content in the concentrate is only about 0. 2 % even without the addition of sodium cyanide. The results of the third stage regrinding/cleaning tests have shown marginal improvement in the molybdenum assay values without affecting the grade of copper and lead. On a comparative basis, it can be inferred that dextrin holds promise {{to be used as a}} potential substitute for the inorganic depressants such as sodium dichromate and sodium cyanide. On the basis of the extensive investigations carried out on the beneficiation of molybdenite ore, a comprehensive flowsheet has been developed...|$|R
