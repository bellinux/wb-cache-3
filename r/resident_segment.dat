After I-380, PA 690 makes a short curve to the northeast before entering Moscow, where it gains the name of Church Street.Heading through Moscow, PA 690 is primarily residential, passing the local high school and into downtown, where commercial businesses begin to appear. In downtown Moscow, the highway intersects with PA 435 (Main Street) and turns south onto a concurrency on South Main Street. Paralleling the tracks of the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad, PA 690 soon splits off under the tracks. Turning northward after the underpass, PA 690 heads northward on Market Street, passing the former Moscow train station. The stretch along Market Street is mainly commercial, before the designation turns off Market at the intersection with Brook Street. Along Brook Street, the route is primarily residential. Before crossing the borough line, PA 690 remains known as Brook Street, but after the borough line, the route becomes woodlands. Soon changing names to Madisonville Road, PA 690 passes a residential complex and enters Madisonville, a rural hamlet. After the intersection with Reservoir Road, the highway turns from the northeast and curves into the hamlet of Aberdeen.|$|E
50|$|Nucleus {{implements}} a segmented memory system, with processes {{having their}} access to memory segments defined by the system tables, which is maintained by OS4000. OS4000 provides a memory system which handles both store-resident memory, and virtual memory backed by disk which is known as overlay, with overlaying being performed at the segment level. OS4000 also inherited grouped segments from DOS, {{where a group of}} segments were to be overlaid and retrieved as a single group, but this feature was very little used in OS4000. A process may use any mixture of <b>resident</b> and overlayable <b>segments,</b> although a process performing real-time tasks would normally be designed to only use <b>resident</b> <b>segments.</b>|$|R

40|$|Five spiny dogfish were {{captured}} in early-mid May during gillnet and longline sampling targeting juvenile coastal sharks in inshore North Carolina waters.   Dogfish captures were made within Back Sound and Core Sound, North Carolina. All dogfish were females measuring 849 - 905 mm total length, {{well over the}} size at 50 % maturity. Dogfish were caught at stations 1. 8 - 2. 7 m in depth, with temperatures 22. 9 - 24. 2 °C, 32. 8 - 33. 4 ppt salinity, and 6. 9 - 8. 0 mg/L dissolved oxygen. These observations are among {{the latest in the}} spring for spiny dogfish in the southeastern U. S. and occurred at higher temperatures than previously recorded for this species.   It is unclear whether late-occurring spiny dogfish in this area represent a cryptic late-migrating or <b>resident</b> <b>segment</b> of the Northwest Atlantic population...|$|E

40|$|DNA coding for {{extracellular}} glucoamylase genes STA 1 and STA 3 {{was isolated}} from DNA libraries of two Saccharomyces diastaticus strains, each carrying STA 1 or STA 3. Cells transformed with a plasmid carrying either the STA 1 or STA 3 gene secreted glucoamylases {{having the same}} enzymatic and immunological properties and the same electrophoretic mobilities in acrylamide gel electrophoresis as those of authentic glucoamylases. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from S. diastaticus and a glucoamylase-non-secreting yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealed that the STA 1 and STA 3 loci of S. diastaticus showed {{a high degree of}} homology, and that both yeast species (S. diastaticus and S. cerevisiae) contained DNA segments highly homologous to those of the extracellular glucoamylase genes. Restriction maps of the homologous DNA segments suggested that the extracellular glucoamylase genes of S. diastaticus may have arisen from recombination among the <b>resident</b> DNA <b>segments</b> in S. cerevisiae...|$|R

40|$|Peripherin/retinal {{degeneration}} slow (rds) is {{an integral}} membrane protein specifically localized to the light-sensing organelle of the photoreceptor cell, the outer segment. Within the outer segment, peripherin is found {{at the edges of}} photoreceptor discs, where it plays a critical role in disc morphogenesis and maintenance. Peripherin loss or mutations are often associated with severe forms of visual impairments. Like all other <b>resident</b> outer <b>segment</b> proteins, peripherin is synthesized in the photoreceptor cell body and subsequently transported to the outer segment. In an effort to further examine peripherin’s delivery to outer segments, we undertook a careful examination of its targeting sequence. Using a fluorescently labeled reporter expressed in the rods of transgenic tadpoles, we narrowed peripherin’s targeting sequence to ten amino acids within its C-terminal tail. This small stretch of amino acid residues is both necessary and sufficient for outer segment targeting. We also conducted alanine scanning of all residues within this sequence and found that only a single residue, valine at position 332, is essential for outer segment targeting. This valine is conserved in all species and its mutation is sufficient to completely abrogate the targeting of full-length peripherin in mouse rods...|$|R
40|$|The working-set {{concept is}} {{extended}} for programs that reference segments of different sizes. The generalized working-set policy (GWS) keeps as its <b>resident</b> set those <b>segments</b> whose retention costs do not exceed their retrieval costs. The GWS {{is a model}} for the entire class of demand-fetching memory policies that satisfy a resident-set inclusion property. A generalized optimal policy (GOPT) is also def'med; at its operating points it minimizes aggregated retention and swapping costs. Special cases of the cost structure allow GWS and GOPT to simulate any known stack algorithm, the working set, and VMIN. Efficient procedures for computing demand curves showing swapping load as a function of memory usage are developed for GWS and GOPT policies. Empirical data from an actual system are included.

40|$|A model {{substrate}} for the joining of Ig VH and DJH elements {{has been}} constructed in a retroviral vector carrying a selectable marker whose expression {{is independent of}} {{the arrangement of the}} <b>resident</b> Ig gene <b>segments.</b> The substrate was introduced into lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, and site-specific recombination between the VH and DJH elements was monitored by a direct hybridization assay. Joining of the exogenous gene segments was observed in cell lines representative of three distinct stages in early B cell differentiation. Rearrangement was not observed in three cell lines derived from mature B cells, or in a fibroblastoid cell line. The VH and DJH elements were initially arranged so that the VH-DJH junction and the recombined flanking sequences could be recovered after rearrangement. By molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence determination, VH-DJH junctions formed upon rearrangement of the substrate were found to resemble closely similar junctions in functional H chain genes. The joining of VH and DJH elements was observed to be asymmetric; loss of nucleotides occurred at the coding joints, but not at the junctions between flanking sequences. Our results suggest that Ig H and L chain gene segments are joined by a common mechanism that is more active in B cell precursors than in mature B cells. These observations provide further evidence that the rearrangement of Ig gene segments occurs by a nonreciprocal recombinational mechanism. The model substrate described here is likely to be of use in defining the nucleotide sequences that mediate rearrangement and in examining the developmental specificity of this process...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{emergency}} {{response to the}} Ebola epidemic, the Government of Sierra Leone and its partners implemented a large-scale Mass Drug Administration (MDA) with artesunate–amodiaquine (ASAQ) covering > 2. 7 {{million people in the}} districts hardest hit by Ebola during December 2014 –January 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) evaluated the impact of the MDA on malaria morbidity at health facilities and the number of Ebola alerts received at District Ebola Command Centres. Methods: The coverage of the two rounds of MDA with ASAQ was estimated by relating the number anti-malarial medicines distributed to the estimated <b>resident</b> population. <b>Segmented</b> time-series analysis was applied to weekly data collected from 49 primary health units (PHUs) and 11 hospitals performing malaria parasitological testing during the study period, to evaluate trends of malaria cases and Ebola alerts during the post-MDA weeks compared to the pre-MDA weeks in MDA- and non-MDA-cheifdoms. Results: After two rounds of the MDA, the number of suspected cases tested with rapid diagnostic test (RDT) decreased significantly by 43 % (95 % CI 38 – 48 %) at week 1 and remained low at week 2 and 3 post-first MDA and at week 1 and 3 post-second MDA; RDT positive cases decreased significantly by 47 % (41 – 52 %) at week 1 post-first and remained lower throughout all post-MDA weeks; and the RDT test positivity rate (TPR) declined by 35 % (32 – 38 %) at week 2 and stayed low throughout all post-MDA weeks. The total malaria (clinical + confirmed) cases decreased significantly by 45 % (39 – 52 %) at week 1 and were lower at week 2 and 3 post-first MDA; and week 1 post-second MDA. The proportion of confirmed malaria cases (out of all-outpatients) fell by 33 % (29 – 38 %) at week 1 post-first MDA and were lower during all post-MDA weeks. On the contrary, the non-malaria outpatient cases (cases due to other health conditions) either remained unchanged or fluctuated insignificantly. The Ebola alerts decreased by 30 % (13 – 46 %) at week 1 post-first MDA and much lower during all the weeks post–second MDA. Conclusions: The MDA achieved its goals of reducing malaria morbidity and febrile cases that would have been potentially diagnosed as suspected Ebola cases with increased risk of nosocomial infections. The intervention also helped reduce patient case-load to the severely strained health services {{at the peak of the}} Ebola outbreak and malaria transmission. As expected, the effect of the MDA waned in a matter of few weeks and malaria intensity returned to the pre-MDA levels. Nevertheless, the approach was an appropriate public health intervention in the context of the Ebola epidemic even in high malaria transmission areas of Sierra Leone...|$|R
