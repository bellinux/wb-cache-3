6000|$|The Rev. Jopling Baynes, {{before he}} called upon Mr. Pope for his promised {{utterance}} about East Purblow, could not refrain from pointing out how silly [...] "in {{every sense of}} the word" [...] these wanton interruptions were. What, he asked, had English social reform to do with the fare to America?--and having roused the meeting to an alert silence by the length of his pause, answered in a voice of ringing contempt: [...] "Nothing--whatsoever." [...] Then Mr. Pope made his few remarks about East Purblow with the ease and finish that comes from long practice; much, he said, had to be omitted [...] "in view of" [...] the <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> at his disposal, but he did not grudge that, the time had been better filled. ("No, no," [...] from Aunt Plessington.) Yes, yes,--by the lucid and delightful lecture they had all enjoyed, and he not least among them. (Applause.)...|$|E

He continued his exercises with his weapons, but without any strong idea that beyond defence against personal attacks they would be of any use to him. The army was not in those days a career. When the king had need of a force to fight in France or to carry fire and sword into Scotland, the levies were called out, the nobles and barons supplied their contingent, and archers and men-at-arms were enrolled and paid by the king. The levies, however, were only liable to service for a <b>restricted</b> <b>time,</b> and beyond their personal retainers the barons in time followed the royal example of hiring men-at-arms and archers for the campaign; these being partly paid from the royal treasury, and partly from their own revenue.|$|E

50|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, {{it has been}} {{possible}} to routinely calculate focal mechanisms from teleseismic data. Catalogues of events with calculated focal mechanisms are now available online, such as the searchable catalogue from the NEIC. As focal mechanisms give two potential active fault plane orientations, other evidence is required to interpret the origin of an individual event. Although only available for a <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> period, in areas of moderate to intense seismicity there is probably sufficient data to characterise the type of seismicity in an area, if not all the active structures.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to wartime physical and capital losses, West Germany imported guest workers {{after the end}} of World War II to speed up the postwar reconstruction process. The Federal Labor Office recruited low and semi-skilled workers from Mediterranean countries; the initial bilateral agreement was with Italy, the program expanded to include Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Portugal, Tunisia and Yugoslavia. Workers were required to obtain a residence permit and a labor permit, which were granted for <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> periods and valid only for certain industries. Of the countries providing labor, recruits from Turkey accounted for the largest portion; approximately 750,000 Turks entered the country between 1961 and 1972.

This <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> period means the writer must slow down and tell the event moment by moment with many details. By contrast, a five-page essay about a three-day trip would only skim the surface of the experience. The writer must consider again the goals of communication - content, audience, importance of information - but add to this a consideration of the format for the writing.

5000|$|Nominal Groups: Reviews of {{research}} on brainstorming groups and nominal groups suggest that nominal groups surpass brainstorming groups. Unlike traditional brainstorming groups, nominal groups consist of a body of individuals whose ideas can be shared without any interaction with others. Individuals in nominal groups {{do not have to}} wait to share their thoughts, thus, their ideas will not be forgotten or lost. Another factor to consider is that in brainstorming groups, individuals may end up having conversations about a different subject with other members. This can be a significant factor that can lead to the production blocking problem because group members are not contributing {{to the quality of the}} groups product. Additionally, using nominal groups would generate a larger amount of ideas in a <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> frame compared to traditional brainstorming groups.|$|E
50|$|The game {{follows the}} path of its predecessor, {{although}} there are distinctions in gameplay. Most of the game {{takes place in the}} fictional city, and on a <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> frame; the entire plot is concluded in 30 days. Many of the puzzles in the game do not appear or cannot be solved until certain days. This keeps gameplay on a tight, linear narrative. The game is also difficult to navigate, as it has an odd perspective and mapping system. The problems with the navigation are compounded by the maze-like layout of the fictional city. This layout was employed as a primitive form of digital rights management: completing early quests was very difficult without the map in the manual provided with purchases of the video game. This difficulty is ameliorated with a magical map which transports the character instantly to hotspots.|$|E

40|$|We used intracoelomically {{implanted}} temperature dataloggers {{to obtain}} semi-continuous body temperature data and establish monthly thermal profiles for free-ranging rattlesnakes. We mimicked random and non-random point-sampling methods by selecting a single daily data point from all values or from <b>restricted</b> <b>times</b> of day to reflect common point-sampling constraints. Thermal profiles generated from point-sampling differed from those generated from semi-continuous sampling, and {{this difference was}} more apparent when point-sampling was non-random. We conclude that semi-continuous sampling provides a better estimate of thermal profiles, and that point-sampling methods are highly sensitive to deviations from true randomness...|$|R
50|$|Home and Away {{follows the}} lives and loves of the {{residents}} in Summer Bay, a fictional seaside town of New South Wales. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family - Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa (Vanessa Downing), and their five foster children, Frank Morgan (Alex Papps), Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) - who relocated {{from the city and}} moved into the Summer Bay House, where they took on the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, Bobby Simpson (Nicolle Dickson). Home and Away was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol addiction and drug overdose. A storyline in particular, concerning rape, outraged the public and a protest erupted, as viewers deemed it an inappropriate subject to be covering in an early evening time slot. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> slot. Palm Beach in Sydney's Northern Beaches district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the Australian Technology Park in Redfern.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Flick {{along with}} her cousins, Florrie and Bob were moved away from their parents {{to live with their}} {{grandmother}} at the Toomelah Mission in inland New South Wales. Tin camps were built for them to live in here. This was a very controlled time in all of their lives. Permission was needed for everything, and arrangements were always made, such as attending Sunday school and church services. If something wasn’t up to adequate standards at the house they lived in, or they didn’t act in the desired way then the Matron had the right to correct it.Although this was a very organized and often <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> in Flick’s life, it was where she learnt to read and write, and where she received an education although it was only up to a present-day year 3’s education. It was here where the government wanted the aboriginal children to assimilate into ‘white society’. Flick’s parents would often come to visit her but this was not done very often, and usually not together. Her parents were only allowed to stay for one hour and she was only allowed one visitor at a time. Flick began to realise how Aboriginals had very limited rights and it was here where her first activist meeting was held. She returned home from the Toomelah Mission to Collarenebri to her mother and her father in 1942 wanting to make positive changes to her community.|$|E

VF-114 again won the [...] "Mutha" [...] trophy and also the Naval Air Force Pacific Fleet Battle “E” battle efficiency award as the top F-14 squadron in the Pacific Fleet. In January 1988, the squadrons next cruise began, a portion of which was spent in the Persian Gulf escorting reflagged tankers through March, April and May due to the ongoing tanker war. In April 1988, VF-114 participated in Operation Praying Mantis. By February 1989, the carrier had returned to port and VF-114 began a compressed turnaround schedule, due to its next cruise beginning in September 1989. Even with the <b>restricted</b> <b>time</b> period, VF-114 was able to fit in significant training, deploying to NAF El Centro for FFARP (Fleet Fighter ACM Readiness Program) {{and as part of}} the air wing to NAS Fallon.

As the grazing time decreased, the proportion of time spent on intake, bite rate and grazing velocity significantly (p< 0. 05) increased, but resting and ruminating time clearly (p< 0. 05) decreased. The grazing months mainly depicted effect on intake time and grazing velocity.
