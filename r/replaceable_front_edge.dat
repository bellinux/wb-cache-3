40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} spatio-temporal changes of active fungal biomass and water in Tricholoma mat-sutake soil colonies during the mushroom fruiting season. The active fungal biomass was estimated by analyzing ergosterol content at four different points within four replicated locations in a single circular T. matsutake colony at Ssanggok valley in the Sogri Mt. National Park in Korea during 2003 to 2005. The four points were the ahead of the colony, the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the colony and 20 cm and 40 cm back from the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the colony. Ergosterol content was 0. 0 to 0. 7 µg per gram dried soil at the ahead, 2. 5 to 4. 8 µg at the <b>front</b> <b>edge,</b> 0. 5 to 1. 8 µg at the 20 cm back and 0. 3 to 0. 8 µg at the 40 cm back. The ergosterol content was very high at the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> where the T. matsutake hyphae were most active. However, ergosterol content did not significantly change during the fruiting season, September to October. Soil water contents were lower at the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> and 20 cm back from the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the colony than at the ahead and 40 cm back during the fruiting season. Soil water content ranged from 12 to 19 % at the ahead, 10 to 11 % at the edge, 9 to 11 % at the 20 cm back and 11 to 15 % at the 40 cm back. Our results suggest that the active <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of the T. matsutake soil colony could be managed in terms of water relation and T. matsutake ectomycorrhizal root development...|$|R

40|$|COR 2 {{coronagraph}} {{images are}} {{the most commonly used}} data for coronal mass ejection (CME) analysis among the various types of data provided by the STEREO (Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory) SECCHI (Sun-Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation) suite of instruments. The field of view (FOV) in COR 2 images covers 2 – 15 solar radii (Rs) that allow for tracking the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of a CME in its initial stage to forecast the lead-time of a CME and its chances of reaching the Earth. However, estimating the lead-time of a CME using COR 2 images gives a larger lead-time, which may be associated with greater uncertainty. To reduce this uncertainty, CME <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> tracking should be continued beyond the FOV of COR 2 images. Therefore, heliospheric imager (HI 1) data that covers 15 – 90 Rs FOV must be included. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method that takes both COR 2 and HI 1 images into account and combine the results to track the <b>front</b> <b>edges</b> of a CME continuously. The method consists of two modules: pre-processing and tracking. The pre-processing module produces a set of segmented images, which contain the signature of a CME, for both COR 2 and HI 1 separately. In addition, the HI 1 images are resized and padded, so that the center of the Sun is the central coordinate of the resized HI 1 images. The resulting COR 2 and HI 1 image set is then fed into the tracking module to estimate the position angle (PA) and track the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of a CME. The detected <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> is then used to produce a height-time profile that is used to estimate the speed of a CME. The method was validated using 15 CME events observed in the period from January 1, 2008 to August 31, 2009. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for CME <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> tracking in both COR 2 and HI 1 images. Using this method, the CME <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> can now be tracked automatically and continuously in a much larger range, i. e., from 2 to 90 Rs, for the first time. These improvements can greatly help in making the quantitative CME analysis more accurate and have the potential to assist in space weather forecasting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{three-dimensional}} singular {{stress field}} near the terminal point 0 of the crack <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> {{at the surface}} of an elastic body is investigated, using spherical coordinates r, 0, ~ 5 and assuming all three displacements {{to be of the}} form SpPF(B, 4) where p = distance from the singularity line (crack <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> or notch edge) and p = given constant. The variational principle governing the displacement distribution on a unit sphere about point 0, which has previously been obtained from the difIerential equations of equilibrium, is now derived more directly from potential energy. The previously developed finite element method on the unit sphere is used to reduce the problem to the form k(A) X = 0 where X = column matrix of the nodal values of displacements on the unit sphere and k(A) = square matrix, all coefficients of which are quadratic polynomials in A. It is proven that the variational principle as well as matrix k must be nonsymmetric, which means that complex eigenvalues A are possible. The dependence of A upon Poisson’s ratio Y for Mode I cracks whose <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> is normal to the surface is solved numerically and it closely agrees with the analytical solution of Benthem. Previously unavailable solutions for Modes II and III and for cracks (of all modes) with inclined <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> and inclined crack plane are also obtained. By energy flux argument, it is found that the <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> of a propagating crack fnust terminate at the surface obliquely, at a certain angle whose dependence upon the inclination of the crack plane is also solved.

Opposing elements must be in full <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> to <b>front</b> <b>edge</b> contact with each other in order to engage in close combat. While simplifying combat resolution, this contact rule requires element placement on the table top to be fairly neat and precise and can result in situations where the arrangement of elements prevents some from getting into combat.|$|R
