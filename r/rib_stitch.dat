This study presents an scientific database from evaluating physical properties of 1 × 1 <b>rib</b> <b>stitch</b> using A/W. In this study, 1 × 1 <b>rib</b> <b>stitch</b> using A/W were made at various knitting tensions (dial no. 2 - 6) and the number (4 - 6) of ply yarn. The physical properties of 1 × 1 <b>rib</b> <b>stitch</b> using A/W were measured and ana-lyzed. The density was in the range 5. 5 - 6. 4 wales/cm and 4. 0 - 5. 6 courses/cm, respectively. The density increased when less plying yarns and more knitting tension were added during knitting. The thickness was {{in the range of}} 1. 592 - 2. 362 mm and the tensile strength was in the range 32. 75 - 53. 63 Kgf/mm. The burst strength was in the range 107. 8 - 139. 2 N/cm 2. Thickness, tensile strength, and burst strength increased as the number of ply yarn and the knitting tension increased. The elongation and the recovery extension rate were in the range 102. 29 - 112. 13 % and 96. 4 - 97. 7 %, respec-tively. The heat retention rate was in the range 59. 3 - 65. 1 %. There was no difference of the elongation and the recovery extension rate and the heat retention rate by the knitting tension and the number of the ply yarn. The permeability was in the range 170. 5 - 396. 3 cm 3 /c...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{structural}} {{analysis of sample}} knitted fabrics and the knit geometric theory, we have built an algorithm that can make three-dimensional structure models for weft knitted fabrics such as welt stitches, tuck <b>stitches,</b> cross <b>stitches,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>stitches</b> and purl stitches. In order to reduce computational complexity, we have set the anchoring point on the diametral plane of yarn in the knitting chart. Drawing from the beginning knitting point to the finished knitting point, a smooth knit curve model can be obtained with the cardinal spline curve. Using this algorithm, we have developed the weft knit three-dimensional structure modeling software that can display the three-dimensional model of knitted fabrics including welt stitches; tuck <b>stitches,</b> cross <b>stitches,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>stitches</b> and purl stitches. Our work confirms 3 -D modeling of three foundation knits of weft knit (plain <b>stitches,</b> purl <b>stitches,</b> <b>rib</b> <b>stitches),</b> tuck stitches, welt stitches and cross stitches with a commercially available PC. This software {{can be used by}} someone with no understanding of knitting to gain an understanding of the knitting process, and determine the structure of a knitted fabric product. 出版者照会後に全文公...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{waviness}} and <b>rib</b> <b>stitching</b> {{have been}} investigated {{as part of a}} series of tests to determine the effects on wing drag of common surface irregularities. The tests were made in the N. A. C. A. 8 -foot high-speed wind tunnel at Reynolds Numbers up to 17, 000, 000. The results of the tests showed that the waviness common to airplane wings will cause no serious increase in drag unless the waviness exists on the forward part of the wing, where it may cause premature transition or premature compressibility effects. Waves 3 inches wide and 0. 048 inch high, for example, increased the drag 1 percent when they covered the rear 67 percent of both surfaces and 10 percent when they covered the rear 92 percent. A single wave 3 inches wide and only 0. 020 inch high at the 10. 5 -percent-chord point on the upper surface caused transition to occur on the wave and increased the drag 6 percent. <b>Rib</b> <b>stitching</b> increased the drag 7 percent when the rib spacing was 6 inches; the drag increment was proportional to the number of ribs for wider spacings. About one-third of the increase was due to premature transition at the forward ends of the stitching...|$|R

5000|$|Featherstitch or feather stitch and Cretan stitch or faggoting stitch are {{embroidery}} techniques made of open, looped stitches worked alternately to {{the right}} and left of a central <b>rib.</b> [...] Fly <b>stitch</b> is categorized with the featherstitches.|$|R
50|$|Fabrics {{in which}} the number of knit and purl {{stitches}} are not the same, such as stockinette/stocking stitch, {{have a tendency to}} curl; by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as <b>ribbing,</b> garter <b>stitch</b> or seed/moss stitch) tend to lie flat and drape well. Wales of purl stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward. Thus, the purl wales in ribbing tend to be invisible, since the neighboring knit wales come forward. Conversely, rows of purl stitches tend to form an embossed ridge relative to a row of knit stitches. This is the basis of shadow knitting, {{in which the}} appearance of a knitted fabric changes when viewed from different directions.|$|R
2500|$|Fabrics {{in which}} each knitted row is {{followed}} by a purled row, such as in stockinette/stocking stitch, have a tendency to curl—top and bottom curl toward the front (or knitted side) while the sides curl toward the back (or purled side); by contrast, those in which knit and purl stitches are arranged symmetrically (such as <b>ribbing,</b> garter <b>stitch</b> or seed/moss stitch) have more texture and tend to lie flat. Wales of purl stitches have a tendency to recede, whereas those of knit stitches tend to come forward, giving the fabric more stretchability.

They {{depended}} on fast reflexes, the rude health of youth, and luck. Despite having all three, Bobby Walthour collected an impressive (or dismaying) inventory of injuries over his career: 28 fractures {{of the right}} collarbone, 18 of the left, 32 broken <b>ribs,</b> and 60 <b>stitches</b> {{to his face and}} head.

Bukumirović managed to escape into the car with only minor injuries while Žeželj wasn't as lucky and ended up with a fractured <b>rib</b> and 6 <b>stitches</b> on his forehead.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the pilling {{degradation}} results is an important decreasing in garment quality and a negative influence on the user’s comfort to wear. There are a lot factors, such as the yarn spinning system, fabric geometry and finishing operation, which affect the pilling performance. This research paper presents the investigation of fabric surface concerning pilling formation, especially knits, influenced by the fibrous composition. As samples were used knitted fabric panels, obtained from carded yarns, with fibers composition like cotton, wool or mixed one. Regarding fabric geometry 3 types were used – single jersey, 2 x 2 <b>rib</b> and moss <b>stitch.</b> In order to establish which of the yarns are most appropriate for knitting garments {{from the point of}} view of pilling resistance were realized tests using the standard SR EN ISO 12945 - 2. The tests were performed with the Nu-Martindale – Abrasion and Pilling Tester, Model 864. For assessment were used two methods – the first one is a comparison with visual standards, tested fabrics or photographs of fabrics, to find the degree of pilling on a scale from 5 (no pilling) to 1 (very severe pilling) and the second one by determination of mass loss percent...|$|R

[...] Oregon Daily Journal on Johnson’s toughness in dealing with his injuries, February 28, 1915 To his supporters, Johnson’s proneness to injury was a result of his physical style of play and the retaliation that came with it, and he was often touted as a relatively clean player. Notwithstanding, his detractors pointed to a few notable incidents as evidence of his being overbearing, such as when he was involved in a brawl with Frank Patrick of the Vancouver Millionaires while drunk on the ice after a losing effort: ...|$|R
