Recently, 60 GHz {{system is a}} hot topic for its large unlicensed bandwidth and small component size. However, some components could not {{be integrated into the}} 60 GHz communication subsystem either because of their large size or poor performance after integration. One of the most popular ways to build a planar device at high frequency with low cost is to use substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). To make a planar device with low loss at the millimeter waveband, first a 60 GHz substrate integrated waveguide with taper transitions from microstrip lines are designed and fabricated. Although planar ferrite isolators based on SIW have been successfully built, all of them work below 20 GHz because the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the traditional ferrite, Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) is low. Here, to develop a 60 GHz isolator based on SIW, a novel C-axis M type Barium thin film ferrite is used. The experimental results proved that the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of this thin film ferrite is much higher than the traditional ferrite materials. In this way a 60 GHz H-plane <b>resonance</b> <b>isolator</b> based on SIW is realized with low insert loss and high isolation in the working waveband. Moreover, by integrating a ferromagnetic thin film with ferroelectric thin film, a tunable 60 GHz isolator based on SIW was realized. The working frequency of the isolator can be varied with the voltage bias. This method makes it possible to build voltage controlled ferrite devices at 60 GHz, which is important for large bandwidth systems...|$|E

40|$|The {{realization}} of nanophotonic optical isolators with high optical isolation even at ultralow light levels and low optical losses {{is an open}} problem. Here, we employ {{the link between the}} local polarization of strongly confined light and its direction of propagation to realize low-loss nonreciprocal transmission through a silica nanofiber at the single-photon level. The direction of the resulting optical isolator is controlled by the spin state of cold atoms. We perform our experiment in two qualitatively different regimes, i. e., with an ensemble of cold atoms where each atom is weakly coupled to the waveguide and with a single atom strongly coupled to the waveguide mode. In both cases, we observe simultaneously high isolation and high forward transmission. The isolator concept constitutes a nanoscale quantum optical analog of microwave ferrite <b>resonance</b> <b>isolators,</b> can be implemented with all kinds of optical waveguides and emitters, and might enable novel integrated optical devices for fiber-based classical and quantum networks...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the active isolation of a system containing a distributed parameter isolator using absolute velocity feedback control. The main differences between this type of system and one with a massless isolator, is that there are <b>isolator</b> <b>resonances.</b> It is shown that the vibration at these resonance frequencies cannot be suppressed using a simple velocity feedback control strategy. Moreover, it is found that the <b>isolator</b> <b>resonances</b> can cause the control system to become unstable, if the isolated equipment is supported on a flexible base. A stability criterion based on the mode shapes of the system is presented. Two techniques to stabilise the system are investigated and compared. The first involves the addition of mass on the base structure, and the second involves an electronic lead compensator. Experimental results are presented to support the theoretical findings. It is shown that even if the instability due to the <b>isolator</b> <b>resonances</b> and flexibility of the base can be prevented, the instability due to the flexibility of the equipment remains a proble...|$|R
50|$|A two-port {{isolator}} {{is obtained}} simply by terminating {{one of the}} three ports with a matched load, which absorbs all the power entering it. The biassed ferrite is part of the circulator and causes a differential phase-shift for signals travelling in different directions. The bias field is lower than that needed for resonance absorption, and so this type of isolator does not require such a heavy permanent magnet. Because the power is absorbed in an external load, cooling is less of a problem than with a <b>resonance</b> absorption <b>isolator.</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{reference}} to the application of magnetic oxides in the electronics industry, a comprehensive review is presented of the theoretical background of such materials existing {{up to the end}} of 1967. In considering magnetization characteristics of the spinel structure, attention is given to the crystal site preference of the various cations; in the commonly used ferrites, the magnetization is the net result of antiparallel magnetic moments of the cations. Also considered are ferromagnetic spinels with parallel moments; values are considered of the exchange interaction detg. the relative orientation of the magnetic moments and the magnetization/temp. curve. The relation of the magnetic anisotropy energy and the permeability (m) is discussed in terms of applications to transformers, inductors, etc. in the frequency range 103 - 108 Hz.; the value, sign, and temp. dependence of the anisotropy can be influenced by ion substitutions, e. g. Co 2 +, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Mn 3 +, Fe 3 +. Stress-induced anisotropy is used in mech. devices such as ultrasonic generators, magnetoacoustic delay lines, etc.; anisotropy is also the cause of magnetostriction. Anisotropy relaxation is discussed, including influences of deviations from stoichiometry; cond., magnetic domain in ideal and in practical cases, where ceramic microstructure is of primary importance, damping, and microstructure are also considered. Damping is very dependent on chem. compn. and microstructure; damping can be useful in <b>resonance</b> <b>isolators</b> and in limiters. Examples are discussed where these parameters interact with one another. 345 references. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R
50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a <b>resonance</b> {{absorption}} <b>isolator,</b> but the magnetic biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the forward signal, while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the forward signal tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the forward signal {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the resistive film is placed. Conversely for the backward signal, the electric field is strong over this surface and so its energy is dissipated in driving current through the film. In rectangular waveguide the ferrite block will typically occupy the full height from one broad-wall to the other, with the resistive film on the side facing the centre-line of the guide.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} passive {{vibration isolator}} {{based on a}} post-buckled beam is proposed and its characteristics and effectiveness are investigated by FE analysis. The intended application of the isolator is specifically isolation in the vertical direction where the isolator is required to be sufficiently stiff statically to bear {{the weight of the}} isolated mass and to be soft dynamically to achieve a low natural frequency. One approach to reconcile such a conflicting requirement is to make use of a post-buckled element that maintains much of its static stiffness in its buckled state but whose dynamic stiffness dramatically reduces. In this paper, we investigate the design of a simple, compact configuration of practical isolator using a post-buckled element â€“ an inverted L-shaped beam. The weight of the isolated mass is taken to act at the vertex causing the vertical member to buckle when the weight is sufficiently large. The static and harmonic base excited response of such a system are investigated by FE analysis and validated through experiments. The system demonstrates the achievement of high-static-low-dynamic stiffness and exhibits a correspondingly low fundamental resonance frequency. However, internal <b>resonances</b> of the <b>isolator</b> are also prominent in its frequency respons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compared}} {{the performance of}} several isolation designs to control vibration transmissions from concrete rail viaducts. The isolation systems analysed includes medium- and short-length floating slabs, and floating ladders. The vibration was measured in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong. The study aimed to assess the effects of bending resonances of the floating slab systems. Simple formulae of estimating the significant bending resonance frequency and support passage frequency of a floating slab system are proposed. The resonance peaks obtained in site measurement {{are found to be}} in agreement with the calculation results. The results show that other than the vertical rigid body resonances for the isolation systems, the bending resonances of slabs have significant effects on vibration isolation performance. In particular, bending resonance frequencies should not coincide with the vertical <b>isolator</b> <b>resonance</b> and support passage frequency. According to the in-situ measurement results, a mini-type concrete floating slab can reduce the vibration level by more than 30 dB in the frequency range of 63 - 200 Hz. This should be achieved by designing the first bending resonances of the floating slab {{to be out of the}} dominant frequency range of concrete rail viaduct vibration.

40|$|In this paper, the {{characteristics}} {{and the effectiveness}} of a nonlinear passive vibration isolator based on a post-buckled beam is investigated experimentally. The intended application is specifically isolation in the vertical direction where the isolator is required to be sufficiently stiff statically to bear the weight of the isolated mass. The isolator consists of two beams joined to form an inverted L-shape and the weight of the isolated mass is taken to act at the vertex. If the weight of isolated mass is larger than the buckling load of the L-shaped beam then the beam buckles in one of two modes, one of which is unstable. In this paper, the static restoring force of the unstable mode is measured and an appropriately selected coil spring is added to counteract the negative stiffness of the beam. The resulting system presents a dramatically lower stiffness to small excursions about its equilibrium position in its buckled state but maintains its static load bearing capability. Free vibration measurements are presented which show some amplitude dependency of the natural frequency for large amplitude motion. Low amplitude harmonic base excitation measurements are also conducted from which transmissibility measurements are obtained and compared with corresponding results from a Finite Element model. The fundamental resonance is about 80 % lower than that achievable by a comparable linear isolator. However the performance of the prototype design is compromised by the presence of higher frequency internal <b>resonances</b> of the <b>isolator,</b> mitigation of which is the focus of ongoing wor...|$|R
