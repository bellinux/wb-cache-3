40|$|SummaryDendritic cell (DC) {{migration}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> to {{lymph nodes}} is {{regulated by the}} pattern of genes expressed by DCs themselves and by signals within the surrounding peripheral environment. Here, we report that DC mobilization can also be regulated by signals initiated within the downstream lymph nodes, particularly when lymph nodes enlarge {{as a consequence of}} immunization. Lymph node B lymphocytes orchestrate expansion of the lymphatic network within the immunized lymph node. This expanded network in turn supports increased DC migration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery.</b> These results reveal unique relationships between B cells, lymphatic vessels, and migratory DCs. Knowledge that DC migration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> is augmented by B cell-dependent signals reveals new potential strategies to increase DC migration during vaccination...|$|R

40|$|The {{infectious}} particle causing transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE), a fatal neurodegenerative disease of humans and animals, has been termed prion. Its major component is an aggregated variant of the cellular prion protein, PrP(C). The main target of prion pathology is {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), yet most prion diseases are initiated or accompanied by prion replication at extracerebral locations, including secondary lymphoid organs, muscle and, in some instances, blood. How do prions travel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> into <b>the</b> CNS? Is this an active or a passive process and does neuronal prion transport explain the long incubation times in prion diseases? Alternatively, if prion infectivity arises spontaneously in the CNS, as believed from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob patients, how do prions manage to travel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CNS into <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> (e. g., spleen, muscle) of the infected host? The mechanisms of neuronal prion transport <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> into <b>the</b> CNS or vice versa are heavily investigated and debated but poorly understood. Although research in the past has accumulated knowledge on prion progression <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> to <b>the</b> brain, we are far <b>from</b> understanding <b>the</b> molecular mechanisms of neuronal prion transport...|$|R

50|$|The CDZ {{system is}} {{organized}} in a hierarchical fashion, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery</b> to <b>the</b> center.

One can think of roots that plunge into <b>the</b> earth, <b>the</b> <b>periphery,</b> and converge {{to the base of}} the trunk, the center. But in the brain, there are a large number of centers. The most central CDZs have converging projections from other CDZs, and are not recruited by a more central CDZ. The memory of an episode of our life is preserved in such central CDZs. When we relive the perceptions, emotions and actions of a past experience, the excitation of this central CDZs activates all subordinated CDZs and the peripheral areas. It thereby reconstructs the previously lived experience.|$|R

Remarkably, {{the dynamics of}} the core segments (which are most remote <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>periphery)</b> shows a scaling behavior that differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dynamics obtained after structural average. We analyze the most relevant processes of single segment motion and provide an analytic approximation for the corresponding relaxation times.
