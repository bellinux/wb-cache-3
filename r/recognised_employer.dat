40|$|The New Zealand <b>Recognised</b> <b>Employer</b> (RSE) Policy was {{designed}} to remedy labour shortages in the horticulture/viticulture industry early in the twenty-first century. It was the first New Zealand contract labour migration programme to be designed with the explicit intent {{of the development of}} the source countries, consisting mainly of small Pacific Island States. This research sought to examine within a historical context whether the programme was beneficial to the source countries and communities, and whether the programme met the expectations of international labour conventions which New Zealand has signed. An attempt was made to discover whether, when compared with antecedent programmes in New Zealand and North America, the RSE represented a new paradigm in the design and implementation of a contract migrant labour programme. The field work was carried out for twenty months between December 2011 and August 2013, involved a grower survey and over 100 semi-structured interviews with Government officials, horticulturalists, migrant workers, pastoral care workers, and other interested parties. Time in southern Vanuatu was divided between interviewing migrant RSE workers in Port Vila and visiting 100 village communities on Tanna Island. Assessments were made of access to the programme for the rural and urban poor and of the positive and negative impacts of the programme. Positive features observed included the benefits of close government monitoring of worker accommodation, the transparency of the remuneration, the interest of many employers in assisting workers to remit funds to source communities, house building and infrastructural benefits gained by many workers, and the transfer of useful skills. Negative features included the powerlessness of the workers to negotiate their work conditions, the failure of some employers to address workers’ specific needs, the social dislocation of some workers leading to alcohol abuse, the frequency of work interruptions due particularly to weather conditions, the excessive work hours on some nightshifts at minimum wage, and a lack of connection between recruitment patterns and areas of greatest need. The RSE policy has come about in an era of migration optimism. Since the mid- 1990 s the total global flow of remittances has exceeded the level of official development assistance. However most literature regarding remittance flows and transnational communities is set within a context of diaspora. The RSE was carefully designed to prevent overstaying of visa entitlements, in order to prevent any growth of diaspora. Consequently the overall financial flows in the case of Vanuatu are small compared to such sectors as tourism, and the position of the RSE in the migration-development nexus is somewhat contradictory...|$|E
30|$|Workers in New Zealand {{can only}} be hired by <b>recognised</b> <b>employers.</b> Growers, labour hire {{companies}} and contractors are eligible {{to apply for the}} status of a <b>recognised</b> seasonal <b>employer.</b> Workers were initially bound to one employer; however in August 2008 a government policy change was introduced, allowing workers to move between <b>recognised</b> <b>employers,</b> but only with the approval of the Department of Labour and through agreed arrangements with the employers. This change was initiated in order to maximise the workers’ earnings as well as to help growers with unexpected down times (Evalue Research, 2010 : 82). Further, two growers are eligible to apply together for a Joint Approval to Recruit, thus the workers will first work for one employer and then for the second. In practice, the majority of all workers hired under the RSE scheme still remain with one employer, however the possibility to move between <b>recognised</b> <b>employers</b> has been proven as a suitable risk minimising and income maximising strategy.|$|R

The Histadrut took over economic firms operated by the parties, which operated by subcontracting, and their Office of Information, which was expanded into a Labor Exchange. Already after a few months the Histadrut became the single largest employer in the Yishuv. The Histadrut succeeded in improving worker's rights as e.g. the right to strike was <b>recognised,</b> <b>employers</b> had to motivate dismissal and workers got a place to turn to with their complaints.|$|R

50|$|Since 2007 {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the <b>Recognised</b> Seasonal <b>Employer</b> (RSE) Scheme in New Zealand, in which New Zealand horticultural businesses can source seasonal labour from several Pacific Islands including Vanuatu, a small number of New Zealand businesses have sourced their RSE labour from Epi, primarily from the Lamen Bay area. Each year between 50 and 80 workers are recruited. These workers spend up to seven months of the year in New Zealand working as seasonal labourers in the horticultural industry; returning {{at the end of the}} period with their savings. A worker on the scheme could be anticipated to save approximately 450 000 Vatu over the seven-month work period. This has provided a substantial cash injection to the local economy and improved the living conditions of many of the residents and their families.|$|R

30|$|The first {{bilateral}} agreements in Germany were signed in 1990, but foreign seasonal workers were already employed on an informal {{basis in the}} years before.

Seasonal labour migration from the Pacific to New Zealand was common already from the 1950 s onwards.

30|$|Australia and New Zealand {{have also}} {{bilateral}} agreements {{with a number}} of Pacific Island countries in the area of seasonal migration of unskilled labour, such as the <b>Recognised</b> Seasonal <b>Employer</b> (RSE) policy New Zealand introduced in 2007 and a similar scheme Australia launched a year later. Such schemes had existed in the late 1960 s for Fijian, Tongan and Samoans to work mainly in agriculture and forestry until the first coup in Fiji (1987) brought the scheme to an end (Lee 2009 : 10). Under the RSE policy, at present, up to 8, 000 persons from (in order of absolute importance) Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati can come to New Zealand for seasonal agricultural work. The Australian scheme allows people from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tonga, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and (since 2012) Timor Leste to enter Australia for seasonal unskilled employment mainly in the agricultural sector. Other economic sectors showed interest in employing temporary workers from the Pacific such as the New Zealand dairy and meat processing industries.|$|R

40|$|Circular {{migration}} was one {{of several}} enduring themes in Graeme Hugo’s highly productive research career. Although his specialist field was Asian population movement, during the 2000 s he became increasingly interested in labour migration in the Pacific Islands. This paper reviews the development of two managed circular migration schemes targeting Pacific labour that emerged following the UN High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development in 2006. New Zealand’s <b>Recognised</b> Seasonal <b>Employer</b> (RSE) scheme and Australia’s Seasonal Worker Program (SWP) have attracted international attention as the kind of ‘best practice’ temporary labour migration schemes that Hugo had in mind when he emphasised the positive contributions that circular forms of mobility could make to development in both source and destination countries. The two schemes have transformed mobility between the participating countries and have {{played a major role in}} the negotiations over a free-trade agreement between Pacific Forum countries, including Australia and New Zealand. Although the schemes have been in operation for almost 10 years, this paper argues that they are not becoming ‘business as usual’; they embody complex systems of relationships between multiple stakeholders that require ongoing management to ensure that they do not become traps for low-skilled, low-paid ‘permanent’ temporary workers.

40|$|In April 2007, New Zealand {{introduced}} the <b>Recognised</b> Seasonal <b>Employer</b> (RSE) program, which allows NZ employers to recruit overseas {{workers from the}} Pacific and South East Asia for seasonal work in horticulture and viticulture. Over the last year, New Zealand has opened its doors to seasonal workers from neighbouring island nations: villagers from Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu have come to New Zealand on temporary visas, to work in vineyards, farms and orchards in regions like Hawke’s Bay, Bay of Plenty, Nelson, Marlborough and Otago. Despite years of pressure from Pacific Island leaders and Australian primary producers, the coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard refused to create a seasonal work scheme. Now, following its November 2007 election victory, Labor has {{opened the way for}} a review of policies towards the islands region. The government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says it will closely monitor New Zealand’s experience on seasonal employment of workers from the Pacific, to decide whether Australia should create its own seasonal worker program.

40|$|The Australian {{government}} has announced changes to its troubled seasonal worker scheme, {{in an effort}} to encourage more employers to recruit temporary workers from the Pacific islands. Australia's Minister for Jobs and Workplace Relations Senator Chris Evans announced changes to the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme (PSWPS) on December 8, introducing revised work hours and transport costs in an attempt to encourage more grower involvement. Under the pilot, which runs until 2012, there are 2500 visas available for workers from four Pacific countries [...] Tonga, Vanuatu, Kiribati and Papua New Guinea [...] to work in vineyards and orchards across Australia. Unlike New Zealand's horticulture sector, Australian growers have failed to take up Pacific workers under the seasonal worker pilot, claiming over-regulation, tight profit margins and other industry pressures. By the end of December 2010, only 154 Australian visas had been issued under the scheme [...] for Tonga 133, Vanuatu 10 and Kiribati 11. As reported in ISLANDS BUSINESS last August, Papua New Guinea had also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Australia to join the pilot, but no PNG workers have yet been recruited.
