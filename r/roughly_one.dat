5|$|However, the {{discovery}} of the object , an object whose appearance was consistent with a D-type asteroid in an orbit typical of a long-period comet, prompted theoretical research that suggests that the Oort cloud population consists of <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> to two percent asteroids.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells us that {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does not say how they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E

5|$|After {{two more}} episodes, Buzz F/X {{terminated}} its unprofitable contract with H-B, later {{filing for bankruptcy}} in 1997 due to $3.6million of debt created by work on Quest. H-B hired Blur Studio to finish the second season's scenes on a ten-week production schedule. Blur used Intergraph hardware, and its sharp performance attracted press attention and sealed an amicable relationship with H-B. Both companies produced in total <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> hundred minutes of computer animation for QuestWorld.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected. Pluto's mass was <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller even than the Earth's Moon, although it was still over ten times as massive as the largest asteroid, Ceres.|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E

5|$|On December 20, 2012, Booker {{announced}} that he would explore running for the U.S. Senate seat that was then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether or not he would run. <b>Roughly</b> <b>one</b> month after declaring his interest in running for the Senate, incumbent Lautenberg {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roughly</b> <b>one</b> {{quarter of}} all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was {{consumed}} in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E

5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> day.|$|E
5|$|The show debuted on November 10, 2012, and ran {{for four}} seasons and 104 episodes. Littlest Pet Shop is {{produced}} by Hasbro Studios and DHX Media. Animated using Flash, completion of a single episode takes <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> year, with several in production at once. The show has received mixed reception; it has been criticised for its embedded marketing, while reviewers have given praise to the writing. Several crew members have additionally received accolades for their work on the show. The series finale aired on June 4, 2016.|$|E
5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. <b>Roughly</b> <b>one</b> quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{impending}} threat of Manuel, several Mexican municipalities were put under disaster alerts. Upon making its first landfall, Manuel caused extreme flooding in southern Mexico. Property and agricultural damage {{as a result}} of the system was widespread, and <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> million people were estimated to have been directly affected. In Guerrero, 97people perished, including 18in Acapulco. Seventy-one others died due to a mudslide in La Pintada. In Guerrero alone, around 30,000homes were damaged and 46rivers overflowed their banks. There, 20,000persons were evacuated to shelters. Statewide, repairs to damage from the storm totaled MXN$3billion ($230 million USD). Other impacts from Manuel spread as far east as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, where 300families were displaced. In the region, at least 11,591homes were destroyed by the floods. Meanwhile, the nation sustained additional impacts from Atlantic Hurricane Ingrid.|$|E
5|$|During a 10-day run in Oklahoma City, the State Fair of Oklahoma attracts <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> {{million people}} {{along with the}} annual Festival of the Arts. Large {{national}} pow-wows, various Latin and Asian heritage festivals, and cultural festivals such as the Juneteenth celebrations are held in Oklahoma City each year. The Tulsa State Fair attracts over one million people during its 10-day run, and the city's Mayfest festival entertained more than 375,000 people in four days during 2007. In 2006, Tulsa's Oktoberfest was {{named one of the}} top 10 in the world by USA Today and one of the top German food festivals in the nation by Bon Appetit magazine.|$|E
5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. <b>Roughly</b> <b>one</b> third of megamaser hosts are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E

5|$|East of Brooks Avenue, NY33A {{passes through}} a small {{residential}} area before entering a more industrial neighborhood surrounding the Erie Canal and the Rochester city line. In the western portion of this area, the route meets I-390 at exit19 and intersects Buell Road (County Route162), which directly links NY33A to the airport a half-mile (0.8km) to the south. East of I-390, NY33A crosses the Erie Canal and enters the city of Rochester, at which point maintenance of NY33A shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{to the city of}} Rochester. On the northern bank of the waterway, the route passes under the Rochester and Southern Railroad. The surroundings become significantly more residential east of the railroad as the route heads northeastward toward downtown Rochester. However, NY33A ends <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> mile (1.6km) west of downtown at a junction with NY33 (West Avenue). Here, Chili and West Avenues converge and NY33 continues toward downtown as West Main Street.|$|E
5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the <b>roughly</b> <b>one</b> mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. <b>Roughly</b> <b>one</b> mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A {{mile and a half}} from the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 {{at the foot of a}} small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E
