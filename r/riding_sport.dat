50|$|While {{in earlier}} times {{agriculture}} was a main source of income, nowadays only 20% {{of the people in}} Nußbach earn their livelihoods by working the land. Other occupations that were available in bygone days were forestry, mining and quarrying. There were coal mines near Reipoltskirchen, Hefersweiler, Relsberg, Adenbach and Rathskirchen. It is likely that workers from Nußbach were also employed in these places. In the village itself, there were also the customary craft occupations. Found in the village today are grocery shops, a clothing shop, a pizzeria and a filling station. For a long time, there was a wildlife park near the village, but this has closed. There are plans to build a great leisure and conference centre where the old wildlife park lay, with a hotel complex, an adventure swimming pool, a <b>riding</b> <b>sport</b> centre, a shopping centre and holiday houses. Such a complex could create many jobs for villagers and others from the local area. At this time, only a few people can actually pursue their profession within the village.

5000|$|After World War II, {{the mare}} {{population}} in 1950 was near 10,000; 11 years later, this number fell by over a third. In that decade, farmers {{had abandoned the}} breeding of horses, and the State Stud of Traventhal was dissolved. Instead of allowing the agricultural horses to die out as a breed, the Board of Directors of the breeders' federation purchased 30 Holsteiner stallions and three Thoroughbreds and completely reshaped the breeding direction. [...] Former state stallions were now owned by the breeders' association, a completely unique arrangement among German warmblood breeding societies. To accomplish the updating of the Holsteiner, several Thoroughbred and French stallions were imported. By 1976, most of the top Holsteiner stallions were Thoroughbred or half-Thoroughbred. The new style Holsteiners were more agile, quicker, taller, and had better jumping technique. These changes have been especially important over the 15 to 20 years, as <b>riding</b> <b>sport</b> has left the realm of male professionals and soldiers, and become dominated by women and girls who ride as a leisure activity. To {{meet the needs of}} this new market, today's Holsteiners have been made more rideable, more beautiful, and more refined.|$|E
40|$|Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} {{accidents}} in <b>riding</b> <b>sport</b> {{from the perspective}} of paramedics. Injuries in general, can be assigned to states, which are indicated by the departure of emergency medical services. It is therefore essential that the paramedic provides the injured patient appropriate pre-hospital emergency care. <b>Riding</b> <b>sport</b> has recently been easily accessible to the general public and many people do not realize the risks that this sport brings. The theoretical part is focused on riding. Significant part of the theoretical work is dedicated to the most famous riding sports. In every riding discipline was attempt to introduce the sport and its basic rules. The second chapter is formed by the safety equipment designed to protect the health of riders. There are introduced possible causes of accidents. It also focuses on prevention and to introduce basic rules of how to behave with horses. The last chapter deals with first aid at the accident in <b>riding</b> <b>sport.</b> In this part of the thesis is process of the injury from its origin, as well as non-professional help but mainly is incorporated professional pre-hospital emergency care. The research part of this thesis was formed through qualitative research. Data were obtained by semi-structured interview and by studying case studies of selected records about the departure of emergency medical services. Interviews were conducted with selected paramedics in the South Region. The survey which was made, sought only paramedics who has met in their profession the injuries resulting in <b>riding</b> <b>sport</b> in the last decade. Interview contained questions that were surveyed, with which particular type of injury, the respondents met and were interviewed for the implementation of pre-hospital care for patients with these injuries.

40|$|Cycling is {{a popular}} but unsafe mode of {{transport}} in the Netherlands {{and the number of}} seriously injured bicyclists has increased significantly since 2006. A special subgroup is the population of sport cyclists who perform their sport on public roads. The number of road crashes with sport cyclists shows an increasing trend. The authors propose two factors which might contribute to this trend. First, bunch riding among sport cyclists, and second the inflow of cyclists with low experience. No evidence is available related to sports cycling in particular. A questionnaire was developed in cooperation with the Dutch Tour Cycling Union (NTFU). The questionnaire aimed to observe involvement in crashes and possible contributing factors (e. g. : bunch riding, experience, distance travelled). The questionnaire was sent to 2625 members, with a response rate of 28 % (N= 744, male respondents). Two groups were researched: a group (N= 313) with cyclists known to have experienced at least one public road crash in the recent past, and a reference group with no such crash involvement (N= 431). Binary logistic regression analysis shows that bunch riding and experience contribute significantly to sport cyclist crash involvement. Experience had an effect regardless of age. This is in line with previous research among cyclists in general. Annual distance travelled had no effect on crash involvement. This means that cyclists who travel a longer annual distance have a lower risk (crashes per km). Further analysis indicated an effect of experience, where more experienced cyclists also travelled further on an annual basis. Bunch riding and relatively few years of sport cycling experience independently contribute to an increase in crash involvement. The authors recommend that the efficacy of bunch riding training interventions is evaluated, with the goal of promoting safety among inexperienced bunch <b>riding</b> <b>sport</b> cyclists.
