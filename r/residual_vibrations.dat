5000|$|The TRX {{engine was}} derived from that in the Yamaha TDM850, but the TRX is lighter, lower and sportier than its TDM stablemate. The {{parallel}} twin engine has five valves per cylinder, three inlet and two exhaust. The engine produces some 85 Nm of torque and 79 bhp. Unusually for a dry sump design, the oil tank is not remote, but is integral to the engine, sitting atop the gearbox. This feature simplifies manufacture, eradicates external oil lines, and gives faster oil warm-up. The shallow sump allows the engine to be sited lower, for an optimal CG position. The 360° crank of the original TDM was changed to a 270° crank in 1996, after which time the TRX and the TDM shared the same engine and transmission.

40|$|<b>Residual</b> <b>vibrations</b> affect {{machines}} {{at the end}} of commanded motion and represent an amplification factor for the work cycle. Furthermore, in repetitive cyclic movements, <b>residual</b> <b>vibrations</b> can lead to an important degeneration of the executed motion, due to a summation effect of undesired dynamic phenomena. For these reasons, the problem of <b>residual</b> <b>vibrations</b> is widely studied in literature and it is faced with different techniques. A first type of approach consists in the production of a structural device realized with proper mechanical solutions devoted to avoid the sources of vibrations. The second approach consists in introducing passive/active physical elements able to attenuate vibrations, by passively consuming their mechanical power or by actively counteracting them with external mechanical power. A third approach is the smart definition of the motion profile of each machine movable part to minimize the vibrational effects. The proposed work is addressed in this direction, with an optimization approach based on the Fourier transformation of the motion profile. More precisely, the natural frequencies of the system are evaluated through experimental tests, the designed motion profile is transformed with a Fourier analysis, a band around the natural frequencies of the system is suppressed from the motion profile spectrum, an antitransformation is implemented to obtain a temporal function, and, finally, a proper optimization is implemented to respect desired kinematical constraints.
