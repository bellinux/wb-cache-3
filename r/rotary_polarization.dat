5000|$|In 1815 he {{demonstrated}} that [...] "polarized light, when passing through an organic substance, could be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, {{dependent upon the}} optical axis of the material." [...] His work in chromatic polarization and <b>rotary</b> <b>polarization</b> greatly advanced the field of optics, although it was later shown that his findings could also be obtained using the wave theory of light (Frankel 2009).|$|E
50|$|Arago warmly {{supported}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel's optical theories, {{helping to}} confirm Fresnel's wave theory of light by observing {{what is now}} known as the spot of Arago. The two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the polarization of light which led to the inference that the vibrations of the luminiferous ether were transverse to the direction of motion, and that polarization consisted of a resolution of rectilinear propagation into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the polariscope and discovery of <b>Rotary</b> <b>polarization</b> are due to Arago. He invented the first polarization filter in 1812. He was the first to perform a polarimetric observation of a comet when he discovered polarized light from the tail of the Great Comet of 1819.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} mechanical design of <b>rotary</b> satellite antenna <b>polarization</b> system. It {{is a part of}} a mobile satellite antenna positioned on the roof rack of a passenger car. Device must be designed to achieve precise positioning and smooth running. It must also resist moisture and temperature fluctuations. For this application, there has been selected and developed solution with toothed belt. The thesis includes a selection algorithm of drive, belt and bearings. The achieved polarization angle is 180 Â°. The results of this paper can be used to produce a functional mobile satellite antenna polarization...|$|R
40|$|In 1950, {{a quarter}} of a century after his first ever {{nonlinear}} optical experiment when intensity dependent absorption was observed in uranium-doped glass, Sergey Vavilov predicted that birefringence, dichroism and polarization rotatory power should be dependent on light intensity. It required the invention of the laser to observe the barely detectable effect of light intensity on the <b>polarization</b> <b>rotary</b> power of the optically active lithium iodate crystal, the phenomenon now known as the nonlinear optical activity, a high-intensity counterpart of the fundamental optical effect of polarization rotation in chiral media. Here we report that a plasmonic metamaterial exhibits nonlinear optical activity 30 million times stronger than lithium iodate crystals thus transforming this fundamental phenomenon of polarization nonlinear optics from an esoteric phenomenon into a major effect of nonlinear plasmonics with potential for practical applications...|$|R

Observation of this giant polarization effect provides a powerful illustration that nanoscale nonlinear plasmonics of metamaterials offers extremely strong effects unfolding in nanoscale volumes of nonlinear medium that could lead to applications in modulation of light intensity and polarization in nanophotonic devices...|$|R
5000|$|Optical {{rotation}} or {{optical activity}} (sometimes {{referred to as}} <b>rotary</b> <b>polarization)</b> is {{the rotation of the}} plane of polarization of linearly polarized light as it travels through certain materials. Optical activity occurs only in chiral materials, those lacking microscopic mirror symmetry. Unlike other sources of birefringence which alter a beam's state of polarization, optical activity can be observed in fluids. This can include gases or solutions of chiral molecules such as sugars, molecules with helical secondary structure such as some proteins, and also chiral liquid crystals. It can also be observed in chiral solids such as certain crystals with a rotation between adjacent crystal planes (such as quartz) or metamaterials. Rotation of light's plane of polarization may also occur through the Faraday effect which involves a static magnetic field, however this is a distinct phenomenon that is not usually classified under [...] "optical activity." ...|$|E
