50|$|<b>Ringing</b> <b>out</b> is {{particularly}} important when mixing monitors, or foldback. As the performer or musician is usually behind the main PA system, the monitors are so they can hear themselves. As such, a microphone {{is much more likely}} to feedback through the monitor loudspeakers than the main PA. <b>Ringing</b> <b>out</b> can become quite complex when working with a large number of microphones and monitors. Indeed, with larger touring acts, one of the major advantages of the rise in use of in-ear monitors is the minimal <b>ringing</b> <b>out</b> that needs to be done.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history.

Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out.

25|$|In Polish culture, the Rezurekcja (Resurrection Procession) is the joyous Easter morning Mass {{at daybreak}} when church bells <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> and explosions resound to commemorate Christ {{rising from the}} dead.

As church bells <b>ring</b> <b>out,</b> handbells are vigorously shaken by altar boys, the air is filled with incense and the faithful raise their voices heavenward in a triumphant rendering of age-old Easter hymns. After the Blessed Sacrament is carried around the church and Adoration is complete, the Easter Mass begins. Another Polish Easter tradition is Święconka, the blessing of Easter baskets by the parish priest on Holy Saturday.

25|$|When {{the ring}} enters the crease, the goaltender then has five seconds to throw, pass with stick, deflect, or push the <b>ring</b> <b>out</b> to another player. If the goalie does not pass it within five seconds, the ring is {{awarded to the}} other team for a free pass {{from one of the}} {{defensive}} free play circles. The goalie may use the stick to touch the ring outside the crease, and can also pass through the crease, but may not pull it into the crease unless she pulls it all the way through and out with one motion. Otherwise, this results in a loss of possession, and a penalty if she has already been given a warning. The goalie may not pick up or cover the ring with her glove outside the crease. The goalie can push the ring with a hand when outside the crease, as can any other player.|$|E
