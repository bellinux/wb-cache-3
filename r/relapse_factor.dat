40|$|AIMS: Emotional facial {{expression}} (EFE) recognition {{has been shown}} to be impaired in abstinent alcoholics. The present study investigated the relationship between EFE recognition impairments and interpersonal difficulties in recently detoxified alcoholics (RA). METHODS: Thirty recently detoxified alcoholics were compared to 30 normal controls (NC) matched for age, sex and educational level on an EFE decoding test. This test involves 16 photographs depicting EFE of happiness, anger, disgust and sadness. Subjects were asked to fill in the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems evaluating six dimensions of interpersonal problems (assertiveness, submissiveness, intimacy, reliability, control and sociability). RESULTS: RA had EFE recognition deficits and more interpersonal problems, compared to NC. Reported interpersonal difficulties were correlated with EFE decoding problems. CONCLUSIONS: Interpersonal difficulties serve as a mediator between EFE accuracy problems and alcoholism. Impaired EFE recognition could have a role in the interpersonal difficulties encountered by RA and may therefore constitute a <b>relapse</b> <b>factor.</b> Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{is intended to}} assist with the identification of <b>relapse</b> <b>factors</b> for alcoholics who have relapsed after their twelve‑step program. It is beneficial to understand <b>relapse</b> <b>factors</b> for alcoholics in order to provide effective treatment plans, services, and goals that will assist in attaining sobriety from alcohol. The research study used a qualitative approach; the data was collected through interviews from participants at the Cedar House agency in Bloomington, CA. The data was collected and then analyzed for possible themes of <b>relapse</b> <b>factors.</b> Themes that developed from interviews conducted with alcoholics that had relapsed after their twelve‑step programs were: commitment to therapy, unemployment, availability of healthy support, shame and guilt in seeking support, loneliness, and lack of support from family/peers and community. There are limitations to this study which, include a small sample size and interviews were held at only one agency that incorporated the twelve‑step process.

40|$|Objectives. To analyze cranio-facial {{growth in}} Class III malocclusions and <b>relapse</b> <b>factors.</b> Methods. Information about growth in {{different}} types of malocclusions and dentoskeletal disharmonies are essential to plan orthodontic treatment, to forecast growth trends and to refer to adequate control data when evaluating treatment outcomes. Mandibular growth in Class III subjects is more pronounced, occurring with a delayed peak during adolescence and lasting longer than in subjects with normal occlusion. Results. The overall amount of mandibular growth, the negligible increase in maxillary size and the more vertical direction of growth in young adulthood are unfavorable aspects of Class III malocclusion in both sexes in the post pubertal period. Conclusions. Many authors tried to identify some unfavorable skeletal components that should induce the clinician to choose a combined surgicalorthodontic treatment. These predictive components are the increase of mandibular linear dimension and sagittal position, the worsening of skeletal vertical dimension with a clockwise mandibular rotation and increase of gonial angle...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pathologic N 2 non-small-cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) was {{demonstrated}} with poor survival among literature. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with pathologic N 2 NSCLC and received anatomic resection (i. e. lobectomy) for further <b>relapse</b> risk <b>factor</b> analysis. The {{aim of this}} study is to identify the clinicopathologic <b>factors</b> related to <b>relapse</b> among resectable N 2 NSCLC patients and to help clinicians in developing individualized follow up program and treatment plan. Method: From January 2005 to July 2012, 90 diagnosed pathologic N 2 NSCLC patients were enrolled into this study. We retrospectively reviewed medical records, image studies, and pathology reports to collect the patient clinico-pathologic factors. Result: We identified that patients with visceral pleural invasion (p =  0. 001) and skip metastases along mediastinal lymph node (p =  0. 01) had a significant relationship to distant and disseminated metastases. Patients who had 2 or more risk <b>factors</b> for <b>relapse</b> demonstrated poor disease free survival than those who had less than 2 risk factors (p =  0. 02).

Breast cancer is especially known for long asymptomatic periods, up to 25 years, with no evidence of the disease, followed by a <b>relapse.</b> <b>Factors</b> that determine the cell&# 39;s decision to enter a dormant state and that control its duration remain unclear. In recent years, considerable {{progress has been made}} in understanding how tumor cells circulating in the blood interact and extravasate into secondary sites and which factors might determine whether these cells survive, remain dormant, or become macrometastases. The mechanisms of tumor cell dormancy are still not clear. Two different hypotheses are currently discussed: tumor cells persist either by completely withdrawing from the cell cycle or by continuing to proliferate at a slow rate that is counterbalanced by cell death. Because dormant disseminated tumor cells may be the founders of metastasis, one hypothesis is that dormant tumor cells, or at least a fraction of them, share stem cell-like characteristics that may be responsible for their long half-lives and their suggested resistance to standard chemotherapy. Therefore, knowledge of the biology of tumor cell dormancy may be the basis from which to develop innovative targeted therapies to control or eliminate this tumor cell fraction. In this review, we discuss biological mechanisms and clinical implications of tumor dormancy in breast cancer patients.

METHODS [...] Each relapse slide was assessed blindly for French American British (FAB) type and other morphological features by a panel of three independent microscopists without reference to each other or any diagnostic material. Diagnostic slides had been assessed by the same panel on an earlier occasion. RESULTS [...] A total of 134 consecutive children was studied. Six (5 %) were classified as FAB type L 2 at diagnosis, compared with 18 (13 %) at relapse (a difference of 9 %). Twenty two (16 %) changed their FAB type, 17 (13 %) from L 1 to L 2 and five (4 %) from L 2 to L 1. The FAB score fell at relapse in 34 children and rose in 14, a difference of 14 %. Cell size was the commonest feature to change (increasing in 22 and diminishing in nine) followed by prominent nucleoli (appearing in 21 and disappearing in six). Forty four (33 %) children had vacuolated blasts at diagnosis, compared with 48 (36 %) at relapse. Twenty five changed their vacuole score substantially, 14 gaining > 10 % and 11 falling < 10 %.

25|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action with various sedative compounds that act by enhancing the GABAA receptor. Cross tolerance means that one drug will alleviate the withdrawal effects of another. It also means that tolerance of one drug will result in tolerance of another similarly-acting drug. Benzodiazepines are often used for this reason to detoxify alcohol-dependent patients and can have life-saving properties in preventing or treating severe life-threatening withdrawal syndromes from alcohol, such as delirium tremens. However, although benzodiazepines can be very useful in the acute detoxification of alcoholics, benzodiazepines in themselves act as positive reinforcers in alcoholics, by increasing the desire for alcohol. Low doses of benzodiazepines were found to significantly increase the level of alcohol consumed in alcoholics. Alcoholics dependent on benzodiazepines should not be abruptly withdrawn but be very slowly withdrawn from benzodiazepines, as over-rapid withdrawal is likely to produce severe anxiety or panic, which {{is well known for}} being a <b>relapse</b> risk <b>factor</b> in recovering alcoholics.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStress {{increases}} addictive {{behaviors and}} is a common cause of <b>relapse.</b> Corticotropin-releasing <b>factor</b> (CRF) {{plays a key role}} in the modulation of drug taking by stress. However, the mechanism by which CRF modulates neuronal activity in circuits involved in drug addiction is poorly understood. Here we show that CRF induces a potentiation of NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) -mediated synaptic transmission in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This effect involves CRF receptor 2 (CRF-R 2) and activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) -protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. We also find that this potentiation requires CRF binding protein (CRF-BP). Accordingly, CRF-like peptides, which do not bind the CRF-BP with high affinity, do not potentiate NMDARs. These results provide evidence of the first specific roles for CRF-R 2 and CRF-BP in the modulation of neuronal activity and suggest that NMDARs in the VTA may be a target for both drugs of abuse and stress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract When Plasmodium vivax tertian malaria was {{prevalent}} in The Netherlands, {{the use of}} therapeutic malaria {{for the treatment of}} neurosyphilis patients presented an opportunity for biological studies of the parasite’s behaviour, in healthy volunteers. One unexplained phenomenon was the long latency between natural exposure to a single infected mosquito and the appearance of clinical signs (average 8 months). Dutch studies with volunteers and syphilis patients, suggested that hundreds of sporozoites transmitted by several mosquito bites were enough to provoke an early attack, known from tropical vivax-malaria. Sporozoites appeared to be programmed either to delay their pre-erythrocytic development or to proceed to an early attack within three weeks. The number of infectious bites also determined the relapse rate and the number of relapses after a primary attack. Analyses of primary cases and relapses from the previous year were used to predict the incidence for the next year. These historic findings fit well with recent studies on genotyping of blood stages during primary attacks and <b>relapses.</b> External <b>factors</b> (i. e. the milieu inside the human host) may trigger hypnozoites to reactivate, but predetermined periods of latency should also be considered. </p...|$|R

Between RR and PP patients statistical significant differences were found in total load, number and size of the lesions when correlated with EDSS. Between RP and PP patients statistical differences were found in total load and size of the lesions on MRI, Patients with a relapsing course of the MS (RR or RP) had a higher total load and size of the lesions than PP patients, The total load, number and size of the lesions corrected for EDSS were also lower compared to <b>relapsing</b> patients. <b>Factor</b> analysis showed a correlation between clinical progression rate and progression rate of MRI abnormalities. No correlation between EDSS and total load of MRI lesions could be found. In conclusion, this study confirms the results of previous studies of differences between MRI scans of patients with a different course of MS...|$|R
40|$|Evoked {{potentials}} and T-lymphocyte helper/suppressor ratio (H/S) {{were evaluated}} serially together with neurological status in 30 definite multiple sclerosis patients {{to evaluate their}} possible role in monitoring disease progression. Evoked potentials in many cases reflected the clinical status of the pathways tested, but some exceptions were observed, probably due to subclinical <b>relapses</b> or physical <b>factors.</b> In some instances the occurrence of subclinical relapses was suggested by increased H/S ratios. Serial H/S values increased in parallel with clinical and subclinical relapses, and seemed to show specific patterns {{in relation to the}} type of clinical course (relapsing, stable, chronic progressive). Our results suggest that evoked potentials and H/S ratio serial analysis can contribute to a better assessment of the progress of multiple sclerosis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the characteristics of}} postoperative <b>relapse,</b> predictive <b>factors</b> and time to relapse after curative surgery for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours of the ileum, without hepatic or other distant metastases. METHODS: Clinical data of patients entered into the Groupe d'étude des Tumeurs Endocrines database were collected and analysed retrospectively to identify <b>factors</b> predictive of <b>relapse.</b> RESULTS: Among 100 patients followed for a median of 56. 5 (range 1 - 290) months, 42 relapsed after a median follow-up of 57. 5 (range 6 - 176) months, with liver lesions in 27 (64. 3 %). Median disease-free survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 88 months (95 % confidence interval 72 - 115). Disease-free survival was shorter for emergency surgery patients (p 20 mm (p= 0. 02), and those with multiple tumours (p= 0. 07). Multivariate analysis retained emergency surgery (odds-ratio 4. 04 [95 % confidence interval 2. 01 - 8. 11]), distant mesenteric lymph-node metastases (odds-ratio 2. 53 [95 % confidence interval 1. 22 - 5. 25]), and multiple tumours (odds-ratio 2. 14 [95 % confidence interval 1. 01 - 4. 50]), as being significantly associated with relapse. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent emergency surgery, with distant mesenteric lymph-node metastases or with multiple ileal tumours relapsed earlier. Closer monitoring for the patients with these risk factors may be required...|$|R
40|$|No {{reliable}} {{identification of}} quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) {{patients with a}} high risk of relapse is available. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a prognostic index to identify those patients. Untreated adult patients with quiescent disease (not induced by surgery) included in three phase III clinical trials were analysed retrospectively with respect to time to <b>relapse.</b> Nineteen <b>factors</b> related to biology, disease history, and topography were investigated. A relapse was defined as either a CD Activity Index (CDAI) > or = 200, a CDAI > or = 150 but over the baseline value by more than 100, or acute complications requiring surgery. The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 178 patients. The median follow up was 23 months. The Cox model retained the following bad prognostic factors: age 5 years, interval since previous relapse < or = 6 months, and colonic involvement (p < 0. 001). Bootstrapping confirmed the variable selection. Patients were classified into three groups with an increasing risk of relapse (p < 0. 001). The worst risk group was composed of patients presenting at least three of the four bad prognostic factors. These results make possible the design of clinical trials in quiescent CD patients with {{a high risk of}} relapse...|$|R
40|$|Background. DCIS {{treated by}} mastectomy ensures high local control rates. There is limited data on risk for relapse {{and lack of}} clear {{indication}} for adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). We report a retrospective review on a population of DCIS patients treated with mastectomy. The objective was to identify the overall incidence of <b>relapse,</b> risk <b>factors</b> for local recurrence, and accordingly for whom adjuvant postmastectomy RT may be considered. Methods. This is an IRB-approved retrospective study on a prospective breast cancer database. From 1997 to 2007, we identified 969 patients with diagnoses of DCIS, among them 211 breasts in 207 patients were treated with mastectomy and comprise the study group. Results. With a median followup of 55 months (4. 6 years) the 10 -year relapse-free survival is 97 %. Two of 211 breasts (0. 9 %) treated with mastectomy developed a local-regional recurrence. Both the relapses were among patients defined as having < 1 [*]mm final mastectomy margin. Conclusions. The rare local relapse after mastectomy limits our ability to reliably identify risk <b>factors</b> for <b>relapse.</b> The consideration for postmastectomy RT {{should be based on}} an individualized risk evaluating surgical technique used, presence of BRCA mutation, grade and extent of tumor, and proximity of lesion to the margin of resection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate 88 adolescent crack users referred to hospitalization and to follow them up after discharge to investigate <b>relapse</b> and <b>factors</b> associated with treatment. Methods Cohort (30 and 90 days after discharge) from a psychiatric hospital and a rehab clinic for treatment for chemical dependency in Porto Alegre between 2011 and 2012. Instruments: Semi-structured interview, conducted to evaluate the sociodemographic profile of the sample and describe the pattern of psychoactive substance use; Crack Use Relapse Scale/CURS; Questionnaire Tracking Users to Crack/QTUC; K-SADS-PL. Results In the first follow-up period (30 days after discharge), 65. 9 % of participants had relapsed. In the second follow-up period (90 days after discharge), 86. 4 % of participants had relapsed. Conclusion This is one of the first studies that show the extremely high prevalence of early relapse in adolescent crack users after discharge, questioning the cost/benefit of inpatient treatment for this population. Moreover, these results corroborate studies which suggested, young psychostimulants users might need tailored intensive outpatient treatment with contingency management and other behavioral strategies, in order to increase compliance and reduce drug or crime relapse, but this specific therapeutic modality is still scarce and must be developed in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Circulating immune {{complexes}} {{were determined}} in 59 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease and {{100 blood donors}} by a double method based on the inhibition of the agglutinating activity of CIq and/or rheumatoid factor on the IgG-coated polystyrene particles. In patients, the incidence of positive immune complexes was 63 % and 61 % at first testing, 85 % and 78 % at subsequent determinations; {{there was a good}} correlation between the inhibition titres of CIq and those of rheumatoid factor (p less than 0. 001). In blood donors, the incidence was 22 % and 14 % at low titre. The incidence of immune complexes was the lowest (36 %) in the group of resected patients without signs of relapse; repeat determinations showed absence of immune complexes three months postoperatively. In patients medically treated for primary disease or <b>relapse,</b> rheumatoid <b>factor</b> titre higher than 1 / 1 was less frequent than in medically untreated patients with active disease (p less than 0. 01). A significantly higher concentration of serum alpha- 1 -antitrypsin and orosomucoid, and a significantly lower level of serum iron were found in patients with an IC titre exceeding 1 / 1; longitudinal studies showed in most cases a concordance between the evolution of immune complex titres, inflammatory parameters and clinical status...|$|R
40|$|Continued {{excessive}} {{alcohol consumption}} {{can lead to}} the development of dependence that is associated with a withdrawal syndrome when alcohol consumption is ceased or substantially reduced. This syndrome comprises physical signs as well as psychological symptoms that contribute to distress and psychological discomfort. For some people the fear of withdrawal symptoms may help perpetuate alcohol abuse; moreover, the presence of withdrawal symptoms may contribute to relapse after periods of abstinence. Withdrawal and relapse have been studied in both humans and animal models of alcoholism. Clinical studies demonstrated that alcoholdependent people are more sensitive to relapse provoking cues and stimuli than nondependent people, and similar observations have been made in animal models of alcohol dependence, withdrawal, and <b>relapse.</b> One <b>factor</b> contributing to <b>relapse</b> is withdrawalrelated anxiety, which likely reflects adaptive changes in the brain in response to continued alcohol exposure. These changes affect, for example, the body’s stress response system. The relationship between withdrawal, stress, and relapse also has implications for the treatment of alcoholic patients. Interestingly, animals with a history of alcohol dependence are more sensitive to certain medications that impact relapselike behavior than animals without such a history, suggesting that {{it may be possible to}} develop medications that specifically target excessive, uncontrollable alcohol consumption.
