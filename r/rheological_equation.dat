The {{knowledge}} of regularities of deformation {{behavior of the}} processed confectionery masses with certain rheological properties allows to calculate parameters of shaping process and to select processing equipment for its carrying out.

The behavior of an elastic-, viscous- and plastic body in the conditions of quasistatic test for creeping during which the set size is tension, and the measured one is relative deformation is considered.

In its original form, the PML technique has been implemented for Maxwell’s electromagnetic equations. On the other hand, the KK method was applied to the Schrödinger and acoustic wave equations. Both techniques have subsequently widely been used in dynamic elasticity, involving different <b>rheological</b> <b>equations,</b> including poroe-lasticity, and electromagnetism. The coordinate stretching used in the PML method is equivalent to the damping kernel in the KK method, which is based on the Maxwell viscoelastic model. Inside the absorbing strips, the result is a traveling wave which gradually attenuates without changing shape or undergoing dispersion. Moreover, we also show that the recently developed unsplit C-PML method is based on the memory-variable formalism to describe anelasticity introduced by Carcione and co-workers, and that the damping kernel is based on the Zener viscoelastic model.
