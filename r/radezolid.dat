40|$|<b>Radezolid</b> (RX- 1741) is {{the first}} biaryloxazolidinone in {{clinical}} development. It shows improved activity, including against linezolid-resistant strains. <b>Radezolid</b> differs from linezolid {{by the presence of}} a biaryl spacer and of a heteroaryl side chain, which increases the ionization and hydrophilicity of the molecule at physiological pH and confers to it a dibasic character. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine accumulation and subcellular distribution of <b>radezolid</b> in phagocytic cells and to decipher the underlying mechanisms. In THP- 1 human macrophages, J 774 mouse macrophages, and human polymorphonuclear neutrophils, <b>radezolid</b> accumulated rapidly and reversibly (half-life of approx. 6 min and 9 min for uptake and efflux, respectively) to reach at equilibrium a cellular concentration 11 -fold higher than the extracellular one. This process was concentration- and energy-independent, but pH-dependent (accumulation reduced to 20 - 30 % of control values for cells in medium at pH < 6 or in the presence of monensin [collapsing pH gradients between the extracellular and intracellular compartments]). Accumulation at equilibrium was not affected by efflux pumps inhibitors (verapamil, gemfibrozil) and markedly reduced at 4 degrees C, but was further increased in media with low serum content. Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated a dual subcellular distribution for <b>radezolid,</b> with approximately 60 % of the drug colocalizing to the cytosol and approximately 40 % to the lysosomes, with no specific association with mitochondria. These observations are compatible with a mechanism of transmembrane diffusion of the free fraction and partial segregation of <b>radezolid</b> in lysosomes by proton trapping, as previously described for macrolides...|$|E
40|$|<b>Radezolid</b> {{is a novel}} biaryloxazolidinone in {{clinical}} development which shows improved activity, including against linezolid-resistant strains. In a companion paper (29), we showed that <b>radezolid</b> accumulates about 11 -fold in phagocytic cells, with � 60 % of the drug localized in the cytosol and � 40 % in the lysosomes of the cells. The present study examines its activity against (i) bacteria infecting human THP- 1 macrophages and located in different subcellular compartments (Listeria monocytogenes, cytosol; Legionella pneumophila, vacuoles; Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, mainly phagolysosomal), (ii) strains of S. aureus with clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance, and (iii) isogenic linezolid-susceptible and-resistant S. aureus strains infecting a series of phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells. <b>Radezolid</b> accumulated to similar levels (� 10 -fold) in all cell types (human keratinocytes, endothelial cells, bronchial epithelial cells, osteoblasts, macrophages, and rat embryo fibroblasts). At equivalent weight concentrations, <b>radezolid</b> proved consistently 10 -fold more potent than linezolid in all these models, irrespective of the bacterial species and resistance phenotype or of the cell type infected. This results from its higher intrinsic activity and higher cellular accumulation. Time kill curves showed that radezolid’s activity was more rapid than that of linezolid both in broth and in infected macrophages. These data suggest the potential interest o...|$|E
40|$|RESULTS Background. S. aureus invades and {{persists}} {{within a}} variety of non-phagocytic cells. This may play a determining role in relapsing diseases like skin or respiratory tract infections, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis. Effective treatment may require drug accumulation in target cells. We have previously shown that <b>radezolid</b> (RDZ) accumulates 8 -fold in human macrophages (Lemaire et al. ECCMID 2009, O 29). We have now determined its intracellular accumulation and activity {{in a series of}} relevant non-phagocytic cells. O N...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a {{frequent}} cause of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Various adverse effects {{have been associated with}} compounds that are commonly used in the treatment of MRSA. Areas covered: Prolonged use of high-dose vancomycin has been linked with nephrotoxicity. Linezolid use has been associated with lactic acidosis in regimens longer than 14 days and occurrence of thrombocytopenia in patients with renal impairment. Daptomycin use correlates with reversible and often asymptomatic myopathy. Among new compounds, telavancin has shown increased toxicity compared to vancomycin, especially in patients with severe renal impairment, while a low rate of adverse effects was reported others glycolipopeptides such as dalbavancin and oritavancin and for new cephalosporins. Recently studied oxazolidinones (tedizolid and <b>radezolid)</b> also showed mild adverse effects in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Expert opinion: Due to the constant increase in antimicrobial resistance, the use of higher doses and prolonged regimens of antibiotics employed in the treatment of Gram-positive infections has become more common and linked to increased toxicity. Furthermore, new compounds with MRSA activity have been recently approved and will be regularly employed in clinical practice. The knowledge of the adverse effects and risk factors for the development of toxicity associated with anti-MRSA antimicrobials is paramount for the correct use of old and new compounds, especially in the treatment of severe infections...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcal {{resistance}} to linezolid (LZD) is mediated through ribosomal mutations (23 S rRNA or ribosomal proteins L 3 and L 4) or through methylation of 23 S rRNA by the horizontally transferred Cfr methyltransferase. To investigate the structural basis for oxazolidinone activity against LZD-resistant (LZDr) strains, we compared structurally diverse, clinically relevant oxazolidinones, including LZD, <b>radezolid</b> (RX- 1741), TR- 700 (torezolid), {{and a set}} of TR- 700 analogs (including novel CD-rings and various A-ring C- 5 substituents), against a panel of laboratory-derived and clinical LZDr Staphylococcus aureus strains possessing a variety of resistance mechanisms. Potency against all strains was correlated with optimization of C- and D-rings, which interact with more highly conserved regions of the peptidyl transferase center binding site. Activity against cfr strains was retained with either hydroxymethyl or 1, 2, 3 -triazole C- 5 groups but was reduced by 2 - to 8 -fold in compounds with acetamide substituents. LZD, which possesses a C- 5 acetamide group and lacks a D-ring substituent, demonstrated the lowest potency against all strains tested, particularly against cfr strains. These data reveal key features contributing to oxazolidinone activity and highlight structural tradeoffs between potency against susceptible strains and potency against strains with various resistance mechanisms. 4. 672 JCR (2010) Q 1, 18 / 107 Microbiology, 26 / 252 Pharmacology & pharmac...|$|E
