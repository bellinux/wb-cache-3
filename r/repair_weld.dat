5000|$|The {{cause of}} {{cracking}} {{did not become}} clear until metallographic results were combined with stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement tests, followed by fracture mechanics analysis. It appeared that an already existing crack had extended through more than 90% of the wall thickness and was about 800 mm in length. Further, {{it was determined that}} hydrogen embrittlement had reduced the fracture resistance of the steel by more than half. The vessel had been put into service in 1970 and had undergone several repairs and modifications before the July 1984 incident. The vessel was fractured along a path that was weakened by extensive cracking adjacent to a <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> joining a replacement section to the original vessel. These pre-existing cracks initiated in areas of hard microstructure known to be susceptible to hydrogen stress cracking. This hard microstructure formed during the repair welding of the replacement section. The cracks grew through the vessel wall as a result of hydrogen pressure cracking.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of welding residual stresses {{is known to}} influence fracture of welded metallic structures. Where there is significant ductile deformation prior to fracture, welding residual stresses are often perceived to be removed as plasticity is accumulated and do not subsequently contribute to fracture. To explore this, a large scale experiment was conducted {{as part of the}} EU-STYLE project. One experiment was performed on a repair welded stainless steel pipe subjected to four-point bending. There was evidence of limited ductile tearing prior to collapse of the pipe. Prior to testing, residual stress measurements were made through the <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> and opposite the <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> in the original girth weld of the pipe. These measurements were used as input to a finite element (FE) model. An iterative technique was employed to map measured residual stresses onto an uncracked FE model, and an equilibrium state determined. The residual stress state was then mapped onto a cracked pipe FE model which was then used to simulate the pipe's behaviour. The simulations reveal that the {{presence of}} tensile residual stresses contributes significantly to initial yielding behaviour but as plasticity progresses the residual stresses are removed...|$|E
40|$|Numerical simulations, {{based on}} an off the self {{commercial}} finite element FE code and experimental tests using the neutron diffraction ND technique, are combined {{in an attempt to}} evaluate post weld heat treatment PWHT of a letterbox type <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> in respect of its effect on the residual stress field. 21 4 CrMo steel plates with an 18 pass <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> were heat treated at various temperature levels and for different durations. Due to the prohibitive cost of a complete residual stress mapping, ND tests were performed only at selected specimen locations. In this sense, FE simulation acts as a supplement to ND, since it predicts the complete residual stress field. Uncoupled quasi static thermoelasticity in conjunction with an element activation deactivation technique, simulating deposition of new weld material, are combined in a 3 D FE analysis. Grouping of the 18 weld beads in lumps, following a sensitivity analysis, reduces computational costs to feasible levels, whereas a creep strain hardening law is used to simulate stress relaxation during PWHT. Computed residual stresses are compared to ND measurements for verification purposes. Comparison of heat treated specimen measurements to heat treated and untreated specimen predictions illustrates that PWHT has a strong effect on the residual stress field, achieving significant stress relaxation...|$|E

40|$|Repair {{rather than}} {{replacement}} of pressure vessel components operating at elevated temperatures {{is becoming a}} far more viable option, with welding being used increasingly for repair, replacement, retrofits and modifications. However, the considerable cost and time involved in performing conventional post weld heattreatment (PWHT) is increasingly forcing utility owners to turn toward other alternatives, such as cold weld repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs to achieve tempering of the HAZ. One such cold weld repair was applied to a prematurely failed reheater outlet header (RHOH) in an emergency situation, enabling its return to service until a replacement component was available. Investigation of this particular repair constitutes a core component of this thesis. Much of the research that has been conducted to justify cold repair techniques has used accelerated high temperature creep testing to demonstrate their integrity. How well this testing reflects real-life performance of repaired components remains uncertain. However, the present study provided {{a rare opportunity to}} evaluate the effects of service exposure on the performance of an emergency cold weld repair, as well as to examine the effectiveness of accelerated laboratory creep testing on creep life predictions for the <b>repair</b> <b>weld,</b> the original fabrication welds and the service exposed parent metal. The metallurgical and mechanical properties of the service-exposed non-PWHT temper bead (TB) <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> were analysed and characterised systematically relative to both the service-exposed original fabrication weld and parent metal. All test specimens were machined transverse to the welding direction, from 20 mm thick slices taken from both the TB repair and original fabrication weldments. The mechanical property characterisation involved hot tensile (miniature sample), Charpy V-notch impact, hardness and accelerated creep-rupture testing. The microstructural characterisation consisted of compositional analysis, surface replication and conventional metallography, post-test fractography, high-resolution microscopy (SEM, TEM and EBSD), EDS and dilatometry. The microstructural studies were successful in characterising the service-exposed TB <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> metal both in the as-received and post-test conditions. The findings generally showed the TB <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> metal microstructure was significantly {{different from those of the}} parent and fabrication weld metals. This was established by the TEM and EBSD studies which showed finer carbides, higher dislocation density and limited subgrain formation, features which are consistent with structure of high stored strain energy. The finer carbides, significant Fe content of some carbides and the presence of Mo-rich carbides are also consistent with a relatively early stage in the carbide evolution sequence for this steel. Additionally, the non-metallic inclusions, which are generally considered to be deleterious to properties, were fine scale and uniform in size distribution. These microstructural characteristics were reflected in superior mechanical properties for all tests, with the notable exception of creep performance. In terms of creep resistance, weld repairs of this kind install a high energy microstructure (finer carbides, higher dislocation density, fine grain structure and subgrain / cell structure) into significantly creep degraded material and generate sharp gradients in microstructure and properties. Overall, the microstructural observations in the service-aged condition and the mechanical properties determined by the experimental work were found to support the conclusion that the ex-service material had clearly not exhausted its creep service-life. This was proven by simulating further service life using accelerated creep testing. During these experiments, the creep failure mode was found to be ductile fracture induced by micro-void coalescence. The tests indicated that although the predicted creep life of the TB repair weldment was inferior to the aged parent metal, it was slightly higher than that of the service-exposed fabrication weldment. It is therefore concluded that the TB <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> and its associated HAZ did not compromise the overall weldment integrity. This conclusion is drawn despite the finding that the accelerated creep test data for the <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> showed sub-normal creep performance relative to NT samples and even the aged parent metal. This outcome is probably due to the “accelerated” test conditions which induced structural changes that are unlikely to occur under the actual service conditions. Therefore, accelerated creep test data should be treated with circumspection, particularly for structures such as cold <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> metal which are characterised by high stored strain energy. The instability of this kind of structure in relation to restoration processes (at the “accelerated” temperatures used for testing) is likely to produce premature creep failure and result in a highly conservative creep life assessment. The perceived danger of cold repair welding is that the vessel integrity will be impaired by the absence of a PWHT to reduce internal stresses, liberate hydrogen and improve mechanical properties. However, the evidence obtained in this study indicates that this need not be the case. Therefore, it is concluded that the TB weld technique can be successfully applied to high energy piping (HEP) components without the need for PWHT. The results of the investigation provide new insights into the microstructure and properties, particularly the creep performance, of service-aged cold repair welds. The research has also revealed a serious limitation of accelerated creep testing of weld repair structures of this kind, in that dynamic restoration processes can be induced that are unlikely to occur at the lower service operating temperatures and stresses...|$|E

The elongation loss is attributed to the presence of a severe notch on each side (fusion line) of the <b>repair</b> <b>weld</b> bead reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|One {{application}} for <b>repair</b> <b>welding</b> is {{to restore the}} integrity of a component where a crack has been found. Cracks can appear during in-service or already in the manufacturing process. The latter is usually the case for large castings where cracks may have formed. The <b>repair</b> <b>welding</b> in this entry {{is the process of}} filling a premachined slot. This slot has been milled in order to remove the crack that has been found. The welding process can be any kind of arc, beam, or gas welding process. However, manual arc welding is the most common method for <b>repair</b> <b>welding.</b> Thereafter, the component may need to be heat treated in order to reduce residual stresses and/or restore material microstructure. Local heat treatment means that only a part of the structure is heat treated. This is in contrast to global heat treatment where the entire structure is heat treated by placing it in a furnace. We focus on the use of induction heating for local heat treatment in the current entry...|$|R
40|$|The {{low alloy}} steels, 2. 25 Cr-lMo (CrMo) and 0. 5 Cr- 0. 5 Mo- 0. 25 V (CMV), {{are two of}} the most widely used creep {{resistant}} steels in the power generation and petroleum industries of Australia. This project involved the accelerated creep tests of <b>repair</b> <b>welded</b> CrMo steel which was aged at 190, 000 hours at an operating temperature of 565 °C and <b>repair</b> <b>welded</b> CMV steel which had been in service for 120, 000 hours at an operating temperature of 538 °C. Two welding procedures with varying heat inputs were used for the <b>repair</b> <b>welding</b> process: a high heat input (HHI) procedure and a low heat input (LHI) procedure. The results of creep tests of <b>repair</b> <b>welded</b> samples and detailed optical and scanning electron microscopy of failed cross-weld specimens are reported. Predictions of remaining life were made using 2 ̆ 7 temperature versus time 2 ̆ 7 graphs, parametric extrapolation techniques (Larson-Miller Parameter), and the 2 ̆ 7 A 2 ̆ 7 Parameter. In addition, microstructural analysis (Neubauer and Toft 2 ̆ 6 Marsden Classifications), hardness testing and FEA models have been used as complementary indicators of remaining life. It was demonstrated that CrMo and CMV cross-weld samples had similar creep-rupture lives at the selected testing temperatures, with CrMo out-performing the CMV weldment in terms of microstructural damage and creep life. Also, the HHI cross-weld samples unexpectedly out-performed the LHI samples which were designed to be superior. The Larson-Miller parameter approach allowed predictions of remaining time in each weldment zone as did the 2 ̆ 7 A 2 ̆ 7 parameter technique, but with less success...|$|R
