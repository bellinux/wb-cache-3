5|$|General Pickett had {{received}} orders from Robert E. Lee to, with the Cavalry divisions of Major Generals William Henry Fitzhugh Lee and Thomas L. <b>Rosser,</b> hold the vital railroad crossing at Five Forks at all costs. On April 1, at the Battle of Five Forks, their troops {{were attacked by}} a combined force under Major General Philip Henry Sheridan, which consisted of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac, commanded by Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, and the Cavalry Corps of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Wesley Merritt. Pickett, W.H.L. Lee, and <b>Rosser</b> were located behind the lines of their troops {{at the time of}} the attack, enjoying a shad bake while failing to inform their subordinate officers of their location. Meanwhile, Warren's troops overwhelmed their left flank, and the Cavalry troops pinned the Confederates down elsewhere. By the time the Confederate commanders realized the catastrophe, it was too late to prevent the defeat. The result of the battle, as well as that of the Third Battle of Petersburg the following day, forced Lee to abandon his entrenchments at Petersburg, leading to the capture of Richmond and surrender of his army on April 9.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther <b>Rosser,</b> gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving.

25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. <b>Rosser,</b> Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. <b>Rosser</b> approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which <b>Rosser</b> replied that “I’ll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead <b>Rosser</b> crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that <b>Rosser</b> chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E
