5|$|C-2, C-3, and C-4 (Routine Training): C-2 {{dress is}} worn for {{day to day}} training; routine parades; or other {{occasions}} as ordered. It must be worn while travelling to and from a CTC. The dress is the same as C-1, except that the medal ribbons <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> medals. C-3 and C-4 is the same as C-2, except that the turtleneck and blue T-shirt <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> shirt and tie respectively; C-3 may be worn in cold weather.|$|E
5|$|C-8 (Mess dress) Worn during mess or formal dinners, {{and other}} {{occasions}} as ordered. Same as C-2, {{except that the}} white collar dress shirt with black bow tie <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> shirt and tie.|$|E
5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found by computing gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E
5000|$|... 6H1 also <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> XE1 prefix, 6I2 <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> XE2 prefix, and 6J3 <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> XE3 prefix. 6E4 <b>replaced</b> XF4 for <b>the</b> Revillagigedo island group.|$|R
50|$|The Azerbaijani {{alphabet}} is {{the same}} as the Turkish alphabet, except for Әə, Xx, and Qq, the letters for sounds which do not exist as separate phonemes in Turkish. When compared to the historic Latin alphabet: Ğğ has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic Ƣƣ (which was represented in Cyrillic by the stroked Ғғ); the undotted Iı (also used in Turkish) has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic soft sign; the dotted İi (also used in Turkish) has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic soft-dotted Ii; Jj has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic Ƶƶ; Öö has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic Ɵɵ; Üü has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic Үy; and Yy has <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> historic Jj.|$|R
50|$|In January 1963, the 213th Helicopter Squadron <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Helicopter Squadron, the 110th Liaison Squadron <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> 1st Liaison Squadron and the 114th Liaison Squadron <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Liaison Squadron.|$|R
5|$|COBOL 2002 also {{introduced}} free-format code. Free-format code {{can be placed}} in any column of the file, as in newer programming languages. Comments are specified using *>, which can be placed anywhere and {{can also be used}} in fixed-format source code. Continuation lines are not present, and the >>PAGE directive <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> / indicator.|$|E
5|$|Directed by Scott Derrickson and {{starring}} Keanu Reeves as Klaatu, {{this version}} <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> Cold War theme of nuclear warfare with the contemporary issue of humankind's environmental {{damage to the}} planet. It follows Klaatu, an alien sent {{to try to change}} human behavior or eradicate humans from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Catholic Church opposes {{in vitro}} {{fertilisation}} (IVF), saying that the artificial process <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> love between a husband and wife. In addition, it opposes IVF because it might cause disposal of embryos; Catholics believe an embryo is an individual with a soul who must be treated as such. For this reason, the church also opposes abortion.|$|E
50|$|Third place games/Bronze finals were {{introduced}} in the 2011-12 season. Starting in the 2016-17 season, Silver and Bronze medals {{were introduced}}, 5th place <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Plate, <b>the</b> Challenge Trophy <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Bowl, and <b>the</b> 13th place <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Shield.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Olympus <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> OmniDekka on Scania chassis, {{which is}} 10.6 or 11.9 metres in length. On Volvo chassis, it <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Myllennium Vyking. On Alexander Dennis chassis, it <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Myllennium Lolyne.|$|R
50|$|Many {{types of}} {{equipment}} are, or will soon, undergo a transitory phase {{as they are}} replaced. Some examples include the Marine Personnel Carrier <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> LAV-25, the F-35 Lightning II <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> AV-8B Harrier, and the CH-53K Super Stallion <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> CH-53E.|$|R
5|$|The chamber version <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> brass {{mostly by}} the organ and uses only one each of flute, oboe, {{clarinet}} and horn. Timpani, percussion and harp {{are the same}} as in the orchestra version, and for the strings, a minimum of two first violins, two second violins, two violas, one cello and one double bass required.|$|E
5|$|The weretiger <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> {{werewolf}} in shapeshifting folklore in Asia; in India {{they were}} evil sorcerers, while in Indonesia and Malaysia they were somewhat more benign. In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, tigers are fiercer and more ruthless than lions.|$|E
5|$|While general {{relativity}} <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank-two tensor, the latter reduces {{to the former}} in certain limiting cases. For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal gravitation.|$|E
40|$|Ian Barnes, Brek Miller, and Barry Jackson visited Carnarvon late in 2006. Jabba {{was removed}} from the mount, the weather cabling was <b>replaced,</b> all <b>the</b> dome roolers were <b>replaced,</b> <b>the</b> cloud {{detector}} LDR was replaced, some mount limit switches were <b>replaced,</b> <b>the</b> computer was <b>replaced,</b> <b>the</b> temperature onitor was reconfigured to monitor different things, <b>the</b> PMTEB was <b>replaced,</b> and <b>the</b> autoguider was realigned...|$|R

50|$|Other {{additions}} to the game include new minor native tribes. <b>The</b> Huron <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois, <b>the</b> Cheyenne <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Lakota (Sioux) and <b>the</b> Zapotec <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Aztec. Other new tribes include the Klamath, the Apache, the Navajo and the Mapuche. The expansion includes 16 minor tribes, compared to the original 12.|$|R
5|$|After the crisis, Unicamp saw {{a period}} of renewal and restructuring. In 1983 the bylaws were rewritten, {{ensuring}} {{the autonomy of the}} academic community, and the new management structure for the campus was implemented. In 1986 the newly created University Council <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. The last years of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like those found in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
25|$|The BR112 was {{launched}} in 1978 as a forerunner to <b>the</b> 2-series, <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> BR111. The rest of the 2-series were launched in 1981 with <b>the</b> F82/F112 <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> BF86/BF111 and <b>the</b> S82/S112 <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> B86/B111, and then in 1982 <b>the</b> K82/K112 <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> BR86/BR116. The BR112 was then updated to the N112 in 1984, and a tri-axle version of the K112 became available, known as the K112T. In 1985, the K82 and F82 were <b>replaced</b> by <b>the</b> 8.5-litre engined K92 and F92. Front-engined versions were in general discontinued on the European markets in the mid-1980s, but production continued in Brazil.|$|R
50|$|The Department {{was created}} in 1937, {{simultaneous}} with <b>the</b> new Constitution <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> Irish Free State's 1922 Constitution. <b>The</b> Department <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Department of the President of the Executive Council, just as the office of Taoiseach <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> office of President of the Executive Council.|$|R
50|$|The John and Frank Show <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> John and John Show, which <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Ted Stryker show on KFMA.|$|R
5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|The current {{economic}} climate {{in the country}} has affected many Icelandic businesses and citizens. With the creation of Nýi Landsbanki, the new organisation which <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> old Landsbanki, around 300 employees will lose their jobs due to a radical restructuring of the organisation which is intended to minimise the bank's international operations. Similar job losses are expected at Glitnir and Kaupthing The job losses can {{be compared with the}} 2,136 registered unemployed and 495 advertised vacancies in Iceland at the end of August 2008.|$|E
50|$|Dresses <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> casual {{t-shirts and}} jeans {{worn by the}} women while Chinos <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> denim pants worn by men.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, <b>the</b> DAP Championship <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Hotel Fitness Championship and the Albertsons Boise Open <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Small Business Connection Championship.|$|R
50|$|The 2000s sees {{reception}} of the Bartolomeu Dias-class frigates (<b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> old Comandante João Belo-class), of <b>the</b> Tridente-class submarines (<b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> old Albacora-class) and of the Portuguese designed and built Viana do Castelo-class ocean patrol vessels (intended to gradually <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> João Coutinho-class and Baptista de Andrade-class corvettes).|$|R
5|$|The eyewall {{may vary}} {{over time in}} the form of eyewall {{replacement}} cycles, particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> primary one {{at the end of the}} cycle, at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault <b>replaces</b> <b>the</b> {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
50|$|Around 1.6 {{million units}} {{were built in}} Brazil, with <b>the</b> Corsa <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> Junior and <b>the</b> Chevrolet Kadett/Ipanema <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> bigger engined versions.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Thinkpad X230 <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> earlier X220, {{introducing}} a new chiclet-style, 6-row keyboard <b>replacing</b> <b>the</b> older 7-row keyboard style. and Ivy Bridge processor.|$|R
