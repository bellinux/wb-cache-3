40|$|The rapid {{urbanization}} of China {{and associated}} {{demand for land}} resources necessitates remediation, redevelopment, and <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil.</b> Before these measures are taken, a basic investigation and inventory of heavy metal (HM) pollution levels in contaminated soil is necessary for establishing and implementing the redevelopment plan. In the present study, to identify the policy implications of inventorying and mapping HM pollution of soil in brownfields throughout China, the Bayan Obo giant rare earth element (REE) -Nb-Fe ore deposit of Baotou in Inner Mongolia, China, {{which is the largest}} REE mineral deposit in the world, was taken as a case study. Soil samples from 24 sites in Bayan Obo mining area (MA) and 76 sites in mine tailing area (TA) were collected for determining contents of soil HMs (Cr, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn). The results showed that the average concentrations of Cr, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in both MA and TA were all higher than their corresponding background values for Inner Mongolia but lower than the Class II criteria of the National Soil Quality Standards of China (GB 15618 - 1995). Enrichment factor (EF) analysis of the soil samples indicated that the soil in the brownfield sites was highly enriched with Cr, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn compared to the corresponding background values. In MA, the EF for Cd was the highest among the studied elements, while in TA, the EF for Cr (3. 45) was the highest, closely followed by the EF for Cd (3. 34). The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a moderate potential ecological risk from the studied HMs in MA and a low potential ecological risk in TA, and the results of RI also suggested that the soil was most heavily polluted by Cd. According to the spatial distribution maps of HM, contamination hot-spots were primarily located near mining-related high-pollution plants. Based on the results, policy recommendations are proposed related to brownfield management in urban planning...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has been}} addressed {{to study the}} <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> heavy metal <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> by soil washing, and to investigate the feasibility of photocatalytic processes {{for the treatment of}} the spent soil washing solution (SSWS). Indeed, the collected SSWS, containing the extracted metals and chelating agents, represents one of the main drawbacks of the washing technique, as it has to be submitted to further treatments for a complete detoxification before being discharged into the environment. The soil washing using EDDS as chelating agent has been demonstrated to be an efficient soil remediation technique to remove Cu and Zn from real polluted soils. Only Cu and Zn present as exchangeable and reducible fractions have been extracted by EDDS. The intra-particle diffusion was the main rate controlling step in the extraction of heavy metals from the solid matrix. Different contributions have been found by applying the Weber and Morris intra-particle diffusion model due to the different roles of superficial and intra-particle diffusive processes. The diffusion coefficients of the Cu/EDDS and Zn/EDDS complexes in real <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> have been estimated using simplified diffusive models. The simultaneous removal of EDDS and metals (Cu, Fe and Zn) from both synthetic solutions and real <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> washing mixtures at neutral pH has been investigated to assess the possibility of applying TiO 2 based photocatalytic processes for the treatment of SSWS and identify the sequence of photocatalytic processes required to optimally decontaminate the liquid wastes. The photocatalytic tests have demonstrated that the sequence of treatment constituted by two steps, TiO 2 -photocatalysis with oxygen followed by TiO 2 -sacrificial photocatalysis, is required to completely detoxify the SSWS. In particular, the results show that Fe and Zn are mainly removed by precipitation as insoluble hydroxides during the first step whereas the second step is necessary to reduce cupric ions to zero-valent Cu, which precipitates from the solution...|$|R
40|$|Copper {{smelting}} {{has created}} large surfaces <b>of</b> bare <b>soil</b> <b>contaminated</b> by trace metals (TMs: e. g. total Cu: 42, 500 mgkg - 1 in bare soil vs. 220 mgkg - 1 in remote forest) in the Lubumbashi suburbs of the 'Cité Gécamines/Penga Penga' (Katanga, D. R. Congo). Human exposure to trace metals {{at the site}} has become a primary environmental concern. This study evaluated different strategies (spontaneous and assisted phytostabilisation) to promote plant establishment on bare soil at the contamination site for soil reclamation/remediation. First, soil chemical properties were assessed in three vegetation units (bare soil, metallophytic grassland patches, and termite mounds). Results showed lower nutrients, organic matter content, and pH in bare soil; however increased metal concentrations were not detected. Limestone (0, 2. 5, 5, and 10 tha - 1) and compost (0, 45, and 225 tha - 1) were applied in a factorial design. Plant establishment was monitored for three years; and leaf TM concentration was assessed during the third year. Soil amendments improved bare soil conditions (higher pH and nutrients and lower TMs), and facilitated spontaneous plant establishment, with compost exhibiting the largest positive effects. Colonisers were primarily annual species; either true metallophytes or weedy taxa, which were sporadically present at the study site. However, only the perennial Microchloa altera survived during the 6 -month dry season. Following three years of phytostabilisation experiment with M. altera by planting, substantial growth and high survival was observed in M. altera. A combination of soil amendments (lime and compost) was most effective to improve plant fecundity, and reduce metal uptake by leaves.

40|$|A 30 -month {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in field containers to evaluate the potential of various amendments and/or a plant cover (Agrostis stolonifera L.) for <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>soil</b> <b>contaminated</b> with As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. Five amended treatments with plant were established: leonardite (LEO), litter (LIT), municipal waste compost (MWC), biosolid compost (BC) and sugar beet lime (SL). Two controls were also set up: control without amendment but with plant (CTRP) and control without amendment and without plant (CTR). A widely accepted sequential extraction procedure was used to assess changes in trace element pools in soil following remediation. Results showed that trace element distribution in soil was highly influenced by the origin of the contamination (mine sulphides) : trace elements were mainly associated with the residual fraction (in form of sulphides) {{and to a lesser extent}} with the reducible fraction, where Fe oxides and oxyhydroxides are expected, as a consequence of sulphide oxidation. The addition of amendments and/or establishment of a plant cover showed no clear effect on Cd and Pb distribution. The influence on As fractionation was also small and restricted to the most labile fraction, where higher concentrations of As were found in SL, MWC and BC. In contrast, Cu concentrations in the most labile fraction decreased in MWC, BC, LEO and LIT, while Cu recovery within the organic matter-associated fraction increased in these treatments. Zinc concentration in the most labile fraction was significantly lower in CTRP than in CTR, whereas Zn recovery in this fraction increased in MWC due to Zn input. In some cases redistribution of amendment-derived trace elements from slow-releasing fractions to the residual pool seemed to occur. Since the increase in As and Zn only accounted for a small proportion of the total pool and soil quality improved in treated soils, the use of soil amendments and/or revegetation might be a reliable option for long-term <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>soils</b> moderately <b>contaminated</b> with trace elements.

40|$|Abstract—Soil {{contamination}} by {{engine oil}} basically takes place due to spilling from vehicles or discarding of used engine oil in areas near garages or service stations. This contamination causes huge {{damage to the}} environment. The hydrocarbons present in the oil influences the quality and physical properties <b>of</b> oil <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil.</b> These hydrocarbons infiltrate into the soil through pore spaces and collect {{at the top of}} the ground level. A fraction of this hydrocarbon gets trapped and clog within pore space, which is cumbersome to remove and costly to clean. Some major tasks need to be performed for remediation and <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> area. Also, in connection with the clean-up works, and for any possible application <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil,</b> a knowledge <b>of</b> the geotechnical properties and behavior <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> is required. This study aimed to investigate the compaction characteristics of engine oil-contaminated alluvial soil. The amount of oil added to soil was varied at 0 %, 4 %, 8 % and 12 % of the dried weight of samples. Results showed that the oil contamination decreased the liquid limit, plastic limit and shrinkage limits. The compaction characteristics were also affected to a great extent. The MDD value was found to be decreasing as a result of increasing amount of added engine oil into the soil. A similar behavior was observed with the value of OMC with increasing engine oil content, which means that the addition of oil has adverse effects to the geotechnical properties <b>of</b> the studied <b>soil.</b> <b>Contaminated</b> residual <b>soils</b> might be used for geotechnical purposes and these results will be used for geotechnical purposes and will benefit engineers or researchers in recycling or re-using <b>of</b> <b>contaminated</b> <b>soils</b> Index Terms — Hydrocarbons, oil <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil,</b> petroleum products, remediation, reclamation.

30|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} groundwater travel times in an artificially drained watershed {{is essential to}} study the impact of drainage on the hydrologic aspects of the watershed. Subsurface drains are installed for increasing crop yields in seasonally or perennially wet soils with high productivity (Brown et al. 1998; Davis et al. 2000). However, numerous {{studies have shown that}} artificial drainage of an agricultural watershed brings about an increase in the outflow of streams in contact with the subsurface drainage tiles in the watershed and that a subsurface drainage system affects mostly the base flow portion of a stream hydrograph (Schilling and Libra 2003; Kladivko et al. 1999, 2004; Schilling and Helmers 2008; Schilling et al. 2012), particularly during fallow seasons when most of the drain tiles are running relatively full as compared to cropped seasons. Another central feature of a subsurface drainage system in a watershed is its influence on the groundwater travel times of a watershed. An accurate estimation of this parameter in a watershed is crucial as it provides information about probable time of migration of a pollutant to receiving water bodies in contact with the watershed via the subsurface (Jury 1975 a, b; Jury and Weeks 1978) drains. Groundwater travel times are also a vital indicator for lag time of a management practice being introduced in a field. By lag time, we mean the time between initiation of a conservation practice in a watershed and a response being observed in the field because of this practice (Meals and Dressing 2006; Schilling and Wolter 2007). Subsurface drainage is also often used for reclaiming waterlogged and saline soils and in mitigating phosphorous and pesticide loads of agricultural fields (Youngs 1994; Dils and Heathwaite 1999; Heathwaite and Dils 2000; Kroger et al. 2008). Washing of a salt-affected soil often involves subjecting the surface of the soil to a uniformly recharged or ponded field so that sufficient head is being provided to force water though the soil profile with the intention that the moving water takes away a portion of the salt present in the soil profile, the salt-enriched water is then drained {{with the help of a}} network of subsurface drains put into the soil for the purpose (Martinez Beltran 1978; Rao and Leeds-Harrison 1991; Youngs 1994; Barua and Tiwari 1995; Youngs and Leeds-Harrison 2000; Barua and Alam 2013). Thus, during <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> profile also, an accurate estimation of groundwater travel times for water particles originating at different locations on the surface of the soil is essential as this distribution provides information based on which the time of leaching <b>of</b> a <b>contaminated</b> <b>soil</b> profile may be worked out. It should be noted that this distribution is mostly non-uniform with particles being released further away from the drains taking much more time to move to the drains as compared to particles seeping from surficial locations close to drains (Zaslavsky 1979; Rao and Leeds-Harrison 1991; Youngs and Leeds-Harrison 2000; Chahar and Vadodaria 2011). Groundwater travel times are frequently estimated for a hydrogeology setting by numerical means using numerical codes like MODFLOW and GFLOW (Haitjema 1995). However, the procedure requires detailed information about the flow boundaries as well as on the hydro-geological properties of the studied subsurface system (Schilling and Wolter 2007). Moreover, for better accuracy, particularly in regions where the flow characteristics change rapidly in a flow domain, the numerical codes require finer grid settings to be implemented which may, at times, be quite computationally demanding. The groundwater travel times of a watershed can also be estimated in a simple way by taking resort to a geographical information system (GIS) platform, as has been done by Schilling and Wolter (2007). This model makes use of readily available soil data for the watershed and calculates the hydraulic gradient at the grids from the information contained in the digital elevation model (DEM) of the watershed, assuming that the water table profile of the watershed follows closely its surface topography. However, for a watershed being drained by a subsurface drainage system, the hydraulic gradients at all locations of the flow domain would naturally not follow the surface topography and hence Schilling and Wolter’s (2007) model probably would not be suitable for such situations. Jury (1975 a, b) made use of the steady-state tile drainage solution of Kirkham (1958) to predict travel times of inert solute particles from the surface of a soil profile to subsurface tiles being installed at a specific depth in the soil, the soil being underlain by an impervious barrier. Kirkham and Affleck (1977) provided expressions for predicting travel times of solute from injection points to a well in a confined aquifer that fully penetrates the aquifer utilizing the piston flow assumption of solute movement along streamlines. Utilizing the same assumption, Cushman and Kirkham (1978) made use of the analytical model of Khan and Kirkham (1971) to work out mathematical expressions for predicting travel times of solutes to fully penetrating wells in a multilayered aquifer underlain by an impervious barrier, both for the cases when the outer boundary is a constant head zone and when it is a no flow one. Kirkham and Sotres (1978) mathematically studied the influence of unscreened casing length of a well in a phreatic aquifer on the travel times of solutes and observed the travel times to be positively correlated with casing depth of the well. Kirkham and Sotres (1979) provided a steady-state model for predicting flow into a tube well with a cover slab at the top of the well, the well being dug in a water table aquifer underlain by an impervious layer. Using the developed model, they then studied the influence of the slab cover at the top of the well on the travel times by taking resort to again the piston flow assumption of solutes moving along streamlines and observed that a well cover slab may increase travel times considerably in comparison to wells with no covers, particularly for particles being injected close to the edge of the cover.|$|R
