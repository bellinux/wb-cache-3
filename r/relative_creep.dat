30|$|For the {{two types}} of bamboo-based products, the creep {{deformation}} increased as the stress level increased. The higher the stress level, the more damage for the product structure, and the more physical properties reduction for the bamboo-based products. The creep-recovery parameters are calculated and are shown in Table  2. The <b>relative</b> <b>creep</b> was quantified for creep behavior of the bamboo-based products. The <b>relative</b> <b>creep</b> was calculated ranging from 0.19 to 0.49 for BLVL, increased by 1.58 times when the stress level increased from 30 to 70 %. For the GLB products, the <b>relative</b> <b>creep</b> was ranged from 0.41 to 0.56, which increased by 0.36 times compared to the BLVL. It is seen that the increase rate for BLVL (1.58 times) was much higher than that of GLB (0.36 times), indicating that stress level was more sensitive on creep property for BLVL than that of GLB.

The co-rotation enhances effects of curvature and elasticity on the secondary flow. For the counter-rotation, there is a critical rotational number RΩ′, which can make the effect of rotation counteract the effect of curvature and elasticity.

40|$|Tendons {{are highly}} {{anisotropic}} and also viscoelastic. For understanding and modeling their 3 D deformation, information is needed on their viscoelastic response under off-axis loading. A study was made, therefore, of creep and recovery of bovine digital extensor tendons when subjected to transverse compressive stress {{of up to}} ca. 100 [*]kPa. Preconditioned tendons were compression tested between glass plates at increasing creep loads. The creep response was anomalous: the <b>relative</b> rate of <b>creep</b> reduced with the increasing stress. Over each ca. 100 [*]s creep period, the transverse creep deformation of each tendon obeyed a power law dependence on time, with the power law exponent falling from ca. 0. 18 to an asymptote of ca. 0. 058 with the increasing stress. A possible explanation is stress-driven dehydration, as suggested previously for the similar anomalous behavior of ligaments. Recovery after removal of each creep load was also anomalous. Relative residual strain reduced with the increasing creep stress, but this is explicable {{in terms of the}} reducing <b>relative</b> rate of <b>creep.</b> When allowance was made for some adhesion occurring naturally between tendon and the glass plates, the results for a given load were consistent with creep and recovery being related through the Boltzmann superposition principle (BSP).

50|$|Grain {{boundary}} migration {{plays an}} important role in many of the mechanisms of creep. Grain boundary migration occurs when a shear stress acts on the grain boundary plane and causes the grains to slide. This means that fine-grained materials actually have a poor resistance to <b>creep</b> <b>relative</b> to coarser grains, especially at high temperatures, because smaller grains contain more atoms in grain boundary sites. Grain boundaries also cause deformation in that they are sources and sinks of point defects. Voids in a material tend to gather in a grain boundary, and if this happens to a critical extent, the material could fracture.|$|R

Post-run samples have melt contents from 0. 3 to 6. 8  % and mean grain sizes from 4. 3 to 84. 5  μm. Grain boundary wetness, {{a measure of the}} intergranular melt distribution, was determined by analyzing scanning electron microscope images with sufficiently high resolution to detect thin layers wetting grain boundaries, as well as small triple junctions. The measurements show that grain boundary wetness increases with increasing melt content to values well above those predicted by the idealized isotropic equilibrium model for a finite dihedral angle. Additionally, the melt geometry changes with grain size, with grain boundary wetness increasing with increasing grain size at fixed melt content. Grain boundary wetness and dihedral angle of samples annealed {{at a range}} of temperatures, but constant melt content does not depend on temperature. These observations emphasize that the dihedral angle alone is not adequate to characterize the melt distribution in partially molten rocks, as the idealized isotropic model does not account for the influence of grain growth. Diffusion creep viscosities calculated from the measured wetness reflect the grain size and melt content dependence. Accordingly, experimentally measured viscosities at small grain sizes underestimate the effect of melt to weaken partially molten rocks for coarser grain sizes.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{adhesion}} {{in the field}} of rail transport represents an ability of tractive force transmission between wheel and rail. Adhesion characteristics is a property of tangential forces transmission between wheel and rail and represents the dependence of tractive force T or adhesion coefficient μ on creep velocity w, or, divided by speed of travel, dependence on <b>relative</b> <b>creep</b> s. The ascending branch of adhesion characteristics is of great importance and acts as one of significant input parameters to drive regulation systems.

These creep deformations {{are known to}} be larger than the creep deformations under constant humidity conditions. The present thesis deals with mechano-sorptive creep in Norway spruce wood. Creep in bending, tension and compression was studied experimentally. The test material was well defined in terms of growth conditions of the trees (one slow-grown stand and one fast-grown stand) and the position of the specimens in the trees. Influence of material properties as annual ring width, shrinkage/swelling, density, grain angle, modulus of elasticity, knots and compression wood on the mechano-sorptive creep behaviour was studied. Additionally, the variability of the dynamic modulus of elasticity (along the grain) and the shrinkage/swelling properties was studied for spruce wood. Annual ring width and modulus of elasticity are the two parameters that correlate best with the <b>relative</b> <b>creep</b> in bending. Specimens cut near the pith of the tree displayed significantly larger <b>relative</b> <b>creep</b> in bending than specimens cut near the bark. For bending creep no significant difference was found between specimens from the different stands. Mechano-sorptive compression creep deformations were larger than corresponding tension creep deformations. In tension and compression no significant difference between specimens cut near the pith and specimens cut near the bark was found. For all three loading modes, creep deformation after a few moisture cycles was a good predictor of the creep deformation also after more moisture cycles. In bending, tension and compression the picture of the creep behaviour was substantially changed when the free shrinkage and swelling along the grain were subtracted. The dynamic modulus of elasticity and the shrinkage/swelling in the longitudinal direction displayed a strong individual variation with distance from the pith for specimens from individual trees. The eigenfrequency for vibrations in the longitudinal direction was the single best predictor of shrinkage/swelling in all three directions. Occurrence of compression wood reduced the dynamic modulus of elasticity on the average by 40 %. The shrinkage/swelling in the longitudinal direction was doubled and in the transverse directions the shrinkage/swelling decreased by approximately 30 % for specimens containing compression wood.

Second, when tests were done at the same temperature (including the effect of Joule heating), the rate of creep was lower under imposed current than under isothermal conditions. These results are explained in the light of new data that show that the temperature within the joint is almost constant, even under a relatively high current density of 5500  A/cm 2. Given constant temperature and a microstructure that includes interfacial voids, the current depletes the joint of vacancies, lowering the␣average creep rate, and introducing observable heterogeneities in the creep pattern.

This work was undertaken to investigate the advantages of using PP fibres in random poly(propylene-co-ethylene) (PPE) with different fibre concentrations. Addition of long polypropylene fibres into PPE greatly improved the creep resistance and modulus of elasticity of the composite compared with the matrix polymer. However, high concentrations of long fibres (> 50 %, w/w) resulted in fibre packing problems and an increase in void content, which lead to a reduction in creep resistance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the possible causes of wheel squeal on Roslagsbanan, a narrow gauge (891 mm) suburban railway system in Stockholm, Sweden. Simulation of the dynamic behaviour of vehicles negotiating curves {{was carried out by}} means of the Swedish multibody simulation software GENSYS [1]. Wheel squeal may arise due to insufficient radial steering capability of the vehicles in curves causing too high levels of <b>creep</b> (<b>relative</b> sliding) in the wheel/rail-contact. Based on this theory, an advanced model of the creep-creep force relation was introduced. In this model the creep force decreases after creep reaches a certain level, called critical creep. It is believed that wheel squeal occurs after the creep level exceeded the critical creep value. Measured rail profiles of the curve together with measured wheel profiles were used as wheel/rail geometry input data. Other interesting parameters for the simulations, such as friction coefficient, primary suspension stiffness and damping, vehicle speed, braking/acceleration were varied and their effects on the outcome were tested. Worn wheels on newly grinded and worn rails under dry conditions are most likely to generate curve squeal. We believe the long term solution for Roslagsbanan is to grind the rail profiles into a shape more similar to the 50 E 3 with inclination 1 / 40. This will give a more even wheel wear over the whole wheel surface. However, curves below ca 300 m cannot be negotiated without wheel squeal, why all curves on the track tighter than ca 300 m have to be lubricated...|$|R

Extensive historical data was collected from two precasting plants and MN counties and it was found that, on average, the measured cambers at release and erection were only 74 % and 83. 5 %, respectively, of the design values. Through data collection, analysis, and material testing, {{it was found that the}} primary causes of the low camber at release were concrete release strengths that exceeded the design values, the use of an equation for concrete elastic modulus that greatly under-predicted the measured values, and thermal prestress losses not accounted for in design.

40|$|Background and Aims: The plastic {{alterations}} of clonal architecture {{are likely}} to have functional consequences, as they affect the spatial distribution of ramets over patchy environments. However, {{little is known about the}} effect of mechanical stresses on the clonal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clonal plasticity induced by mechanical stress consisting of continuous water current encountered by aquatic plants. More particularly, the aim was to test the capacity of the plants to escape this stress through clonal plastic responses. Methods: The transplantation of ramets of the same clone in two contrasting flow velocity conditions was carried out for two species (Potamogeton coloratus and Mentha aquatica) which have contrasting clonal growth forms. Relative allocation to clonal growth, to creeping stems in the clonal biomass, number and total length of creeping stems, spacer length and main creeping stem direction were measured. Key Results: For P. coloratus, plants exposed to water current displayed increased total length of <b>creeping</b> stems, increased <b>relative</b> allocation to <b>creeping</b> stems within the clonal dry mass and increased spacer length. For M. aquatica, plants exposed to current displayed increased number and total length of creeping stems. Exposure to current induced for both species a significant increase of the proportion of creeping stems in the downstream direction to the detriment of creeping stems perpendi Conclusions: This study demonstrates that mechanical stress from current flow induced plastic variation in clonal traits for both species. The responses of P. coloratus could lead to an escape strategy, with low benefits with respect to sheltering and anchorage. The responses of M. aquatica that may result in a denser canopy and enhancement of anchorage efficiency could lead to a resistance strategy. ...|$|R

While both models provided good fitting for the data, the 5 -element model was found to possess better extrapolation capacity beyond the regression period. An increase in the period of regression data from 90 days to 150 days significantly lowered the errors in both of the models. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{clarify the}} wood {{properties}} and chemical composition of branches of Viburnum odoratissimum produced by unusual eccentric growth, we investigated growth strain (GS), basic density (Db), microfibril angle (MFA), elastic moduli (EL and EL/Db), creep deformation, cellulose crystalline features, and lignin structure in {{upper and lower}} sides of the branches, and considered the correlations among these factors. In most measuring positions, the distribution of GS showed that higher tensile GS was in the upper side and compressive GS was in the lower side of the branch, which combines GS features of reaction wood. However, the generation of GS in the lower side was different from that in compression wood, because EL/Db and MFA had a negative correlation. The creep compliance curves show that the upper-side wood had low rigidity and high viscosity, whereas the lower-side wood had large rigidity and low viscosity. <b>Relative</b> <b>creep</b> had a negative relation with MFA in the upper side, which is unusual. The cellulose crystalline features showed no obvious difference between {{both sides of the}} branch; however, the lignin with less b-O- 4 proportion and less S units but more G units seemed to exist in the lower side because of a decreased syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) molar ratio. This suggests that cell wall could be reinforced by lignin resulting in lower viscosity in the lower side of the branch. Additionally, the S/G ratio showed a relatively high correlation with GS in the lower side. These results suggest that lignin structure {{plays an important role in}} adapting to environmental changes during eccentric growth for V. odoratissimum...|$|E
40|$|This {{viewgraph}} presentation {{includes the}} following main concepts. Goal: To evaluate Raman spectroscopy as a potential NDE tool {{for the detection of}} stress rupture in Kevlar. Objective: Test a series of strand samples that have been aged under various conditions and evaluate differences and trends in the Raman response. Hypothesis: Reduction in strength associated with stress rupture may manifest from changes in the polymer at a molecular level. If so, than these changes may effect the vibrational characteristics of the material, and consequently the Raman spectra produced from the material. Problem Statement: Kevlar composite over-wrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) on the space shuttles are greater than 25 years old. Stress rupture phenomena is not well understood for COPVs. Other COPVs are planned for hydrogen-fueled vehicles using Carbon composite material. Raman spectroscopy is being explored as an non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique to predict the onset of stress rupture in Kevlar composite materials. Test aged Kevlar strands to discover trends in the Raman response. Strength reduction in Kevlar polymer will manifest itself on the Raman spectra. Conclusions: Raman spectroscopy has shown relative changes in the intensity and FWHM of the ~ 1613 cm(exp - 1) peak. Reduction in <b>relative</b> intensity for <b>creep,</b> fleet leader, and SIM specimens compared to the virgin strands. Increase in FWHM has been observed for the creep and fleet leader specimens compared to the virgin strands. Changes in the Raman spectra may result from redistributing loads within the material due to the disruption of hydrogen bonding between crystallites or defects in the crystallites from aging the Kevlar strands. Peak shifting has not been observed to date. Analysis is ongoing. Stress measurements may provide a tool in the short term...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} modeling of concrete creep and shrinkage at variable environmental conditions. At lower <b>relative</b> humidity concrete <b>creeps</b> more slowly than at full saturation but during drying it creeps faster. Creep is also accelerated at elevated temperature or by temperature variations. One of the physically based models for concrete creep and shrinkage {{that takes into account}} variable temperature and humidity is based on the theory of microprestress and solidification (MPS). Unlike the MPS model to the models from the design codes which use the average cross-sectional approach, the MPS model operates at the material point level, which makes it possible to capture the stress distribution more realistically. Assessment of the MPS model is the main topic of this work. Several severe deficiencies of this model have been identified and appropriate remedies have been proposed. Comparing to the experiments, the original formulation of the MSP model exhibited the opposite size-effect on drying creep, spurious sensitivity to the particular choice of relative humidity and excessive compliance during the repeated cycles of temperature and relative humidity. First, the model was reformulated, making the governing equations simpler yet equivalent. Afterwards, the model was improved and validated on typical examples from the literature. The MPS model was implemented into the open-source finite element package OOFEM developed mainly at the Department of Mechanics, Faculty of Civil Engineering, CTU in Prague. The model was calibrated on the experimental specimens, and afterwards applied in the analysis of a real-world structure - a concrete floor subjected to drying. The results indicate that even the improved model needs further improvements regarding the relationship between shrinkage and relative humidity; however, this relationship cannot be uniquely identified from the currently available experimental data. The engineering approach of shrinkage updating based on short-time measurements has also been questioned.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A set of finite element computer programs has been written for the settlement analysis of structures founded on normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soft clays. The programs take into account nonlinear material stress-strain behaviour and creep. Analyses may assume 'undrained' and 'drained' conditions and fully coupled consolidation analyses are also possible. The 'modified' Cam clay model has been used with some modification to model nonlinear material stress-strain behaviour and a phenomenological creep relationship to model creep behaviour. The author's programs have been-tested against another, fully tested, finite element package and also against closed form solutions where they exist. Sensitivity {{of the results of}} creep analyses in response to possible variations in the determination of the values of the creep parameters has also been studied. Results of a combined creep and consolidation analysis of a flexible strip footing. indicate the <b>relative</b> importance of <b>creep</b> displacements with respect to the consolidation settlements which are difficult to separate in practice. A review is made of the main nonlinear models of soil behaviour available to the practising engineer. The main techniques within the finite element method that are used to implement such nonlinear soil models are also reviewed and the 'initial strain' method chosen for use in the computer programs developed. The author's programs have been used to calculate displacements and excess pore pressures resulting from the construction of a trial embankment built at Cubzac-les-Ponts in France and compared to the measured in-situ values. In the conclusions an appraisal is made of the soil model developed by the author and the nonlinear finite element solution technique used. Also, the results of analyses using the computer programs and the accuracy {{of the results of the}} analyses of the trial embankment are summarised. The author's computer programs are explained and listed in the form of appendices...|$|R
