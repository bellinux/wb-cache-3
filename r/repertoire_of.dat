5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a <b>repertoire</b> <b>of</b> signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
5|$|Currently, major Italian opera theaters {{maintain}} ballet companies. They {{exist to}} provide incidental and ceremonial dancing in many operas, such as Aida or La Traviata. These dance companies usually maintain a separate ballet season and perform the standard <b>repertoire</b> <b>of</b> classical ballet, little {{of which is}} Italian. The Italian equivalent of the Russian Bolshoi Ballet and similar companies that exist only to perform ballet, independent of a parent opera theater is La Scala Ballet, which is {{under the direction of}} Frèdèric Olivieri.

40|$|This article’s goal is {{to explore}} the {{existence}} of ‘political citizens’ profiles across three European cities (Turin, Cologne and Lyon) and to ascertain {{the role of an}} unstable occupational status on the <b>repertoires</b> <b>of</b> action deployed. For this purpose, a technique called latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) is applied to a large sample, including young precarious and regular workers (deployed as a reference group). This technique allowed us to derive five descriptive probabilistic profiles of ‘political citizens’ and their <b>repertoires</b> <b>of</b> action in each city. The empirical findings underline the emergence <b>of</b> hybrid <b>repertoires</b> <b>of</b> action together with ‘single-issue’ or ‘cause-oriented’ forms of political participation.

5|$|From {{the early}} 1890s, Janáček led the {{mainstream}} of folklorist activity in Moravia and Silesia, using a <b>repertoire</b> <b>of</b> folksongs and dances in orchestral and piano arrangements. Most of his achievements in this field were published in 1899–1901 though his interest in folklore would be lifelong. His compositional work was still influenced by the declamatory, dramatic style of Smetana and Dvořák. He expressed very negative opinions on German neo-classicism and especially on Wagner in the Hudební listy journal, which he founded in 1884. The death of his second child, Vladimír, in 1890 was followed by an attempted opera, Beginning of the Romance (1891) and the cantata Amarus (1897).|$|E

WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration.

The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E
