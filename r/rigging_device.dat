5000|$|Brian Henson was {{the middle}} child and first born son of Jane Henson (1934-2013) and Jim Henson (1936-1990). He had four siblings: Lisa (born 1960), Cheryl (born 1961), John (1965-2014), and Heather Henson (born 1970). As a child, he made several cameo {{appearances}} {{in some of the}} filmed segments his father produced for the PBS children's series Sesame Street, most notably in various segments of the [...] "Number Song Series." [...] As he got older, he built the very first Muppet penguin puppet for the opening [...] "Lullaby of Broadway" [...] segment of a season three episode of The Muppet Show, guest starring Gilda Radner. During his summer break from high school in 1980, he assisted in the bicycle sequence from The Great Muppet Caper (1981). He helped create and operate a special <b>rigging</b> <b>device</b> that was created to allow the Muppets to ride bicycles since he was skilled in the use of marionette puppets. A few years later, he similarly operated a marionette of Scooter riding a bicycle in The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, new {{development}} of a sensor <b>rig</b> <b>device</b> with infrared sensors is used to reconstruct the 3 D image of an object’s surfaces. Five sensors {{have been used to}} acquire data that measure distance from the object and sensors. A stepper motor controls the object rotation with 2 degrees per turn. A few objects such as tulip, curvilinear, flower and star shape have been selected for data collection, and the results proved that this sensor <b>rig</b> <b>device</b> is capable of reconstruct a 3 D image of an object’s surface. A prosthetic model with distinct size in diameter was tested to prove that this device is capable of measuring distance with different size. From the results obtained, this sensor <b>rig</b> <b>device</b> shows a capability to reconstruct 3 D image of an object surfaces with simple post processing technique. A prosthetic object was tested and results show that the accuracy was around 75 %...|$|R

Spider-Man's teammates Iceman and Firestar help the web-slinger overcome his deathtraps ranging from a robotic giant gorilla and a robotic shark. This led Mysterio to create special traps to keep Iceman and Firestar from interfering which included android look-a-likes of their favorite movie stars. Mysterio even created a robot duplicate of Hulk to attack Spider-Man which ended up fighting the real Hulk. After Hulk was defeated, Mysterio is apprehended by Spider-Man.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} an aerodynamic loading acting on the stator vanes of the turbocharger using variable nozzle turbine (VNT). Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) is applied using commercial software ANSYS CFX. A full turbine stage CFD model is used to investigate the aerodynamic loading in several operating points for different stator vane positions. Results are compared with the measurement on the Gas Stand testing <b>rig.</b> This <b>device</b> burns natural gas and produces a stable flow at very high temperatures. This excludes the impact of the engine control management, the engine vibrations, and the flow pulsations on measured values. A comparison of measured and simulated vane aerodynamic loading provides a very good correlation. These encouraging results show a high potential of CFD methods for further development and optimization of VNT mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, {{the bullet}} catch trick was tested on the TV show MythBusters. The crew used a {{slaughtered}} pig's head {{to see if}} it were actually feasible for a human jaw to withstand the force of a bullet. Despite having stronger teeth than a human, the pig's teeth and jaw were badly damaged. After judging the trick [...] "busted", the crew was challenged to design a precisely timed mechanical bullet catching <b>rig.</b> This <b>device</b> was only modestly successful at actually catching a bullet, and only after the [...] "jaws" [...] were switched from a human shaped metal jaw to a longer duckbill one with more surface area. Even with perfect timing aided by ultra-high speed photography, the bullet deteriorated into an almost unrecognizable mass of metal upon impact.|$|R
50|$|Jayne is {{suspected}} {{to have been}} behind the disappearance of Ann Miller, 21, Patricia Blough, 19, and Renee Bruhl, 20, who were last seen July 2, 1966 in Indiana Dunes State Park, after leaving their purses and car keys {{on the beach and}} boarding a boat similar to one owned by one of his stable workers. Blough and Miller boarded their horses at Silas Jayne's brother, George Jayne's, Tri-Color Riding Stables on 1200 West Algonquin Road (now a Harper College parking lot in unincorporated Palatine), and may have been witnesses to the planting of the car bomb that killed 22-year-old Cheryl Lynn Rude there on June 14, 1965 as she attempted to move his Cadillac. Following the incident, George <b>rigged</b> a <b>device,</b> consisting of the key attached to a wooden pole, which enabled his turning the ignition of vehicles while standing outside the passenger-side door.|$|R
50|$|They {{take shelter}} {{at a local}} school, {{examining}} the remaining items in the envelope while Porter tries to convince Jennings of the relationship they shared during his tenure at Allcom. One of the stamps holds a microdot that, on enlargement, reveals several pictures of newspaper headlines taken from a machine's display showing Allcom becoming financially successful with a device that can depict future events, but the world reacts to the catastrophic forecasts in ways that fulfill their outcomes, resulting in financial panic, political strife and America launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Jennings realizes he must have built this device based on Dekker's invention and, on realizing the horrors that will come, prepared the envelope, using the forecasts from the machine to allow his future self to return to Allcom and destroy the machine. Furthermore, as Rethrick discovers, Jennings <b>rigged</b> the <b>device</b> to malfunction, preventing Rethrick from anticipating Jennings' actions.|$|R
