5|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Hezbollah {{condemned}} al-Qaeda for targeting {{civilians in}} World Trade Center, but <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> {{on the attack}} on The Pentagon. Hezbollah also denounced the massacres in Algeria by Armed Islamic Group, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya attacks on tourists in Egypt, the murder of Nick Berg, and ISIL attacks in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Potthast later {{married and}} took on her husband's name. Her son {{struggled}} with ailments {{throughout his life}} and stayed with her; her daughter became a physician. In a 1987 interview with former Der Spiegel editor Peter-Ferdinand Koch, Potthast <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> about Himmler's responsibility for Nazi war crimes. She died in 1997, aged 85, in Baden-Baden, Baden-Württemberg.|$|E

"In sum, {{a suspect}} who has {{received}} and understood the Miranda warnings, {{and has not}} invoked his Miranda rights, waives the right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> by making an uncoerced statement to the police. Thompkins did not invoke his right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> and stop the questioning. Understanding his rights in full, he waived his right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> by making a voluntary statement to the police." ...|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 800 {{students}} from both Platte Canyon High School {{and the nearby}} Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request {{for the police to}} back away. All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School. Parents were able to gain little information from authorities, who <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> regarding the issue while the crisis continued.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel <b>remained</b> <b>silent.</b> However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} the Polish Jewish {{community}} was decimated during World War II, coupled with well-known collaboration stories, has contributed to a stereotype of the Polish population having been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. Also, the postwar portrayals of Holocaust perpetrators based on court testimonies greatly contribute to this multifaceted distortion in perspective, because the German policemen <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> till the end about Polish help to Jews and their own brutal punishment for such help.|$|E
5000|$|... is {{difficult}} to sustain. First, s 35(5) only becomes applicable once it has been established that evidence has been unconstitutionally obtained. In respect {{of the right to}} <b>remain</b> <b>silent,</b> it first needs to be established whether the right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> in s 35(1)(a) or s 35(3)(h) has been infringed. The right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> attaches only to arrested and accused persons and does not embrace the rights of the victim and society at large. The broader notion of trial fairness may possibly be read into s 35(5) but is precluded at any earlier stage of the inquiry. Secondly, by conflating the right to silence and the right to a fair trial at all stages, Yacoob J implies that the only remedy for infringing the right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> is the exclusion of evidence. An arrested person who is subjected to improper police questioning that infringes her right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> must surely (at least theoretically) be able to seek relief for the infringement of this pre-trial right prior to going to trial. Undue emphasis on trial fairness may result in insufficient attention being given to the underlying relationship between the right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> and the right to dignity.|$|R
50|$|With {{regards to}} the trial procedure, an adult accused has the option to give a sworn evidence, unsworn evidence, or <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> The Child Act does not provide for any right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent.</b> Section 90(9) merely allows the child to give sworn or unsworn evidence.|$|R
50|$|Indeed, {{when there}} is a problem in the workplace, {{employees}} have two options: <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> or speak up. Unfortunately, many employees choose to <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> because {{they do not want to}} share information that could be interpreted as negative or threatening. Employees typically <b>remain</b> <b>silent</b> about conflicts with co-workers, disagreements about organizational decisions, potential weaknesses in work processes, illegal or dangerous behaviors, and individual/personal grievances. Their silence keeps management from receiving critical information that would allow their organizations to improve or address problems before they have adverse effects.|$|R
5|$|The {{major event}} of the second day (August 31, 1983) was the {{successful}} deployment of the INSAT-1B satellite, which took place at 7:48 UTC, with Challenger then maneuvering to avoid the firing of the booster motor forty minutes later. Other experimentation continued, though telemetry through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A fire alarm sounded in the morning, indicating signs of {{a fire in the}} avionics compartment, but a second alarm <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic, although a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions and never interposed {{with her own}} views in public. She <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> {{on the topic of}} his suspected extra-marital relationships—including a liaison with her daughters' governess. In turn, she was treated with unfailing respect and her position at Court and home was always secure. Of the four children Teresa Cristina bore him, two boys died in infancy and a daughter of typhoid fever at the early age of 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held {{a peace conference}} in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry would finally marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir. Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> and Richard then publicly changed sides at the conference and gave formal homage to Philip {{in front of the}} assembled nobles.|$|E

5|$|The {{two players}} {{did not tell}} their {{teammates}} or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval. They {{said that they did}} not feel that their liaisons were harming their team's chances in any way. They <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, asserting that his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the harbour. Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the harbour. The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the harbour itself <b>remained</b> <b>silent.</b> From entering the harbour to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1538, {{shortly before}} the Catholic Duke Georg of Saxony died, a {{religious}} colloquy was convened in Leipzig to discuss potential reforms within the Duchy. The Electorate of Saxony sent Melanchthon, and Philip of Hesse sent Bucer. The Duchy itself was represented by Georg Witzel, a former Lutheran who had reconverted to Catholicism. In discussions from 2 to 7 January 1539, Bucer and Witzel agreed to defer controversial points of doctrine, but Melanchthon withdrew, feeling that doctrinal unity was a prerequisite of a reform plan. Bucer and Witzel agreed on fifteen articles covering various issues of church life. Bucer, however, made no doctrinal concessions: he <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> on critical matters such as the mass and the papacy. His ecumenical approach provoked harsh criticism from other reformers.|$|E

5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but <b>remained</b> <b>silent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

Arizona and is aware he or she has the right to <b>remain</b> <b>silent,</b> but does not explicitly invoke or waive the right.|$|R
5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> on {{the presidential}} campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
5|$|Hanson <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> {{during the}} team's {{interviews}} while Hawk {{did most of}} the talking. The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka to win the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions. They held the title belts four times between 1968 and 1971 while feuding with George Becker and Johnny Weaver. During that time, they also won the IWA World Tag Team Championship while competing in Tasmania. While in the Carolinas, Hanson and Hawk {{spent a lot of time}} with Ric Flair when Flair entered the wrestling business. Hawk stated that Flair used to cause trouble for the group, including one incident in which Flair flirted with the girlfriend of a Mafia member. Hanson and Hawk used their friendship with the Mafia member to help Flair escape from being killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to remedy the {{perceived}} defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 {{and then to the}} Philadelphia Convention in 1787, where they drafted the United States Constitution, which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the new Constitution's lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government. In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began. Hancock mostly <b>remained</b> <b>silent</b> during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.|$|E
