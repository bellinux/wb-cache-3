25|$|During questioning, Javadi {{says that}} one of Nazir's men detonated the Langley bomb, and that Brody {{had nothing to do}} with it. As Carrie {{delivers}} Javadi to the airport, he tells her that Bennett knows the bomber's identity. Carrie enlists Quinn to help clear Brody's name. To track down the bomber, she tells Franklin that Leland's firm has been linked to the bombing, provoking Leland into ordering the bomber moved out of the country. She takes part in a stakeout of the bomber's hotel room and watches as Franklin approaches with a silenced pistol. Carrie insists on intervening, as she cannot prove Brody's innocence without the bomber's testimony. Black ops agent Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) orders her to stand down, but she ignores him and starts <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> hotel. Quinn shoots her in the shoulder to stop her. Adal's team then drives her to the hospital.|$|E

The bomb failed to detonate, which gave Diệm enough time to seek shelter in a cellar in the eastern wing.

500|$|During {{a seventh}} {{interview}} the next day, Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had {{made during the}} attack. During the eighth interview, {{he said he had}} armed himself that night with a broom handle, and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock, but there were too many people around him: [...] "I had a weapon when I was <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> policeman, a broom handle." [...] He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of common purpose.|$|E
500|$|Washington saw Tomjanovich <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> altercation. Not {{knowing that}} he {{intended}} to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a roundhouse punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious {{in a pool of blood}} in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete. Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker. Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was [...] "the loudest silence you have ever heard." [...] Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor press box, and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.|$|E

Riegels told the Associated Press, [...] "I was <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sidelines when I picked up the ball... I started to turn to my left toward Tech's goal. Somebody shoved me and I bounded right off into a tackler. In {{pivoting}} {{to get away from}} him, I completely lost my bearings." [...] Teammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop. Known for his speed, Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California's [...] line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately rushed by a wave of Georgia Tech players, and tackled by Frank Waddey and Vance Maree at the [...] line. [...] The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E

2500|$|On June 22, Jackie Bryson, {{a friend}} of Grant [...] "who was {{kneeling}} and handcuffed just inches from Grant when Johannes Mehserle shot him", testified for the prosecution. Bryson said that Grant's hands were under Grant's body and Grant said: [...] "I quit. I surrender." [...] He claimed that Mehserle said [...] "Fuck this" [...] before shooting Grant. Defense attorney Rains repeatedly accused Bryson of lying to convict Mehserle and pointed out a video showing Bryson <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> train while handcuffed. Responding to Rains' question, [...] "You were going to leave your friend on that platform, weren't you?" [...] Bryson said [...] "I would never leave my friend." [...] Rains accused Bryson of being inconsistent based on his statements in the civil lawsuit he had filed in early January 2009 against BART. Bryson {{said that he had}} lied to investigators, distrusted the police, and had been frequently stressed since Grant's killing.|$|E
2500|$|Right halfback Joe Magidsohn scored both of Michigan's {{touchdown}}s {{within the}} first ten minutes of {{the start of the}} game. [...] Allerdice kicked both extra points. [...] The first touchdown was scored less than two minutes into the game and was set up by a trick play. [...] With the ball at the 22-yard line, Michigan lined up to kick a field goal, but the formation was a fake. [...] William Wasmund took the snap from center and ran backward and to his left. [...] Wasmund tossed the ball back to Dave Allerdice who was trailing behind Wasmund. [...] Allerdice began running with the ball, then stopped behind the blocking of the fullback. [...] Allerdice passed to Magidsohn who was <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> right sideline. [...] Magidsohn caught the ball at the 26-yard line and ran downfield before he was tackled at the five-yard line. [...] Magidsohn scored on a short run two players later, and Allerdice kicked the extra point.|$|E

50|$|The Gjinoc burial mound (Illyrian tumulus), is {{a unique}} case of tumuluses {{recorded}} in Kosovo.

Nevertheless, based on the overall dimensions, the tumulus construction, height and setting, most probably the burial mound was constructed during the Late Iron Age of the Dardanian antiquity. Moreover, when taking into consideration the overall facts, it might be stated that the giant tumulus grave was constructed for a very important family with a high social status.|$|R

2500|$|Ascetic practices, shrine {{rituals and}} ceremonies, and Japanese festivals {{are the most}} public ways that Shinto devotees {{celebrate}} and offer adoration for the kami.

Many festivals involve believers, who are usually intoxicated, parading, sometimes <b>running,</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> shrine while carrying mikoshi (portable shrines) as the community gathers for the festival ceremony. Yamamoto Guji, the high priest at the Tsubaki Grand Shrine, explains that this practice honors the kami because [...] "it is in the festival, the matsuri, the greatest celebration of life {{can be seen in the}} world of Shinto and it is the people of the community who attend festivals as groups, as a whole village who are seeking to unlock the human potential as children of kami." [...] During the New Year Festival, families purify and clean their houses in preparation for the upcoming year. Offerings are also made to the ancestors so that they will bless the family in the future year.|$|E

2500|$|Milwaukee {{has three}} [...] "founding fathers": Solomon Juneau, Byron Kilbourn, and George H. Walker. Solomon Juneau {{was the first}} of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He was not the first European settler (Alexis Laframboise settled a trading post in 1785) but founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began {{attracting}} more settlers. [...] In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the Milwaukee River and made sure the streets <b>running</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today. Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent builder was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, King {{returned}} to his alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono, to teach for {{a year as a}} gesture of gratitude for the education he had received there. During this time his family rented a house on a busy road in Orrington. The road claimed the lives of a number of pets, and the neighborhood children had created a pet cemetery in a field near the Kings' home.

King wrote the novel based on their experiences, but feeling he had gone too far with {{the subject matter of the}} book, he discarded the idea of having it published, particularly since both his wife Tabitha and friend Peter Straub agreed Pet Sematary was too dark and unenjoyable. However, needing a final book for his contract King reluctantly submitted it to Doubleday on the advice of his wife Tabitha. The subsequent success of the book made King note how both Americans and British readers liked it despite him considering Pet Sematary too bleak in how [...] "it just spirals down into darkness. It seems to be saying that nothing works and nothing is worth it, and I don’t really believe that.” ...|$|E
