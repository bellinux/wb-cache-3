50|$|StreetStrider is {{the brand}} name for a mobile {{elliptical}} trainer. The StreetStrider consists of a T-shaped lower frame to which two front wheels and a rear wheel containing a drive assembly are attached, and an upright frame to which two <b>reciprocating</b> <b>arm</b> <b>levers</b> are attached. Two elongated foot platforms {{on either side of}} the lower frame are attached to cranks as part of the drive assembly, which, as with bicycle drivetrain systems, also includes a hub, a rotating axle, and an internal hub gear system translating the axle rotation to the hub. The StreetStrider drive assembly is either chained or chainless direct drive, depending on model. The lower end of each arm lever is attached to the front end of each foot platform, which, by connection in the rear to the rotating crank arm and in the front to the pivoting arm lever, moves generally in an elliptical path. The device also includes a leaning mechanism for steering, as well as brakes and multiple gearing. It was developed by David W. Kraus.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} of incorporating VTEC {{for both the}} intake and exhaust valves in a SOHC engine has been removed on the J37A4 by a novel design of the intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Each exhaust valve on the J37A4 corresponds to one primary and one secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Therefore, there are a total of twelve primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and twelve secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> However, each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is shaped similar to a [...] "Y" [...] which allows it to contact two intake valves at once. One primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> corresponds to each secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> As {{a result of this}} design, there are only six primary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and six secondary intake <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the years}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> have been {{optimized}} in its design and material for better performance. Durability, toughness, high dimension stability, wear resistance, strength {{and cost of}} materials {{as well as economic}} factors are the reasons for optimization of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> This paper reviews the various types of <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> based on published sources from the last 40 years in order to understand <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> for its problem identification and further optimization. This paper present what <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is, where it is used and why it is used, History related to <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> and it working is described. Various types of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> used in vehicles and different materials used for making <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> are studied in this paper. Reasons for Failure of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> are also discussed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|The primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> {{contacts}} a low-profile camshaft lobe during low-RPM engine operation. Once VTEC engagement occurs, the {{oil pressure}} {{flowing from the}} exhaust rocker shaft into the primary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the VTEC switching piston into the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> thereby locking both exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> together. The high-profile camshaft lobe which normally contacts the secondary exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> alone during low-RPM engine operation is able to move both exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> together which are locked as a unit. The same occurs for the intake rocker shaft, except that the high-profile camshaft lobe operates the primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... {{the intake}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are marked {{so they are}} {{correctly}} placed on the rocker shaft when servicing. An IN1 or IN2 will be embossed on each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> As viewed {{from the front of}} the engine the Number 1 intake valve of each cylinder and the number 2 intake valve have an IN1 marked and IN2 marked <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> that mates with it. New IN1 <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> can also be identified by a Green painted mark on the top of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> The IN2 <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> have a white mark. Proper positioning is maintained through the use of a wave washer located between the <b>rocker</b> shaft <b>arm</b> and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> shaft support.|$|R

50|$|For {{car engines}} the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are {{generally}} steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of strength, weight and economical cost. Because the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are, in part, reciprocating weight, excessive mass {{especially at the}} lever ends limits the engine's ability to reach high operating speeds. For this reason, aluminum is often used for high performance, aftermarket <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> for pushrod engines {{as well as many}} OEM <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> on OHC engines. Aluminum rockers on OHC engines often have a steel pad or roller where the cam contacts the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> in order to reduce wear. Truck engines (mostly diesel) use stronger and stiffer <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> made of cast iron (usually ductile), or forged carbon steel.|$|R
50|$|Advanced VTEC has a {{standard}} camshaft and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> attached as they normally are with camshaft overhead, and <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> pushing {{down on the}} poppet valves. The camshaft {{is surrounded by a}} partially open drum which has secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> attached to it via a pivoting point. These secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> which have a varying depth profile (similar to cams), are directly actuated by the camshaft, in a scissor-like manner. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{beginning}} with the J37A4 3.7L SOHC V6 engine introduced on all 2009 Acura TL SH-AWD models, SOHC VTEC was incorporated for use with intake and exhaust valves. The intake and exhaust rocker shafts contain primary and secondary intake and exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> respectively. The primary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the VTEC switching piston, while the secondary <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> contains the return spring. The term [...] "primary" [...] does not refer to which <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> forces the valve down during low-RPM engine operation. Rather, {{it refers to the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> which contains the VTEC switching piston and receives oil from the rocker shaft.|$|R
50|$|Some {{overhead}} cam engines employ short <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> {{in which the}} cam lobe pushes down (rather than up) on the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> to open the valve. On this type of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> the fulcrum {{is at the end}} rather than the middle, while the cam acts on the middle of the arm. The opposite end opens the valve. These types of <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are particularly common on dual {{overhead cam}} motors, and are often used instead of direct tappets.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> finger, or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use <b>rocker</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>Rocker</b> <b>arms</b> are actuated by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual ball studs in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{the design}} {{aspects of the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> {{geometry}} has been studied and changed to maximize the cam information exchange to the valve which the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> imposes, as set forth by the Miller US Patent, #4,365,785, issued to James Miller on December 28, 1982, {{often referred to as}} the MID-LIFT Patent. Previously, the specific pivot points with <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design was based on older and less efficient theories of over-arcing motion which increased wear on valve tips, valve guides and other valve train components, besides diluting the effective cam lobe information as it was transferred through the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> motion to the valve. Jim Miller's MID-LIFT Patent set a new standard of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> geometrical precision which defined and duplicated each engine's specific push-rod to valve attack angles, then designing the rocker's pivot points so that an exact perpendicular relationship on both sides of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> was attained: with the valve and the pushrod, when the valve was at its [...] "mid-lift" [...] point of motion.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} use of {{this system}} was Honda's VTEC system. VTEC changes hydraulic pressure to actuate a pin that locks the high lift, high duration <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> to an adjacent low lift, low duration <b>rocker</b> <b>arm(s).</b>|$|R

The obtained results provided by ANSYS Workbench are compared to the results obtained by manual calculation...|$|R
50|$|VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift {{intelligent}} system) (also sometimes denoted as VVT-iL or Variable Valve Timing and Intelligence with Lift) is {{an enhanced}} version of VVT-i that can alter valve lift (and duration) {{as well as}} valve timing. In {{the case of the}} 16 valve 2ZZ-GE, the engine head resembles a typical DOHC design, featuring separate cams for intake and exhaust and featuring two intake and two exhaust valves (four total) per cylinder. Unlike a conventional design, each camshaft has two lobes per cylinder, one optimized for lower rpm operation and one optimized for high rpm operation, with higher lift and longer duration. Each valve pair is controlled by one <b>rocker</b> <b>arm,</b> which is operated by the camshaft. Each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> has a slipper follower mounted to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a spring, allowing the slipper-follower to freely move up and down with the high lobe without affecting the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> When the engine is operating below 6000-7000 rpm (dependent on year, car, and ECU installed), the lower lobe is operating the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> and thus the valves, and the slipper-follower is freewheeling next to the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> When the engine is operating above the lift engagement point, the ECU activates an oil pressure switch which pushes a sliding pin under the slipper-follower on each <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> The <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> is now locked into the slipper-follower's movements and thus follows the movement of the high rpm cam lobe and will operate with the high rpm cam profile until the pin is disengaged by the ECU. The lift system is similar in principle to Honda VTEC operation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pull rod and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> are {{important}} parts of aircraft control system, its strength, stiffness and stability can largely affect the aircraft’s control effect, sometimes the flight safety will be influenced [2]. A type of aircraft control system has been upgraded and modified, therefore the pull rod and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> of the flap control system {{need to take the}} static strength test. Based on field test and finite element simulation analysis, this paper has the static strength of pull rod and <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> checked, and to verify the correctness of the finite element model and lay foundation for the optimization design of components of aircraft control system...|$|R
50|$|The {{effective}} leverage {{of the arm}} (and {{thus the}} force it can exert on the valve stem) {{is determined by the}} <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> ratio, the ratio of the distance from the <b>rocker</b> <b>arm's</b> center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrod. Current automotive design favors <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> ratios of about 1.5:1 to 1.8:1. However, in the past smaller positive ratios (the valve lift is greater than the cam lift) and even negative ratios (valve lift smaller than the cam lift) have been used. Many pre-World War II engines use a 1:1 (neutral) ratio.|$|R
40|$|As a {{combination}} of two materials with different properties, the aluminum die-cast <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a ceramic insert for internal combustion engines {{is a kind of}} technical improved new product. Replacing the conventional forged steel <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with it can ameliorate the wear resistance and dynamic characteristics of the valve greatly, and reduce the maintenance of engines evidently. On the foundation of analyses of the key manufacturing techniques suited to mass production of the aluminum die-cast <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> with a ceramic insert, a general model of developing procedure of it is put forward. At the same time, the applying methods of modern devising theories and means to the design process of this type of <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> are expounded, and several innovating points and ways of producing technologies of it are described as well.

5000|$|All of the D.III series were {{generally}} {{very similar to}} other models, {{with the exception of}} the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily-sealable cylindrical <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, <b>rocker</b> boxes, <b>rocker</b> <b>arms</b> and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical [...] "slotless" [...] valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.|$|R

50|$|As {{popularity}} and marketing {{value of the}} VTEC system grew, Honda applied the system to SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off was that Honda's SOHC engines benefitted from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center <b>rocker</b> <b>arm</b> and cam lobe (for each intake and exhaust side), and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust <b>rocker</b> <b>arms,</b> leaving no room for the VTEC <b>rocker</b> <b>arm.</b> Additionally, the center lobe on the camshaft cannot be utilized by both the intake and the exhaust, limiting the VTEC feature to one side.|$|R
