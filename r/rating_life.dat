It is shown that the basic <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> increases more than quadratically with the roller infill and the aspect ratio of the rollers, increases with the sixth power of the pitch diameter of the roller set and decreases with the third power of the applied radial force. Further, for any given ratio of axial to radial force, an optimal contact angle exists which maximizes the <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> of the bearing pair, irrespective of the actual bearing size and ratio of roller diameter to pitch diameter. The optimization procedure can either be used to design custom-made bearings or to select from manufacturers’ catalogues the bearing with the best contact angle for any assigned loading condition...|$|E

40|$|The <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> of ball {{bearings}} is reduced when hard particle contaminants {{are present in}} the lubricant. Usually, this life reduction is taken into account in the calculation of modified <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> by using the contamination factor through a general characterization of the lubrication conditions. However, the impact of contaminant’s variables such as size, hardness and concentration level has to be specified in detail. This need is resolved by the present work, where greases contaminated with hard steel particles of different sizes are tested with the purpose of finding a pattern in the relationship between steel particle sizes and the progress of wear inside the bearings. A laboratory rig is utilized for these tests and vibration analysis is performed to estimate the condition and the residual life of the bearings. After the tests, optical inspections performed in a stereoscope verify the predictions of vibration analyses. It was found that large contaminating particles, after their initial deformation, produce high stresses and therefore higher wear of the bearings and that the wear mechanism is closely related to the interruption of the lubricating film {{in such a way that}} local overheating caused point melting and adhesion of the particles adhered on the raceways. In case of grease contaminated with steel particles, vibration analysis can indicate the severity of wear and monitor its progress. From the conducted tests of the present work it is prove...|$|E

40|$|One main {{contributor}} for gearbox rated lifetime estimation is {{the assessment}} of bearing loading during predicted operating conditions. This paper investigates an approach to determine input bearing loading {{by means of a}} TPA (Transfer Path Analysis) approach. TPA is suggested to retrieve internal bearing forces from acceleration measurements acquired at the outside of the gearbox housing. However, classical TPA methods would require the gearbox to be dismantled during the transfer path determination process. This poses significant practical challenges. To overcome this issue, this paper investigates the possibility of using a flexible multibody simulation model to calculate the different frequency response functions between bearings forces and acceleration sensors. All simulations use a flexible multibody modeling approach, which has been extensively validated. Main results of this validation process have been published by the authors in the past. The paper discusses the results of such analysis on a multi-megawatt wind turbine gearbox. Here, simulated acceleration measurements on the gearbox housing are processed into bearing forces. The feasibility of using these forces for a <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> calculation is investigated. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics interpretation of rolling bearing fatigue MWJ Lewis 1 and B Tomkins 2 In fatigue assessment of structures and components, {{it is now}} commonplace to use a defect-tolerant approach {{to account for the}} inevitable presence of surface and internal flaws, both detectable and undetectable. This approach has been applied to rolling bearings in an attempt to present contact stress limits as a function of defect size below which fatigue failure would not be expected. In essence, it is an extension to the existing <b>rating</b> <b>life</b> methods developed by Ioannides and Harris that incorporate a fatigue limit stress in the estimation of bearing life, a concept {{similar to that of the}} endurance limit in structural fatigue. Such a {{fracture mechanics}} approach to sub-surface initiated fatigue in rolling bearing steels containing non-metallic inclusions, based upon the work of Murakami, has led to an allowable contact stress limit as a function of maximum inclusion size (as estimated by extreme value analysis). An alternative, less conservative fracture mechanics based stress limit is the prevention of propagation of cracks formed on inclusions (termed ‘butterflies’) by shear (Mode II) loading. The approach has been developed by examination of butterflies formed in service in rolling element bearings manufactured in bainitic steel with maximum inclusion sizes in excess of 100 mm. The observed lack of micro-crack formation on inclusions and non-propagation of butterflies support the concept of a fatigue endurance limit that is related to the cleanliness of the bearing steel...|$|E
