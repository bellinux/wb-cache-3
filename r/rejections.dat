40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that <b>rejection</b> sensitivity, a social cognitive processing style characterised by anxious and angry expectations of <b>rejection,</b> develops from experiences of <b>rejection</b> or acceptance by others. The {{purpose of this}} study of 417 children and early adolescents (age 9 to 13) was to examine how relationship experiences are directly and interactively associated with their <b>rejection</b> sensitivity. In a multivariate analysis, there was an association of <b>rejection</b> by parents and by peers with <b>rejection</b> sensitivity, with a stronger association between peer <b>rejection</b> and sensitivity than between parent <b>rejection</b> and sensitivity. Regarding interactive effects, peer <b>rejection</b> was found to have a strong association with <b>rejection</b> sensitivity among participants with low or high parent acceptance, and among those with high friendship satisfaction. Yet, there was evidence of a stronger association between peer <b>rejection</b> and <b>rejection</b> sensitivity among those with low parent acceptance or high friendship quality. This was because <b>rejection</b> sensitivity was highest when peer <b>rejection</b> was high and parent acceptance was low, and sensitivity was lowest when peer <b>rejection</b> was low and friendship quality was high.

50|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft <b>rejection</b> that may occur. They include hyperacute <b>rejection,</b> acute <b>rejection</b> and chronic <b>rejection.</b> Hyperacute <b>rejection</b> is caused by {{preformed}} anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute <b>rejection</b> happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute <b>rejection,</b> which is B cell mediated, acute <b>rejection</b> is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute <b>rejection</b> is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute <b>rejection</b> is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic <b>rejection</b> is the presence of any sign and symptom of <b>rejection</b> after 1 year. The cause of chronic <b>rejection</b> is still unknown but an acute <b>rejection</b> is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.Liver <b>rejection</b> may happen anytime after the transplant. Lab findings of a liver <b>rejection</b> include abnormal AST, ALT, GGT and liver function values such as prothrombin time, ammonia level, bilirubin level, albumin concentration, and blood glucose. Physical findings include encephalopathy, jaundice, bruising and bleeding tendency. Other nonspecific presentation are malaise, anorexia, muscle ache, low fever, slight increase in white blood count and graft-site tenderness.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} (1996) {{definition}} of <b>rejection</b> sensitivity is {{the tendency to}} [...] "anxiously expect, readily perceive, and overreact" [...] to social <b>rejection.</b> People differ in their readiness to perceive and react to <b>rejection.</b> The causes of individual differences in <b>rejection</b> sensitivity are not well understood. Because of the association between <b>rejection</b> sensitivity and neuroticism, there is a likely genetic predisposition.

His hopes that, despite the previous <b>rejections,</b> Japan would reciprocally attack the Soviet Union, were not realized, as Japan stuck to its Nanshin strategy of going south, not north, and would continue to maintain an uneasy peace with the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Germany's declaration of war further solidified German–Japanese relations and showed Germany's solidarity with Japan, which was now encouraged to cooperate against the British. To some degree, Japan's actions in South-East Asia and the Pacific in the months after Pearl Harbor, including the sinking of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS Repulse, the occupation of the Crown Colonies of Singapore, Hong Kong, and British Burma, and the air raids on Australia, were a tremendous blow to the United Kingdom's war effort and preoccupied the Allies, shifting British (including Australian) and American assets away from the Battle of the Atlantic and the North African Campaign against Germany to Asia and the Pacific against Japan. In this context, sizeable forces of the British Empire were withdrawn from North Africa to the Pacific theatre with their replacements being only relatively inexperienced and thinly spread divisions.

25|$|The {{classical}} {{explanation of}} the ultimatum game as a well-formed experiment approximating general behaviour often leads to a conclusion that the rational behavior in assumption is accurate to a degree, but must encompass additional vectors of decision making. Behavioral economic and psychological accounts suggest that second players who reject offers less than 50% of the amount at stake do so for one of two reasons. An altruistic punishment account suggests that <b>rejections</b> occur out of altruism: people reject unfair offers to teach the first player a lesson and thereby reduce {{the likelihood that the}} player will make an unfair offer in the future. Thus, <b>rejections</b> are made to benefit the second player in the future, or other people in the future. By contrast, a self-control account suggests that <b>rejections</b> constitute a failure to inhibit a desire to punish the first player for making an unfair offer. Morewedge, Krishnamurti, and Ariely (2014) found that intoxicated participants were more likely to reject unfair offers than sober participants. As intoxication tends to exacerbate decision makers' prepotent response, this result provides support for the self-control than the altruistic punishment account. Other research from social cognitive neuroscience supports this finding.|$|E

However, {{the criteria for}} graft removal remain undefined; although some reports recommend removing all kidneys undergoing a third <b>rejection.</b> In our series (1968 - 1973) of 316 patients with technically successful first grafts followed 2 ½- 8 years, graft survival was inversely related {{to the number of}} <b>rejection</b> episodes. One hundred per cent of kidneys without <b>rejection</b> are currently functioning or functioned at the time of death compared to 90 % with one <b>rejection,</b> 67. 4 % with two and 21 % with three.

The formula was based on information available prior to treatment of the third <b>rejection</b> episode, and represents an index of baseline renal function (serum creatinine after second <b>rejection</b> episode) and two indices of the severity of <b>rejection</b> episodes (serum creatinine change {{between the first and second}} <b>rejection</b> episodes; rapidity of sequential <b>rejection).</b> Following its derivation, the formula was applied to a second group (1974) of 19 patients having had three <b>rejection</b> episodes.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the sensitivity of noninvasive surveillance (physical examination, echocardiography) of <b>rejection</b> in accurately predicting histologically documented <b>rejection</b> episodes. Additionally, the usefulness of routine scheduled biopsy and its safety in pediatric patients was explored. Background. Endomyocardial biopsy has been utilized as the standard for <b>rejection</b> surveillance after heart transplantation in adults, but its role in documenting clinically suspected <b>rejection</b> and in routine surveillance of pediatric patients has not been agreed upon. Methods. Heart transplantation was performed in 14 neonates and 21 children. The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisone. All patients underwent routine noninvasive <b>rejection</b> surveillance that included clinical examination and echocardiography. In the neonates, biopsy was performed quarterly beginning 6 months after transplantation, after cessation of prednisone therapy. In the children, biopsy was performed 15 times in the 1 st year. A minimum of five biopsy samples were interpreted using the Working Formulation for Heart Transplant <b>Rejection.</b> Results. In the neonates, 37 biopsies were performed. Evidence of <b>rejection</b> was present in only three biopsy samples obtained during eight episodes (38 %) of clinically suspected <b>rejection.</b> In 29 biopsies performed when <b>rejection</b> was not clinically suspected, each biopsy was free of cellular infiltrate. In the children, 291 biopsies were performed. Evidence of <b>rejection</b> was present in only seven biopsies (41 %) from 17 episodes of clinically suspected <b>rejection.</b> Cellular <b>rejection</b> was discovered during routine <b>rejection</b> surveillance biopsies in asymptomatic patients in 23 (8. 4 %) of 274 biopsies. Conclusions. In neonates with clinically suspected <b>rejection,</b> endomyocardial biopsy identified which patients did not require <b>rejection</b> therapy. Endomyocardial biopsy surveillance did not detect any unsuspected cases of <b>rejection.</b> In children, noninvasive <b>rejection</b> surveillance was less reliable even in asymptomatic patients, suggesting that periodic endomyocardial biopsy should be utilized...|$|R
