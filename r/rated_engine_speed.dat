For the same field operation, the tractor experiences diverse load demands and corresponding fuel use rates as it maneuvers through straight passes, turns, suspended operation for adjustments, repair and maintenance, and biomass or other material transfer operations. It is challenging to determine the actual fuel rate and load states of agricultural machinery using force prediction models, and hence, some form of in-field data acquisition capability is required. Controller Area Networks (CAN) available on the current model tractors provide engine performance data {{which can be used}} to determine tractor load states in field conditions. In this study, CAN message data containing fuel <b>rate,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and percent torque were logged from the tractor’s diagnostic port during anhydrous NH 3 application, field cultivation and planting operations.

Anhydrous NH 3 application and field cultivation were characterized by three distinct tractor load states (TS-I, TS-II and TS-III) corresponding to idle states, parallel and headland passes, and turns, whereas corn planting was characterized by two load states (TS-I and TS-II) : idle, and a combined state with parallel, headland passes and turns.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted with}} a single combustor from a J 47 turbojet engine using weathered aviation gasoline and several spark-plug modifications to determine altitude ignition, acceleration, and steady state operating characteristics. Satisfactory ignition was obtained with two modifications of the original opposite-polarity spark plug {{up to and including}} an altitude of 40, 003 feet at conditions simulating equilibrium windmilling of the engine at a flight speed of 400 miles per hour. At a simulated altitude of 30, 000 feet, satisfactory ignition was obtained over a range of simulated engine speeds. No significant effect of fuel temperature on ignition limits was observed over a range of fuel temperatures from 80 deg to - 52 deg F. At an altitude of 30, 000 feet, the excess temperature rise available for acceleration at low engine speeds was limited by the ability of the combustor to produce temperature rise, whereas at high engine speeds the maximum allowable turbine-inlet temperature became the restricting factor.

We first propose a novel yet simple unknown input observer {{based on the}} crankshaft rotation dynamics only. For this purpose, an invariant manifold is derived by defining auxiliary variables in terms of first order low-pass filters, where only one constant (filter coefficient) needs to be tuned.

The parameter estimation errors are derived to drive these adaptive laws and time-varying adaptive gains are introduced. The two proposed estimators only use the measured air mass flow <b>rate</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> and thus allow for improved computational efficiency.

This fuel {{can be made from}} agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops widely available in the Midwestern United States. The biofuels industry is already moving to meet these federal biofuels mandates and to establish sustainable biomass feedstock supply chains. Two companies have scheduled to build dedicated cellulosic ethanol refineries in Iowa. This initial phase of a biofuels supply chain is currently in its infancy and will require significant efficiency improvements and enhancement to current methods to ensure profitability. The resulting harvest costs, transportation costs and material quality all have significant impact on the cellulosic ethanol industry. The objective of the first chapter of this thesis was to determine the best method for semi-automated and large scale analysis of machinery management parameters. Electronic data logging of GPS position and CAN messages provides the timing and operational status needed for calculation of machinery management terms. Additional information like fuel <b>rate,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> hydraulic flow, or specific implement parameters can also be captured. This data enables detailed performance evaluation. GIS software was used to query the dataset. Appropriate spatial selections and parameter filters were defined for each performance parameter. This ensured measurement of productivity terms in conformance to ASABE Machinery Management Standards. The objective of the second chapter was to quantify and provide detailed information on the performance of corn stover collection equipment during industrial scale harvest operations. Current equipment developed for the hay and forage industry can be used to harvest corn stover. Understanding the performance characteristics of this repurposed forage equipment is critically important for the continued development of the cellulosic ethanol industry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this econometric {{analysis}} is to model the concentration of particle number emissions from a hybrid diesel-electric bus in terms of operating characteristics. Important aspects {{of this study are}} that particle number concentrations are modeled instead of particle mass, and the emissions are recorded using on-board instrumentation in real-world driving conditions. The operating characteristics included in the final models are two <b>engine</b> parameters: fuel <b>rate</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and two vehicle parameters: velocity and acceleration. The emissions data possess properties that frequently cause problems in regression analysis: nonstationarity, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation. Methods for overcoming and/or minimizing the effects of these properties are implemented. The Newey-West autocorrelation consistent covariance estimator is implemented using ordinary least squares (OLS) to produce a model that accounts for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, without requiring assumptions to be made about the structure of the model disturbances. A first-order autoregressive process is used with feasible generalized least squares as a comparative model. Both models have similar coefficients, fit and predictive capability. However the models are specific in scope to typical freeway driving conditions. In future studies, the researchers anticipate applying econometric analysis to model particle number emissions among different routes, bus technologies, aftertreatments, and atmospheric conditions.

40|$|Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is a widely-known {{technique}} {{applied in}} internal combustion engines for controlling the combustion process and harmful emissions. The recirculation of gases {{can be achieved}} either by delivering burnt gases from upstream of the turbine to downstream of the compressor (short-route) or by taking the exhaust gas downstream the turbine and deliver upstream the compressor (long-route). Although long-route (LR) system is preferred for highly boosted engines due to the higher EGR availability at low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> it lacks a fast response time during transient performance compared to the short-route (SR) system. This paper examines the potentials of introducing an alternative EGR route which can be applied in two-stage boosted engines.

The system provides high EGR <b>rates</b> at all <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> while the transport delay in the case of transient operation is relatively short. The potential of a hybrid EGR system combining MR and LR EGR is examined and various components’ (i. e. compressor, turbine and coolers) sizing and transient performance studies are performed to understand the trade-offs of the system.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an altitude test chamber at the NACA Lewis laboratory {{to determine the effect}} of a revision of the rated engine operating conditions and modifications to the afterburner fue 1 system, flameholder, and shell cooling on the augmented performance of the J 71 -A- 2 (x- 29) turbo jet engine operating at altitude. The afterburner modifications were made by the manufacturer to improve the endurance at sea-level, high-pressure conditions and to reduce the afterburner shell temperatures. The engine operating conditions of rated rotational speed and turbine-outlet gas temperature were increased. Data were obtained at conditions simulating flight at a Mach number of 0. 9 and at altitudes from 40, 000 to 60, 000 feet. The afterburner modifications caused a reduction in afterburner combustion efficiency. The increase in <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and turbine-outlet temperature coupled with the afterburner modifications resulted in the over-all thrust of the engine and afterburner being unchanged at a given afterburner equivalence ratio, while the specific fuel consumption was increased slightly. A moderate shift in the range of equivalence ratios over which the afterburner would operate was encountered, but the maximum operable altitude remained unaltered. The afterburner-shell temperatures were also slightly reduced because of the modifications to the afterburner...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and durabi l i ty of two means fo r measuring metal temper-atures of thin walls of air-cooled turbine blades i n a turbojet engfne, were fnvestlgated. One method employed thermocouples which were cemented i n small grooves, about 0. 008 inch deep by 0. 020 inch wide, i n {{the surface of}} the blades. The second method consisted of applying commercial temperature-indicating paints t o the blade surfaces. The majority of the investigations were conducted a t maximum rated engine conditions, a turbine-inlet gas temperature of about 16500 F and an engine speed of 11, 500 rpm. A t <b>rated</b> <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> the thermocouple junctions were sub-jected to a force equivalent t o about 42, 000 times gravity. The accuracy of the cemented thermocouples as compared t o reference thermocouple ins ta l la t ions tha t have been used in the past by the NACA t o obtain temperatures of blades with shells which were about 0. 040 inch o r. thicker was good; the agreement between the t w o types of thermocouples was about 2. 50 F with the msximum deviation being about & 15 O F over most of the speed range.
