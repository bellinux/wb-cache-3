5|$|After Hardy's client Adam Cole {{defeated}} Jay Briscoe {{to become}} the Undisputed <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Honor World Champion, Cole presented Jay Briscoe's custom made world championship belt (Briscoe claimed to still be the <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Honor champion as he forfeited the title due to injury and never officially lost it) to Hardy as a show of appreciation, Hardy re-branded the belt as the <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Honor Iconic (Innovative Creator and Originator of a New-Found Industry Champion) Championship, however, the title has not been sanctioned as an official championship by <b>Ring</b> <b>of</b> Honor. On June 22, 2014 at Best in the World, Hardy and Michael Bennett were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers in a no disqualification tag team match. In July, Hardy opted out of his ROH contract {{and went back to}} TNA.|$|E

5|$|As a whole, the <b>ring</b> system <b>of</b> Uranus {{is unlike}} either the faint dusty <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter or the broad and complex <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts <b>of</b> the latter <b>ring</b> system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus are similar to the outer G and E <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Uranus may be similar to the <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|R

The fascinating combinatorics emerges, showing that our <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> invariants are the <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> some toric varieties.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} PCF {{characteristics}} such as chromatic dispersion, effective area, confinement loss and nonlinearity for circular PCF having 5 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes and 4 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes. Proposed structures are simulated by using Comsol multiphysics. Method used for simulation is finite element method (FEM). For both the cases of circular structures air filling fraction i. e. d/Λ= 0. 5. From the numerically simulated results it’s shown that circular PCF with 5 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes provides large negative dispersion, which is {{of the value of}} - 150 ps/(km. nm), hence such PCF have high potential {{to be used as a}} dispersion compensating fiber in optical communication systems. Circular PCF with 5 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes offers low confinement loss of the order of 10 - 10 dB/m. Circular PCF with 5 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes offers low effective area. In the case of nonlinearity circular PCF with 5 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes has a value of 38. 38 W- 1 km- 1 and that for circular PCF with 4 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes has 14. 47 W- 1 km- 1 at 1550 nm. From the above optical properties for both the structures, it is seen that structure with 5 <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> air holes is suitable for majority of application such as dispersion compensation fiber and supercontinuum generation. Nonlinearity can be increased by increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>rings.</b> By increasing nonlinearity value it became suitable for supercontinuum generation...|$|R
