40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{defining}} the concept of market access for agricultural products, this paper analyzes the necessity of establishing market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products, proposes the conception of establishing market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products in China; sets up the frame of market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products; analyzes the rationality of the frame of market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products; poses the consideration of economic law regarding setup of market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products. This paper also puts forward the legislative suggestions for establishing market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products as follows: establish the frame of market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products taking quality access as core; establish and perfect the compensation and relief system of guaranteeing benefit of manager and producers; establish the market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products with hierarchical structure; sort out existing laws and form the sound the legal frame of market <b>access</b> <b>system</b> of agricultural products.

40|$|The {{sequence}} of documents a user accesses while using an Information <b>Access</b> <b>System</b> will heavily influence the user’s {{experience of the}} system. In this position paper, I discuss {{the idea of using}} these sequences to evaluate one facet of the overall user experience. Such sequences can be considered a generalization of rankings used to evaluate Information Retrieval System, but can be generated by any Information <b>Access</b> <b>System.</b> While this view provides greater flexibility for evaluating and comparing different Information <b>Access</b> <b>Systems,</b> it also raises many other issues regarding their ap-plication for evaluation. This paper provides an overview of some of these issues along with possible directions for us-ing sequences of documents to evaluate Information <b>Access</b> <b>Systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|As large mobile {{networks}} have become commonplace, {{the allocation of}} resources has become critical. The most important and restricted resource is the system bandwidth {{for this kind of}} networks. In order to use the system bandwidth efficiently, multiple <b>access</b> <b>systems</b> are used. For multiple <b>access</b> <b>systems,</b> MAC (medium <b>access</b> control) protocols have primary effect in the throughput and delay performance of the system. Among MAC protocols, the ALOHA scheme has enjoyed the advantage of simplicity, however, the throughput of ALOHA decreases under heavy traffic conditions. Alternative random <b>access</b> <b>systems</b> have been proposed based on code division multiple <b>access</b> (CDMA) <b>systems</b> to improve the throughput [1, 2]. Random <b>access</b> CDMA <b>systems</b> have been shown to efficiently allocate scarce radio communication channels (bandwidth) {{in such a way that}} users with bursty traffic can share the sam...|$|R
