5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E

5|$|About 8% of {{lung cancer}} is due to {{inherited}} factors. In <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> people with lung cancer, the risk is doubled. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk {{of lung cancer}}.|$|E
5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> the Driscolls {{attempted}} {{to strike back}} at the Regulators.

With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E

5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives. In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from <b>relatives</b> <b>of</b> those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
