40|$|Chronology is a {{necessary}} component of paleoclimatology. Radiocarbon dating plays {{a central role in}} determining the ages of geological samples younger than ca. 50 ka BP. However, there are many limitations for its application, including radiocarbon reservoir effects, which may cause incorrect chronology in many lakes. Here we demonstrate temporal changes in the <b>radiocarbon</b> reservoir <b>age</b> of Lake Xingyun, Southwestern China, where <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>ages</b> based on bulk organic matter have been reported in previous studies.

500|$|A {{calibration}} curve {{is used by}} taking the radiocarbon date reported by a laboratory, and reading across from that date on the vertical axis of the graph. The point where this horizontal line intersects the curve will give the calendar age of the sample on the horizontal axis. This is the reverse {{of the way the}} curve is constructed: a point on the graph is derived from a sample of known age, such as a tree ring; when it is tested, the resulting <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>age</b> gives a data point for the graph.Over the next thirty years many {{calibration curve}}s were published using a variety of methods and statistical approaches. These were superseded by the INTCAL series of curves, beginning with INTCAL98, published in 1998, and updated in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The improvements to these curves are based on new data gathered from tree rings, varves, coral, plant macrofossils, speleothems, and foraminifera. [...] The INTCAL13 data includes separate curves for the northern and southern hemispheres, as they differ systematically because of the hemisphere effect; there is also a separate marine calibration curve. For a set of samples with a known sequence and separation in time such as a sequence of tree rings, the samples' radiocarbon ages form a small subset of the calibration curve. The resulting curve can then be matched to the actual calibration curve by identifying where, in the range suggested by the radiocarbon dates, the wiggles in the calibration curve best match the wiggles in the curve of sample dates. This [...] "wiggle-matching" [...] technique can lead to more precise dating than is possible with individual radiocarbon dates. [...] Wiggle-matching can be used in places where there is a plateau on the calibration curve, and hence can provide a much more accurate date than the intercept or probability methods are able to produce. [...] The technique is not restricted to tree rings; for example, a stratified tephra sequence in New Zealand, known to predate human colonization of the islands, has been dated to 1314AD ± 12 years by wiggle-matching. The wiggles also mean that reading a date from a calibration curve can give more than one answer: this occurs when the curve wiggles up and down enough that the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>age</b> intercepts the curve in more than one place, which may lead to a radiocarbon result being reported as two separate age ranges, corresponding to the two parts of the curve that the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>age</b> intercepted.|$|E

500|$|If {{the carbon}} in {{freshwater}} is partly acquired from aged carbon, such as rocks, then {{the result will}} be a reduction in the / ratio in the water. For example, rivers that pass over limestone, which is mostly composed of calcium carbonate, will acquire carbonate ions. Similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed. These rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable , so this carbon lowers the / ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it. This is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results. [...] The effect varies greatly and there is no general offset that can be applied; additional research is usually needed to determine the size of the offset, for example by comparing the <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>age</b> of deposited freshwater shells with associated organic material.|$|E
500|$|To {{produce a}} curve {{that can be}} used to relate {{calendar}} years to radiocarbon years, a sequence of securely dated samples is needed which can be tested to determine their <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>age.</b> The study of tree rings led to the first such sequence: individual pieces of wood show characteristic sequences of rings that vary in thickness because of environmental factors such as the amount of rainfall in a given year. These factors affect all trees in an area, so examining tree-ring sequences from old wood allows the identification of overlapping sequences. In this way, an uninterrupted sequence of tree rings can be extended far into the past. The first such published sequence, based on bristlecone pine tree rings, was created by Wesley Ferguson. Hans Suess used this data to publish the first calibration curve for radiocarbon dating in 1967. The curve showed two types of variation from the straight line: a long term fluctuation with a period of about 9,000 years, and a shorter term variation, often referred to as [...] "wiggles", with a period of decades. Suess said he drew the line showing the wiggles by [...] "cosmic schwung", by which he meant that the variations were caused by extraterrestrial forces. It was unclear for some time whether the wiggles were real or not, but they are now well-established. [...] These short term fluctuations in the calibration curve are now known as de Vries effects, after Hessel de Vries.|$|E
500|$|As a tree grows, {{only the}} {{outermost}} tree ring exchanges carbon with its environment, so the age measured for a wood sample {{depends on where}} the sample is taken from. [...] This means that radiocarbon dates on wood samples can be older than the date at which the tree was felled. [...] In addition, if {{a piece of wood}} is used for multiple purposes, there may be a significant delay between the felling of the tree and the final use in the context in which it is found. [...] This {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "old wood" [...] problem. [...] One example is the Bronze Age trackway at Withy Bed Copse, in England; the trackway was built from wood that had clearly been worked for other purposes before being re-used in the trackway. [...] Another example is driftwood, which may be used as construction material. [...] It is not always possible to recognize re-use. [...] Other materials can present the same problem: for example, bitumen is known to have been used by some Neolithic communities to waterproof baskets; the bitumen's <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>age</b> will be greater than is measurable by the laboratory, regardless of the actual age of the context, so testing the basket material will give a misleading age if care is not taken. [...] A separate issue, related to re-use, is that of lengthy use, or delayed deposition.

Traditional terrestrial stratigraphies are typically reliant on radiocarbon dating, although estimates of antiquity for samples older than 40 [*]ka may be unreliable.

The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator.

Here we present new 23 accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>ages</b> on peat and bivalve molluscs, supported by the first amino acid racemization (AAR) dating of bivalve molluscs (n ¼ 66) in the Black Sea. These data indicate infilling of the Black Sea during the early Holocene from an initial depth 107 m below sea-level, and 72 m below that of the Bosphorus Sill. These data combined with a review of previous <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>ages</b> has enabled a unique perspective on the post-glacial Black Sea. A sea-level curve based on conventional and AMS <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>ages</b> on peat and AMS-based ages on Dreissena sp. shells indicate the water-level in the earlier lake phase continued, until the early Holocene, to be lower than the Bosphorus Sill after the Younger Dryas ended. However, the absence of AMS-dated mollusc ages from the shelves of this basin older than the Younger Dryas is suggestive of sub-aerial exposure of the shelves, and comparatively lower water-levels when the Younger Dryas began. Thus post-glacial outflow from the Black Sea occurred through a lowered or open Bosphorus seaway. Basinwide <b>radiocarbon</b> <b>ages</b> on peat indicate a prompt increase in water-level from that of the pre-existing and unconnected palaeo-lake during the earliest Holocene (9600 e 9200 cal a BP).
