Negotiations on prices are more about the relative strength of the negotiation parties rather than a discussion about actual costs. Adding extensive changes in the forest haulers cost structure has led to insufficient knowledge of whether the negotiated prices really correspond to their costs. Methodology: We decided {{to carry out a}} case study at Träfrakt Götaland AB, a special interest organisation whose members represent the majority of forest haulers in Götaland. Purpose: To describe the processes and underlying activities of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> <b>transports.</b> This study may serve as the basis {{in the development of a}} new costing model. Conclusions: The resulting model focuses on the significant activities while insignificant activities are ignored. In our conclusion we make recommendations of which steps to take to further develop the costing model...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} types {{of work in the}} warehouses of raw timber companies is a sort of <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> <b>Transport</b> and sorting of logs in the enterprises of the Republic of Belarus is carried out mainly by longitudinal sorting conveyors. Main indicators of the technical characteristics of these transporters do not meet the requirements of the Belarusian forestry enterprises in a number of parameters. Replacement of obsolete design and procurement of new equipment associated with considerable capital investment. An analysis of existing structures proposed scheme is an automated line to sort of <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> A new scheme of arrangement will significantly reduce the length of the conveyor and the speed reduction will apply traction body drive lower power and lower the metal structure...|$|R
30|$|The {{bending test}} results showed no {{significance}} at the 5  % significance level on average regarding the Young’s modulus {{obtained by the}} longitudinal vibration method, and the apparent Young’s modulus for green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> Meanwhile, the average bending strength showed significant differences at the 5  % significance level between green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> When considering that the average for green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> would actually increase because the green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> included those that did not show failure, {{it was difficult to}} simply conclude that there were differences between green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of bending strength was slightly higher for air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> than green <b>round</b> <b>timbers,</b> although we should also consider the fact that the bending strength of green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> would actually increase.|$|R
30|$|As for the {{compressive}} test {{parallel to}} the grain results, there was no significance seen in the average Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method for air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and green <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> Significance was seen in average compressive strength {{parallel to the}} grain at the 5  % significance level for air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> and green <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b> The 5  % PTL of compressive strength parallel to the grain was higher in air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> than green <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> In terms of average, the strength ratios of dry/green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> were larger in compressive strength parallel to the grain than in bending strength, {{as well as the}} other timbers [5, 6] and small clear specimens [7].|$|R
30|$|<b>Round</b> <b>timbers</b> with 140 and 160  mm {{diameter}} were bored at {{the center}} of the cross section from one end to the other. The flexural performance of center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was expected not to show large differences from the <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> with corresponding outer diameter. However, it showed much lower load-carrying capacity than <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> The center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> failed by flattening mode. Because this failure was caused by compressive stress perpendicular to the timber length, it was concluded that the design of center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> guardrail beam requires additional design calculation on the flattening failure.|$|R
30|$|The {{air-dried}} <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> were air-dried outdoors for 8 – 9  months. After being air-dried, the air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> {{were subjected}} to the test using the same method as for the green <b>round</b> <b>timbers.</b>|$|R
30|$|Unlike initial expectation, the center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> {{resisted}} {{much lower}} load under the center-point flexural test. This low {{load carrying capacity}} could be explained flattening failure mode of center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> distinguishing the solid <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> failure. This flattening failure is not caused by bending moment; therefore, {{the results of this}} study do not indicate that the flexural performance of center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> is much lower than solid timber. Actually, this failure was caused by compressive stress perpendicular to the grain, not by bending moment. The center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> needs to be designed with consideration of the flattening failure mode and the inner hole size needs to be optimized to use this center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> as a structural beam. As a guardrail member, the center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> beam will be loaded by a single-point force which will be induced by vehicle impact. Therefore, the flattening failure would be more important factor in guardrail beam design.|$|R
40|$|<b>Round</b> <b>timber</b> {{has great}} use in civil construction, {{performing}} {{the function of}} beams, columns, foundations, poles for power distribution among others, with the advantage of not being processed, such as lumber. The structural design of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> requires determining the elastic properties, mainly the modulus of elasticity. The Brazilian standards responsible for the stiffness and strength determination of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> are in effect for over twenty years with no technical review. <b>Round</b> <b>timber,</b> for generally present an axis with non-zero curvature according {{to the position of}} the element in the bending test, may exhibit different values of modulus of elasticity. This study aims to analyze the position effect of Eucalyptus grandis <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> on the flexural modulus of elasticity. The three-point bending test was evaluated in two different positions based on the longitudinal rotation of the <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> element. The results revealed that at least two different positions of the <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> element are desired to obtain significant modulus of elasticity...|$|R
30|$|Eighty green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> (each {{measuring}} 16 – 20  cm {{in diameter}} {{at the top}} end, and about 5  m in length) were procured. The dynamic Young’s modulus for all green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> was obtained by using the longitudinal vibration method. The density of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was calculated according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard for logs [2]. The average Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method was 8.20 kN/mm 2, with minimum and maximum values of 5.88 and 9.71 kN/mm 2, respectively. Green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> {{were divided into two}} groups of 40 specimens by the Young’s modulus obtained by the longitudinal vibration method for that average, with largely uniform standard deviation. One group was tested as green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> and the other group as air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|R
30|$|Static bending {{tests and}} {{compressive}} test {{parallel to the}} grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry. The strength of green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> were compared for bending and compression parallel to the grain. The strength change ratio {{in response to a}} 1  % change in the moisture content of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was compared with that of small clear specimens and timber. The results revealed that a 5  % parametric tolerance limit of bending and compressive strength parallel to the grain satisfied the referenced strength, even when using green <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> The average strength of air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was higher than that of green <b>round</b> <b>timber,</b> in both bending and compression parallel to the grain, with significant differences indicated at a 5  % significance level. The relation between the cross-section area that includes <b>round</b> <b>timber,</b> timber and the small clear specimens, and the strength change ratio in response to a 1  % change in moisture content change was fitted to a logarithm curve. Thus, the size of the specimen was considered to affect the strength change ratio.|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{knots and}} {{slope of grain}} are {{regarded}} {{as the most important}} strength-reducing defects in dimension lumber. However, Green et al. [15] reported that strength of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> is not sensitive to such strength-reducing defects. In this study, the knots and slope of grain were also measured to investigate the effect of them on strength but its effect was not significant. Instead, the test results of this study indicated that the specific gravity of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> and the ratio of juvenile wood are important properties to affect <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> strength. In case of small <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> like R 100, R 120, and R 140, the ratio of juvenile wood is almost 100  %. Their flexural performance was much lower than R 160 and R 180 <b>round</b> <b>timber,</b> because R 160 and R 180 has mature wood in circumferences. In other viewpoint, this means that the inner part of R 160 and R 180 <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> has relatively low-strength property. Besides, when considering stress distribution in bending, the center part of beam less contributes to the flexural performance of <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{expand the}} use of wood that {{includes}} thinned <b>round</b> <b>timber,</b> wood should be used not only for construction products but also for civil engineering products. One use of wood products for civil engineering would be for underground bearing piles. Wooden bearing piles would {{be used in the}} form of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> without lumbering. When <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> is used underground, it must always be under a green condition. The strength of a small clear specimen and that of timber are known to decrease in line with higher moisture content [1]. The strength data of green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was very poor, however, when compared with that of a small clear specimen and timber. In this study, static bending tests and compressive tests parallel to the grain of sugi (Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica) green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> were conducted to confirm whether its strength would satisfy the referenced strength determined by the Construction Ministry. The strength of green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> and air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> were also compared for bending and compression parallel to the grain. The strength change ratio in response to a 1  % change in the moisture content of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was compared with that of small clear specimens and timber.|$|R
30|$|Although {{products}} {{with a round}} shape give benefits of better production yield, they were rarely used structurally because of little information available to {{provide a basis for}} the <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> structural element in applications efficiently. Also, <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> does not dry as quickly as sawn lumber and high temperatures used to accelerate drying could cause structural problems as well as physical degrade. The presence of surface checks on <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> may reduce structural performance, such as holding power of fasteners. Also, it can decrease their appearance quality. It is because drying <b>round</b> cross-section <b>timber</b> is difficult to obtain uniform moisture profile and surface quality [14, 15]. Besides, the preservative treatment of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> is not easy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTimber constructions made of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly popular nowadays. They concern both non-pedestrian and pedestrian bridges, watchtowers and playground equipment. If these constructions are designed with a truss supporting system, the element joints are often made of bolts with slotted-in steel plates. Joints in <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> do not have sufficient support in existing Eurocodes. The problem {{is also in the}} characterization of cyclically loaded <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> joints (fatigue loading in wood). The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the results of static and dynamic tensile tests of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> bolted joints with slotted – in steel plates along the grains. Some of these <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> joints samples were reinforced in the timber part (near the bolt) with different components (screws, special washers, steel bands, performed steel plates and nails). The main reason of the reinforcing of the joints was to increase the carrying capacity and safety of these joints in tension. Based on the results of static and dynamic <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> bolted joints tests, reinforcement of the bolted joints significantly increased joint carrying capacity and reliability...|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} outer diameter on flexural performance, center-point bending tests were performed on the <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> without center-hole. The flexural performance tends to increase {{with the increase of}} diameter. This could be explained by the ratio of juvenile wood. In case of smaller <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> (R 100, R 120 and R 140), juvenile wood occupies most of all cross section. However, larger <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> (R 160 and R 180) has some mature wood in circumference. This tendency indicates that the inner part around the pith has lower strength than the part in circumstance. When considering the stress distribution under bending moment, the inner part of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> seems to less contribute the flexural performance.|$|R
30|$|In this study, 6 {{red pine}} <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> without any {{biological}} deterioration were prepared. The {{diameter of the}} <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> {{was the same as}} each other as 96  mm and length was approximately 1, 300  mm. Moisture content was approximately 12  % (8 – 14  %).|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{the timber}} constructions built from <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> {{components}} become increasingly popular. In the current European {{standards for the}} design of timber structures, the issue of joint type timber-to-timber is solved only for squared timber. Thus, determination of carrying capacity of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> bolted joints does not have sufficient support in current standards. One of the key issues of the effective use of timber as a construction material is a guarantee of material technical parameters. Before <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> material is used in a construction, its technical properties have to be verified. This paper presents the results of static tests in tension at an angle of 90 °, 60 ° and 0 ° to the grain of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> bolted joints with reinforcement. The main purpose of sample reinforcing is to delay the occurrence of a failure...|$|R
30|$|For {{the static}} bending test, a {{universal}} testing machine of 200 -kN capacity (made by Tokyokoki Seizosho Ltd.) {{was used for the}} 100 -kN range. Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The total span deflection of green <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> was measured using the CDP- 100 displacement gauge with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted duration of testing was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the total span deflection, and calculated at the middle circumference of the <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s ram cylinder. For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s ram cylinder was considered the maximum load. For the air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber,</b> the total span deflection was measured using the rolled-in type DP- 500 E displacement gauge with 50 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection of air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timber.</b> All air-dried <b>round</b> <b>timbers</b> failed within the extension limit of the ram cylinder.|$|R

Round shape is advantageous to efficient use of small-diameter logs, there is a difficulty of drying and preservative treatment. It is necessary to apply a new technique. In this study, center-boring technology was applied to improve the efficiency of manufacturing. The effect of a hole was not expected to make a significant effect on the flexural performance because the hole is located at the centroid of beam under bending moment. Unlike a <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> beam, the failure of center-bored <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> beam starts with a crack and is followed by a longitudinal split.

40|$|Abstract- In many {{countries}} logging {{is a very}} important sector of economy, a factor, which led to an extensive industrialization in the field of wood processing within the last three decades. In particular electronic measurement systems are used to optimise the commercial utilization of the resource “timber ” and also for data acquisition in trade and commerce. Modern measuring assemblies for <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> enable not only to acquire the volume of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> but also to record – self-acting- taper, sweep and ovality. More and more efforts are undertaken to use data- primarily attained for internal purposes only and for pricing, respectively. Therefore, the measurement methods presently used should be analyzed and several criteria for measurement of <b>round</b> <b>timber</b> in the future should be discussed and- last but not least- basic requirements on measurement systems as far as the valuation of features of wood is concerned should be identified...|$|R

Using microwave drying, the timbers were dried within one day, but the other two drying methods required a much longer time. During most of the microwave drying process, the wood temperature appeared to be higher in the inner layer than in the outer layer. As a result, the inner layer moisture contents were significantly reduced by microwave drying, while kiln drying produced almost no decline in the inner layer moisture contents. In addition, although significant surface checks often occurred in timbers dried by kiln drying and air drying, microwave drying caused few surface checks. In contrast, internal checks were only observed in timbers treated by microwave drying.
