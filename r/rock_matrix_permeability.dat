40|$|The {{geological}} repository for final storage of spent nuclear fuel, {{envisioned by the}} Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Management Company (SKB), relies on several barriers: copper canisters deposited in holes in the floor of underground tunnels in deep bedrock, embedded in a buffer of compacted bentonite. The initially unsaturated buffer would take up water from the surrounding rock mass and swell to seal any potential gap. This initial two-phase (gas and liquid) regime with two components (air and water) may impact the final density, swelling pressure and biogeochemical conditions in the buffer. A main objective of this work is to identify factors and mechanisms that govern deposition hole inflow and bentonite wetting under the prevailing two-phase flow conditions in sparsely fractured bedrock. For this purpose, we use the numerical code TOUGH 2 to perform two-phase flow simulations, conditioned by a companion field experiment (the Bentonite Rock Interaction Experiment or BRIE) performed in a 417 m deep tunnel of the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory in southeastern Sweden. The models predict a significant de-saturation of the rock wall, which was confirmed by field data. To predict the early buffer wetting rates and patterns, the position of local flowing fractures and estimates of local <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> appear {{more important than the}} total open hole groundwater inflow. A global sensitivity analysis showed that the buffer wetting time and the persistence of unsaturated conditions over extended periods of time in the rock depend primarily on the local fracture positions, <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability,</b> ventilation conditions in the tunnel and pressure far in the rock. Dismantling photographs from BRIE were used to reconstruct a fine-scale snapshot of saturation at the bentonite/rock interface, showing tremendous spatial variability. The high level of heterogeneity in the rock generates complex two-phase flow phenomena (air trapping, dissolution), which need to be accounted for in buffer design and rock suitability criteria. In particular, results suggest that uncertainties regarding two-phase flow behavior are relatively high close to residual air saturation, which may also have important implications for other applications involving two-phase flows, such as geological storage of carbon dioxide.

30|$|Source-rock matrix {{permeability}} {{is a key}} parameter {{to determine}} gas production rates from source-rock reservoirs (Ozkan et al. 2011). Because gas flow in these reservoirs is associated with slip flow, Knudsen diffusion and other mechanisms, the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability,</b> unlike that for conventional rock types, are not an intrinsic rock property, but depend on gas pressure and temperature (Civan 2010; Darabi et al. 2012). Thus, laboratory permeability measurements should not be directly used for reservoir modeling studies without correction when reservoir conditions (including pressure and temperature) are considerably different from the test conditions under which laboratory measurements are made. To correct the laboratory permeability measurements, we need to know, for a given rock sample, the relationship between measured permeability and pore pressure that determines {{the relative importance of}} the combination of slip flow and Knudsen diffusion. Note that in this paper, we only discuss cases in which pore pressure may change, but effective stress imposed on a core sample remains unchanged. Thus, mechanical deformation processes do not come into play in the discussion in this paper.|$|E

While contributing to enhancing the reservoir's permeability, hydraulic stimulation processes {{may lead to}} undesired seismic activity. Here, we present a three dimensional numerical model aiming to increase understanding of this mechanism and its consequences. The fractured reservoir is modeled as a network of explicitly represented large scale fractures immersed in a permeable <b>rock</b> <b>matrix.</b> The numerical formulation is constructed by coupling three physical processes: fluid flow, fracture deformation, and <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> deformation. For flow simulations, the discrete fracture matrix model is used, which allows the fluid transport from high permeable conductive fractures to the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> and vice versa. The mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using a hyperbolic model with reversible and irreversible deformations. Linear elasticity is assumed for the mechanical deformation and stress alteration of the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix.</b> Fractures are modeled as lower dimensional surfaces embodied in the domain, subjected to specific governing equations for their deformation along the tangential and normal directions. Both the fluid flow and momentum balance equations are approximated by finite volume discretizations.

40|$|Fractional {{calculus}} provides efficient {{physical models}} to quantify non-Fickian dynamics broadly observed within the Earth system. The potential advantages of using fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) for real-world problems are often {{limited by the}} current {{lack of understanding of}} how earth system properties influence observed non-Fickian dynamics. This study explores non-Fickian dynamics for pollutant transport in field-scale discrete fracture networks (DFNs), by investigating how fracture and rock matrix properties influence the leading and tailing edges of pollutant breakthrough curves (BTCs). Fractured reservoirs exhibit erratic internal structures and multi-scale heterogeneity, resulting in complex non-Fickian dynamics. A Monte Carlo approach is used to simulate pollutant transport through DFNs with a systematic variation of system properties, and the resultant non-Fickian transport is upscaled using a tempered-stable fractional in time advection–dispersion equation. Numerical results serve as a basis for determining both qualitative and quantitative relationships between BTC characteristics and model parameters, in addition to the impacts of fracture density, orientation, and <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> on non-Fickian dynamics. The observed impacts of medium heterogeneity on tracer transport at late times tend to enhance the applicability of fPDEs that may be parameterized using measurable fracture–matrix characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The karstogenesis of a {{synthetic}} aquifer is analyzed {{as a function}} of the matrix permeability and the fracture density affecting the carbonate reservoir. The synthetic carbonate aquifer generation results from numerical simulations based on Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) and groundwater flow simulations. The aim is to simulate karstogenesis processes in an aquifer characterized by a fracture network, while matching field reality and respecting geometrical properties as closely as possible. DFN are simulated with the soft REZO 3 D that allows the generation of 3 -D realistic fracture networks, especially regarding the relative position of fractures that control the overall network connectivity. These generated DFN are then meshed and considered to perform groundwater flow simulation with the model GroundWater (GW). At each time step and for each fracture element, flow velocity and the mean groundwater age are extracted and used in an analogical dissolution equation that computes the aperture evolution. This equation relies on empirical parameters calibrated with former speleogenesis studies. In this paper, karstogenesis simulations are performed using fixed-head hydraulic boundary conditions within a single stratum {{as a function of}} two fracture density settings. The results are interpreted in terms of head fields, mean groundwater age distributions; while total flow rate and average aperture are analyzed as a function of time.

30|$|The {{basement}} rocks—granites and metagranites—have low connected porosity (<[*] 0.05) and permeability (<[*] 10 − 19 to 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 18  m 2; Fig.  8 b). Despite this, the granitic {{samples are}} more than two orders of magnitude more permeable than the metagranites (Table  3). The granite microstructure shows evidence of pervasive plagioclase dissolution. Evidence of plagioclase dissolution (Figs.  4 d and 5 d) far from fractures is rife in the Upper Rhine Graben and the impregnation of these features with organic material speaks to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids outside of fracture zones (Ledesert et al. 2010; Sardini et al. 1997). These alteration processes can {{have a profound effect}} on <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability.</b> For example, fresh, intact granite from the EPS- 1 borehole at the geothermal site near Soultz-sous-Forêts (France) has low porosity and permeability that does not vary by more than an order of magnitude (Géraud et al. 2010; Rummel 1992) (Fig.  8 b). By contrast, granites characterised as altered (e.g. containing hematite, illite–hematite, or chlorite–hematite alteration) vary significantly in porosity (from 0.00 to 0.10) and permeability (over five orders of magnitude) (Géraud et al. 2010); these values are more comparable to the sedimentary sequences in this study. In some cases, where samples contain a pre-existing structural feature that may act as a conduit for flow (e.g. in-filled fracture; e.g. Figs.  4 d and 5 d), the permeability of the rock is significantly increased with respect to other samples from the same block. Indeed, the presence of fractures—even partially in-filled fractures—can significantly increase the permeability of a given lithology without an accompanying significant increase in connected porosity (Kushnir et al. 2018; Hofmann et al. 2016; Nara et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2016; Pérez-Flores et al. 2017; Heap and Kennedy 2016; Lamur et al. 2017).|$|E

In the specific case of the Soultz-Sous-Forêts geothermal reservoir, a new statistical analysis of the fault and fracture networks is proposed to precise the actual 3 D structural model of the reservoir (Sausse et al., 2009; Dezayes et al., 2009). The statistical characterization of the fractures and faults is realized with the re-interpretation of the whole U. B.

40|$|Packer {{tests in}} {{boreholes}} in fractured rock involving injection or withdrawal {{of water in}} borehole segments have been standard practice in bedrock hydraulic investigations pertaining to geotechnical and water resource projects since the 1950 ’s. However in contaminant hydrogeology, the tests are conducted to assess groundwater velocity and contaminant fluxes and therefore, much improved resolution and measurement accuracy is needed. For this thesis study packer testing equipment was designed specifically for studies of contaminant behavior in fractured rock {{with the ability to}} conduct four types of hydraulic tests: constant head/flow injection step tests, slug tests, pumping tests and recovery tests, all in the same borehole test interval without removing the equipment from the hole while acquiring high precision data for calculation of transmissivity (T) and fracture hydraulic apertures (2 b). This equipment records pressure above, within, and below the test interval to gain insights regarding open borehole flow patterns, and to identify short circuiting to the open borehole above or below the test interval. The equipment measures flow rates as low as 6 ml/min up to 20 L/min, and the temperature in the test interval and at the ground surface is measured to account for density and viscosity variations. Each type of test is conducted repeatedly over a wide range of imposed applied pressures and flow rates and the equipment was applied to assess performance of this new methodology for packer testing and gain new insights concerning fractured rock hydrology in 6 boreholes in the fractured dolostone aquifer underlying the City of Guelph, Ontario. In the first stage of the equipment application in the fractured dolostone aquifer, over 150 high precision straddle packer tests using constant rate injection (Q) were conducted to identify the conditions of change from Darcian (linear) to non-Darcian (non-linear) flow based on the Q vs dP relationship where dP is the applied pressure above ambient. In the Darcian regime, the linear Q vs dP relationship passes through the origin (0, 0) where the ambient pressure represents static conditions (i. e. Q= 0 and dP= 0). After the onset of non-Darcian flow, proportionally less Q per unit dP occurs so that the interval transmissivity (T) calculated from the test results using Darcy’s Law based models is underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude. The Darcy-Missbach equation was found to be a robust conceptual model for representation of step constant Q tests in which the linear proportionality constant relates Qn vs dP. It was found that quantifying non-linear flow allows for a more accurate determination of the linear data to obtain better estimates of T and hence the hydraulic apertures derived from the T using the Cubic Law. In order to obtain hydraulic apertures from the packer test T values, the number of hydraulically active fractures in the test interval is needed. The only data collected regarding individual fractures was the core log created during the coring process and the acoustic televiewer log, both of which identify the location of fractures, but neither could tell if the fractures identified were hydraulically active. A sensitivity analysis concerning the effects of non-linear flow and the number of hydraulically active fractures on the calculated hydraulic aperture shows that the number of fractures selected as hydraulically active has the greatest effect on the aperture values. A new approach is proposed for determining apertures from hydraulic tests in fractured rock utilizing the onset of non-linear flow to aid in the choice of the number of active fractures present in the test interval. In the second stage of the equipment application, the four types of hydraulic tests (constant head, pumping, recovery, and rising/falling head slug tests) conducted in the same test interval at gradually increasing flow rates showed that non-linear flow can be most easily identified and quantified using constant head tests providing a higher degree of certainty that the data used to calculate T are from the Darcian flow regime. Slug tests are conducted most rapidly, but formation non-linear behavior is commonly exaggerated by non-linearity within the test equipment at large initial displacements. However, the equipment non-linearity can be accounted for using a Reynolds number (Re) analysis allowing identification of the non-linear flow in the formation. In addition, non-linear flow can interfere with evidence of fracture dilation. The pumping and recovery tests are the most time consuming because of the relatively long time required to reach steady state. However, these tests offer the most potential to give insight into the influences of the peripheral fracture network and <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> on test results In addition to the actual transmissivity of the test interval T values obtained from packer tests can be influenced by several factors including non-linear flow in the formation and in the test equipment, aperture dilation or closure, hydraulic short circuiting or leakage from the test interval to the open borehole and dual permeability properties of the system (fractures and matrix). The equipment and procedures developed in this thesis provide an improved framework for identifying these influences and in some cases avoiding them so that the aperture values calculated from T measurements are more accurate than those obtained through conventional approaches. In the conventional procedures for packer testing in fractured rock as recommended in manuals and guidance documents, the applied head and flow rate can be expected, {{based on the results of}} this thesis, to produce transmissivity values biased low because of non-linear (non-Darcian) flow...|$|E

40|$|The single-well {{injection}} withdrawal (SWIW) test, a {{tracer test}} utilizing only one well, is proposed {{as a useful}} contribution to site characterization of fractured rock, {{as well as providing}} parameters relevant to tracer diffusion and sorption. The usual conceptual model of flow and solute transport through fractured <b>rock</b> with low <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> involves solute advection and dispersion through a fracture network coupled with diffusion and sorption into the surrounding <b>rock</b> <b>matrix.</b> Unlike two-well tracer tests, results of SWIW tests are ideally independent of advective heterogeneity, channeling and flow dimension, and, instead, focus on diffusive and sorptive characteristics of tracer (solute) transport. Thus, they can be used specifically to study such characteristics and evaluate the diffusive parameters associated with tracer transport through fractured media. We conduct simulations of SWIW tests on simple and complex fracture models, the latter being defined as having two subfractures with altered rock blocks in between and gouge material in their apertures. Using parameters from the Aspo site in Sweden, we calculate and study SWIW tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs) from a test involving four days of injection and then withdrawal. By examining the peak concentration C{sub pk} of the SWIW BTCs for a variety of parameters, we confirm that C{sub pk} is largely insensitive to the fracture advective flow properties, in particular to permeability heterogeneity over the fracture plane or to subdividing the flow into two subfractures in the third dimension orthogonal to the fracture plane. The peak arrival time t{sub pk} is not a function of fracture or rock properties, but is controlled by the time schedule of the SWIW test. The study shows that the SWIW test is useful for the study of tracer diffusion-sorption processes, including the effect of the so-called flow-wetted surface (FWS) of the fracture. Calculations with schematic models with different FWS values are conducted and the possibility of direct in situ measurement of FWS with SWIW tests is demonstrated...|$|R

In naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs, gas is mainly stored in the <b>rock</b> <b>matrix</b> with very low permeability, and the natural fractures have the main contribution on total gas production. Therefore, identifying natural fractures characteristics in the tight formations is essential for well productivity evaluations. Well testing and logging are the common tools employed to evaluate well productivity. Use of image log can provide fracture static parameters, and welltest analysis can provide data related to reservoir dynamic parameters. However, due to the low <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> {{and complexity of the}} formation in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs, welltest data are affected by long wellbore storage effect that masks the reservoir response to pressure change, and it may fail to provide dual-porosity dual-permeability models dynamic characteristics such as fracture permeability, fracture storativity ratio and interporosity flow coefficient. Therefore, application of welltest and image log data in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs for meaningful results may not be well understood and the data may be difficult to interpret. This paper presents the estimation of fracture permeability in naturally fractured tight gas formations, by integration of welltest analysis results and image log data based on Kazemi’s simplified model. Reservoir simulation of dual-porosity and dual-permeability systems and sensitivity analysis are performed for different matrix and fracture parameters to understand the relationship between natural fractures parameters with welltest permeability. The simulation results confirmed reliability of the proposed correlation for fracture permeability estimation.

Certain processes tend to occur at specific pressures or temperatures, with different fluids and for different lithologies and primary textures. From a geothermal perspective, this suggests that building a permeability model requires careful geological and physical characterisation of the rock and rock mass for each unique geothermal system. This would also be the case for petroleum reservoirs, dewatering and excavations in volcanic systems or hydrothermally altered systems.|$|R
40|$|Cores {{from two}} of the 13 U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) {{research}} holes at Yellowstone National Park (Y- 5 and Y- 8) were evaluated to characterize lithology, texture, alteration, and the degree and nature of fracturing and veining. <b>Matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> measurements and petrographic examination of the core were {{used to evaluate the}} effects of lithology and hydrothermal alteration on permeability. The intervals studied in these two core holes span the conductive zone (including the reservoir cap) and the upper portion of the convective geothermal reservoir. Variations in porosity and <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> observed in the Y- 5 and Y- 8 cores are primarily controlled by lithology. Y- 8 intersects three distinc...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{parametric}} {{study of the}} thermal and hydrologic characteristics of the fractured porous tuffs at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was conducted. The effects of different fracture and <b>matrix</b> properties including <b>permeability,</b> thermal conductivity, specific heat, porosity, and tortuosity on heat pipe performance {{in the vicinity of}} the waste package were observed. Computer simulations were carried out using TOUGH code on a Cray YMP- 2 supercomputer. None of the fracture parameters affected the heat pipe performance except the mobility of the liquid in the fracture. <b>Matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> and thermal conductivity were found to have significant effect on the heat pipe performance. The effect of mass injection was studied for liquid water and air injected at the fracture boundary. A high rate of mass injection was required to produce any effect on the heat pipe. The fracture-matrix equilibrium is influenced by the <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> and the <b>matrix</b> thermal conductivity...|$|R
30|$|Smaller crack systems {{which are}} not visible in the {{graphical}} documents require a second, isotropic or anisotropic <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> delivering a non-zero “background value”.

30|$|Because {{the matrix}} of tight gas {{sandstones}} in Xujiahe Formation {{is characterized by}} poor pore structure, small pores, narrow pore throats, and low permeability, the resistance to fluid flow is great, and the interacting forces at the interfaces of solids and liquids are strong. Therefore, a clear start pressure gradient exists and the fluid flow is not coincident with the Darcy law. Start pressure is inversely proportional to <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability</b> (Shanley et al. 2004; Friedel and Voigt 2006). The lower the permeability is, the higher the start pressure is, and the greater the influence on the development. Meanwhile, because {{of the existence of}} well-developed fractures, the high fracture conductivity contrasts with the low <b>matrix</b> <b>permeability,</b> making the flow system complex.|$|R
