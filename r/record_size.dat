25|$|The {{first edition}} of the Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells was {{reviewed}} for Conchologists of America (COA) by malacologist Gary Rosenberg of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and conchologist Gene Everson.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the registry, shells were {{sometimes}} officially measured for world <b>record</b> <b>size</b> status at Conchologists of America conventions, as in 1999 when the measurements were carried out by senior author Kim Hutsell.|$|E
25|$|While the {{importance}} of maximum shell size {{and its role in}} the overall scheme of Conchology and Malacology is debatable, it remains one point of continual interest among collectors and researchers. The purpose of the Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells is to provide a single publication containing a list of the largest known specimens for as many shelled molluscan species as possible in a format designed for ease of use. Undoubtedly, specimens may exist, hidden in museums, universities and private collections, which exceed some of the sizes listed herein. It is the sincere hope of the editors that information concerning such specimens be shared with others by submitting accurate and verifiable records to the Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells.|$|E
50|$|The maximum <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> of {{the shell}} is 1 mm.|$|R
2500|$|Comparing {{around a}} quarter of the <b>size</b> <b>records</b> from the first edition against shells in the {{collections}} of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Rosenberg found that the latter had larger specimens in some 10% of cases. What Rosenberg considered [...] "f greatest concern", however, were discrepancies between the <b>record</b> <b>sizes</b> listed in the registry and larger specimens found in contemporary monographic works, and this even extended to type specimens in some cases. The problem seemed to be particularly pronounced in the Pleurotomariidae—a family highly prized by shell collectors—where nine out of sixteen species had larger shells listed in the standard work on the family, that of Anseeuw & Goto (1996). Similar issues were found with the <b>record</b> <b>sizes</b> of Terebridae. Rosenberg concluded: [...] "The Registry would be much more authoritative if it included <b>record</b> <b>sizes</b> from the literature, and I recommend this be done in future editions." ...|$|R
2500|$|Since {{the initial}} {{benchmarking}} {{work done in}} 2012, multiple follow-on tests have been conducted with additional database engines for both in-memory [...] and on-disk [...] workloads characterizing the performance across multiple CPUs and <b>record</b> <b>sizes.</b> These tests show that LMDB performance is unmatched on all in-memory workloads, and excels in all disk-bound read workloads, as well as disk-bound write workloads using large <b>record</b> <b>sizes.</b> The benchmark driver code was subsequently published on github and further expanded in database coverage.|$|R
25|$|The Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells is a conchological work {{listing the}} largest (and {{in some cases}} smallest) {{verified}} shell specimens of various mollusc taxa. A successor to the earlier World Size Records of Robert J. L. Wagner and R. Tucker Abbott, it has been published on a semi-regular basis since 1997, changing ownership and publisher a number of times. Originally planned for release every two years, new editions are now published annually. Since 2008 the entire registry has been available online {{in the form of}} a searchable database. The registry is continuously expanded and now contains more than 20,000 listings and 55,000 supporting images.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{families}} of attractive shells (such as cones, cowries, marginellas, and murex) are particularly favoured by collectors. World <b>record</b> <b>size</b> shells (commonly {{indicated by the}} acronym 'WRS') of species in the most popular families are much sought after by some shell collectors, and can thus command high prices. Collections of such shells are exhibited {{at a number of}} specialist museums, including the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. Maximum and minimum sizes are also of interest to malacologists, and may be useful in delimiting closely related species. As an extensive compilation of maximum shell sizes, the registry has found use as a data source for scientific studies.|$|E
25|$|The text of {{the fourth}} edition was {{completed}} by Kim and Linda Hutsell and originally planned for release at the 2003 COA convention in Tacoma, Washington, but was greatly delayed and only came out in 2005. The fifth edition appeared three years later. With {{the departure of the}} first two authors, the titles of the fourth and fifth editions were shortened to Pisor's Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells. These also marked a switch from Snail's Pace Productions to a new main publisher, ConchBooks of Hackenheim, Germany. They were compiled with the help of Conchology, Inc., with the company's founder, Guido T. Poppe, providing an introduction for the fifth edition.|$|E
50|$|Fairly large spines at {{eyes and}} along centre of back and tail. Colour brown with groups of lighter spots. <b>Recorded</b> <b>size</b> up to 102cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{exceptionally}} {{long summer}} days enable some vegetables to attain world <b>record</b> <b>sizes,</b> including a carrot of 19 lb, a rutabaga of 76 lb, and a cabbage of 127 lb.|$|R
50|$|Bullheads {{do not get}} {{as large}} as the other {{catfishes}} native to North America, with average sizes in the one to two-pound range and world <b>record</b> <b>sizes</b> well under 10 lb.|$|R
25|$|On 2 April 2008, the {{copyrights}} to {{the registry}} were transferred from Pisor to Jean-Pierre Barbier of Topseashells and Philippe Quiquandon of Shell's Passion. With Olivier Santini, Barbier and Quiquandon subsequently launched an official website where all registry listings {{can be accessed}} for a fee. The online database includes photographs of the listed specimens that have been gathered {{with the help of}} collectors, dealers, and institutions such as the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris. Older records for which photographic evidence could not be obtained were removed from the database and replaced by verified specimens, even if these were smaller, to ensure that all specimens were measured and identified correctly. Barbier, Quiquandon and Santini moved the print title to an annual publication cycle, starting with the sixth edition in 2009, with Shell's Passion and Topseashells taking over as publishers. Under the new ownership the print edition is titled simply Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells.|$|E
25|$|The direct {{predecessor}} to the Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells was World Size Records, {{compiled by}} renowned malacologists Robert J. L. Wagner (1905–1992) and R. Tucker Abbott (1919–1995). These record sizes originally appeared in 1964, {{in the first}} edition of Van Nostrand's Standard Catalog of Shells, not as a separate list but interspersed among other species-specific information that made up the bulk of the work. An updated list was published as part of the book's second edition, in 1967. The next update appeared in the work's third edition, which was renamed Wagner and Abbott's Standard Catalog of Shells. Unlike previous editions, this third and final installment of the catalog was a ring binder with loose-leaf content, intended as a continually updated resource. To match the newly retitled work, the list's name was modified to Wagner and Abbott's World Size Records. In this final incarnation, the list appeared as a series of four supplements: the first two were loose-leaf publications that appeared in 1978 and 1982, and these were followed by hole-punched paperback titles in 1985 and 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells has {{appeared}} in twelve print editions since 1997. New editions are currently released on an annual basis. All editions are of the approximate dimensions [...] and have coil or comb binding, with heavy paper covers and a clear plastic sheet protecting the front cover.|$|E

2500|$|The park {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of the scenic Williamson River and Spring Creek whose origin is a natural spring about a mile from the park. The aquifer that feeds the spring is believed to originate thirty miles northeast of the park in the east side drainage of Crater Lake National Park. The Williamson River is well known for its trout fishing. Brook, rainbow, and native Great Basin redband trout are found in the Williamson River in this area. The brook and rainbow trout often reach , and the redband trout in the Williamson River can reach <b>record</b> <b>size,</b> up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The upper creek, above Warsaw, is {{stocked with}} 1,850 {{yearling}} brown trout {{in the spring}} of each year, supplementing an indigenous wild population. DEC surveys have found that by June few of the stocked trout remain, showing that the stretch has heavy fishing pressure. The <b>record</b> <b>size</b> for trout taken from this stretch is [...] DEC has not acquired any public fishing rights along the four miles (...) south of, but public access is relatively unhindered as there are several bridges, paralleling railroad tracks (both of which automatically create public access to adjacent areas of the stream under New York law) and the area is otherwise lightly posted against trepassing.|$|E

50|$|The <b>record</b> <b>size</b> {{cutthroat}} trout of any subspecies was a Lahontan caught in Pyramid Lake weighing 41 lb, although anecdotal and photographic evidence exists of even larger fish from this lake.|$|E
50|$|The pharaoh {{cuttlefish}} (Sepia pharaonis) {{is a large}} cuttlefish species, {{growing to}} 42 cm in mantle length and 5 kg in weight. When raised in the laboratory, the maximum <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> for males is 16.2 cm, and for females 15.5 cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{shell of}} the species is almost spherical, which is unusual in vase snails, hence the {{specific}} name globulus. The maximum <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> of the shell is 43 mm, but it is small {{compared to that of}} other species in the same genus.|$|R
50|$|Young grunion grow {{rapidly and}} are about five inches long {{by the time}} they reach one year old and are ready to spawn. Adult fish {{normally}} range in size from 6 to 7 in with a maximum <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> of 8.5 in (La Jolla, Ca., 05-11-05).|$|R
50|$|The <b>record</b> <b>size</b> {{for white}} bass caught on fishing tackle is 6 lb shared by fish caught in 1989 in Orange Lake, Orange, Virginia, and in 2010 in Amite River, Louisiana.|$|E
50|$|Seminatrix are small, thin snakes, usually 25 - 38 cm long; the <b>record</b> <b>size</b> (reported for S. pygaea) was 55 cm. They are uniformly black, with {{a bright}} orange or red belly.|$|E
50|$|The {{first edition}} of the Registry of World <b>Record</b> <b>Size</b> Shells was {{reviewed}} for Conchologists of America (COA) by malacologist Gary Rosenberg of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and conchologist Gene Everson.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a small}} snake with {{a maximum}} <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> of less than 30 centimeters. The color pattern {{consists}} of a pale golden-brown ground color {{with a series of}} dark-brown and cream parallel longitudinal stripes. The ventral scales are very dark, almost black. The smooth scales show a strong green-blue iridescence.|$|R
50|$|C. zonatus {{has a very}} deep, {{compressed}} {{body with}} a blunt snout and a sloping, slightly concave profile. It has a small mouth with the posterior end of the jaw not passing {{the front of the}} eye. The maximum <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> was 65 cm but more commonly reach a length of 25 cm.|$|R
50|$|This species {{commonly}} {{grows to}} more than 100 cm in length. The maximum <b>recorded</b> <b>size</b> is 151.5 cm. In Montana, specimens occasionally exceed 120 cm in length; the species reaches its maximum size in this region. One of the most characteristic features {{is the presence of}} three or more, usually four, internasal scales.|$|R
