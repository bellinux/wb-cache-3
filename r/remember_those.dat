5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{effect of the}} war was a psychological one. The heavy losses deeply affected many directly, and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to <b>remember</b> <b>those</b> that had been killed. However, despite the size of Australia's contribution to the fighting, there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it. Realising this, and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand, Charles Bean, who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in the war, advocated the need for a national memorial {{and was one of the}} main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The experience of the war also perpetuated many notions about the Australian character and national identity that endure to this day. For many Australians the performance of their soldiers—particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign—served to highlight the nation's emergence as a member of the international community, while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians' natural ability as soldiers. The attitudes of many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected. There was a widespread revulsion at the large-scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again. In many regards this led to a general complacency towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict, while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day.|$|E

25|$|The Ypres League was a British World War I {{veterans}} and remembrance society.

It later became an incorporated society, based in London. It produced a quarterly newsletter and a guide book to Ypres, and provided a variety of services to its members, including specially designed membership certificates. It also worked to successfully erect a memorial church at Ypres. International branches were established, and the League celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1930. Publication of its newsletter continued well into the 1930s, and branches were still active in the 1940s.|$|E

500|$|Confirmation bias {{is a form}} of {{cognitive}} bias, a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology.

Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not.

500|$|A thirteen-year {{rivalry with}} Nicholls State University {{ended with the}} 2011 {{football}} season.

[...] To <b>remember</b> <b>those</b> affected by the floods, including some people {{who had died in}} it, a wooden oar was made with each school's colors and initials.

[...] Prior to the schools' meeting in 2011, Rob Bernardi, the Athletic Director for Nicholls State, said {{that they would not be}} bringing the oar to San Marcos and would leave it on display in the Nicholls State athletic offices.

500|$|Hirst was {{recalled}} for {{the final}} Test and played a vital role. Wisden said that he bowled {{as well as he}} had in 1901 as he brought about an early batting collapse. Although Australia recovered, he had figures of five for 77. With Len Braund, Hirst then helped England to avoid the follow-on, scoring 43 and according to Wisden [...] "hitting with the utmost freedom." [...] Hirst took a further wicket as Australia were dismissed for 121. England, needing 263 to win, were 48 for five at one point but an innings of 104 from Gilbert Jessop gave England a chance. Hirst scored 58 not out, making an aggressive start but slowing down to score mainly from singles in the later stages of the innings as wickets were lost. The ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when Rhodes joined Hirst. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, [...] "We'll get 'em in singles", but neither batsman could <b>remember</b> <b>those</b> words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen held their nerve to take England to a one-wicket victory. Wisden described Hirst as playing [...] "a great game", noted the coolness of his play under pressure and said that [...] "Hirst's innings was in its way almost as remarkable as Jessop's".|$|E
500|$|The main cricket {{event of}} 1902 was the Australian tour of England. Rhodes played in all five Tests and was England's leading wicket-taker with 22 wickets {{at an average}} of 15.27. He took seven for 17 in the first innings of the first Test, out of an Australian total of 36, in {{conditions}} that the umpires considered reasonable for batting; Wisden noted that Rhodes and Hirst bowled very well. However, C. B. Fry believed that Hirst was more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they [...] "hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success". Rain meant the game was drawn and washed out most of the second match. In the third Test, which England lost, Rhodes took five for 63, including a spell of four wickets in nineteen balls. In the fourth Test, Rhodes took seven wickets in the match, taking three quick wickets in the first innings, but receiving some heavy punishment. He was batting {{at the end of the}} match, but was unable to prevent Australia from snatching victory to win by three runs and take the series. The final Test, at The Oval, was dominated by Gilbert Jessop and Hirst, but when England needed 263 to win in the final innings, Rhodes came into bat after the ninth wicket fell with 15 needed for England to win. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, [...] "We'll get 'em in singles", but neither batsman could <b>remember</b> <b>those</b> words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen were not dismissed and England won by one wicket.|$|E
