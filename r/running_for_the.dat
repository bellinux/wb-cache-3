5|$|On December 20, 2012, Booker {{announced}} that he would explore <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate seat that was then occupied by Frank Lautenberg in the 2014 election, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Chris Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election. On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing whether or not he would run. Roughly one month after declaring his interest in <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Senate, incumbent Lautenberg {{announced that}} he would not seek reelection.|$|E
5|$|After being {{sworn in}} as premier, Dunderdale {{announced}} {{that she would not}} be seeking the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a leadership election was held in the spring of 2011.

5|$|On November 6, 2008, Emanuel {{accepted}} {{the position of}} White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7.

5|$|The next {{election}} {{was called for}} October 2008. Dosanjh faced sociologist Wai Young <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Conservatives, health worker Ann Chambers <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NDP, and an IT consultant, Csaba Gulyas for the Green Party. Dosanjh won by 33 votes over Young, both receiving 38.4% of the vote. A recount confirmed Dosanjh's victory but only {{by a margin of}} 22 votes. The Conservative Party requested a second, judicial recount, which again confirmed Dosanjh as the victor. In the 40th Canadian Parliament, with his party once again forming the official opposition, Dosanjh was appointed the National Defence critic for the first parliamentary session which was short-lived. During the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute he defended the proposed coalition government as a reaction to inappropriate leadership on economic issues by the existing government. When Dion resigned as party leader, Dosanjh considered but did not run for leadership citing his inability to speak French and again supported Rae's bid. In October 2009, Michael Ignatieff appointed Dosanjh as the Liberals' critic for National Defence.|$|E

5|$|Warren is {{a leading}} figure in the Democratic Party and is popular among American progressives. Although she {{repeatedly}} stated {{that she was not}} <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presidency, Warren was frequently mentioned by political pundits as a strong potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Warren remained neutral during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, endorsing presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton only after all fifty states had voted.|$|E
5|$|As Bayne was <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Nationwide Series Championship and {{was thus}} ineligible to receive points, the result left Edwards leading the Driver's Championship with 42points.

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War I, Helgoland was {{assigned}} to the I Division, I Battle Squadron. Helgoland was stationed off the heavily fortified island of Wangerooge on 9 August. Minefields and picket lines of cruisers, torpedo boats, and submarines were also emplaced there to defend Wilhelmshaven. Helgolands engines were kept <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entirety of her deployment, so that she would be ready to respond at a moment's notice. Four days later, on 13 August, Helgoland returned to Wilhelmshaven to refuel. The following day, naval reservists began arriving to fill out the wartime complements for the German battleships.|$|E

5|$|Blaine had {{considered}} <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United States House of Representatives from Maine’s 4th district in 1860, but agreed {{to step aside}} when Anson P. Morrill, a former governor, announced {{his interest in the}} seat. Morrill was successful, but after redistricting placed Blaine in the 3rd district for the 1862 elections, he allowed his name to be put forward. Running on a campaign of staunch support for the war effort, Blaine was elected with an ample majority despite Republican losses across the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of}} the race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, who was <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> United State Senate in {{the spring}} of 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married {{president}} of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; the CWA represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.|$|E

5|$|Daniels had {{his first}} {{experience}} in politics while still a teenager when, in 1968, {{he worked on the}} unsuccessful campaign of fellow Hoosier and Princeton alumnus William Ruckelshaus, who was <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh. After the campaign Ruckelshaus helped Daniels secure an internship in the office of then-Indianapolis mayor Richard Lugar. Daniels worked on Lugar's re-election campaign in 1971, and later, in 1974, he worked on Lugar's first campaign for Senate via L. Keith Bulen's Campaign Communicators, Inc, a political consultancy where Daniels served as vice president. Daniels joined Lugar's mayoral staff in December, 1974. Within three years, he became Lugar's principal assistant. After Lugar was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Daniels followed him to Washington, D.C. as his Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not alone in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and letting the delegates choose.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Goebel {{was again}} {{selected}} as an All-Pro {{player with the}} Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown. In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924. While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved {{in one of the}} oddest plays in NFL history. Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the Chicago Bears. Knop began <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate Ed Healey on the four-yard line.|$|E

In 2002, the firm gave {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars to Governor Rod Blagojevich and Attorney General Lisa Madigan's campaigns. In 2003, while Chico was chairman and simultaneously <b>running</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> US Senate, Altheimer became insolvent and dissolved. Some partners blamed the bankruptcy on poor management by Chico, while an attorney who sat on two financial committees blamed an economic downturn.|$|E
