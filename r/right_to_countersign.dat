50|$|After {{he agreed}} to this final {{compromise}} with King Carol, Averescu largely withdrew from public life. He maintained only some informal contacts with former PP dignitaries, such as Argetoianu, Meissner, Trancu-Iași and Petre Papacostea. He bemoaned the passing of Romania's repressive constitution, and refused <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> it, but he also rejected offers to join up with a public show of protest by the PNȚ and PNL. Just as some advanced proposals to restore Averescu to the premiership, the ailing Marshal went on an extended trip abroad. He died of heart disease shortly after returning to Romania, and was granted a state funeral.|$|R

Despite this, the tax continued to face stiff opposition from the part of Orthodox clergy and Metropolitan Dosiftei Filiti.

2500|$|The {{new draft}} was very {{different}} from the intentions of the drafting committee, and at one point, Sanya actually resigned from the premiership, only to be pressured back into position. [...] The new draft was approved by the convention and promulgated on 7 October 1974. The majority of the constitution conformed to the convention's alternative draft. [...] However, the premier, rather than the privy council president, was allowed <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the royal declaration appointing senators. [...] Legislative elections were held in January 1975, resulting in none of the 22 parties coming close to winning a majority. The Democrats, led by Seni Pramoj, formed a coalition government in February 1974. The coalition was highly unstable, and was replaced {{in less than a month}} by a Social Action Party-led coalition which appointed Kukrit Pramoj as premier.|$|R

But one might ask: have the difficulties experienced by women in old age been surpassed by these achievements? The {{purpose of this article is}} to make a contribution towards turning more visible specific issues relating to the current generation of older women. The basis for these reflections are the discussions taking place in the National Forum of Elderly Woman (FNMI) as well as the findings of the research on “Elderly Woman in Pernambuco: empowerment and its barriers”, currently underway, undertaken by the Joaquim Nabuco Foundation in partnership with the Women's Secretariat of Pernambuco...|$|R
50|$|These changes did {{not fully}} resolve the {{problems}} of the agencies. After the new services were established, President Stipe Mesić proposed appointments for the directors of the agencies, but Prime Minister Ivica Račan refused <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the appointments. Additional problems were caused by a lack of coordination, since documents and files had to be transferred to the new agencies. Several days before the Office for National Security ceased to exist (on March 31), its outgoing head Tomislav Karamarko ordered all such materials to be moved to the Croatian State Archives. This gesture was a protest against the reorganization of the security and intelligence services. It also {{turned out to be a}} major scandal since the sensitive and confidential documents were not guarded at the archives, where they languished for several days before being taken to the Intelligence Agency.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Miklósi's remarks, {{the above}} disagreements, {{primarily}} {{the rejection of}} electoral registration and the reclassification of MNB public funds, were serious political setbacks for Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who, as a result, seriously considered the replacement of Ádár by a more obedient candidate in the 2017 presidential election. Pro-government portal Origo.hu, citing anonymous sources from the Fidesz leadership, wrote in April 2016 (a month after Áder refused <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the MNB law) that Áder's dismissal after the expiry of his mandate in May 2017 was [...] "almost certain". The website noted that Orbán personally opposed Áder's nomination, and wanted a non-politician in his place, for instance academics József Pálinkás or Szilveszter E. Vizi. In May 2016, Hír TV's microphone recorded a short conservation between György Rubovszky (KDNP), Chairman of the Justice Committee, and Imre Vas (Fidesz), the committee's deputy chairman. Rubovszky told his colleague {{that there was no}} way to re-elect Áder in 2017 as [...] "Viktor Orbán does not allow it".|$|R
5000|$|After the Potsdam Conference and the reaffirmation by the Allies of {{the need}} to {{establish}} democratically elected governments in Europe, Michael I demanded the resignation of Petru Groza, who refused. Faced with this insubordination, the sovereign began a [...] "royal strike" [...] on 23 August 1945 during which he refused <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the acts of the government. With his mother, he locked himself in the Elisabeta Palace for six weeks before departing to Sinaia. The resistance of the monarch, however, wasn't supported by the West, who after the Moscow Conference of 25 December 1945, asked Romania to allow two opposition figures to enter the government. Disappointed by the lack of courage of London and Washington, the sovereign was shocked by the attitudes of Princesses Elisabeth and Ileana, who openly supported the communist authorities. Disgusted by all these betrayals, Helen, in turn, encouraged fewer meetings with Soviet officials and worried every day for the life of her son.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1864, the cabinet {{introduced}} a bill providing for an extensive land reform, which proposed allocating land based on peasant status. The fruntași ("foremost people"), who owned 4 or more oxen, were to receive 5 fălci of land, or approx. 7.5 hectares; mijlocași ("middle people"), with two oxen—approx. 6 hectares; pălmași ("manual laborers"), with no oxen—approx. 3 hectares. Peasants were to own their plots after making 14 yearly payments to their respective landowner. This caused uproar in Parliament, which represented around 4,000 mostly boyar electors, and voices from among the Conservatives deemed it [...] "insane". The latter party prepared a censure vote, {{based on the fact}} that Kogălniceanu had publicized the project through Monitorul Oficial in contradiction with the one endorsed by the Focșani Commission, thus going against the letter of the law—he later justified himself saying: [...] "Publication was necessary in order to quell the rural population, agitated by the project".

5000|$|The most stormy {{incident}} was the [...] "Antall-Göncz media war" [...] {{during the years}} of his first term. In July 1990, as consensus between the six parliamentary parties, the National Assembly appointed sociologists Elemér Hankiss and Csaba Gombár as Presidents of the Magyar Televízió and Magyar Rádió, respectively. In the summer of 1991, the Antall cabinet submitted new deputies of the state medias to counterbalance Hankiss and Gombár, however Göncz refused <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the appointments. Antall accused the President of overstepping his powers and turned to the Constitutional Court, which ruled in September in that year that the President does not have a right of veto with regard to appointments, [...] "unless those appointments endangered the democratic functioning of state institutions involved." [...] Göncz did not change his position and began to play for time, thus the Prime Minister again turned to the Constitutional Court, which on 28 January 1992 ruled that the President should sign the appointments [...] "within a reasonable time." ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the compulsory psychiatric regime in Hong Kong. Under section 36 of the Mental Health Ordinance, which authorises long-term detention of psychiatric patients, a District Judge is required <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the form filled out by the registered medical practitioners {{in order for the}} detention to be valid. Case law, however, has shown that the role of the District Judge is merely administrative. This article suggests that, as it currently stands, the compulsory psychiatric regime in Hong Kong is unconstitutional because it fails the proportionality test. In light of this conclusion, the author proposes two solutions to deal with the issue, by common law or by legislative reform. The former would see an exercise of discretion by the courts read into section 36, while the latter would involve piecemeal reform of the relevant provisions to give the courts an explicit discretion to consider substantive issues when reviewing compulsory detention applications. The author argues that these solutions would introduce effective judicial supervision into the compulsory psychiatric regime and safeguard against abuse of process...|$|R
5000|$|He {{left for}} the Indies in 1514 along with Hernando de Luque on a fleet {{commanded}} by Pedro Arias Dávila. Conflict between Quevedo and Arias Dávila soon ensued as Quevedo strongly protested against the cruel acts committed by the governor and his officers, not only against the Indians, but also against rivals, such as the beheading of Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, the discoverer of the Pacific Ocean. Counter charges were brought against Quevedo with Bartolomé de Las Casas accusing him of having violated a trust, accumulated wealth, and neglected the Indians, but the veracity of Las Casas' accusations has not been established. Quevedo returned to Spain in (1518) and presented two memorials to King Charles. One was against Arias Dávila, and the other advocated restricting the powers of all governors in the New World for the better protection of the natives. When these documents were shown to Las Casas, in spite of differences between the two, he offered <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> them. Bishop Quevedo soon fell sick and died at Barcelona.|$|R
5000|$|Returning from Paris, Polyzoidis {{found himself}} pitted against the autocratic {{government}} of Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias, and soon {{passed into the}} opposition, editing the newspaper Apollon, printed at Hydra. In 1832 he was nominated by the Bavarian regency {{to be president of}} a five-member court of Nafplio, which had to judge Theodoros Kolokotronis, Dimitrios Plapoutas and other former leaders of the War of Independence on trumped-up charges of treason. Polyzoidis, together with fellow judge Georgios Tertsetis, knowing very well the innocence of the defendants, refused <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> the decision of condemnation. The Minister of Justice, K. Schinas, personally intervened to force Polyzoidis to append his signature to the document [...] "in the name of the King", to which Polysoidis replied: [...] "I prefer my hand to be cut off rather than sign." [...] His stance caused his imprisonment and violent maltreatment. This refusal to accept royal intervention in the administration of justice was indicative of the Polyzoidis' integrity, and his portrait, together with that of Tertsetis, now hangs in the Areios Pagos, the Supreme Court of Greece.|$|R
2500|$|A monarch-appointed senate with 100 {{members was}} established, equal {{in size to}} the house of representatives. As in {{previous}} constitutions, the monarch still did not have an absolute veto. However, the monarch-appointed senate could, through a simple majority over the combined houses of parliament, sustain a royal veto. The chairman of the Supreme State Council had <b>to</b> <b>countersign</b> any royal orders in order to make them official (when the constitution was announced, Bhumibol Adulyadej was still a minor and the privy council performed the king's regnal duties on his behalf. Thus in practice, the Supreme Council of State itself selected and appointed senators and had the power of veto). [...] The ban on civil servants and soldiers serving in parliament and the cabinet was removed. Another key change stated that the policies of one government could not be altered by a succeeding government without royal approval. A multi-member constituency system replaced the single member constituency system which had been in effect since 1932. The minimum age of electoral candidates was raised from 23 to 35. Numerous MPs elected under the 1946 constitution had been under the age of 30, but were ineligible under the junta's constitution.|$|R

Paxson, Treasurer, of the City and County of San Francisco. 25 Cal. 635) and in 1865, a legal judgment against Loewy (The People ex rel The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California vs. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, and Wilhelm Lowey, Clerk 27 Cal. 655) directing that the Bonds be countersigned and delivered. In 1863 the legislature's forcing of City and County action became known as the [...] "Dutch Flat Swindle".
