In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion in his lab.

Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
