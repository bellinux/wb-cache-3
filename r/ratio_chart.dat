Flow characteristics or the rheological characteristics of concrete were expressed by using the Bingham model. Yield shear stress and the plastic viscosity are the two flow properties included in the Bingham model. A range of the combinations of yield shear stress and plastic viscosity was identified within which the concrete is likely to be self-compactable. To determine the self-compactability of a concrete three index properties were determined by experiments. Those three properties are the filling ability, passing ability and the segregation resistance. To measure the filling ability, slump flow by Abram’s cone, T 50 cm slump flow time and V funnel test were used. To measure the passing ability, J ring test was used. V funnel at T 5 min test was used to test the resistance to segregation. Self-compactability was judged by comparing the results with the acceptable regions given in the EFNARC publications. Yield shear stress and the plastic viscosity were calculated by using the rotational speed and the applied torque on the concrete which were measured by a coaxial type cohesiometer.

Layered patterns are important because they form {{a record of the}} state of internal and external factors that regulate pattern formation in these geological and biological systems. It is therefore potentially possible to recognize trends, periodicities, and events {{in the history of the}} formation of these systems among the incremental sequences. Though the structures and sizes of these 2 -D patterns are typically scale-free, they are also characteristically anisotropic; that is, the number of layers and their absolute thicknesses vary significantly during formation. The aim of the present work is to quantify the structure of layered patterns and to reveal similarities and differences in the processing and interpretation of layered landforms and biological systems. To reach this goal we used N-partite graph and Boolean functions to quantify the structure of layers and plot charts for “layer thickness vs. layer number” and “layer area vs. layer number”. These charts serve as a source of information about events in the history of formation of layered systems. The concept of synchronization of layer formation across a 2 -D plane is introduced to develop the procedure for plotting “layer thickness vs. layer number” and “layer area vs. layer number”, which takes into account the structural anisotropy of layered patterns and increase signal-to-noise <b>ratio</b> in <b>charts.</b> Examples include landforms on Mars and Earth and incremental layers in human and iguana bones...|$|R
