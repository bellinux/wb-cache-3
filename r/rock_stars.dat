5|$|As a result, Homer goes on {{tour with}} the festival and hangs out with The Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, and Sonic Youth. Homer {{suddenly}} finds himself living the high life: partying with big name <b>rock</b> <b>stars</b> and becoming respected among American youth, including Bart. As the tour approaches {{a stop in}} Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to hurt and he is sent to a veterinarian. The veterinarian advises Homer that if he performs his act one more time, he will die. At first he decides to do his job, {{but at the last}} second he dodges the cannonball. Consequently, he is released from the festival and, despite a warm sendoff from the <b>rock</b> <b>stars,</b> goes back to not being respected by his children.|$|E

Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.

5|$|Dig Me Out is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album Call the Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. Call the Doctor confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of Call the Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill <b>Rock</b> <b>Stars,</b> another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill <b>Rock</b> <b>Stars</b> afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that Call the Doctor only took four days to record while Dig Me Out was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E

The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors. The lyrical themes of the album explore issues of failed relationships and personal uncertainty.|$|E

The music on the record was influenced by traditional rock and roll bands, while the lyrics deal with issues of heartbreak and survival. The album cover is an homage to The Kinks' 1965 album The Kink Kontroversy.|$|E

Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, which was another Kill <b>Rock</b> <b>Stars</b> release. Either/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title {{was derived from the}} two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.|$|E

5|$|More or {{less the}} Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, with their du-jour cool and deft {{combination}} of insular art flair and dance-floor populism, was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as {{the dawn of a}} new rock revolution. The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist may prefer its <b>rock</b> <b>stars</b> with suspenders and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome.|$|E

5|$|The {{magistrates court}} {{continued}} to cover significant trials that were widely {{reported by the}} media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried here for attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of <b>rock</b> <b>stars,</b> including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at the magistrates court. Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly a discrete genre known as rock and roll evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, which came to include diverse styles like heavy metal and punk rock. During the 1970s most of these styles were evolving in the underground music scene, while mainstream audiences began the decade {{with a wave of}} singer-songwriters who drew on the deeply emotional and personal lyrics of 1960s folk rock. The same period saw the rise of bombastic arena rock bands, bluesy Southern rock groups and mellow soft <b>rock</b> <b>stars.</b> Beginning in the later 1970s, the rock singer and songwriter Bruce Springsteen became a major star, with anthemic songs and dense, inscrutable lyrics that celebrated the poor and working class.|$|E
5|$|Determined {{to become}} part of the fashion industry, but unable to make a breakthrough, Everest decided to use his {{knowledge}} of tailoring. He answered an advertisement placed in the London Evening Standard, in 1982, by Tommy Nutter; 'Boy wanted in Savile Row'. He pestered Nutter for weeks, until he was given the job. Nutter's client base included <b>rock</b> <b>stars,</b> celebrities, politicians and businessmen; he famously dressed The Beatles and The Stones. Everest also mixed with future celebrities of the fashion world. John Galliano, who had been studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, passed on some design skills to Everest, while on work placement with Nutter. Everest met his future wife Catherine (now an actress and film producer) at this time, while she was also working with Nutter. The couple have two daughters. Everest's time under Nutter, a Savile Row revolutionary in the 1960s, inspired him to experiment with tone and pattern in his own designs. In 1986, after nearly five years as Nutter's apprentice, Everest was persuaded to move on to work for Malcolm Levene. He had become disillusioned with Savile Row, particularly with their lack of appreciation for Nutter's more modern approach. Everest found that working with Levene, a small menswear retailer based away from Savile Row, on Chiltern Street, provided a welcome change. During Everest's first year there, Levene's turnover doubled.|$|E
