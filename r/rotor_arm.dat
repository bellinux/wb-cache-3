5|$|In the Safari Rally, a <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> in Mouton's Quattro {{failed and}} caused the turbo {{to break down}} as well. She retired after falling victim to the team's ranking order; as the repairs were {{expected}} to take too long, Gumpert ordered championship leader Blomqvist's Quattro to be fixed by using Mouton's sister car as spares. Her debut in the new Sport Quattro at the Acropolis Rally ended with engine overheating problems. In the 1000 Lakes, Mouton placed ninth after the short first day. She later crashed and continued without a windscreen, but the damage to her Quattro could not be repaired in service. Mouton retired and left Finland pointless for the fourth year in a row. In late October, she signed a contract extension with Audi. At the RAC Rally, a slight mistake led to a puncture and Mouton dropped from third to fifth. She went on to narrowly lose the final podium spot to Toyota's Per Eklund. Mouton's results placed her 12th in the drivers' world championship, a point behind RÃ¶hrl. Outside the WRC, Mouton debuted in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in the United States, driving an Audi Sport Quattro together with her usual co-driver Fabrizia Pons. After her main opponent Martin Schanche got hampered by a flat right front tyre she won the open rally category (now known as unlimited) in a record time and placed second overall, leaving behind several specialised V8 single-seaters that had normally dominated the race.|$|E

Unfortunately for Hill, in the race itself he retired following an accident on only the seventh lap. The early season shakedown races continued well for the BRM team; Hill set fastest lap at Goodwood on 30 March, and was only prevented from winning when the car's <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> dropped off two laps from the end. Hill added a further two second-place finishes, at the Aintree 200 and BRDC International Trophy races, before the first race of the World Championship season.|$|E
500|$|The tank {{broke down}} twice. The distributor's <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> broke and a {{replacement}} {{had to be}} sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, {{and the lack of}} suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a [...] cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.|$|E
5000|$|Practical commutators have {{at least}} three contact segments, to prevent a [...] "dead" [...] spot where two brushes {{simultaneously}} bridge only two commutator segments. Brushes are made wider than the insulated gap, to ensure that brushes are always in contact with an armature coil. For commutators with at least three segments, although the rotor can potentially stop {{in a position where}} two commutator segments touch one brush, this only de-energizes one of the <b>rotor</b> <b>arms</b> while the others will still function correctly. With the remaining <b>rotor</b> <b>arms,</b> a motor can produce sufficient torque to begin spinning the rotor, and a generator can provide useful power to an external circuit.|$|R
40|$|In the {{construction}} of the electrostatic motor, which was developed, the rolling spherical bodies caused the rotation {{at the level of the}} rotor. For this reason the mechanical collector design solution is very important. The number of the <b>rotor</b> <b>arms</b> and the angular value between them can influence the period of rotation of this rotor. This work attempts to set the cause and to establish as much as accurately as possible an optimum angular value...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBipolar {{electrochemistry}} {{has been}} shown to enable and control various kinds of propulsion of nonwired conducting objects: translation, rotation, and levitation. There is a very rapid development in the field of controlled motion combined with other functionalities. Here we integrate two different concepts in one system to generate wireless electrochemical motion of a specifically designed rotor and track its polarization simultaneously by electrochemical light emission. Locally produced hydrogen bubbles at the cathodic pole of the bipolar rotor are the driving force of the motion, whereas [Ru(bpy) 3]Cl 2 and tripropylamine react at the anodic extremity, thus generating an electrochemiluminescence signal with an intensity directly correlated with the orientation of the <b>rotor</b> <b>arms.</b> This allows in a straightforward way the qualitative visualization of the changing interfacial potential differences during rotation and shows {{for the first time that}} light emission can be coupled to autonomously rotating bipolar electrodes...|$|R
5000|$|A {{distributor}} {{consists of}} a rotating arm or [...] inside the distributor cap, {{on top of the}} distributor shaft, but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle (ground). The distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the camshaft on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The distributor shaft may also drive the oil pump.) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded carbon brush {{on the underside of the}} distributor cap. The metal part of the <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via high tension leads to the spark plug of each cylinder. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.|$|E

MEMS 2J was used on the VVC engine, to control the Variable Valve Control and the distributorless ignition system, which was used because there were camshaft drive belts at both ends of the engine. With the launch of the Rover 25 and Rover 45 in 1999, MEMS 3 was introduced, with twin coils and sequential injection.|$|E

40|$|Purpose-Few {{modeling}} approaches {{exist for}} cycloidal rotors {{because they are}} a prototypal technology. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to develop new models for their analysis and validation. These models were used to analyze cycloidal rotors and a helicopter that uses them instead of a tail rotor. Design/methodology/approach-Three different models were developed to study the aerodynamic response of cycloidal rotors. They are a simplified analytical model resolved algebraically; a multibody model resolved numerically; and an unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The models were validated using data coming from three different experimental sources, each with rotor spans and radii of roughly 1 m. The CFD model was used to investigate the influence of <b>rotor</b> <b>arms.</b> The efficiency and the stability of the rotor in different configurations were studied. An aeroelastic multibody simulation was used to verify the influence of flexibility on the rotor response. Findings-The analyses suggested that cycloidal rotors can increase the efficiency of a helicopter at high velocities while flexibility reduces it and may lead to instabilities. Research limitations/implications-These models do not consider the effect of boundary layer friction on the trailing vortices generated by the rotor blades. Practical implications-These models allow a four-step aerodynamic optimization procedure. First, a range of optimized configurations is obtained by the analytical model. Second, the multibody model refines that range. Third, the CFD model detects eventual problematic blade interactions. Originality/value-The models presented should serve researchers and industrials looking for a means to measure the performance of cycloidal rotors concepts. The results presented also guide an initial cycloidal rotor design...|$|R
5000|$|Sky Wing I-X18 is a {{multirotor}} with eighteen rotors {{and a pair}} of skids as landing gear, and it {{has since}} been renamed as XY-18. There are six arms in the form of letter Y extending from the center, each with three rotors. Two of the rotors are positioned {{at the end of each}} tip of the Y, and the remaining <b>rotor</b> on each <b>arm</b> is positioned halfway between the split of Y and the root of Y connecting the center. This UAV is currently under development by Xinying, and has not been formally named yet. The name Sky Wing I-X18 is given by Chinese military and aviation enthusiasts posted on various Chinese internet website, based on the tradition Xinying has named its multirotors developed in the past: for example, Sky Wing I-X6 is for hexacopter, and Sky Wing I-X8 is for octocopter, so multirotors with eighteen rotors would presumably named as Sky Wing I-X18, after the number of rotors of the UAV.

5000|$|The player {{takes the}} role of Captain Frank Hayden, an elite Delta Force {{operative}} and the former leader of Black Saber, the President's personal black bag unit. Hayden and his team are attempting to recover a briefcase nuclear bomb code named [...] "Red Mercury" [...] from terrorist mercenary Vladimir Styanovich, known by his Nom de guerre Vlady the Vicious, who is operating out of a coastal Syrian town. The team's Black Hawk is shot down immediately upon insertion, and they fight {{their way through the}} streets in pursuit of Vlady. Hayden is too late to stop Vlady from escaping via helicopter, but manages to damage the helicopter's <b>rotors</b> with small <b>arms</b> fire. Vlady, escaping over the ocean, states he is nobody's martyr, and attempts to disarm the nuke and [...] "re-evaluate". However, to his dismay, the bomb re-arms itself seconds later. Vlady leaves the bomb on the helicopter and leaps into the ocean in a futile attempt to escape the blast. The blast wave from the nuke capsizes the U.S. aircraft carrier which had been Hayden's base of operations, as well as destroying the helicopter sent to extract Hayden's team, knocking them unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|In early June 2015, the USAF Air Education and Training Command (AETC) {{issued its}} {{official}} {{report on the}} incident.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{design of a}} miniature vegetation cutter for use in minefields in southern Lebanon has been developed and the authors have evaluated its mechanical properties focusing on the stress in welded joints using the CAD software Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4. 0. The {{conceptual design}} has been developed {{in the field in}} close cooperation with field staff from MAG Lebanon. The requirements from the field specify that the cutter should have a cutting range of 80 cm, be equipped with adjustable covers, weigh less than 200 kg, be fitted to a commercial hydraulic excavator, and have the ability to cut vegetation, bushes and small trees including (olive) trees with a diameter up to 10 cm. The miniature cutter is to be manufactured in the field and fitted to a commercial hydraulic exÂ­cavaÂ­tor (Caterpillar 301. 6 C). It consists of a rotor on which eight cutting blades, alternatively chains, are attached in a helix formation. The cutter is protected by adjustable covers. When in operation, the rotor spins at 750 revolutions per minute whereby the blades cut through the shrubs and bushes in the cutterâs path. The blades are mounted in a T-shape on arms, which are fastened to the rotor by a pin joint between two brackets (each) on the <b>rotor.</b> Blades and <b>arms</b> are to be welded together, as are the brackets to the rotor. These welded joints are the primary focus of the report. 3 D CAD models have been created and analysed in PTC Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4. 0 to ascertain that the stress in the joints will not exceed the yield strength of the weld consumables, which should be 500 MPa. Ideally, the stress in the joints would be half the yield strength. Type of bearings and a hydraulic motor have been selected for the cutter. Based on the specificaÂ­tions of the hydraulic motor an approximation of the forces acting on the weld joints {{in the case of an}} accidental stop (e. g. collision with a rock) has been calculated, and entered into the CAD software. Also, an approximation of the size (diameter) of branches the cutter would be able to tear apart in the case of branches getting stuck has been calculated and shown to be about 14. 6 mm. Based on this, it is estimated that the cutter should be used only in areas where the shrubbery is of 20 - 30 mm in diameter, maximum. Considering this, and the relative light weight of the cutter, it is not likely that the cutter will be able to cut through the larger olive trees as requested, but it is considered that the tool still could be a valuable asset for mine clearing in Lebanon. In order to cut through thicker trees, it would be necessary to increase the power supply to the cutting system as well as the sturdiness of the cutting parts. Finding the required power and technical solutions for this demands further research which does not fit within the time frame for this report. A preliminary weight approximation shows that the cutter will weigh roughly 170 kg, which falls below the limit of 200 kg and leaving some room for the bearings to be added. The results from the stress analyses show that the stress in the welded joints falls well below the yield limit of 500 MPa, but not below 250 MPa. Still, the stress in all the welded joints is shown to be less than 300 MPa or at 40 % of the limit, which may still be acceptable. The end user will have to decide whether this is an acceptable safety margin before manufacturing the cutter and if it is not, measures will need to be taken to reinforce the weld joints and try to minimise the stress concentration in them...|$|R

40|$|Unit 5 at Ohau A {{power station}} has been closely {{monitored}} since 2002 following {{the identification of}} a defect in a construction weld of one rotor spider arm. In 2003 {{it was determined that}} the defect, initially identified in 1996, was beginning to grow and there was evidence of further defects developing. By the end of 2005, after substantial analysis, risk studies and the discovery of a further 18 defects, the unit was removed from service to effect a <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> replacement. The following paper covers the four years of condition monitoring, defect analysis and risk studies that were carried out on the rotor spider prior to the complex physical works of replacing a rotor spider arm. The paper will also cover, in brief, the physical works carried out during the <b>rotor</b> <b>arm</b> replacement. This work highlights the benefits of routine engineering assessments and the use of non destructive testing methods in assessing critical defects. 1. Meridian Energy Assets Meridian Energy is the largest state owned electricity generator in New Zealand. It owns and operates nine hydro stations in the South Island, New Zealand's largest wind farm in the North Island, and a wind turbine in Wellington. The hydro assets are broken up in to the Waitaki Valley and Manapouri. The Waitaki scheme consists of eight power stations containing 32 generating units ranging in size from 15 MW to 90 MW. The Manapouri scheme consists of one station and seven 135 MVA units. Hydro units generate electricity by harnessing the gravitational potential energy available from the water. The water flows down to the turbine via the penstock and into the scroll case. The turbine runner is located in the centre of the scroll case in a circle of guide vanes and wicket gates that direct and control flow to the runner to vary the output power. The runner is connected to the generator rotor via the main shaft rotating a set of electromagnets within the stator to generate electricity. 1. 1.

40|$|The {{experiment}} proposed aims {{to evidence}} and {{to measure the}} deflection of light rays induced by the source speed upon emission, and to discern it from the aberration of light rays induced by the observer speed. The method stands in creating a speed asymmetry between that of the source {{and that of the}} observer, and relies on the centrifugation of a light source at ultrahigh speed. When source and observer have the same speed, such as when being both on the same inertial system, the deflection and the aberration compensate and their net effect is null. So, in order to circumscribe the odds of inertial systems and to isolate these speed-induced effects it has instead been appealed to a centrifugal system, since it allows infringing symmetry between the source and the observer speeds. Three cases are considered. (a) Centrifugation of the source fixed {{at one end of the}} <b>rotor</b> <b>arm,</b> while the detector is fixed on the rotor axis. This configuration of the experiment aims to unveil that due to the peripheral speed of the source the beam is deflected forward, so it impinges on the centric detector slightly shifted from its position when the system was not rotating. (b) The positions of the source and the detector are interchanged, so the source peripheral speed is then null and thus no speed-induced deflection ensues, but due to the observer peripheral speed there is a speed-induced aberration since during the beam time-of-flight the detector has slightly moved side-way. However, this time the spot shifts in opposite direction and hence the effect of centrifugation is not reciprocal. (c) The source and the detector are fixed at the two ends of the rotor arms. In this case the beam deflection and aberration add, since their speed vectors have opposite directions and each shift of the spot on the detector is double since the time-of-flight is double.
