In the present experiment, 11 vegetable protein meals and cakes used in ruminant nutrition were included with a main focus on determining various nitrogen (N) fractions in vitro. Total N (N ×  6. 25) content varied from 22. 98 % (mahua cake) to 65. 16 % (maize gluten meal), respectively. Guar meal korma contained the lowest and <b>rice</b> <b>gluten</b> meal {{had the highest}} acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN; N ×  6. 25). Borate-phosphate insoluble N (BIN, N ×  6. 25) and Streptomyces griseus protease insoluble N (PIN; N ×  6. 25) were higher (P <  0. 01) in maize gluten meal than in other feeds, whereas groundnut cake and sunflower cake had lower (P <  0. 01) BIN, and PIN, respectively. Available N, calculated {{with the assumption that}} ADIN is indigestible, was maximum in guar meal korma and minimum in <b>rice</b> <b>gluten</b> meal. Furthermore, rapid and slowly degradable N (N ×  6. 25) was found to be higher (P <  0. 01) in groundnut cake and coconut cake, respectively. Intestinal digestion of rumen undegradable protein, expressed as percent of PIN, was maximum in guar meal korma and minimum in <b>rice</b> <b>gluten</b> meal.

40|$|Objective This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of isonitrogenous replacement of groundnut cake (GNC) by <b>rice</b> <b>gluten</b> meal (RGM) and maize gluten meal (MGM) at 75 % level on nutrient intake, apparent digestibility, growth performance and related blood constituents in growing Sahiwal cattle. Methods Eighteen Sahiwal calves were divided into three groups, based on average body weight (87. 24 kg) and age (6 to 12 mo), and treatments {{were assigned to the}} different groups randomly. The first group (GP-I) was kept as control and received GNC-based concentrate mixture. In second (GP-II) and third (GP-III) groups, 750 g/kg nitrogen (N) of GNC was substituted by RGM and MGM respectively, with similar forage:concentrate ratio (56 : 44). Results The 90 days of experimental feeding revealed that intake of dry matter, crude protein and digestibility coefficients for all nutrients did not differ among groups. Furthermore, although N balance was greater (p≤ 0. 05) for GP-III than GP-I and GP-II, average daily gain was similar between GP-I and GP-II but greater (p≤ 0. 05) for GP-III. In addition, feed efficiency and related haematological variables did not differ due to treatments. Conclusion Nutritional worth of GNC and RGM was highly comparable in terms of intake, digestibility and growth in growing calves.

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of pet animal death and health problems have revealed pet food contaminated by melamine and cyanuric acid. 1 When present together, melamine and cyanuric acid form an insoluble crystal matrix that may cause kidney function failure. 2 In addition, since con-taminated wheat <b>gluten,</b> <b>rice</b> protein concentrate, and corn gluten used in animal feed can be {{also used in}} human food such as bread, pasta, baby food, etc., {{it is crucial to}} monitor for the presence of melamine and cyanuric acid in raw materials as well as in suspicious animal tissue. Current methods for quantitative determination of melamine and cyanuric acid include gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). GC-MS requires derivatization which is labor intensive and the reported LC-MS meth-ods generally involve a long gradient chromatographic run as well as column clean up. This presentation introduces a sensitive, simple, and high-throughput method for simultaneous determination of melamine and cyanuric acid by LC-MS and uses stable isotope labeled internal standard (ISTD) for quantification. Analytes were retained and separated on a recently developed Mixed-Mode WAX- 1 column 3 which demonstrates the unique selectivity and retention offered by mixed hydrophobic and ion exchange retention mechanisms. Chromatographic run time was significantly reduced to 8 min. and MS detection was applied to ensure selectivity and sensitivity. Excellent linearities with R 2 > 0. 9995 through a range of 2 – 200 ng/mL were achieved for both analytes. Method detection limits (MDL) were estimated to be 3. 97 ng/mL for melamine and 3. 32 ng/mL for cyanuric acid. The reliability of this method was evaluated against pet food extracts as well as biological matrices: pork and fish tissue extractions. Pet food samples were prepared by a fast, simple, and automated extraction pro-cess (results will be presented elsewhere). And biological samples were obtained from the U. S.

40|$|Bread {{is the one}} of {{the oldest}} {{processed}} foods and a major wheat based product. The basic process involves mixing of ingredients until the flour is converted into dough, followed by baking the dough into a loaf. A very important step in breadmaking is to know how to make good quality dough. However, the increasing knowledge of people being diagnosed with celiac disease (gluten intolerance) has encouraged scientists to develop healthier and better quality gluten-free products that would greatly {{improve the quality of life}} of celiac patients. The main objective of this study was to create a dough system composed of mainly maize proteins that would be able to reproduce same rheological properties as wheat gluten in breadmaking. The dough composites were made of Zein + co-protein + starch and were mixed at 25 °C and 35 °C. Three types of starches (corn, wheat, and rice) were used to better understand the interaction between starch and the proteins. Also, four different co-proteins (casein, sodium caseinate, gliadin and glutenin) were added to the system to determine the effect in zein functionality and its contribution to the viscoelastic dough system. Each sample was subjected to frequency test in a DHR- 3 Rheometer and to lubricated squeezing flow test in order to determine the rheological properties of each dough sample such as phase angle (delta), complex modulus (G*), and extensional viscosity (μ b). Moreover the glass transition temperatures of the different protein + starch samples were analyzed using the oscillatory squeezing flow technique. In small and large deformation tests, rice starch doughs showed similar or slightly improved rheological properties when compared to <b>gluten.</b> <b>Rice</b> starch doughs also showed a lower glass transition temperature than gluten doughs when mixed at both temperatures when tested under OSF method. Overall, not only protein plays an important role when making bread dough. Similar wheat flour dough properties can be obtained with corn and rice starch when mixed with zein and other co-proteins at 35 °C. The glass transition temperature plays an important role in determining zein 2 ̆ 7 s behavior in a dough system. Addition of co-protein showed to have an effect in dough formation when zein becomes more mobile at 35 °C. ...|$|R
