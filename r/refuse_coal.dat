40|$|AbstractCoal <b>refuse,</b> from <b>coal</b> {{mining and}} coal processing, {{is the most}} {{important}} source of coal mine. Based on the analysis of the contamination and its migration, some countermeasures on the control of contamination in situ were put forward. The research showed that: the contamination of <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> was mainly due to the existence {{of a large number of}} pollutants, open-air dumps, oxidation, acidification and spontaneous combustion, and its pollution migration mainly through wind and water. In-situ control of <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> pollution is the most effective means because <b>coal</b> <b>refuses</b> piled up and the presence of large quantities of pollutants. Slurry ejection, adding some inhibiting materials to inhibit oxidation (selective bactericide, reducing bacteria, alkaline material) and surface coverage are appropriate control measures in situ.

To activate <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> is one practical solution to recycle this huge amount of solid waste as substitute for Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). The central goal of this project is to investigate and develop a new silica-alumina based cementitious material largely using <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> as a constituent that will be ideal for durable construction, mine backfill, mine sealing and waste disposal stabilization applications. This new material is an environment-friendly alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement. The main constituents of the new material are <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> and other <b>coal</b> wastes including coal sludge and coal combustion products (CCPs). Compared with conventional cement production, successful development of this new technology could potentially save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, recycle vast amount of coal wastes, and significantly reduce production cost.

40|$|Today, <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> as {{industrial}} {{solid waste}} stockpiled {{on the ground}} {{is one of the greatest}} threats to the environment. One of the practical solutions to utilize this huge amount of solid waste is to activate the <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> and utilize it as substitution for portion of ordinary Portland cement. The key purpose of activation is to enhance the pozzolanic property of the <b>coal</b> <b>refuse.</b> Many scientists and engineers found that thermal activation is a practical approach on increasing pozzolanic property. For thermal activation, temperature and time are two important parameters which significantly determine the activation effect. In this paper, a systematic research has been conducted to seek for anoptimal solution for enhancing pozzolanic reactivity of the relatively inert solid waste-coal refuse in order to improve the utilization efficiency and economy benefit forconstruction and building materials. The mechanical property analysis shows that coal refusethat activated at 700 °C to 800 °C with 1 hour to 1. 5 hours has much higher reactivity when compared with <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> activated at 500 °C to 600 °C with 1 hour to 1. 5 hours.

40|$|In {{the initial}} period of Taiwan's restoration, the coal was an {{important}} energy resource in Taiwan. There were many abandoned collieries {{in all parts of}} Taiwan. Majority of abandoned <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> banks had not been restored with proper treatment exploitation. The mining sites belong to acid sulfate soils zone. It is difficult to carry out revegetation. Only M. floridulus could be invade and grow at these sites. The erosion of the bared grounds was sources of all sorts of problems for landscape, environmental, ecological, soil and water conservation. This paper is to investigate the problems of soil and water conservation for the abandoned <b>coal</b> <b>refuses</b> bank at <b>coal</b> mine in Miaoli County.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a pilot {{process for the}} comprehensive utilization of <b>coal</b> <b>refuse.</b> During the process, alumina was first extracted from <b>coal</b> <b>refuse,</b> the residue was then used to calcine cement clinker, {{and all of the}} waste gases and water were recovered and re-used in the process of alumina extraction. During the first process, the appropriate temperature regimen and temperature distribution were determined based on laboratory results in a tunnel kiln, and were optimized during the pilot process. The most important step of the temperature regimen is the increasing rate within the temperature range of 500 – 600 °C. And the last determined temperature regimen is suitable {{to be used in the}} other industrial kiln when the other processes are applied for the extraction of alumina from <b>coal</b> <b>refuse.</b> The extraction rate for alumina has also been investigated in the pilot tests, and it is a bit lower than those obtained in the laboratory tests.

40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{potential}} {{on the growth}} of two strains of Thiobacillus ferroxidans was determined by adding defined amounts of sodium chloride or glycerol to the culture medium. The two strains differed slightly, and the most tolerant strain had a minimum water potential for growth of - 15 to - 32 bars when sodium chloride was used and - 6 bars when glycerol was used. In another approach, the limiting water potential was determined by equilibrating small amounts of culture medium with atmospheres of relative humidities equivalent to specific water potentials, {{and the ability of}} the organism to grow and oxidize ferrous iron was determined. Under these conditions, which are analogous to those which might control water potential in a <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> pile or copper leaching dump, the lower limit at which iron oxidation occurred was - 23 bars. The water potential of some <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> materials in which T. ferrooxidans was present were determined, and {{it was found that the}} water potentials at which the organism was active in these habitats were similar to those at which it was able to grow in culture. However, marked variation in water potential of <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> materials was found, presumably due to differences in clays and organic materials, and some <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> materials would probably never have water potentials at which the organism could grow. Some literature on the water potentials in copper leach dumps is reviewed, and it is concluded that control of water potential is essential to maximize the success of leaching operations. Because adequate drainage is necessary in a leach dump to ensure sufficient aeration, in many cases water availability in leach dumps may restrict the development of the bacterium necessary for the process...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for mobilization of SO 4 and Cl from coal stockpiles and coal processing waste and refuse (waste rock) disposal areas to the receiving streams and groundwater is an environmental concern and proper management practices {{are necessary to}} minimize {{the impact of these}} discharges. In an effort to characterize the long-term environmental impact of weathering in from both a typical coal stockpile and coal waste disposal areas a series of laboratory- scale and field-scale kinetic tests were performed with the ultimate goal of improving both coal and coal waste management at coal mines in a manner that minimizes the discharge of sulfate (SO 4) and chloride (Cl). Laboratory experiments demonstrated that kinetic testing is a productive method for understanding the chemistry of surface water discharges from coal stock piles. However, these tests proved to be problematic in simulating the weathering of <b>coal</b> <b>refuse.</b> In an effort to improve the kinetic tests, field test columns were constructed that eliminated this deficiency. Unfortunately, field-scale test columns were found to be difficult to construct and, due to extremes weather events, difficult to maintain for an adequate test period. In the course of the experiment elemental and mineralogical data were collected both before and after weathering of fresh, run-of-mine coal from the Springfield (No. 5) coal seam and <b>coal</b> <b>refuse</b> samples from processing the Springfield (No. 5) and Herrin (No. 6) coal seams. Duplicate columns were constructed in 2008 to conduct kinetic testing of the fresh run-of-mine No. 5 coal collected at an active underground mine in Southeastern Illinois.
