5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and <b>reeds</b> by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll <b>reeds</b> with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The <b>reeds</b> can be viewed as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal.

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled <b>reeds</b> before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the <b>reeds</b> and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the <b>reeds</b> had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Raised bogs {{are most}} common in the Shannon basin. They formed when {{depressions}} left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes.

5000|$|Harrison <b>Reed</b> (August 26, 1813 - May 25, 1899) was {{the ninth}} Governor of Florida. <b>Reed</b> {{was born in}} Littleton, Massachusetts, on August 26, 1813, to parents Seth <b>Reed</b> (1781-1848) and Rhoda Finney <b>Reed</b> (1781-1874). The <b>Reed</b> family came to Milwaukee in 1836. Harrison was one of eight <b>Reed</b> children. His {{brothers}} were Herbert <b>Reed,</b> a Milwaukee grocer who married Phebe Adeline Brisbane, Orson <b>Reed</b> of Summit, Wisconsin who married Agnes Fairservice (listed as Faissenice on the marriage certificate), Curtis <b>Reed</b> and George <b>Reed.</b> His sister, Mary Augusta <b>Reed</b> Smith (1811-1866) married Judge Abram Daniel Smith (1811-1865). His sister, Martha <b>Reed</b> Mitchell (1817-1902) married banker and railroad tycoon, Alexander Mitchell (1817-1887). His sister Julia Ann <b>Reed</b> Noyes, married Dr. Thomas J.

5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from <b>reeds</b> and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E
5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. A {{large proportion of}} the whole day is spent on feeding and vigilance. They can easily camouflage in grasses and <b>reeds,</b> and hide themselves rather than running from danger. When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the threat is close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Hawkes & Son (later Rivière & Hawkes), a rival to Boosey & Company, {{was founded}} in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral sheet music. The company also made musical {{instruments}} and spare parts such as clarinet <b>reeds,</b> and by 1925 Hawkes had set up an instrument factory in Edgware, North London. The business, which was particularly known for brass and military band music, was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes (1898–1950).|$|E

5|$|Its {{distribution}} is now restricted to Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, but it previously ranged northward into Minas Gerais, Brazil, and southward into eastern Argentina. The Argentine form {{may have been}} distinct from the living form from Brazil and Uruguay. L.molitor is a large rodent, with the head and body length averaging , characterized by a long tail, large hindfeet, and long and dense fur.

5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among <b>reeds</b> while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E

5|$|Russian olive and {{tamarisk}} or salt cedar trees now {{dominate the}} Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would {{once have been}} found. Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other <b>reeds</b> are still found in small pockets along the river.
