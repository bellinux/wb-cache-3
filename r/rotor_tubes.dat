Based on the {{advantages}} of polymer materials over other materials, rotors which are made of the polymer material, are the functional elements of the rotor-assembled strand, and rotate under certain mass flow rate to obtain heat transfer enhancement and online automatic cleaning. The paper carried out numerical studies on heat transfer and friction loss characteristics of the <b>tube</b> fitted with <b>rotors</b> of different spaces. The comparison of the field synergy angle between plain tube and the <b>tube</b> fitted with <b>rotors</b> was also presented in the paper. The numerical data had good agreement with the experimental data. The numerical studies indicated that the field synergy angle of the <b>rotors</b> inserted <b>tube</b> were significantly smaller {{than that of the}} plain tube, which validated that the rotors could significantly enhance heat transfer process and had a better comprehensive performance of heat transfer enhancement though extra friction loss was generated. In addition, both the Nusselt number and friction factor of the <b>tube</b> fitted with <b>rotors</b> increased with the increasing space between rotors; the thermal performance factor of the rotors were all higher than 1, which validated the heat transfer enhancement function of the rotors; meanwhile, the thermal performance factor increased with the space between rotors...|$|R

In essence, the novel topology consists of a hollow <b>tube</b> <b>rotor</b> coupled to a secondary nonrotating shaft located concentrically within the primary rotor. The two shafts are linked via a number of actively managed magnetic couplings. The topology is provided, along with an analysis comparing the out-of-balance vibration response of the proposed rotor to a comparable simple passive rotor. Designs for a test rig based on this topology are presented, together with an outline of anticipated testing and development of the idea. Special consideration is given to the design of the magnetic bearings, which form the system couplings. An internal-stator homopolar bearing design fabricated from Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC) is presented.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 99 - 104) Despite {{the popularity}} of tube-format density gradient centrifugation {{and the increase in}} the numbers of tubes that may be accommodated by the newer rotors available, the problem still persists of efficiently producing identical density gradients for each tube position. This problem has been compounded with the emergence of "vertical tube rotors" - the most recent development and innovation in centrifugal methodology. A number of solutions have been proposed to attack the problem of multiple gradient production and several of these are examined and evaluated in this work. Most successful and particularly useful is an approach in which a system of plungers incorporated into the design of a vertical <b>tube</b> <b>rotor</b> is used to apportion a single stream of gradient among the rotor's chambers. A similar approach is taken to empty (either in concert or in sequence) the gradient (and separated particles) when centrifugation is completed. The apparatus produces gradients in short order and with exceptional uniformity. Rotor performance was analyzed using biological and model test systems...|$|R

The developed model includes a teetering hub, containing a flexure and torque <b>tube,</b> <b>rotor</b> blades, pitch links, and swashplate system. A non-teetering rotor configuration, which modified the baseline teetering rotor by removing the teetering hinge, is also developed, and its aeromechanics characteristics compared to those of the baseline teetering design. The rotor aeroelastic responses and loads are studied under various flight conditions including the conversion flights. The rotor natural frequencies are calculated for two blade pitch angles, which represents respectively the rotor operating in helicopter and airplane modes. The MBDyn predictions of aerodynamics loading of the teetering rotor are compared with those of OVERFLOW in both helicopter and airplane modes. The comparison shows overall good agreements. The blade responses and loads in conversion flight are then compared between the baseline teetering rotor and the modified non-teetering version. Similar aeromechanical characteristics are shown for the two rotor configurations, such as the blade response, steady hub loads, and steady and oscillatory blade shear forces. However, the non-teetering rotor displays a much larger blade bending moments, both the mean and oscillatory components. Overall, the study shows that the multibody analysis has the capability to model complex rotor configurations, and helpful in establishing the requirement and criteria applied to VTOL proprotor load analysis in supporting the aircraft design...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{commercial}} 3 D Navier-Stokes CFD-solver Ansys CFX {{was used to}} investigate the flow through a horizontal shaft bulb turbine in a stationary and transient way. The draft tube {{is one of the}} most critical parts for the performance of bulb turbines and highly influences the efficiency of the whole configuration with a level of several percent of the total efficiency. A calculation of the existing situation was the basis for a modification and adaptation of the draft tube geometry to realize a shorter machine construction and also to compare the results with hydraulic model tests from a closed loop turbine test stand. For all influences on the draft <b>tube</b> <b>rotor</b> stator effects are decisive – in reality as well as in numerical simulations. In a first part, several modifications were analyzed, e. g. inlet variations, as those cause different space requirements of the generator as far as the flow rate is concerned, the operating points differ more than 300 %. For the flow through the runner the meridional velocity was analyzed on 5 different planes around the runner. In front and also after the runner the flow over the radius was nearly on an equal level – this means that the hydraulic is good and that no fluid transport in radial direction is needed. In a second part, an investigation of different influences of rotor stator interactions was carried out, based on a large full 360 °-model of the whole machine configuration of this 3 -blade runner and 16 guide vane turbine. The simulations were done after tests with different grids, turbulence models, grid interfaces and settings.

40|$|Authors: Edward Hutchinson & Ervin Fodor ### Abstract It {{is often}} useful to {{concentrate}} and purify the pleomorphic, enveloped virions of influenza viruses prior to analysis. This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 <b>rotor</b> (polyallomer centrifuge <b>tubes,</b> 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 <b>rotor</b> (polyallomer centrifuge <b>tubes,</b> 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 swinging bucket rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 swinging bucket rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the buckets (with the lids on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion and refrigerate for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second tube to balance. Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the balance tube as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient tube and a balance tube into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the tube and a balance tube in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, mixing, changing pipette tip and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.
