Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.|$|E
5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but at a lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice <b>range</b> <b>based</b> on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} Paraceratherium {{appears to have}} varied across its <b>range,</b> <b>based</b> on the types of {{geological}} formations {{it has been found}} in. The Hsanda Gol Formation of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin, and the environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover, as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground. A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland, with plants such as saltbush, mormon tea (Ephedra), and nitre bush (Nitraria), all adapted to arid environments. Trees were rare, and concentrated near groundwater. The parts of China where Paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes, and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert-adapted Palibinia. Trees in Mongolia and China included birch, elm, oaks, and other deciduous trees, while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees. Dera Bugti in Pakistan had dry, temperate to subtropical forest.|$|E

This paper proposes new soft-decision ranging techniques with low complexity for wideband localization. The proposed techniques adopt range likelihood functions obtained from a reduced dataset of the received waveform samples.

[...] The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or [...] "black out mask" [...] so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage. Other sports, like athletics, are open to athletes {{with a wide variety}} of impairments.

The diversity of Death Valley's plant communities results partly from the region's location in a transition zone between the Mojave Desert, the Great Basin Desert and the Sonoran Desert. This location, combined with the great relief found within the Park, supports vegetation typical of three biotic life zones: the lower Sonoran, the Canadian, and the Arctic/Alpine in portions of the Panamint <b>Range.</b> <b>Based</b> on the Munz and Keck (1968) classifications, seven plant communities can be categorized within these life zones, each characterized by dominant vegetation and representative of three vegetation types: scrub, desert woodland, and coniferous forest.
