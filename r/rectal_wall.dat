25|$|Intussusceptum {{refers to}} the {{proximal}} section of <b>rectal</b> <b>wall,</b> which telescopes into the lumen of the distal section of rectum (termed the intussuscipiens). What results is 3 layers of <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> overlaid. From the lumen outwards, the first layer is the proximal wall of the intussusceptum, the middle is {{the wall of the}} intussusceptum folded back on itself, and the outer is the distal <b>rectal</b> <b>wall,</b> the intussuscipiens.|$|E
25|$|Patients with solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} {{combined with}} internal intussusception (as 94% of SRUS patients have) {{were shown to}} have altered <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> biomechanics {{compared to patients with}} internal intussusception alone. The presumed mechanism of the obstructed defecation is by telescoping of the intussusceptum, occluding the rectal lumen during attempted defecation. One study analysed resected <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with rectal intussusception undergoing stapled trans-anal rectal resection. They reported abnormalities of the enteric nervous system and estrogen receptors. One study concluded that intussusception of the anterior <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> shares the same cause as rectocele, namely deficient recto-vaginal ligamentous support.|$|E
25|$|Pathological {{specimens}} of sections of <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> taken from SRUS patients show thickening and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue and excess collagen. Rarely, SRUS can present as polyps in the rectum.|$|E
50|$|The rectum {{acts as a}} {{temporary}} storage site for feces. As the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> expand due to the materials filling it from within, stretch receptors from the nervous system located in the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> stimulate the desire to defecate. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon where more water is absorbed from the feces. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period, constipation and hardened feces results.|$|R
50|$|The rectum ampulla (anatomically also: ampulla recti) {{temporarily}} stores fecal waste. As {{the waste}} fills the rectum and expands the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls,</b> nervous system stretch receptors in the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> stimulate {{the desire to}} defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal muscles, relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the faeces is stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, diarrhea may occur.|$|R
2500|$|The {{site of the}} ulcer is {{typically}} on the anterior <b>wall</b> of the <b>rectal</b> ampulla, about 7–10cm from the anus. However, the area may of ulceration may {{be closer to the}} anus, deeper inside, or on the lateral or posterior <b>rectal</b> <b>walls.</b> The name [...] "solitary" [...] can be misleading since there may be more than one ulcer present. Furthermore, there is a [...] "preulcerative phase" [...] where there is no ulcer at all.|$|R
25|$|Internal rectal {{intussusception}} (rectal intussusception, internal intussusception, internal rectal prolapse, occult rectal prolapse, internal rectal procidentia and rectal invagination) is {{a medical}} condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> that can occur during defecation.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{external}} rectal prolapse, internal rectal intussusception is {{not visible}} externally, {{but it may}} still be diagnosed by digital rectal examination, while the patient strains as if to defecate. Imaging such as a defecating proctogram or dynamic MRI defecography can demonstrate the abnormal folding of the <b>rectal</b> <b>wall.</b> Some have advocated the use of anorectal physiology testing (anorectal manometry).|$|E
25|$|As with {{external}} rectal prolapse, {{there are a}} great many different surgical interventions described. Generally, a section of <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> can be resected (removed), or the rectum can be fixed (rectopexy) to its original position against the sacral vertebrae, or a combination of both methods. Surgery for internal rectal prolapse can be via the abdominal approach or the transanal approach.|$|E
2500|$|FI can {{be divided}} into those people who {{experience}} a defecation urge before leakage (urge incontinence), and those who experience no sensation before leakage (passive incontinence or soiling). Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden need to defecate, with little time to reach a toilet. Urge and passive FI may be associated with weakness of the external anal sphincter (EAS) and internal anal sphincter (IAS) respectively. [...] Urgency may also be associated with reduced rectal volume, reduced ability of the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> to distend and accommodate stool, and increased rectal sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|The IAS {{contributes}} 55% of the resting {{pressure of}} the anal canal. It {{is very important for}} bowel continence, especially for liquid and gas. When the rectum fills beyond a certain capacity, the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> are distended, triggering the defecation cycle. This begins with the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, RAIR, where the IAS relaxes. This is thought to allow a small amount of rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where specialized mucosa samples whether it is gas, liquid or solid. Problems with the IAS often present as degrees of fecal incontinence (especially partial incontinence to liquid) or mucous rectal discharge.|$|R
40|$|Background: Natural orifice translumenal {{endoscopic}} surgery (NOTES) is a minimally invasive operation using {{devices such as}} flexible endoscopes and linear or circular staplers. Nevertheless, hand-sewn anastomosis in NOTES remains challenging. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of transrectal robotic NOTES requiring intracorporeal small intestinal anastomosis and closure of the <b>rectal</b> anterior <b>wall</b> incision in a relevant human model. Methods: The authors developed a flexible rectal proctoscope with a diameter of 43  mm for transrectal robotic NOTES. Small intestinal anastomosis was performed in a porcine intestinal transrectal NOTES model using two robotic arms and a camera inserted through the proctoscope and a <b>rectal</b> anterior <b>wall</b> incision. The quality of transrectal small intestinal anastomosis using the da Vinci surgical system (transrectal robotic NOTES group) was {{compared with that of}} transabdominal anastomosis using the da Vinci surgical system (transabdominal robot-assisted surgery group) and transrectal anastomosis using traditional transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) instruments (TEM NOTES group). The quality of transrectal <b>rectal</b> anterior <b>wall</b> suturing in the transrectal robotic NOTES group was compared with that of the TEM NOTES group and the open surgical instruments group (open group). Results: Robotic intracorporeal suturing was performed successfully in the porcine intestine model. During small intestinal anastomosis, burst pressure in the transrectal robotic NOTES group (67. 7  ±  29. 3  mmHg) was similar to that in the transabdominal robot-assisted surgery group (73. 3  ±  18. 2  mmHg) but significantly higher than in the TEM NOTES group (20. 3  ±  24. 0  mmHg; p <  0. 01). During <b>rectal</b> anterior <b>wall</b> suturing, the burst pressure did not differ significantly between the transrectal robotic NOTES group (149. 9  ±  81. 1  mmHg) and the open group (195. 0  ±  60. 5  mmHg). Conclusions: The preliminary safety and efficacy of transrectal robotic NOTES was established. Further studies are required to determine the practical feasibility of this procedure. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. in Pres...|$|R
25|$|Rectal mucosal {{prolapse}} (mucosal prolapse, anal mucosal prolapse) is a {{sub-type of}} rectal prolapse, and refers to abnormal descent of the rectal mucosa through the anus. It is different {{to an internal}} intussusception (occult prolapse) or a complete rectal prolapse (external prolapse, procidentia) because these conditions involve the full thickness of the <b>rectal</b> <b>wall,</b> rather than only the mucosa (lining).|$|E
25|$|Rectal {{prolapse}} {{often used}} to mean complete rectal prolapse (external rectal prolapse), where the rectal walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally, and if the full or only partial thickness of the <b>rectal</b> <b>wall</b> is involved.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} (partial rectal mucosal prolapse) {{refers to}} prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal {{layer of the}} <b>rectal</b> <b>wall.</b> Most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external, segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles). However, both internal mucosal prolapse (see below) and circumferential mucosal prolapse are described by some. Others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of rectal prolapse.|$|E
5000|$|Trypanosoma lewisi is a {{parasite}} of Rattus species and other rodents such as mice and kangaroo rats in America. Among these host species are two endemic species of rats: Rattus macleari, now {{believed to be}} extinct, and Rattus nativitatis. It is not very clear {{whether or not the}} same lewisi parasite infects both species. However, both parasites are very similar. The northern rat flea, Nosopsyllus fasciatus acts as the vector for the parasite, harboring the epimastigote stage in its midgut. [...] The trypomastigote is the stage that is present in the main host, the rodent. The epimastigote form attaches itself to the rectum of the insect using its flagella to burrow through the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls.</b> [...] The parasites also appear in the flea's feces. Ingestion of either the flea or its feces during grooming infects the host rodent with the parasites. T. lewisi is normally non-pathogenic but is known to have produced fatal infections in rats.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out with the purpose to {{demonstrate}} the anatomo-topographic features of rabbit vesicular glands by computed axial tomography imaging (CT). Eight sexually matured, clinically healthy male white New Zealand rabbits, 12 months of age and weighing 2. 8 - 3. 2 kg were used. CT scans of the pelvis were performed in the transverse planes from the seventh Lumbar (L 7) vertebra to the first Sacral vertebra (S 1), with a section thickness of 2 mm. The cranial border of the vesicular glands was visualized in the transverse plane between L 7 and S 1 while the caudal part of the glands was observed in scans of the pelvic inlet in the transverse plane through the caudal part of S 1. In the transverse scans of the pelvic inlet halfway S 1, the vesicular glands appeared as transversely ovoid, homogeneous and relatively hypodense structures {{as compared to the}} adjacent soft tissues. The glandular areas were relatively hypodense compared to the urethral and <b>rectal</b> <b>walls.</b> The density of the rabbit vesicular glands was that of the soft tissues, ranging from 31 ± 0. 33 HU in precontrast imaging and 78 ± 0. 33 HU in postcontrast imaging...|$|R

25|$|These {{may reveal}} {{congestion}} and edema (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa, and in 10-15% of cases {{there may be}} a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior <b>rectal</b> <b>wall.</b> Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda. Rarely, a neoplasm (tumour) may form on {{the leading edge of the}} intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention. These investigations may be used with contrast media (barium enema) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|According to Burou, the {{operation}} {{began with an}} incision from the anal area through the scrotal raphe. After dissecting of the bulbus urethrae and both corpora cavernosa, the rectum and the prostate were separated by cutting all the ligaments between the bulb and the rectum. Burou {{made a point of}} barring, but not damaging, the posterior aspect of the prostate so that the penile skin flap after invagination would immediately overlie this aspect, which he felt optimized the possibility of postoperative orgasm. The separation was extended digitally and was considered complete as soon as two fingers or a vaginal retractor could be admitted easily. Burou considered this first part of {{the operation}} to be the most important, but most risky, and stressed the importance of repeated intrarectal inspection to determine that there was no lesion to the <b>rectal</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Trypanosoma cruzi {{life cycle}} starts in an animal reservoir, usually mammals, wild or domestic, {{including}} humans. A triatomine bug {{serves as the}} vector. While taking a blood meal, it ingests T. cruzi. In the triatomine bug (Triatoma infestans) the parasite goes into the epimastigote stage, {{making it possible to}} reproduce. After reproducing through binary fission, the epimastigotes move onto the <b>rectal</b> cell <b>wall,</b> where they become infectious. Infectious T. cruzi are called metacyclic trypomastigotes. When the triatomine bug subsequently takes a blood meal from a human, it defecates. The trypomastigotes are in the feces and are capable of swimming into the host's cells using flagella, a characteristic swimming tail dominant in the Euglenoid class of protists.|$|R
2500|$|The rectum {{needs to}} be of a {{sufficient}} volume to store stool until defecation. The <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> need to be [...] "compliant" [...] i.e. able to distend to an extent to accommodate stool. Rectal sensation is required to detect the presence, nature and amount of rectal contents. The rectum must {{also be able to}} evacuate its contents fully. There must also be efficient co-ordination of rectal sensation and relaxation of the anal canal. [...] If the sensory nerves are damaged, detection of stool in the rectum is dulled or absent, and the person will not feel the need to defecate until too late. Rectal hyposensitivity may manifest as constipation, FI, or both. Rectal hyposensitivty was reported to be present in 10% of people with FI. Pudendal neuropathy is one cause of rectal hyposensitivity, and may lead to fecal loading/impaction, megarectum and overflow FI. Normal evacuation of rectal contents is 90-100%. If there is incomplete evacuation during defecation, residual stool will be left in the rectum and threaten continence once defecation is finished. This is a feature of people with soiling secondary to obstructed defecation. Obstructed defecation is often due to anismus (paradoxical contraction or relaxation failure of the puborectalis). Whilst anismus is largely a functional disorder, organic pathologic lesions may mechanically interfere with rectal evacuation. Other causes of incomplete evacuation include non-emptying defects like a rectocele. Straining to defecate pushes stool into the rectocele, which acts like a diverticulum and causes stool sequestration. Once the voluntary attempt to defecate, albeit dysfunctional, is finished, the voluntary muscles relax, and residual rectal contents are then able to descend into the anal canal and cause leaking.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the planning target volume (PTV) margin for an adaptive radiotherapy procedure that uses five computed tomography (CT) scans to calculate an average prostate position and rectum shape. To evaluate alternative methods to determine an average rectum {{based on a}} single delineation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Repeat CT scans (8 - 13) of 19 patients were used. The contoured prostates of the first four scans were matched on the planning CT (pCT) prostate contours. With the resulting translations and rotations the average prostate position was determined. An average rectum was obtained by either averaging the coordinates of corresponding points on the <b>rectal</b> <b>walls</b> or by selecting the "best" rectum or transforming the pCT rectum. Dose distributions were calculated for various expanded average prostates. The remaining CT scans were used to {{determine the}} dose received by prostate and rectum during treatment. RESULTS: For the prostate of the pCT scan and a 10 -mm margin, all patients received more than 95 % of the prescribed dose to 95 % of the prostate. For the average prostate, a margin of 7 mm was needed to obtain a similar result (average PTV reduction 30 %). The average rectum overestimated the mean dose to the rectum by 0. 4 +/- 1. 6 Gy, which was better than the pCT rectum (2. 1 +/- 3. 0 Gy) and the alternative average rectums (1. 0 +/- 2. 6 Gy and 1. 4 +/- 3. 2 Gy). CONCLUSIONS: Our adaptive procedure allows for reduction of the PTV margin to 7 mm without decreasing prostate coverage during treatment. For accurate estimation of the rectum dose, rectums need to be delineated and averaged over multiple scan...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} dosimetric parameters {{derived from}} anorectal, <b>rectal,</b> and anal <b>wall</b> dose distributions that correlate with different late gastrointestinal (GI) complications after three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this analysis, 641 patients from a randomized trial (68 Gy vs. 78 Gy) were included. Toxicity was scored with adapted Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) criteria and five specific complications. The variables derived from dose-volume histogram of anorectal, <b>rectal,</b> and anal <b>wall</b> were as follows: % receiving > or = 5 - 70 Gy (V 5 -V 70), maximum dose (Dmax), and mean dose (D(mean)). The anus {{was defined as}} the most caudal 3 cm of the anorectum. Statistics were done with multivariate Cox regression models. Median follow-up was 44 months. RESULTS: Anal dosimetric variables were associated with RTOG/EORTC Grade > or = 2 (V 5 -V 40, D(mean)) and incontinence (V 5 -V 70, D(mean)). Bleeding correlated most strongly with anorectal V 55 -V 65, and stool frequency with anorectal V 40 and D(mean). Use of steroids was weakly related to anal variables. No volume effect was seen for RTOG/EORTC Grade > or = 3 and pain/cramps/tenesmus. CONCLUSION: Different volume effects were found for various late GI complications. Therefore, to evaluate the risk of late GI toxicity, not only intermediate and high doses to the anorectal wall volume should be taken into account, but also the dose to the anal wall. status: publishe...|$|R
