40|$|Physical {{intervention}} {{is often used}} to manage incidents involving service users in mental health in-patient wards. Yet, little effort has been channelled into finding out the views of such individuals regarding the experience. This study aimed to document the experiences and perceptions (good and bad) of local mental health service users who had the experience of being restrained whilst in admission. A qualitative research approach adopting the phenomenological strategy was employed. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from five service users with seven experiences of manual restraint and who either volunteered, were contacted purposively or recruited through snowball sampling. Service users identified two contrasting moods (anger and concern) of the staff restraint team. These moods they said, determined how the procedure was carried out. Twenty nine categories of restraint team practices were identified including: non-pain compliant holds, early intervention, post incident review including debriefing, pain compliant holds, angry orders/no communication, abandoned after being restrained. The categories clustered under the six core themes that emerged from the data including: build-up to physical <b>restraint,</b> <b>power</b> imbalance, communication, staff training. The themes were discussed. One of the areas suggested for further research was how staff mood and feelings towards the person being restrained affect their practice during the process. The implications for future physical intervention training were considered...|$|E
40|$|The ADA {{definition}} of disability reflects an historical shift from defining disability within the individual (the medical model) to constructing disability {{within the social}} environment (the socio-political or interactional model). Further, this shift reveals a movement away from paternalistic to empowering rehabilitation policies and service delivery systems. Similarly, academic programs in Rehabilitation are updating their undergraduate curriculum in ways that reflect changes {{that have taken place}} in public policy and service delivery related to disability, knowledge emerging from the field of disability studies, and a changing student demographic. Disability related rehabilitation research has not yet fully reflected this shift, and this has resulted in data and knowledge that are of limited utility. It has been well researched that negative attitudes toward individuals with disabilities held by rehabilitation professionals will limit the scope of services generated and provided by professionals and, ultimately, have a detrimental effect on a successful rehabilitation process. Knowledge about the ways that undergraduate students conceptualize disability may illuminate the content and origin of positive and negative attitudes and beliefs. The present study was a phenomenological examination of the framework students employed in conceptualizing, understanding and making meaning of the concept of disability. The study utilized in-depth interviews and students' course assignments in order to answer the question, "How do undergraduate students in disability related majors construct disability?" Data revealed six common themes which were: participants had difficulty defining the category of disability; disability was understood as an individual problem, requiring special accommodations, assistance and services; there was an altruistic desire among participants to challenge stereotypes surrounding disability, alongside limited self-awareness of the application of stereotypes in their own construction of disability; the meaning of disability was a reflection of participants' own identities; Concepts of opportunity, <b>restraint,</b> <b>power</b> and privilege had limited relationship with disability; and, motivation for professional practice was related to a desire to help those who need assistance. Suggestions were made relating to the undergraduate curriculum and future research...|$|E

Unfortunately that responsibility is very widely misunderstood, misunderstood, largely by the popular use and misuse of terms which are not applicable, and it is not sufficiently recognised that the court’s sole function is to interpret a constitutional description of <b>power</b> or <b>restraint</b> upon <b>power</b> and say whether a given measure falls on one side of a line consequently drawn or on the other, and that {{it has nothing to do}} with the merits or demerits of the measure.|$|R
