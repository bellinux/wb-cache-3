He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War in 1989, the US {{government}} conducted careful <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> national {{priorities and}} of the defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located to act as a base for mobilization and power projection into the Pacific region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was downsizing, Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the economy, causing {{the collapse of}} {{a large part of the}} heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> the restaurant chain {{in the late}} 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize the look and feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major industrial city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching <b>restructuring</b> <b>of</b> steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E
