40|$|This senior {{design project}} is {{sponsored}} by Newport News Shipbuilding. The objective of this project is to design a pipe hanger system that could be installed during initial fabrication while still allowing adjustment when the pipe path deviates from the initial drawings. The design must be cheap and utilize already existing parts. One key constraint is to hold a load of 250 pounds and withstand a velocity between 100 - 120 inches per second. The original design created utilizes a C-channel track attached to the ceiling and a spring locking mechanism to provide flexibility. This final design eliminated the spring device with a nut and <b>rod</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism and a threaded rod between the C-channel track and the marine style pipe hanger. This design was tested against the constraints given by NNS, using the program ANSYs workbench. The design {{was found to be}} able to withstand 100 - 120 inches per second velocity without faltering. The design was found to be able to withstand up to 6014 psi. Once the computer testing was complete, the total cost was calculated. This was estimated originally at a range of $ 50 - $ 60. The end price was calculated at $ 90, this was without the track. For the constraint of a cheap product to be achieved, the design will need to be altered to use either cheaper materials, cheaper tools, or cheaper components. [URL]...|$|R

Some have a fine radius adjustment. The threaded adjustment {{is similar to that}} of a Screw. The only limitation is the rigidity of the wood beam or metal rod being used. Longer wooden beams tend to sag depending on the species of wood used. Metal rods can be used as an alternative, but they also have length limitations. Some trammel sets include a support roller for attachment at mid span of the beam or rod, to take out the sag. Trammel points score a precise line by using a sharpened point, or draw a line using a lead clutch, or an ink nib. When the circular knob is turned, it micro adjusts the radius of the circle. On some, a spring and screw mechanism locks the compass at the precise desired location. Turning clockwise decreases the radius while turning counterclockwise increases the radius slightly.|$|R

Swing out cylinders quickly caught on, because they combined the best features of earlier designs. Top-break actions gave the ability to eject all empty shells simultaneously, and exposed all chambers for easy reloading, but having the frame hinged into two halves weakened the gun and negatively affected accuracy, due to lack of rigidity. [...] "Side-loaders", like the earlier Colt Model 1871 and 1873, gave a rigid frame, but required the user to eject and load one cylinder at a time, as they rotated the cylinder to line each chamber up with the side-mounted loading gate.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. Development {{and testing}} of a new spinal implant-locking {{mechanism}} based on the special properties of nickel-titanium alloy. OBJECTIVE. To develop a new self-tightening locking mechanism to reduce fretting corrosion at implant junctions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. All current implant locking involves tightening of a nut against the rod and screw head to form a coupling. Particulate debris is generated, and the coupling becomes loose because of wear between the <b>rod</b> and <b>locking</b> mechanism (fretting). To avoid this fretting, a new locking mechanism with an automatic retightening effect based on the superelastic and shape-memory properties of nickel-titanium alloy has been developed. METHOD. The new coupling made of nickel-titanium alloy will tightly <b>lock</b> the <b>rod</b> when temperature increases to 50 °C (shape-memory effect). If fretting occurs, the coupling will further tighten itself around the rod (superelastic effect). This new coupling is mechanically tested against 4 current implant couplings. RESULTS. In axial compression, conventional couplings failed between 570 and 740 N, while the new coupling reached 800 N without loosening. In axial rotation, conventional devices failed between 1. 8 and 5. 3 Nm, while the new coupling reached 6. 5 Nm without failure. During testing, the retightening effect could {{be seen on the}} force versus displacement plot. CONCLUSIONS. To our knowledge, the self-tightening coupling is a new concept not previously described and is attributable to the superior superelastic effect of the new coupling. This implant coupling {{has the potential to be}} used as a very low profile system and also in nonfusion technologies in which demands on the coupling would not higher without the protection of spinal fusion. © 2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Ten cockerels were subjected to transverse osteotomy of the right humeral diaphysis followed by the insertion of polyamide 12 <b>locked</b> <b>rods,</b> with two nails in each bone fragment. Radiographies obtained at the immediate pre and post-operative period, and every 7 days for 3 months revealed no perioperatory complications. Radiography revealed a radiopaque bone callus between the 4 th and 5 th week post-surgery. Histopathology detected an amphophylic material (polyamide 12 rod) in the intramedullary region and the proliferation of highly vascularized connective tissue between the rod and the cortical bone. This connective tissue was highly cellular with differentiation into osteoblasts. The collagen fibers varied from loose to dense and a differentiated bone matrix, containing osteocytes in gaps and the development of bone marrow, was also observed; indicating the formation of a bone callus without signs of implant rejection. The polyamide 12 intramedullary rod was effective in the stabilization of the fractures used in this experimental model, with no rejection reaction for at least 90 days...|$|R
50|$|Three-point locking is a {{locking system}} {{installed}} in cabinet or locker doors to enable more secure locking. Whereas in single-point locking, {{the door on}} a cabinet locks only {{at the point where}} the key is turned, halfway up the edge of the door, three-point locking enables the top and bottom of the door to be simultaneously secured. This is accomplished by attaching two long steel <b>rods</b> to the <b>lock</b> on the inside of the door, which extend vertically upwards and downwards: when the lock is turned, the rotary movement of the latch on the inside of the door translates to vertical movement in these rods, with the result that the upper rod moves upwards by an inch or so, and the lower rod moves downwards similarly. This causes the ends of the rods to move through small holes in the flanges at the top and bottom of the door, resulting from the metal of the door being turned inwards, and the rods then move a short distance into holes in the metal surrounding the door. This effectively immobilizes the top and bottom of the door, and greatly increases the security of the door-locking compared to a door with only single-point locking.|$|R
