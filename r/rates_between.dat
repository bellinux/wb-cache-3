5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E
5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSequence {{differences}} in the dimerization initiation signal (DIS) affect the <b>rate</b> of recombination <b>between</b> subtype B and subtype C HIV- 1. To test the hypothesis that DIS sequences {{can be used to}} predict intersubtype recombination potentials, we measured the recombination <b>rate</b> <b>between</b> CRF 01 _A/E (AE) and B, which contain mismatches in the DIS, and between AE and C, which have an identical DIS. Compared with the intrasubtype recombination rate, the recombination <b>rate</b> <b>between</b> AE and subtype B virus was 9 -fold lower, and the <b>rate</b> <b>between</b> AE and subtype C virus was 2 -fold lower. Thus, DIS sequences can be used to predict the recombination potential between HIV- 1 subtypes. Further analyses revealed that the 2 -fold lower recombination <b>rate</b> <b>between</b> AE and C viruses can be restored to the intrasubtype recombination rate by matching a part of the LTR and a portion of the viral genome. Therefore, the lower intersubtype recombination <b>rate</b> <b>between</b> AE and C is not caused by a given region but is a cumulative effect by more than one region...|$|R

5|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{that results}} from the relationship between forward and spot exchange rates {{within the context of}} covered interest rate parity is responsible for eliminating or correcting for market inefficiencies that would create potential for arbitrage profits. As such, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting. In order for this equilibrium to hold under differences in interest <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> two countries, the forward exchange rate must generally differ from the spot exchange rate, such that a no-arbitrage condition is sustained. Therefore, the forward rate is said to contain a premium or discount, reflecting the interest rate differential between two countries. The following equations demonstrate how the forward premium or discount is calculated.|$|E

Cortana can forecast results in various other sports such as the NBA, the NFL, the Super Bowl, the ICC Cricket World Cup and various European football leagues. Cortana can solve mathematical equations, convert units of measurement, and determine the exchange <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> currencies including Bitcoin.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

5|$|Regarding incidence, cohort {{longitudinal}} studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, {{which means that}} half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|The canal company {{exhausted}} {{its capital}} of £8 million in 4 years, when {{only half the}} construction work was completed. To avoid bankruptcy they appealed for funds to Manchester Corporation, which set up a Ship Canal Committee. On 9 March 1891 the corporation decided, on the committee's recommendation, to lend the necessary £3 million, to preserve the city's prestige. In return the corporation was allowed to appoint five of the fifteen {{members of the board}} of directors. The company subsequently raised its estimates of the cost of completion in September 1891 and again in June 1892. An executive committee was appointed as an emergency measure in December 1891, and on 14 October 1892 the Ship Canal Committee resolved to lend a further £1.5million on condition that Manchester Corporation had an absolute majority on the canal company's board of directors and its various sub-committees. The corporation subsequently appointed 11 of the 21 seats, nominated Alderman Sir John Harwood as deputy director of the company, and secured majorities on five of the board's six sub-committees. The cost to Manchester Corporation of financing the Ship Canal Company {{had a significant impact on}} local taxpayers. Manchester's municipal debt rose by 67 per cent, resulting in a 26 per cent increase in <b>rates</b> <b>between</b> 1892 and 1895.|$|E
