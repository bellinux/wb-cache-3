Therefore, when the construction of seadikes is planned, the effective heightof seadikes {{and the depth of}} scouring have to be determined under careful considera-tion. This paper presents the experimental result of scour due to waves. In this paper, first, it is cleared that the wave action of scouring at the toe ofseadikes is divided into two parts: occurrence of <b>bed</b> <b>roller</b> and sand movement alongthe bed, and four types of scour behaviours by the location of seadikes are revealed. Furthermore, it is found that the maximum depth of scour is approximately equal tothe wave height in deep water and the location of seadikes where the maximum scouroccurs is related to the depth of breaking of incident waves. In addition, the scours at the toe of seadikes along Mie Coast due to Typhoon No. 13 and Isewan Typhoon are discussed based on this experimental result...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In all sugar {{industries}} {{the cane}} after processing {{is left with}} the waste product called “Bagasse”. The Bagasse produced in the mills {{is used as a}} fuel to boilers and the generation of steam. The steam thus produced is expanded in turbines and the power is generated. The excess bagasse is then stored in an open area. Lot of human health hazards is taking place due to loading of bagasse. Nowadays, the industries are using the crane systems to load the bagasse into the tippers, which is a very slow task and causing more dust. The bucket conveyors are used to move bulk materials in a vertical or inclined path. Buckets are attached to a cable, chain, or belt. Buckets are automatically unloaded {{at the end of the}} conveyor run. The belt conveyor is used for transporting light- and medium-weight loads between operations, departments, levels, and buildings, providing considerable control over the orientation and placement of the load. The belt is <b>roller</b> or slider <b>bed</b> supported; the slider bed is used for small and irregularly shaped items...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Iran {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{producers}} of almonds. According to the statistics released by FAO (2011), Iran with more than 110000 tons of almonds is the third in rank throughout the world. However, most Iranian almonds are presented as an unsorted and unpackaged product. Some producers sort their products by hand which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. So, there is an essential need for suitable grading and packaging machines especially for the export of almond kernels. Grading, which is sometimes called sorting, is basically separating the material in different homogenous groups according to its specific characteristics like size, shape, color and on the basis of quality. Weighing {{is one of the}} best methods for grading agricultural products based on size, but due to its high cost and complexity of operations, usage of weigh size sorting machines is practically limited. So, sizing of most agricultural products is accomplished based on their dimensional attributes such as diameter, length, thickness or a combination of them. Field study shows that recently vibrating sizing machines are used for grading almond kernels. This type of sizing machine is huge, expensive, noisy and it consumes a lot of energy. Thus, the main objective of the present study was the design, development and evaluation of a new prototype of an almond kernel sizing machine. Materials and methods: It is important that the machine could resolve defects of existing vibrating machines. It should provide efficient and cost effective sizing for a wide range of kernel sizes and shapes. Furthermore, it should be of simple construction and be able to accept manual feeding. Previously conducted experiments showed that the thickness of the kernel is the most appropriate dimension for its sizing. Among the different types of dimensional sizing machines, the divergent roller grader which grades the products based on their thickness is considered to be one of the simplest options. So, a divergent roller grader was developed and built in this research. The prototype consisted of two diverging rotating rollers which were made of mild steel with an outside diameter of 95 mm and a length of 700 mm. They were mounted to provide an adjustable slope towards the wide opening end. These <b>roller</b> <b>beds</b> were fixed on a box shaped frame of size 500 × 1000 × 1200 mm. The slope and counter-rotating action of the rollers encouraged the kernels to continue moving toward the end where the gap between the rollers was the widest. A tray was fixed at the feeding end of the machine for feeding the kernels. A provision was given to adjust the gap from a minimum to a maximum level. Based on the required activate torques of the rollers, an electric 74 W motor was selected to drive the machine. The power transmission mechanism consists of two pulleys 150 and 250 mm diameters and a V belt type A with a length of 1448 mm. The center distance of the pulleys is calculated to be 410 mm. Standard criterions of weighted sorting error index (C ̅_R), weighted sorting efficiencies index (EW) and operation capacity (Q) were used to evaluate the machine. Practical analysis showed that the machine’s performance is influenced mainly by the slope of the rollers, the rotation speed of the rollers, and the feeding rate of the product. In order to evaluate the performance of the prototype, a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications for each test was done. The performance evaluation was carried out for three levels of feeding rates (600, 1000, and 1400 kg 8 h- 1, three levels of slopes (2, 7, and 12 degree), and three rotation speeds of rollers (50, 80, and 110 rpm). Spreadsheet software MSTATC and SPSS were used to analyze the data and the Duncan's multiple range tests were used to compare the means. Results and discussion: Analysis of variance showed that all three studied factors have significant effects on evaluating standard criterions of C ̅_R, EW, and Q at the 1...|$|R
40|$|Powders {{used in the}} Particle Bed Fusion {{process are}} spread onto compact layers and then are fused to {{generate}} a layer of the final part. This process is repeated layer-upon-layer to form the final products. It has recently been demon- strated [Powder Technology, 306 (2017) 45 – 54] that spreading the particles with a counter-rotating <b>roller</b> produces a <b>bed</b> with a higher quality (i. e. a lower void fraction) compared to a blade type spreader. This {{is related to the}} geometry of the two spreaders which directly changes the bed-spreader contact dynamic and consequently affects the bed's quality. Based on this rationale, here, it is postulated that changing the blade profile at the blade bed contact region can significantly enhance the bed's quality and improve the effectiveness of a blade as a spreading device. A set of Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations is performed at device-scale to optimise the geometry of blade spreaders to yield the lowest void fraction using simple rod-shaped grains to control the computational costs. The blade profile is parametrised using a super-ellipse with three geometrical parameters. Firstly, it is demonstrated that geometric optimisation of a blade profile is an effective alternative to using more complex spreading devices. Secondly, for the proposed parametrisation, the optimum values are found using computer simulations and it is shown that bed volume fractions close to critical values are achievable. Finally, a new technique for multi-sphere approximation (MSA) is developed and applied to 3 D models of real powder grains to generate realistic particle shapes for the DEM simulations. Then using these grains it is shown that the proposed optimum blade profile is capable of producing a bed with qualities comparable (and even better) to a roller at the actual operating conditions and with realistic grain characteristics...|$|R
40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, field cultivators, rotary hoes, drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, <b>rollers,</b> ridge- or <b>bed</b> -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these. They operate at a shallower depth than primary tillage tools and provide additional soil pulverization. Equipment that permits primary and/or secondary tillage plus planting in a single operation is also available...|$|R
