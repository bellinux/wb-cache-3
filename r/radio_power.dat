500|$|Hershey's {{offensive}} problems {{continued in}} a 3–1 loss against the Portland Pirates on November 11, {{in which they}} struggled to get the puck out of their zone and through the neutral zone. Holtby, who made 31 saves, said afterward, [...] "We just seemed to look dead the last couple games." [...] Kalinski suffered a hand injury and would not return until December 27. The Bears fell to Syracuse again on November 16. The 6–1 game, the most lopsided defeat of the season, was their third consecutive loss and third straight home game with only one goal. Hershey broke a three-game losing streak on November 17 with a 4–1 against the Penguins, where Garrett Mitchell scored two goals, including Hershey's first successful penalty shot since February 27, 2010. The team had surrendered two goals or fewer in eight of their past 14 games. But Hershey lost their next two games, including a 4–0 shutout loss to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on November 21. The Binghamton-based Internet <b>radio</b> <b>Power</b> Play Post Show reported from an anonymous source that Penguins head coach John Hynes put a $200 bounty on Bears defenseman Oleksy for that game, a claim Hynes strongly denied.|$|E

Three hundred Raiders were built and many were part of a “driveaway” by area dealers {{on the eve of the}} Auto Show. All Raiders came with a V8 engine with automatic transmission, as well as “blow-your mind colors to choose from: electric green, tangerine, and blue-you’ve never seen.” This was a test market of the “Big Bad” colors by AMC through a regional dealer-lead promotional campaign. The bright hues were later introduced at mid-year on the Javelin and AMX models. Other standard features on the Raider included black upholstery and carpeting, black front grille, black vinyl roof, a sports-type steering wheel, AM <b>radio,</b> <b>power</b> steering, and power brakes. The total price of the special Raider models was advertised at US$2,699.|$|E
