50|$|A {{built-in}} O-lock {{is a type}} of bicycle lock {{that prevents}} ride-off theft, establishes ownership, secures the back wheel to the frame (which can be separately locked), and provides a lock and slot for a cable. An O-lock is also called a <b>ring</b> <b>lock</b> or wheel lock.|$|E
5000|$|The third variant, {{made from}} 1976 {{to the end}} of {{production}} of breech ring FD lenses (around 1980) changed the green [...] "o" [...] to a green [...] "A" [...] and the chrome aperture <b>ring</b> <b>lock</b> button was changed from chrome to black. The breech ring was still locked unless mounted and it still had the spring loaded twist {{to make it easier to}} mount the lens. The third version FD 50mm F1.8 lens also received a plastic front barrel to reduce size and weight. This corresponded with the introduction of the Canon A-series cameras which were smaller and lighter than the older, larger and heavier [...] "F-series" [...] bodies.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{generation of}} FD lenses featured a silver colored <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> at the base. Only the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> turns to <b>lock</b> the lens {{to the camera}} body; the lens body remains stationary. The later New FD lenses have a black mount which includes a lens release button.|$|R

Minimal force required to position male in female joint, {{at which time}} split-ring retainers are triggered to release split <b>locking</b> <b>rings.</b> Originally developed to assemble large space structures, joint is simple, compact, strong, lightweight, self alining, and has no loose parts...|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> door {{requires a}} safety interlock to prevent operation {{when there is}} any pressure in the autoclave. It is good practice to incorporate the ability to reverse the door <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> rotation {{at any time and}} without delay. With some doors, it is possible to swing them shut not quite far enough and then have the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> jam as it tries to close.|$|R
40|$|The facile {{preparation}} of a racemic hydrazine bridged diphosphonium compound possessing a ring system analogous to bicyclo[3. 3. 2]decane is reported. Although the reaction yield is low, {{the structure of}} the compound, which possesses an eight-membered ring, two phosphonium cationic centers, a biimino bridge, molecular chirality and two fused aromatic <b>rings</b> <b>locked</b> into roughly perpendicular planes is unusual. The compound displays substantial biological activity in the brine shrimp test and cleaves plasmid DNA...|$|R
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories {{designed}} the H 1616 container for transport of Type B quantities of radioactive materials. During {{the most recent}} recertification cycle, questions were raised concerning the ability of drum type containers with <b>locking</b> <b>rings</b> to survive the hypothetical accident sequence when the puncture test was oriented to specifically attack the <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> A series of tests has been performed that conclusively demonstrates that the specially designed <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> on the H 1616 performs adequately in this environment...|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a housing, in which a <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope. Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above-mentioned <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> the bolt <b>locks</b> by rotation; thus, the receiver with <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> bolt and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1 {{guns were}} {{upgraded}} to Marks 5 and 8 {{in the late}} 1930s. The Mark 5's have a larger chamber to permit larger charges and a new liner with a heavier taper carbon steel along with a liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and <b>locking</b> collar. The Mark 8, similar to the Mark 5, had a uniform rifling with a chromium plated bore for increased life.|$|R

50|$|The Shang Ring {{consists}} of two concentric medical grade plastic rings: an inner ring with a silicone band and an outer, hinged ring {{that acts as a}} ligature. The appropriate size is determined through use of a measuring strip. The outer ring fits is placed outside of the foreskin and locks against the inner ring when snapped together; the distal foreskin is then excised. The Shang Ring is removed after one week when the outer <b>ring</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism is opened using a special tool. A pair of scissors, specifically designed for this purpose, is then used to remove the inner ring.|$|R

50|$|The gun is an air-cooled, recoil-operated design, firing {{standard}} 7.92×57mm Mauser ammunition, fed from {{a slightly}} curved 30-round magazine {{inserted in the}} left side of the weapon. It uses a <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> which is located at the end of the barrel extension, to lock the bolt. Inside the <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> there are six sets of locking lugs, arranged as an interrupted thread, which mate with lugs cut at the rear of the bolt. Rotation of the <b>ring,</b> which <b>locks</b> and unlocks the bolt, is controlled by rollers mounted on the outside of the ring. Upon recoil, these rollers follow cam tracks cut into the receiver. The gun is of relatively simple design, with most parts having a round cross-section. The tubular receiver is an extension of the barrel jacket. The butt hosts a tube which contains the return spring and its guide.|$|R

50|$|Mod 4, {{the twelve}} guns from , relined in 1921-1923, had a conical {{one-step}} liner and uniform rifling {{with a new}} chase locking hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> With the Mod 5 {{an attempt was made}} to reline a Mod 1 with a uniform twist rifling, but it was dropped. Mod 6 relined Mod 2 with a uniform twist rifling along with a modified new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 7 took the Mod 3 and used a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling, and added a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 8 was the Mod 0 or Mod 4 also using a one-step conical liner, uniform twist rifling that was secured by a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> with a liner locking collar at the breech end. The Mod 8s that used Mod 0 guns also added a new chase hoop and <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> Mod 9 was a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearances at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. Mod 10, like the Mod 9, was also a Mod 2 or Mod 6 that had a new liner with longitudinal clearance at the liner shoulders installed, uniform twist rifling along with a tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> and collar added at the breech end. The Mod 10 used Breech Mechanism Mark 9 instead of the Mark 8 on the previous Mods. Mod 11 was a Mod 7 that had the chamber lengthened, adding , and a 3½° breech band seating slope and used Breech Mechanism Mark 12. Mod 12 used a Mod 10 and lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope with Mod 13 being similar but of a Mod 8, Mod 14 used a Mod 9, Mod 15 used a Mod 7, Mod 16 used a Mod 10, Mod 17 used a Mod 8, and Mod 18 a Mod 9. Mod 19, the last modification, used a Mod 2 with its breech modified for the Smith-Asbury Breech Mechanism and the forward end of the chamber modified similar to the Mod 18, lengthened the chamber and added a 3½° breech band seating slope. The breech end was further modified by being machined out so that it could accommodate a gas check seat liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring.</b> The Mod 19 could also be used right or left handed by cutting a new slide keyway that was 180° from the original keyway.|$|R
50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two <b>locking</b> <b>rings,</b> tube and liner <b>locking</b> <b>ring,</b> yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} door types available. These are {{proprietary}} designs having special characteristics which suit {{them to a}} variety of applications. For example, some door designs are simpler than the <b>locking</b> <b>ring</b> type, having no notched cutouts at all in the <b>locking</b> <b>rings.</b> They are easily operated by hand or power and intrinsically safe, much like the T-bolt configuration, in that any movement of the locking mechanism from closed toward open will release pressure well before the door and hub actually separate.|$|R
40|$|Fused <b>ring</b> bridge, <b>ring</b> <b>locked</b> dyes {{that form}} {{thermally}} stable photorfractive compositions. The fused ring bridge structures are. pi. -conjugated bonds in benzene-, naphthalene- or anthracene-derived fused ring systems that connect {{donor and acceptor}} groups. The donor and acceptor groups contribute to a high molecular dipole moment and linear polarizability anisotropy. The polarization characteristics of the dye molecules are stabilized since the bonds in the fused ring bridge are not susceptible to rotation, reducing the opportunity for photoisomerization. The dyes are compatible with polymeric compositions, including thermoplastics. The dyes are electrically neutral but have charge transport, electronic and orientational properties such that upon illumination of a composition containing the dye, the dye facilitates refractive index modulation and a photorefractive effect that can be utilized advantageously in numerous applications such as in optical quality devices and biological imaging...|$|R
50|$|The O.T.O. is the {{simplest}} of the three Mod.35 Types. The Allways fuze is driven by a lead ball held between a cone shaped cap and a spring loaded striker. An interesting feature is the design on the ball, it's a lead-wrapped assembly of small lead shot, intended to rupture {{at the moment of}} detonation, a safety feature. Since the grenade was an offensive type, designers didn't want to have a heavy part of the bomb flying far away from the intended point of detonation, an possibly injuring the thrower. That's the reason why the ball should break into tiny parts at the moment of detonation. The internal capsule contains the explosive and a primer/detonator tube. A thin wire <b>ring</b> <b>locks</b> the two body halves together at a specific place, fixing the overall length, so as not to bind the internal parts.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} indoline-pi-acceptor chromophores has been {{synthesized}} {{and the members}} first hyper-polarizabilities measured to investigate the effect of conjugation length, the use of various substituents and configurational locking on the nonlinear optical response. While increasing {{the length of the}} conjugated interconnect enhances the optical nonlinearity, <b>ring</b> <b>locking</b> was found to have little effect, although this is thought to be due to the electronic properties of the substituent groups, rather than structural factors. Nonetheless, all of the compounds were found to have high molecular hyper-polarizabilities with values of up to 1485 x 10 (- 30) esu when measured in chloroform at 1300 nm, findings which confirm that these chromophores are excellent candidates for further study. X-ray crystallographic studies were performed on three of the compounds and bond length alternation values obtained; these were found to correlate well with the observed molecular responses.

5000|$|Perhaps {{the first}} {{documented}} case of poltergeists in Spain was in 1724, {{when the doctor}} and writer Diego de Torres Villarroel went called {{to the house of}} the Countess of Arcos, located on Fuencarral to witness a paranormal phenomenon. He himself wrote in his life: [...] "I can assure that for fifteen nights I was sleepless and restless, I heard horrible noises ... so out of natural order, such as the pictures being taken down without falling from the nail or the <b>ring,</b> <b>locked</b> doors being opened, plates rolling without breaking ..." [...] All the servants had locked themselves away from fear of suffering from the phenomena, which consisted of repeated blows and movements of objects. The poet watched the fall of several tables in a room. He could not find the source of these sounds, although it was clear {{that this was not a}} joke.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{the closing}} of atoms into <b>rings</b> may <b>lock</b> {{particular}} functional group-substituted atoms into place, resulting in stereochemistry and chirality being associated with the compound, including some manifestations that are unique to rings (e.g., configurational isomers); As well, depending on ring size, the three-dimensional shapes of particular cyclic structures—typically rings of 5-atoms and larger—can vary and interconvert such that conformational isomerism is displayed.|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{communication}} between concentric macrocycles with wave functions that extend around their circumferences {{can lead to}} remarkable behavior, as illustrated by multiwalled carbon nanotubes and photosynthetic chlorophyll arrays. However, {{it is difficult to}} hold one π-conjugated molecular ring inside another. Here, we show that ring-in-ring complexes, consisting of a 6 -porphyrin <b>ring</b> <b>locked</b> inside a 12 -porphyrin ring, can be assembled by placing different metals in the two rings (zinc and aluminum). A bridging ligand with carboxylate and imidazole binding sites forms spokes between the two rings, resulting in a highly cooperative supramolecular self-assembly process. Excitation is transferred from the inner 6 -ring to the outer 12 -ring of this Russian doll complex within 40 ps. These complexes lead to a form of template-directed synthesis in which one nanoring promotes formation of a larger concentric homologous ring; here, the effective template is an eight-component noncovalent assembly. Russian doll templating provides a new approach to amplifying the size of a covalent nanostructure...|$|R
