40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model for}} the process of steady burning of a stationary droplet of fuel in an oxidizing atmosphere has been examined. Explicit expressions have been obtained for the burning <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the fuel droplet, for the temperature {{at the flame front}}, and for the radius of the combustion surface. The principal assumptions on which our analysis is based are: the flame front is established at a spherical surface surrounding the drop; the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> fuel and oxygen to this surface are in stoichiometric proportions; the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> reaction at the flame front are fast compared to the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> combustible gases. Our analysis is an extension and generalization of the work of G. A. E. Godsave. We are able to delete several of Godsave's restrictive assumptions by use of an efficient method for formulating the problem in which only integrated forms appear for the expressions of conservation of mass and energy. Our theoretical formulas provide a satisfactory correlation of Godsave's experimental results...|$|R

2500|$|Some [...] {{feel that}} the rapid-fire {{delivery}} makes debate harder to understand for the lay person. [...] Rapid delivery is encouraged by {{those who believe that}} increased quantity and diversity of argumentation makes debates more educational. Others, citing scientific studies, claim that learning to speak faster also increases short- and long-term memory. A slower style is preferred by those who want debates to be understandable to lay people and those who claim that the pedagogical purpose of the activity is to train rhetorical skills. Many further claim that the increased speed encourages debaters to make several poor arguments, as opposed to a few high-quality ones. Most debaters will vary their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> depending upon the judge's preferences.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the general}} field of human speech reproduction, a {{bandwidth}} of 5512Hz {{is sufficient to}} produce excellent results (for voice) using the sampling rate of 11025 and VBR encoding from 44100 (standard) wave files.. This is easily accomplished using LAME version 3.99.5 and the command line [...] "lame -V 9.6 lecture.WAV" [...] English speakers average 41–42kbit/s with -V 9.6 setting but this may vary with amount of silence recorded or the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> (wpm). Resampling to 12000 (6K bandwidth) is selected by the LAME parameter -V 9.4 Likewise -V 9.2 selects 16000 sample rate and a resultant 8K lowpass filtering. For more info see Nyquist – Shannon. [...] Older versions of LAME and FFmpeg only support integer arguments for variable bit rate quality selection parameter.

2500|$|In contrast, the {{arguments}} for a ¾ scaling factor are based on resource transport network models, where the limiting resources are distributed via some optimized network to all resource consuming cells or organelles. [...] These models {{are based on the}} assumption that metabolism is proportional to the rate at which an organism’s distribution networks (such as circulatory systems in animals or xylem and phloem in plants) deliver nutrients and energy to body tissues. Larger organisms are necessarily less efficient because more resource is in transport at any one time than in smaller organisms: size of the organism and length of the network imposes an inefficiency due to size. [...] It therefore takes somewhat longer for large organisms to distribute nutrients throughout the body and thus they have a slower mass-specific metabolic rate. An organism that is twice as large cannot metabolize twice the energy—it simply has to run more slowly because more energy and resources are wasted being in transport, rather than being processed. Nonetheless, natural selection appears to have minimized this inefficiency by favoring resource transport networks that maximize <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> of resources to the end points such as cells and organelles. This selection to maximize metabolic rate and energy dissipation results in the allometric exponent that tends to D/(D+1), where D is the primary dimension of the system. A three dimensional system, such as an individual, tends to scale to the 3/4 power, whereas a two dimensional network, such as a river network in a landscape,tends to scale to the 2/3 power.|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has found that wellness visits, recall and reminder systems, and stand-ing orders are associated with higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> preventive services in primary care practices. However, there is little information about how to help practices implement these processes. Methods: A 6 -month randomized, controlled trial comparing a multicomponent quality improvement intervention to feedback and benchmarking. One clinician/nurse team from each of 24 practices was {{randomly assigned to one of}} 2 study arms. Intervention practices received performance feedback, peer-to-peer education (academic detailing), a practice facilitator, and computer (information technology) support. Implementation of the 3 targeted processes was determined by a blinded 3 -clinician panel that reviewed transcribed clinician interviews before and after intervention using performance definitions. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> selected preventive services were determined by chart audit. Results: Intervention practices implemented more of the processes than control practices overall (P. 003), for adults (P. 05), and for children (P. 04). They were also more likely to implement at least one of the processes for children (P. 04) and to implement standing orders for either chil-dren or adults (P. 02).
