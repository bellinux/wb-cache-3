40|$|DNA is {{frequently}} damaged by various {{physical and chemical}} agents. DNA damage can lead to mutations during replication. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the damage-induced mutagenesis pathway requires the Rev 1 protein. We have isolated a human cDNA homologous to the yeast <b>REV</b> 1 <b>gene.</b> The human <b>REV</b> 1 cDNA consists of 4255 bp and codes for a protein of 1251 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 138 248 Da.

40|$|Abstract The genomes {{of human}} and simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (HIV and SIV) encode the gag, pol and env genes and contain at least six supplementary open reading frames termed tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpx and vpu.

However, these auxiliary proteins are essential for viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. The two vpr - and vpx -related genes are found only in members of the HIV- 2 /SIVsm/SIVmac group, whereas primate lentiviruses from other lineages (HIV- 1, SIVcpz, SIVagm, SIVmnd and SIVsyk) contain a single vpr gene.

40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>REV</b> 3 <b>gene</b> {{function}} in UV-induced mutagensis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been examined by determining the reversion of 12 well-defined cyc 1 mutations in diploid strains homozygous for the rev 3 – 1 or rev 3 – 3 allele. The 12 cyc 1 alleles include one ochre, one amber, four initiation, two proline missense, and four frameshift mutations. We find that the rev 3 mutations reduce the frequency of UV-induced reversion {{of all of the}} cyc 1 alleles, though different classes of alleles respond to a different extent. These results imply that the <b>REV</b> 3 <b>gene</b> function is required for the production {{of a wide variety of}} mutational events, though probably not all, and show that each of the three REV loci have different mutational phenotypes. Such diverse phenotypes are not predicted by the unitary model for bacterial mutagenesis (Caillet-Fauquet, Defais and Radman 1977; Witkin 1976), suggesting that this is at best an incomplete description of eukaryotic mutagenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{range of}} {{specificity}} of the rev 2 – 1 mutation, an allele {{that reduces the}} frequency of ochre revertants induced by UV in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Lemontt 1971 a), has been investigated by examining its influence on the reversion of eleven well-defined and contrasting cyc 1 mutations. We have shown, {{in support of a}} suggestion of Lemontt (1971 a), that the <b>REV</b> 2 <b>gene</b> product is concerned only with the reversion of ochre alleles; it plays virtually no role in the reversion of amber, missense or frameshift mutations. We have also shown that its effect is specific and confined to only some highly revertible ochre alleles. The <b>REV</b> 2 <b>gene</b> product appears to enhance reversion at these sites by facilitating the conversion of two otherwise nonmutagenic photo-products into a single premutational lesion. UV-induced killing of rev 2 – 1 strains was found to be significantly greater on fermentable rather than on nonfermentable media...|$|R

Both Rex and Rev act at a posttranscriptional level by binding to highly structured RNA-response elements, the Rex-response element in HTLV-I and the Rev-response element in HIV- 1. Using a sensitive in vivo assay of protein-protein interaction, we now demonstrate that the HTLV-I Rex and HIV- 1 Rev proteins readily form homomultimeric complexes {{in the absence of}} their cognate RNA-response elements yet fail to form heteromultimeric complexes with each other. Dominant negative mutations have been identified in both the rex and <b>rev</b> <b>genes</b> which presumably specify a critical activation or effector domain in each of these viral transactivators.
