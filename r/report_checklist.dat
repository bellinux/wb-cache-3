40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to understand the interactions between different actors of an educational community using a multi-method approach. The participants were twenty five teachers and one hundred children whose ages were between nine and twelve. Information was collected by means of the Behavioural Observation Record, the Bullying <b>Report</b> <b>Checklist</b> by Hirchstein, Edstom, Frey, Sneill, & Mackenzie (2007) and Discussion Groups. Frequency analysis were carried out in order to identify the prevalence of physical and psychological school bullying among peers inside and outside the classroom as well as the teachers' reactions when facing this kind of situation. The information obtained through the Discussion Groups was analysed through Strauss & Corbin's (2002) approach. That analysis led to understanding the underlying meaning of practices where the use of power and authority to intimidate and control others are evidenced. The participants' perception of impotence doesn't allow them to assume themselves as active subjects when coping with this reality...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{several studies}} of normative development in adolescence, focusing specifically on internalized perceptions of parents’ early behavior {{and how these}} perceptions affect the self-concept and social functioning during. Questions of possible age and gender differences in relation to perceptions of self-concept and early parental behavior are addressed. The patterns found in a normal adolescent group are compared with those {{in a group of}} adolescents with antisocial problems. Two hundred seventy-seven normal adolescents aged 12 to 18 and 30 adolescents with antisocial problems aged 13 - 19 were investigated. The following self-administered instruments were used: self-concept assessments, the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) introject questionnaire, perception of early parental behavior assessment, the SASB mother/father questionnaires, and the EMBU (A Swedish acronym for “own memories of upbringing”). The Youth Self <b>Report</b> <b>checklist</b> (YSR) was used to assess internalizing and externalizing problems. Studies I and II showed that the normal adolescent self-concept and perception of early parental behavior were positive and that there were no age or gender differences. The antisocial group of adolescents, and particularly the antisocial girls, showed a more autonomous and negative self-concept and more negative perceptions of early parental behaviors. Study III showed that a positive self-concept was related to a positive perception of parent’s early behavior. Study IV showed that an adolescent’s positive self-concept was influenced by a mix of mother acting positively and father acting with control. Adolescent self-control was indirectly influenced by parental control behavior mediated through self-affiliation. Study V showed that a positive self-concept was important for adjustment. A negative self-concept combined with female gender was a risk factor for internalizing problems. Self-control had only a small effect on social adjustment in adolescence. The relationship between a negative self-concept and externalizing problem behavior was stronger for adolescents aged 15 to 16 than for younger or older adolescents. Internalizing problem behavior influenced externalizing problems. The results presented in this thesis support a modified “storm-and-stress” view of adolescence and highlight the importance of promoting a positive self-concept in every adolescent in various psychosocial contexts...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{process of}} “mapping” is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} predict health utilities, for application within health economic evaluations, using data on other indicators or measures of health. Guidance for the reporting of mapping studies is currently lacking. Objective The overall objective {{of this research was}} to develop a checklist of essential items, which authors should consider when reporting mapping studies. The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a checklist, which aims to promote complete and transparent reporting by researchers. This paper provides a detailed explanation and elaboration of the items contained within the MAPS statement. Methods In the absence of previously published <b>reporting</b> <b>checklists</b> or <b>reporting</b> guidance documents, a de novo list of reporting items and accompanying explanations was created. A two-round, modified Delphi survey, with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies and the biomedical journal editorial community, was used to identify a list of essential reporting items from this larger list. Results From the initial de novo list of 29 candidate items, a set of 23 essential reporting items was developed.

Although blame is often attributed to the manufacturers, scientists are not doing all they can to help themselves. One example of this is in the reporting of research antibody use. Publications routinely lack key details, including the host species, code number and even the company who supplied the antibody. Authors also fail to demonstrate that validation of the antibodies has taken place. These omissions make it harder for reviewers to establish the likely reliability of the results and for researchers to reproduce the experiments. The scale of this problem, combined with high profile concerns about experimental reproducibility, has caused the Nature Publishing Group to include a section on antibody information in their recent <b>Reporting</b> <b>Checklist</b> for Life Science Articles.

40|$|Not {{all aspects}} of the side effects that occur during the {{treatment}} of stress are negative. In fact, many of the socalled side effects, including abreactions, physiological and psychological discharges, and other cognitive distortions, that occur during treatment are common, and one can argue that they are often an integral part of successful treatment. Side effects occur at different frequencies depending on factors such as the treatment approach used (e. g., autogenic training, biofeedback, or neurofeedback) and client history and symptoms. Side effects and symptoms can be detected via observation, client <b>report,</b> <b>checklists,</b> and physiological measurements. Some side effects can be avoided by using a different treatment approach; for example, clients undergoing autogenic training are likely to experience very different side effects than those who are undergoing progressive relaxation training. It can be argued that side effects occur in 100 % of patients if treatment is successful; thus, practitioners should be prepared and competent so that they can anticipate, identify, and appropriately deal with side effects when they occur.

In this study, I investigated different dimensions of E- mail applicability and usefulness for assessing assignments and its strengths and weaknesses among new students.

Possibility of electronic search for assignments, giving feedback to students without time and place restriction, group feedbacks and guidance, and reinforcements of teaching – learning in informal times are advantages of using E-mail as a tool for assignment management. However, using E- mail has some limitations, too. Restricting communication to writing, prolonged individual feedbacks, repetitive E- mails, misunderstanding and technical problems among new students are weaknesses of using e- mail for assessing assignments. At the end I’ll offer some recommendations to make E- mail an effective means for assignment assessment...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{tests are}} {{essential}} for patient care. Evidence-based assessment of the relative accuracy of competing diagnostic tests informs clinical and policy decision making. This thesis addresses questions centred on assessing the reliability and transparency of evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of comparative test accuracy, including validity of meta-analytic methods. Case studies were used to highlight key methodological issues, and provided rationale and context for the thesis. Published systematic reviews of multiple tests were identified and used to provide a descriptive survey of recent practice. Availability of comparative accuracy studies and differences between meta-analyses of direct (head-to-head) and indirect (between-study) comparisons were assessed. Comparative meta-analysis methods were reviewed and those deemed statistically robust were empirically evaluated. Using simulation, performance of hierarchical methods for meta-analysis of a single test was investigated in challenging scenarios (e. g. few studies or sparse data) and implications for test comparisons were considered. Poor statistical methods and incomplete reporting threatens the reliability of comparative reviews. Differences exist between direct and indirect comparisons but direct comparisons were seldom feasible because comparative studies were unavailable. Furthermore, inappropriate use of meta-analytic methods generated misleading results and conclusions. Therefore, recommendations for use of valid methods and a <b>reporting</b> <b>checklist</b> were developed...|$|R

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the dietary intake methods and reporting in intervention studies that included a dietary component to treat overweight or obese children. A systematic review of studies published in the English language, between 1985 and August 2010 in health databases. The search identified 2, 295 papers, of which 335 were retrieved and 31 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three studies reported energy intake as an outcome measure, 20 reported macronutrient intakes and 10 studies reported food intake outcomes. The most common dietary method employed was the food diary (n = 13), followed by 24 -h recall (n = 5), food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (n = 4) and dietary questionnaire (n = 4). The quality of the dietary intake methods reporting was rated as ‘poor’ in 15 studies (52 %) and only 3 were rated as ‘excellent’.

40|$|Checklist for {{assessing}} the reporting of the updating methodology in updated guidelines. Background: To maintain their validity, clinical guidelines (CGs) require a regular update, due to a possible obsolescence because of new scientific research [1]. Although there is no gold standard for the methodology of updating guidelines, {{as far as we}} know, it consists of three components: identifying new evidence, assessing the need to update, and communicating, in some manner, the update process and results [2 - 7] The process of updating CGs is not standardised across different institutions, possibly {{due to the fact that}} there is little scientific literature and methodological consensus available on this subject [2, 7, 8]. It is necessary to establish a process for updating CGs, which might ensure the validity of all recommendations. At this moment the updating process for CGs is immature and the lack of research in this field has a lack of optimal strategies and, consequently, facilitating the existence of variability, imprecision, and insufficient transparency. Clearly, more work is required to identify a strategy or set of strategies that combines rigour and feasibility. As a necessary first step, we will develop a <b>reporting</b> <b>checklist</b> incorporating methodological standards to guide the research needed to optimise the reporting of updating CGs...|$|R
40|$|Evidence from {{economic}} evaluations {{is often not}} used to inform healthcare policy despite being well regarded by policy makers and physicians. This article employs the accessibility and acceptability framework to review the barriers to using evidence {{from economic}} evaluation in healthcare policy and the strategies used to overcome these barriers.

Consistently reported factors that limit the translation of findings from economic evaluations into healthcare policy include poor quality of research informing economic evaluations, assumptions used in economic modelling, conflicts of interest, difficulties in transferring resources between sectors, negative attitudes to healthcare rationing, and the absence of equity considerations. Strategies to overcome these barriers have been suggested in the literature, including training, structured abstract databases, rapid evaluation, <b>reporting</b> <b>checklists</b> for journals, and considering factors other than cost effectiveness in economic evaluations, such as equity or budget impact.
