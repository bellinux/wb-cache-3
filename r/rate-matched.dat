40|$|Regenerating code is a {{class of}} code very {{suitable}} for distributed storage systems, which can maintain optimal bandwidth and storage space. Two types of important regenerating code have been constructed: the minimum storage regeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code. However, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes, the storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this paper, we propose two optimal constructions of regenerating codes through rate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile networks: 2 -layer <b>rate-matched</b> regenerating code and $m$-layer <b>rate-matched</b> regenerating code. For the 2 -layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage efficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that our code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency compared to the universally resilient regenerating code which is a straightforward extension of regenerating code with error detection and correction capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the 2 -layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching the code rate of each layer's regenerating code. We also demonstrate that the optimized parameter can achieve the maximum storage capacity under the same constraint. Compared to the universally resilient regenerating code, our code can achieve much higher error correction efficiency. Comment: 31 pages, 7 figures, journal pape...|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} rate-matching {{system for}} constructing rate-compatible polar codes is proposed. The proposed polar code circular buffer rate-matching {{is suitable for}} transmissions on communication channels that support hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) communications, {{as well as for}} flexible resource-element rate-matching on single transmission channels. Our proposed circular buffer rate matching scheme also incorporates a bit-mapping scheme for transmission on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) channels using higher order modulations. An interleaver is derived from a puncturing order obtained with a low complexity progressive puncturing search algorithm on a base code of short length, and has the flexibility to achieve any desired rate at the desired code length, through puncturing or repetition. The rate-matching scheme is implied by a two-stage polarization, for transmission at any desired code length, code rate, and modulation order, and is shown to achieve the symmetric capacity of BICM channels.

However, it is unknown whether such perceived rate differences between native and foreign languages (FLs) have effects on implicit speech processing. Our measure of implicit perception was â€˜rate normalizationâ€™: Dutch and German listeners interpret vowels midway between /É‘/ and /a:/ more often as /a:/ if the target vowel follows a fast (vs. slow) sentence. We asked whether such a â€˜rate normalizationâ€™ effect may be observed when the context is not actually faster but simply spoken in a foreign language.

The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the feasibility of using a commercial, single-lead, physiologic (VDD) pacemaker in dogs with 3 rd-degree AV block. Furthermore, we hoped to characterize and identify differences in the radiographic, echocardiographic, neurohormonal, and quality of life consequences of physiologic versus nonphysiologic pacing. We evaluated 10 dogs during a 12 -week crossover study. Acutely, <b>rate-matched</b> physiologic pacing reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 19 % compared with nonphysiologic pacing. VDD pacing significantly reduced left atrial size normalized to body weight, left atrial-to-aortic root ratio, and left ventricular end-systolic dimension and increased fractional shortening, aortic Doppler velocity, cardiac output, and stroke volume compared with VVI pacing. Variable rate VDD pacing resulted in a significantly slower heart rate (HR) during echocardiography than fixed-rate (100 bpm) VVI pacing. AV synchronous pacing reduced circulating N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), norepinephrine (NOR), and epinephrine (EPI) concentrations compared with asynchronous pacing. There were no significant differences in systemic blood pressure, thoracic radiographs, or owner-perceived quality of life. The median percentage of AV synchronous pacing during the VDD modality was 99. 8 % (range, 1. 2 to 99. 9 %). This study confirms the potential to achieve physiologic pacing with a commercial, single-lead system in dogs. VDD pacing improved hemodynamics and neurohormonal profiles over asynchronous pacing although the long-term clinical benefits of these changes remain to be determined. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the time course of autonomic nervous system activity preceding ambulatory ischemic events. BACKGROUNDVagal withdrawal can produce myocardial ischemia and may be involved in the genesis of ambulatory ischemic events. We analyzed trajectories of heart rate variability (HRV) 1 h before and after ischemic events, and we examined the role of exercise and mental stress in preischemic autonomic changes. METHODSMale patients with stable coronary artery disease (n = 19; 62. 1 Â± 9. 3 years) underwent 48 -h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Frequency domain HRV measures were assessed for 60 min before and after each of 68 ischemic events and during nonischemic heart <b>rate-matched</b> control periods. RESULTSHigh-frequency HRV decreased from âˆ’ 60, âˆ’ 20 to âˆ’ 10 min before ischemic events (4. 8 Â± 1. 3; 4. 6 Â± 1. 3; 4. 4 Â± 1. 2 ln [ms 2], respectively; p = 0. 04) and further from âˆ’ 4, âˆ’ 2 min, until ischemia (4. 4 Â± 1. 3; 4. 1 Â± 1. 3; 3. 7 Â± 1. 2 ln [ms 2]; pâ€™s < 0. 01). Low frequency HRV decreases started at âˆ’ 4 min (p < 0. 05). Ischemic events occurring at high mental activities were preceded by depressed high frequency HRV levels compared with events at low mental activity (p = 0. 038 at âˆ’ 4 min, p = 0. 045 at âˆ’ 2 min), whereas the effects of mental activities were not observed during nonischemic control periods. Heart rate variability measures remained significantly decreased for 20 min after recovery of ST-segment depression when events were triggered by high activity levels.

40|$|A novel inter-frame coding {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} varying channel-state conditions in broadcast wireless communication is developed in this paper; this problem causes the appropriate code-rate to vary across different transmitted frames and different receivers as well. The main aspect of the proposed approach is that it incorporates an iterative <b>rate-matching</b> process into the decoding of the received set of frames, such that: throughout inter-frame decoding, the code-rate of each frame is progressively lowered to or below the appropriate value, prior to applying or re-applying conventional physical-layer channel decoding on it.

Consequently, the data-rates achievable by the proposed scheme are derived. Overall, it is concluded that, compared to the existing solutions, inter-frame coding presents a better complexity versus data-rate tradeoff. In terms of complexity, the overhead of inter-frame decoding includes operations that are similar in type and scheduling to those employed in the relatively- simple iterative erasure decoding.

In the 13 patients, 22 of 25 echocardiographically defined wall segments (13 septa, nine posterior left ventricular walls) were supplied by coronary arteries with> 70 % stenosis and were compared with the corresponding 22 segments from the 11 normals. Mean systolic septal thickening increased in the 22 segments of normals from 56 Â± 3 % (SEM) at rest to 77 Â± 7 % in exercise (p < 0. 01) while in the patients ' 22 wall segments supplied by stenotic vessels the mean value fell during peak exercise from 59 6 to 35 Â± 3 % (p < 0. 005).

40|$|The technology-push of die {{stacking}} and application-pull of Big Data {{machine learning}} (BDML) {{have created a}} unique opportunity for processing-near-memory (PNM). This paper makes four contributions: (1) While previous PNM work explores general MapReduce workloads, we identify three workload characteristics: (a) irregular-and-compute-light (i. e., perform only a few operations per input word which include data-dependent branches and indirect memory accesses); (b) compact (i. e., the computation has a small intermediate live data and uses {{only a small amount}} of contiguous input data); and (c) memory-row-dense (i. e., process the input data without skipping over many bytes). We show that BDMLs have or can be transformed to have these characteristics which, except for irregularity, are necessary for bandwidth- and energyefficient PNM, irrespective of the architecture. (2) Based on these characteristics, we propose RowCore, a row-oriented PNM architecture, which (pre) fetches and operates on entire memory rows to exploit BDMLsâ€™ row-density. Instead of this row-centric access and compute-schedule, traditional architectures opportunistically improve row locality while fetching and operating on cache blocks. (3) RowCore employs well-known MIMD execution to handle BDMLsâ€™ irregularity, and sequential prefetch of input data to hide memory latency. In RowCore, however, one corelet prefetches a row for all the corelets which may stray far from each other due to their MIMD execution. Consequently, a leading corelet may prematurely evict the prefetched data before a lagging corelet has consumed the data. RowCore employs novel cross-corelet flow-control to prevent such eviction. (4) RowCore further exploits its flow-controlled prefetch for frequency scaling based on novel coarse-grain compute-memory <b>rate-matching</b> which decreases (increases) the processor clock speed when the prefetch buffers are empty (full). Using simulations, we show that RowCore improves performance and energy, by 135 % and 20 % over a GPGPU with prefetch, and by 35 % and 34 % over a multicore with prefetch, when all three architectures use the same resources (i. e., number of cores, and on-processor-die memory) and identical diestacking (i. e., GPGPUs/multicores/RowCore and DRAM) ...|$|R

Since {{there will be more}} users and higher data rates, the capacity must also be increased. This thesis studies channel coding and multiuser detection, two techniques that are of vital importance for designing a flexible system with high capacity and high quality. In {{the first part of the}} thesis optimum distance spectrum (ODS) convolutional encoders are presented. These encoders generate maximum free distance codes and have superior information error weights. Results show that the ODS codes outperform previously published maximum free distance codes at no extra cost. We next use the ODS encoders as parent encoders to find large and flexible families of multirate codes. These multirate codes are obtained both by puncturing and nesting of the parent ODS codes, and are shown to perform almost as well as unpunctured codes, and to be well suited for <b>rate-matching</b> in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems. A study of the performance of a number of multiuser detectors shows that such advanced receiver structures are quite sensitive to errors in phase and timing estimates. With parameter estimation errors the performance of all investigated detectors approach that of the conventional matched filter detector. This emphasizes even more the important role of channel coding in CDMA systems. A family of powerful very low-rate maximum free distance convolutional codes is found by nesting of rate 1 / 4 ODS codes. These codes are proposed for combined coding and spreading in CDMA systems, and are shown to be both more flexible and more powerful than previously known very low-rate convolutional codes. When applied in a CDMA system, we obtain significantly better performance than with a conventionally coded and spread scheme. Detailed investigations of parallel and successive interference cancellation in combination with channel code decoding show performance very close to the single user bound for the very low-rate code. All results with interference cancellation assume that decisions are taken before regeneration and subtraction of the signal. Accurate analysis of such non-linear interference cancellation is difficult. We therefore present iterative approximative analysis techniques that give results close to simulation results. Sequential decoding of convolutional codes is a suboptimum technique that makes it possible to decode very long constraint length codes and thus obtain very low error rates. We evaluate the performance of sequential decoding theoretically and by simulations for Rayleigh fading channels. A tailbiting coding scheme together with sequential decoding is proposed and shown to give improved throughput for wireless packet data transmission...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, new {{detection}} and modulation methods for multicarrier systems are presented. The proposed multicarrier detectors {{are based on}} feedback of previously detected symbols {{and the idea is}} to exploit the correlation, both in time between consecutive symbols, and in frequency between neighboring sub-carriers. This enables us to calculate a reliable channel estimate, to be used for coherent detection. The proposed detectors have significantly lower irreducible bit error probabilities compared to a conventional differential detector. Furthermore, a Parallel Combinatory - Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (PC-OFDM) system is proposed and analyzed. Here, some of the information bits select, in each symbol interval, a subset of the available sub-carriers. The selected sub-carriers are then modulated by points from an M-PSK signal constellation. PC-OFDM systems can be designed to have lower bit error probability on Gaussian channels, lower Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and higher bandwidth efficiency compared to conventional OFDM systems. The thesis is further focused on convolutional channel codes of multiple rates. New high-rate encoders obtained by puncturing, and low-rate encoders obtained by nesting are presented. These new codes are rate-compatible, they have higher constraint lengths and a wider range of code rates than what has previously been presented. The new codes are applied to a multicode direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) system and are shown to provide good performance and <b>rate-matching</b> capabilities. Further presented in this thesis is a family of very low-rate convolutional codes which all have maximum free distance. This low-rate family of codes are suited for bandwidth expansion instead of conventional direct-sequence spreading in CDMA systems. The performance of a CDMA system employing these very low-rate maximum free distance codes for combined coding and spreading is analyzed when successive or parallel interference cancellation is applied in the detector. Results show that the code spread system outperforms the conventionally spread system. Without interference cancellation in a multiuser system the single-user bound is never reached (except for one user). With two stages of parallel interference cancellation, a code-spread system with a load only slightly less than 1 bit/chip obtains a bit error rate very close to that of a single user system even for rather low signal-to-noise ratios. The thesis also derives a new metric for Turbo decoding on Rayleigh fading channels with noisy channel estimates. By including the error variance of the channel estimator in the decoder metric derivation, we calculate the correct channel reliability factor for this case. The gain by using this new metric, compared to what we obtain if we ignore the uncertainty of the channel estimator, may be as large as 1 dB at a bit error probability of 0. 001...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two of the most active fields of {{chemical}} physics. One is long-range charge transfer in complex molecular systems such as DNA, and another is quantum dissipation that is about the general theory of complex molecular system. Part I is on charge transfer in DNA molecules. Starting with the introduction of the standard electron transfer theory, we overview and summarize the current research status of charge transfer in DNA in both theory and experiment in Chapter 1. To build a bridge between theoretical calculations and experimental chemical yields, Chapter 2 presents a formulation based on a superexchange-mediated sequential hopping model. An exact mapping between the stationary chemical yields and the normalized electric currents is established, followed naturally by the Ohm's law for the kinetic multistep hopping processes. To determine the coherent unistep (superexchange) contributions, the scattering matrix technique is exploited. In order to examine the possibility and effects of partially incoherent tunneling in DNA systems, a generalized scattering matrix formalism is constructed in Chapter 3. This is a generalized BuÌˆttiker phase-breaking formalism that clearly elucidates the interplay of electron resonance, coherence, dephasing, inelastic scattering, and heterogeneity effects, which are known to be physically important in long range electron transfer/transport processes. Obtained is an analytical expression of partially incoherent tunneling probability in model donor-bridge-acceptor systems with arbitrary lengths and sequences. To take the effects of electronic structure and its incoherent interaction with aqueous solution into account, Chapter 4 gives a quantum chemistry based Greenâ€™s function formulation, and thus elucidates the mechanism of long-range charge transfer in DNA double helix at a microscopic level. Semiquantitive comparisons with experiments are also obtained. Part II is about the development of quantum dissipation theory, together its application to a general topic of quantum stochastic resonance transport. After a general overview of the background knowledge in Chapter 5, a Liouville-space algebraic approach is exploited in Chapter 6 to revisit and further bridge between two most commonly used quantum dissipation theories, the Bloch-Redfield theory and Fokker-Planck equations. The nature of the common approximation scheme involving in these two theories is analyzed in detail. With the general theory built on a solid basis, the cooperative effects of driving and dissipation on transport in a model two-level system is then studied in Chapter 7. Analyzed in detail are the <b>rate-matching</b> and Rabi resonance conditions for the tunneling stochastic resonance. Large amplitude transport is found near not only the fundametal-harmonics region, but also higher harmonic resonance vicinities. Demonstrations are carried out to highlight the interplay between the strength of dissipation, and the intensity and frequency of external driving field. Finally, we make a brief summary of this thesis research, followed by a discussion of future directions toward understanding structure dynamics correlation in complex molecular systems...|$|R
