40|$|In {{the railway}} {{industry}} asset management decisions {{are focused on}} the maintenance, enhancement and <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in order to ensure a required level of dependability and improvement in services at the lowest whole life costs. To achieve these objectives system lifecycle models, rather than individual asset models,= offer a greater advantage. The paper presents a modelling approach developed for constructing multi asset system models to support well-informed railway infrastructure asset management decisions. The models are built using the Petri Net formalism and are analysed by a means of Monte Carlo simulations. A specific example of the railway superstructure model is presented. Its simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the system-wide model against individual asset models in terms of its accuracy in predicting the superstructure (system) performance and information available to support asset management decisions. Furthermore, by using the multi-asset system model interdependencies among maintenance regimes of different assets and different parts of the infrastructure can be modelled...|$|E
40|$|Summary: In a large asset {{organisation}} the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> forms {{a significant}} portion of the ongoing annual capital works programme. Over recent years there has been an increasing focus by the energy regulators on evidence of prudent expenditure. The development of tools and processes that provide this objective evidence has become essential for the support of modern asset management practices. The approach taken by EnergyAustralia has been to develop concepts presented at past ICOMS conferences into a working repair/replace model with a simple user interface. This paper outlines the evolution of repair/replace decision making within EnergyAustralia by exploring the technical, financial and change management techniques required for practical implementation, and finally, reviews some practical examples via case studies. The model developed incorporates asset failure history to develop a view of the future risk of failure and total cost of ownership. It takes into account the realised and unrealised costs of the existing assets, and compares these to the expected costs of the replacement asset to provide a recommendation for the decision maker...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the emerging common movement toward proactive asset management for the nation’s infrastructure, {{in particular the}} water resources infrastructure (water, wastewater, and storm water treatment facilities, collection and distribution systems). Following decades of original capital investment, we now face a mounting financial burden to sustain that infrastructure. Appropriate <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> before reaching “dire-need” is the objective of proactive asset management. Failure to renew the infrastructure will lead to greater violations of water quality standards and greater costs for appropriate mitigation. The job must begin now if the water resources infrastructure is to be sustained or improved to an appropriate level of quality.

The information requests of integrated reporting users are described. The necessity of reflection {{of all types of}} capital, namely, natural, social, human and intellectual in the integrated reporting are revealed. The main advantages of compiling the integrated accounts for the enterprise are established: a broader perspective of consideration of the activity; the improvement of accounting policy as a result of integration of the principles of sustainable development into activity; increasing the trust of workers and consumers in the safety of technological processes and products for environment. For the wider introduction of the integrated reporting it is necessary to develop the methodological provision for accounting in accordance with the principles of sustainable development to ensure the reliability of the indices obtained; it is necessary to select the optimal list of indices that can meet the information needs of all users, in particular, investors, the state, auditors, society, creditors, consumers, employees, management personnel, academics, and the media. The main tasks and principles of compilation of the integrated reporting are presented. Orientation to the future, materiality, demand, integrity, reliability, completeness, periodicity, consistency, timeliness, interpretation, and comparability are suggested as the principles of integrated reporting. The issue of the necessity of conducting the external audit of the data verification of the integrity reporting is highlighted.

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of community buildings is a challenging task in Australia. Maintenance and <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> building <b>assets</b> is a prominent issue {{as a large}} number of buildings owned by local councils were built in 1970 s and become aged and deteriorated. Each building consists of a massive load of building components which adds complexity into their management. Limited asset management models in favor of buildings&# 039; decision making have further widened the gap in finding a reliable decision-making model for building maintenance and renewals. On the other hand, a majority <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> management models available are unable to cope with the uncertainty associated with the data collection which makes the results inconsistent and subjective. This paper presents a useful tool minimizing aforementioned problems and making asset planner&# 039;s life easier to prioritize maintenance actions.

In order to improve current sewer asset management, this study assesses the availability and use of information in decision-making for sewer system renewal in the Netherlands. Eighteen interviews were conducted at seven municipalities, combined with an analysis of their municipal sewerage plans. The interviewees described the decision-making process and the information sources they use in this process. Decisions for sewer system renewal are often based on intuition in implicit risk analyses, where risk is defined as ‘feeling times consequence’. Sewer asset management is ineffective, because it relies mostly on intuition, hampering justification, accountability and repetition of decisions and preventing evaluation. Evaluation procedures and a critical attitude towards relevancy and quality of information are recommended. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Most {{contemporary}} economic theories {{upon which}} conventional national accounting is based regard man-made assets as productive capital to be depreciated against {{the value of}} production. Such production, without replenishment or <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> or capital stock, is not sustainable. Natural resource assets, however, are not valued in the same way. There is no accounting mechanism to reflect the decrease in potential future pro duction as the resource diminishes or deteriorates. In 1993, the United Nations adopted its guidelines for a 'System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting' (SEEA), which allows for the adjustment of the System of National Accounts (SNA) for natural asset stripping and degradation, providing a format for national accounting which assesses the viability and sustainability of economic growth. The concept of an SEEA for South Africa was pursued in 1994 as a pilot study. The framework to be devel oped was termed the South African National Economic Environmental Planning (SANEEP) model. The framework {{can be used to}} predict the environmental impact, in terms of natural resource use and degradation, of economic growth, both nationally and at the sectoral level.

Hence, the SANEEP framework has the potential to become a broad-based, integrated environmental and economic planning tool.

Decisions about the way assets are managed are of utmost importance in achieving this. Timely <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>assets</b> supports reliability and maximum utilisation of infrastructure and enables business and community to grow and prosper. This research initially examined a framework for asset management decisions and then focused on asset renewal optimisation and renewal engineering optimisation in depth. This study had four primary objectives. The first was to develop a new Asset Management Decision Framework (AMDF) for identifying and classifying asset management decisions. The AMDF was developed by applying multi-criteria decision theory, classical management theory and life cycle management. The AMDF is an original and innovative contribution to asset management in that: · it is the first framework to provide guidance for developing asset management decision criteria based on fundamental business objectives; · it is the first framework to provide a decision context identification and analysis process for asset management decisions; and · it is the only comprehensive listing <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> management decision types developed from first principles. The second objective of this research was to develop a novel multi-attribute Asset Renewal Decision Model (ARDM) that takes account of financial, customer service, health and safety, environmental and socio-economic objectives. The unique feature of this ARDM is that it is the only model to optimise timing <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> <b>renewal</b> with respect to fundamental business objectives. The third objective of this research was to develop a novel Renewal Engineering Decision Model (REDM) that uses multiple criteria to determine the optimal timing for renewal engineering. The unique features of this model are that: · it is a novel extension to existing real options valuation models in that it uses overall utility rather than present value of cash flows to model engineering value; and · it is the only REDM that optimises timing <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> engineering with respect to fundamental business objectives; The final objective was to develop and validate an Asset Renewal Engineering Philosophy (AREP) consisting of three principles <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> <b>renewal</b> engineering. The principles were validated using a novel application of real options theory. The AREP is the only renewal engineering philosophy in existence.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} therapies predominantly use {{exposure to}} feared stimuli {{in the treatment}} of anxiety disorders. However, clients frequently experience a return of fear after treatment and this may increase the likelihood of relapse occurring. Return of fear via a renewal effect is the most frequently studied source of return <b>of</b> fear. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurs when the previously feared object is encountered in a context that is different to the treatment context. The present chapter reviews clinical-analogue studies that have investigated the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear. Prior research has confirmed the validity <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> as a mechanism for the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear in high fearful and phobic individuals. Moreover, prior research has shown that factors such as phobic cognitions and pre-treatment fear can predict the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurring. The review also highlights the methodologies used to detect <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear and subsequently reduce <b>renewal.</b> Applications <b>of</b> the research to reduce the return <b>of</b> fear via <b>renewal</b> following exposure therapy are discussed.
