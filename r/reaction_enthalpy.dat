The <b>reaction</b> <b>enthalpies</b> related to three antioxidant action mechanisms HAT, SET-PT and SPLET for substituted Magnolols have been calculated using DFT/B 3 LYP method in gas-phase and water. Calculated results show that electron-withdrawing substituents increase the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), ionization potential (IP) and oxidation/ reduction enthalpy (O/RE), while electron-donating ones cause {{a rise in the}} proton dissociation enthalpy (PDE) and proton affinity (PA). In ortho- position, substituents show larger effect on <b>reaction</b> <b>enthalpies</b> than in meta-position. In comparison to gas-phase, water attenuates the substituent effect on all <b>reaction</b> <b>enthalpies.</b> In gas-phase, BDEs are lower than PAs and IPs, i. e. HAT represents the thermodynamically preferred pathway. On the other hand, SPLET mechanism represents the thermodynamically favored process in water. Results show that calculated enthalpies can be successfully correlated with Hammett constants (σm) of the substituted Magnolols. Furthermore, calculated IP and PA values for substituted Magnolols show linear dependence on the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) ...|$|R

The CBS-QB 3 procedure also produces very good <b>reaction</b> <b>enthalpies,</b> but shows a systematic error in the reaction barriers.

The polarizability of the carbon nanotubes provides an interaction mechanism, which leads to the stabilization of confined dipolar species. Inside hydrogen-terminated (8, 0) and (9, 0) carbon nanotubes, the activation energy and reaction endothermicity for the Menshutkin SN 2 reaction are significantly reduced compared to those in the gas phase. Polarizable continuum models, using dielectric constants calculated from the carbon nanotube polarizabilities, are found to provide results in remarkable agreement with all electron nanotube-confined calculations, confirming the stabilization mechanism and offering a cost-effective approach for further exploration {{of the effects of the}} carbon nanotube environment. Overall, the effect of carbon nanotube confinement on <b>reaction</b> <b>enthalpies</b> closely resembles solvation in a low-dielectric solvent.
