Once they'd done this, it released their two teammates who would have to optain the other two blocks. One of these required climbing up an inflatable cone, on a <b>revolving</b> <b>part</b> of the stage and surrounded by moats of gunge, and the other was hidden in the gunge itself. The first team to acquire all 3 blocks and place them together would be the winner.|$|E
50|$|The <b>revolving</b> <b>part</b> of alternators {{can be the}} {{armature}} or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has {{the armature}} wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used. The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the slip ring connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{counter-rotating}} {{electrochemical machining}} (CRECM), a revolving cathode tool with hollow windows of various shapes {{is used to}} fabricate convex structures on a <b>revolving</b> <b>part.</b> During this process, the anode workpiece and the cathode tool rotate relative to {{each other at the}} same rotation speed. In contrast to the conventional schemes of ECM machining with linear motion of a block tool electrode, this scheme of ECM is unique, and has not been adequately studied yet. In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) is used to simulate the anode shaping process during CRECM, and the simulation process which involves a meshing model, a moving boundary, and a simulation algorithm is described. The simulated anode profiles of the convex structure at different processing times show that the CRECM process can be used to fabricate convex structures of various shapes with different heights. Besides, the variation of the inter-electrode gap indicates that this process can also reach a relative equilibrium state like that in conventional ECM. A rectangular convex and a circular convex are successfully fabricated on revolving parts. The experimental results indicate relatively good agreement with the simulation results. The proposed simulation process is valid for convex shaping prediction and feasibility studies as well...|$|E

60|$|One {{advantage}} of the method that I propose is this, that while {{we are able to}} produce a plain intermittent light; an intermittent light of variable period, ranging from a brief flash to a steady illumination of half the revolution; and finally, a light combining the immediate occultation of the intermittent with combination and change of colour, we can yet preserve comparative lightness in the <b>revolving</b> <b>parts,</b> and consequent economy in the driving machinery. It must, however, be noticed, that none of these last methods are applicable to cases where more than one radiant is employed: for these cases, either my grandfather's or Mr. Wilson's contrivance must be resorted to.|$|R

The effects of current density, translational speed and rotational speed on the deposit properties were studied by orthogonal test. The tensile strength, elongation and micro hardness value were measured to find out how the factors affected the properties. The optimized results show that changes of current density affect the tensile strength of nickel layer most, while translational speed has the most remarkable influences on both elongation and micro hardness. The low rotational speed affects the properties least. In this experiment, a smooth nickel layer with tensile strength 581  MPa, elongation 17 % and micro hardness 248 HV is obtained by the orthogonal test...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{two cases}} of traumatic closed index extensor tendon rupture at the musclotendinous junction. Both patients were injured when their work gloves {{were caught in}} the <b>revolving</b> <b>parts</b> of machines, and both were treated surgically. One of the patients completely ruptured the index extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendons at the musclotendinous junction of dorsal forearm. In this patient, the distal stump of the index EDC tendon was sutured to the middle EDC tendon in an end-to-side juncture. The other patient completely ruptured the EIP tendon and partially ruptured the index EDC tendon at the musclotendinous junction. In this patient, tendon transfer of the extensor digiti minimi (EDM) to the EIP tendon and plication of the index EDC tendon were performed. In both cases, surgical intervention enabled the patients to extend their index fingers almost normally; however, the former complained of inability to extend his index finger independently. Tendon transfer of the EDM in cases of index extensor tendon rupture at the musclotendinous junction is a good method to restore ability to independently extend the index finger. However, consideration should be given to anatomical variation in the little finger. The EDC tendon is sometimes absent leaving the EDM tendon as the only extensor tendon to the little finger...|$|R
