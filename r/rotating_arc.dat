30|$|Stream and {{rotating}} {{metal transfer}} occur at higher power ranges. The {{rotation of the}} molten metal {{is the result of}} longer electrode stick out (25 to 35  mm) and higher current and voltage, which cause stream metal to deflect out of its symmetry axis and start to rotate under magnetic forces. Although butt welding is the most typical application of <b>rotating</b> <b>arc</b> mode welding, a <b>rotating</b> <b>arc</b> can also be used in narrow gap welding. Heavy thick plates can be welded using this method. Due to the flexibility, efficiency, and productivity of this mode, it can be used in the manufacturing of large and heavy structural parts (Church and Imaizumi 1990). Although the process is reported by Church and Imaizumi (1990) as requiring quaternary shielding (He-Ni-CO 2 and O 2), which allows very limited tolerance, Suban and Tusek (2003) indicated that a binary shielding gas (argon and CO 2) could produce satisfactory results with optimized welding parameters. Full exploitation of its potential is in completely mechanized procedures (Masseti 2010). Large-scale bridge parts, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, and heavy cylindrical structures are some examples of its applications. A new development of the <b>rotating</b> <b>arc,</b> rotation that is not due to the magnetic effect but to special small rotating torches, makes it possible to apply a <b>rotating</b> <b>arc</b> mode to fillet welding in shipbuilding, bridges, etc. The mode is also suitable for low carbon steel plates (Iwata et al. 2009 a, b; Yang et al. 2009; Christensen et al. 2005).|$|E

30|$|Arc modes {{are related}} to arc voltage {{and the level of}} current. By {{changing}} these two parameters, the modes of the arc can be changed. With small current, the droplet does not form until it touches the weld pool; this mode of arc is a so-called short arc. The arc mode changes to a globular arc when the current is increased so that a small electromagnetic force is generated (Wang et al. 2004). In a globular arc, the diameter of the droplet is bigger than the electrode and the droplet is formed by the gravitational force. By further increasing the current, the type of arc changes to a projected spray arc, then a streaming arc, and finally a <b>rotating</b> <b>arc</b> (Li and Zhang 2007).

40|$|AbstractWe {{demonstrate}} that the apparent length of a thin white arc on a black disk, rotating concentrically at 2. 5 rps, varies with angular length and exposure duration. While short arcs (9 – 18 °) gradually expand, long arcs (36 – 72 °) first undergo a brief contraction, before they also expand. On average, perceived elongation asymptotes after 15 s equivalent to visual persistencies ranging from 68 to 170 ms. Using bi- and tri-colored arcs, {{we find that the}} apparent increase in length derives from the rear end of the rotating stimulus, while the initial shrinkage derives from contraction of the middle. After 15 s of adaptation, perceived length of the arc decays to actual stimulus length within an average of 6 s and, upon re-exposure of the arc, reaches its former value after only 5 s (priming). When the <b>rotating</b> <b>arc</b> is presented first to one eye and then to the other, apparent elongation transfers partially (46 %), suggesting a contribution by the binocular cells in the visual cortex. A partial transfer (26 %) also occurs from clockwise to counterclockwise rotation. When tested interocularly, the directional transfer is more pronounced (47 %) and equals the interocular transfer under equidirectional conditions, suggesting that the directional transfer (cw versus ccw) might derive from non-directional cortical units. Whereas the initial contraction may be attributable to backward masking, the observed elongation likely reflects a cumulative build-up of after-discharge in cortical neurons over time...|$|E

If the rectangular planes (the floating and transition spans) rotate relative to each other along hinge line DD’, the ends B and B’ of the wings will rise and the wings will rotate about their longitudinal edges, namely axes AB* and A’B’*, in order to maintain contact with the spans at points C and C'. As the wing ABC <b>rotates,</b> the <b>arc</b> will <b>rotate</b> about the chord line AB* so that it is no longer in the horizontal plane.

40|$|Thermal {{homogenization}} {{is essentially}} a transient problem and convective heat transfer by (chaotic) advection is known to accelerate this process. Convective heat transfer traditionally is examined in terms of heat-transfer coefficients at domain walls and characterised by Nusselt relations. However, though of proven worth, such Nusselt relations offer limited insight into the underlying thermal transport phenomena. This study seeks to address this by considering convective heat transfer from an alternative perspective. To this end, the temperature field is decomposed into a conductive and convective contribution, where the latter incorporates the impact of fluid motion. This representation enables explicit isolation and visualisation of the energy redistribution and energy fluxes induced by the flow and thus facilitates a more direct description and analysis of convective heat transfer compared to conventional methods. The alternative method is demonstrated for the <b>Rotated</b> <b>Arc</b> Mixer, a prototypical industrial mixer/heat-exchanger.

The deposited Cr 0. 38 Al 0. 56 Si 0. 06 N exhibited higher hardness of 41 +/- 2 GPa and higher H- 3 /E*(2) ratio of 0. 468 GPa than CrN due to the introduction of Al and Si to form a nanocrystalline structure.

The Cr 0. 38 Al 0. 56 Si 0. 06 N possessed much lower oxidation rate as measured by the oxide layer of the coatings. The addition of Al and Si in the coating may inhibit the formation of Cr 2 N phase and grain coarsening as found in the deposited CrN coating.

A <b>rotating</b> <b>arc</b> circuit breaker is described which uses an auxiliary current source to generate the magnetic field for driving the arc. Test results obtained using optical fiber measurement systems have shown that there are three main arcing phases. Initially the arc rotates at an essentially constant but low velocity, subsequently its velocity oscillates between this and much higher values, and finally the arc plasma may become diffuse in nature. Test results obtained with dielectric strength probes have indicated that a unidirectional flow of arc heated gas is generated. The flow is away from the moving contact of the interrupter so promoting good dielectric strength in this critical contact region. The combination of the optical fiber and dielectric probe results indicates two possible modes of gas pumping represented, respectively, by a fan and a piston-type action of the arc. Simplified analytical models for both modes are developed with predictions obtained showing good agreement with the experimental results. Discussion of experimental results suggests that the transition from oscillatory velocity changes to diffuse arcing represents an important parameter for scaling the geometries of future interrupters and arc heaters...|$|E
40|$|Passive scalar {{transport}} involves {{complex interactions}} between advection and diffusion, where the global transport rate depends upon scalar diffusivity {{and the values}} of the (possibly large) set of parameters controlling the advective flow.

By decomposing the flows within Q so as to exploit symmetries, we derive a spectral method that solves the ADE over Q three orders of magnitude faster than other methods of similar accuracy.

HGMs were soaked for 1 - 2 weeks and bioactivity was confirmed by the development of hydroxyapatite (HA) layer over the surface of HGMs. The HA formation was confirmed by the crystalline peak of HA obtained in X-ray diffraction spectra owing to the presence of crystalline calcium phosphate layer of HA, Ca- 10 (PO 4) (6) (OH) (2) as well as by determining weight percentage of corresponding elements by EDS Spectra. In vitro bioactivity of HGMs thus makes them biocompatible and renders them for use in orthopaedics field. They can contribute effectively when used in conjunction with metallic implants in order to enhance its mechanical strength as well as biocompatibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

One alternative to improve transport within such materials is chaotic advection, whereby Lagrangian chaos occurs within regular (non-turbulent) flows [J. M. Ottino, The Kinematics of Mixing: Stretching, Chaos and Transport, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989]. Complex interactions between chaotic advection and diffusion yields enhanced dispersion, and the topology of the Lagrangian dynamics is governed by the set of control parameters for the flow device. What parameter set maximises scalar dispersion for a given fluid rheology and diffusivity? Most studies to date have only considered a handful of points in the parameter space Q, but as this space may be large and the solution distribution complex (fractal), robust optimisation requires detailed global resolution of Q. By utilising a novel spectral method [D. R. Lester, G. Metcalfe, M. Rudman, H. Blackburn, Global parametric solutions of scalar transport, J. Comput. Phys. (2007). doi: doi: 10. 1016 /j. jcp. 2007. 10. 015] which exploits the symmetries often present in chaotic flows, we can resolve the asymptotic transport dynamics over Q, facilitating the identification of optima and elucidating the global structure of transport. We employ this method to optimize scalar transport for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in a chaotic mixing device, the <b>Rotated</b> <b>Arc</b> Mixer (RAM). Significant (up to sixfold) acceleration of scalar transfer is observed at Pecl&# 0233;t number Pe = 103, which furthermore increases with Pe...|$|R
