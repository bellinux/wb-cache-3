5|$|As a {{security}} measure, The Football Association secretly manufactured a <b>replica</b> of the trophy {{for use in}} exhibitions rather than the original. This <b>replica</b> was used on subsequent occasions up until 1970 when the original trophy had to be handed back to FIFA. Since FIFA had explicitly denied the FA permission to create a <b>replica,</b> the <b>replica</b> also had to disappear from public view and was for many years kept under its creator's bed. This <b>replica</b> was eventually sold at an auction in 1997 for £254,500, when it was purchased by FIFA. The high auction price, ten times the reserve price of £20,000–£30,000, was led by speculation that the auctioned trophy was not the <b>replica</b> trophy but the original itself. Subsequent testing by FIFA, however, confirmed the auctioned trophy was indeed a <b>replica</b> and FIFA soon afterwards arranged for the <b>replica</b> to be lent for display at the English National Football Museum, which was then based in Preston but is now in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|A <b>replica</b> Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale <b>replica</b> of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the <b>replica</b> {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The <b>replica</b> was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 a <b>replica</b> Rocket was {{commissioned}} from Robert Stephenson and Company by Henry Ford, using Stephenson's original construction techniques. It {{was intended as}} a centrepiece of the Henry Ford Museum, where it remains. Another fully functioning <b>replica</b> was built in the 1970s for the National Railway Museum. In 1999, to mark the 170th anniversary of the Rainhill Trials, the Trials were re-enacted on the Llangollen Railway using this <b>replica</b> and replicas of Novelty and Sans Pareil, the other serious contenders in 1829. Rocket again won.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Air and Space Museum (CASM), {{located at}} the former CFB Downsview, {{features}} a full-size <b>replica</b> Arrow built by volunteers with assistance from local aerospace firms. With a metal structure, the <b>replica</b> features many authentic-looking components including landing gear constructed by Messier-Dowty, the original Arrow primary landing gear sub-contractor. Painted in the colours of Arrow 25203, the Arrow <b>replica</b> was rolled out for a media event on 28 September 2006 and was on public display on 8–9 October 2006 to commemorate the original aircraft's rollout in 1957.|$|E

40|$|Byzantine fault {{tolerant}} state machine replication (BFT-SMR) is {{a foundation for}} implementations of highly reliable services. Existing algorithms for BFT-SMR require at least 3 f + 1 active <b>replicas</b> to tolerate f faulty <b>replicas.</b> We show that BFT-SMR can be achieved with fewer than 3 f + 1 active <b>replicas,</b> as long as standby spare <b>replicas</b> are available, such {{that the number of}} active <b>replicas</b> plus the number of spares is at least 3 f + 1. In particular, a single Byzantine fault can be tolerated with only three active <b>replicas</b> and a single standby spare. The spares are rarely used — only for reconfigurations triggered by faults or suspected faults. Each reconfiguration leads to a different subset of nodes running the active <b>replicas.</b> By reducing the number of active <b>replicas,</b> our algorithm reduces power consumption for processing and communication. It also has the potential to provide better performance. We present a 1 -resilient algorithm that achieves BFT-SMR with only three active <b>replicas</b> and one standby spare, and show the results of preliminary performance evaluation. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{authorities}} had initially {{planned for the}} <b>replica</b> to replace the red Berlayer Beacon, but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying the beacon was itself a heritage site {{and should not be}} destroyed because the beacon has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II. The <b>replica</b> was finally built just meters away from the beacon. The authorities hope the symbolic <b>replica</b> can serve to preserve the memory of Long Ya Men, which {{is an important part of}} Singapore's maritime history, for future generations and visitors familiar with the historical voyages of Zheng He.|$|E
5|$|The <b>replica</b> Endeavour visited various European ports before {{undertaking}} {{her final}} ocean voyage from Whitehaven to Sydney Harbour on 8 November 2004.

The <b>replica</b> Endeavour finally entered Sydney Harbour on 17 April 2005, having travelled , including twice around the world.

40|$|In {{determining}} the etched track rate in solid-state nuclear track detectors, track lengths should be determined accurately. A method based on surface profilometry is proposed {{to determine the}} track lengths in CR- 39 detectors through measurements of their <b>replicas.</b> Tracks from alpha particles with an incident energy of 4 MeV have been chosen to demonstrate the method. After irradiation and chemical etching, resin <b>replicas</b> were made from the tracks, of which the heights were measured by the Form Talysurf PGI Profilometer. The {{results showed that the}} surface of the <b>replicas</b> were smooth and the heights of the <b>replicas</b> were uniform, so the replicating fluid should have filled the tracks completely and the <b>replicas</b> truly reflected the dimensions of the tracks. The heights of the <b>replicas</b> were conveniently determined from the lateral view of the <b>replicas</b> generated by the Form Talysurf PGI Profilometer...|$|R

Despite {{the fact that}} the <b>replicas</b> are deployed in identicallyequipped computing nodes, under heavy load, some <b>replicas</b> would lag behind due to various reasons. Quickly recovering slow <b>replicas</b> is important because not doing so could result in reduced throughput, high jitters in end-to-end latency, and reduced replication degree...|$|R
