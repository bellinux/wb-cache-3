5|$|Plaque of Martyrs – The plaque {{came into}} being as the seal {{for the city of}} Lichfield. The disputed story of 999 Christian martyrs who were killed by the Romans under pagan Emperor Diocletian in Lichfield in 288 CE is {{depicted}} in the stonework of the monument. It was located {{on the front of the}} Guildhall until, in 1744 during the Victorian restoration of the Guildhall the plaque was taken down a placed in storage. It emerged again in 1864, when it was moved to a <b>rockery</b> on the eastern side of the Museum Gardens. It lay in the <b>rockery</b> falling into a state of disrepair until 2010 when it was restored and relocated onto a plinth in the Recreation Grounds. The seal can also be seen on the railway bridge at St John's Street.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in full sun or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a <b>rockery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} in the southeast were scarcely affected by the 19th century restoration apart from the chapel. Many of {{the walls of the}} 12th century tower have survived, partly rebuilt in the 15th century, and there are traces of a Romanesque chapel. The park was redesigned in the 19th century, enclosed in dry stone walls with several entrances. These have since been removed, as have the luxuriant gardens of the 18th century. Some traces remain in the form of boxwood, some alleys, the pools on the two terraces and the <b>rockery.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{complex is}} in the gardens of York House by {{the banks of the}} River Thames. The gardens have been laid out in an Italian style to give {{unrestricted}} frontal views of the statue complex from the entire width of the gardens. The statues are set in a <b>rockery</b> behind a pond, with trees and security fencing restricting side and rear views.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rockery</b> was {{designed}} and the whole complex installed by the British company of J Cheal & Sons who had {{to make their own}} interpretation as to the intended layout of the statues. Though they were able to incorporate all the statues into one tableaux, their interpretation of the sculptor's intended design has led to comments about the unusual poses of some of the statues, especially when viewed from the side.|$|E
50|$|For gardening, Lewisia {{species are}} usually planted in <b>rockeries</b> because this mimics their natural habitat. <b>Rockeries</b> also provide the free {{drainage}} that Lewisias need {{to prevent their}} roots rotting.

25|$|In 1770, {{the column}} and the double {{rectangular}} basin disappeared; the statue was {{integrated into a}} new decor, {{in the form of}} a stone niche in <b>rockery</b> style, originating from another dismantled fountain of Brussels. The water simply flowed through a grating in the ground, which was replaced by a basin, in the 19th century. In its new setting, Manneken Pis gives the impression of being smaller than in its original layout.|$|E
25|$|The Naked Ladies are {{a statue}} complex on a <b>rockery</b> and water cascade {{in the gardens}} of York House, Twickenham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. The larger than human size statues depict eight Oceanids {{and a pair of}} aquatic horses. They were carved in the fin de siècle style from white Carrara marble and {{probably}} came from Italy {{in the late nineteenth century}} or very early twentieth century. Originally they were part of a larger set of statues that was subdivided after the suicide of the initial purchaser.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} North-West University Botanical Garden spans {{less than three}} {{hectares}} more than a 1500 plant species can be found here. Most plants in the Botanical Garden are indigenous to South Africa {{with the exception of}} a few exotic plants which are kept for research or educational value. A large section of the garden, around a man-made ridge, is managed as a natural wooded grassland area. A variety of theme gardens make up the rest of the Botanical Garden, including the swamp garden, vlei garden, contemporary indigenous garden, vegetable and herb garden, invader display, plant evolution garden and succulent <b>rockery.</b> Some more common plant genera represented in the garden include Acacia, Aloe, Bonatea, Crinum, Dierama, Encephalartos, Eucomis, Eulophia, Euphorbia, Gasteria, Gladiolus, Haworthia, Hypoxis, Indigofera, Kniphofia, Plectranthus, Podocarpus, Polygala, Scadoxus, Searsia, Stapelia and Zantedeschia.|$|E

These scenes were filmed on 3 November, on the <b>rockery</b> at Sunny Heights, Starr's house in Weybridge, Surrey. Tony Barrow, the production manager for Magical Mystery Tour, recalls that, as [...] "a colourful conclusion" [...] to the segment, they set off fireworks that had been bought for the upcoming Guy Fawkes Night celebrations. The version of [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] appearing in the 2012 DVD release of Magical Mystery Tour is an alternative edit and includes some previously unused footage.

500|$|The {{gardens are}} home to a {{population}} of semi-tame grey squirrels and many species of birds. [...] Until 2006 a family of peacocks had been in residence for at least 70 years. [...] There are approximately 4,500 plants and trees in the collection, some of the varieties native to England and some {{from other parts of}} the world. Planting consists of large beds containing predominantly shrubs and trees, and lawns interspersed with individual trees. [...] Species of tree include a monkey puzzle tree along with oak and chestnut trees; three of the trees in the gardens are classed as United Kingdom champion trees. There is a <b>rockery</b> next to the Marygate entrance, by the ruins of the abbey church, and in front of the entrance to the Yorkshire Museum there is a terrace bordered with beds of white roses, the symbol of Yorkshire.|$|E
500|$|To the {{southeast}} of the hall is the stable block which partly surrounds a courtyard. [...] It has a south front of nine bays, the middle three of which project forwards and have a pediment carried on four large Doric pilasters. [...] The block originally had a cupola, but this has been removed. [...] A formal garden has been built between the east wing and the stable block. [...] Standing in this garden is a lead statue of a reclining, naked male figure, said to be Father Tiber, the river god. [...] This formerly stood in the Wilderness garden. [...] On {{the wall behind the}} statue are two carved unicorn heads, the emblem of the Legh family. [...] These formerly stood on pillars at the eastern entrance to the grounds. [...] The statues have been designated as a GradeII listed building. [...] A GradeII building is one that is [...] "nationally important and of special interest". [...] To the south of the formal garden is a stone statue of Napoleon carved by George Turner and dated 1837. [...] To the west of the hall is a ha-ha in rubble sandstone dating from the 18thcentury. It was built to act as a barrier between {{the west side of the}} garden and the deer park beyond it, and is listed GradeII. [...] Immediately to the south of the hall is a circular lawn, in the centre of which is a sundial that probably dates from about 1825. [...] Constructed in ashlar buff sandstone and standing on a pair of circular steps, it consists of an octagonal base with a partly fluted baluster supporting an octagonal moulded capstone. The capstone carries a copper plate inscribed with Roman numerals and the initials [...] "TL", and has a simple triangular gnomon. [...] The sundial is also listed GradeII. [...] Leading south from the lawn is a walk known as the Lime Avenue, which is entered through gates dated 1688. [...] The gates are in wrought iron and the piers in ashlar buff gritstone; these are again listed GradeII. [...] The avenue leads to another GradeII listed building, a structure known as the Shell House, so-called because its interior is decorated with shells and coloured mirrors. [...] It is a single-storey cottage constructed in red brick with buff sandstone dressings. [...] The roof is in stone-slate and the chimney is brick. [...] The wall is in brick with a stone coping. [...] In front of Shell Cottage another sundial, also listed GradeII. [...] This was probably built in the early 18thcentury for John Legh, and moved to its present position in the middle of that century. [...] It is thought that the pillar on which it stands was originally a Saxon cross base. [...] The octagonal copper plate is inscribed with Roman numerals, the longitude of Adlington, and John Legh's initials. [...] To the front of the Shell House is another walk, known as the Yew Walk. [...] At the back and side of the house is a <b>rockery.</b> [...] To the south and west of the Shell House is a wooded area known as the Wilderness, through which runs the River Dean (or Dene). [...] Many of the winding paths created by Charles Legh in the Wilderness are now overgrown, and some of the buildings are in a poor condition, or have collapsed into ruin. [...] One building still in good condition is the Tig House, a small square pavilion overlooking the river, an early example of a building in the Chinoiserie style. [...] It is constructed in red brick and partly clad in black and white timber framing. [...] It has a stone-slate pyramidal roof with a wooden finial, and is listed GradeII. [...] Near to this is the a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge crossing the river, but the summerhouse which once stood on the bridge is no longer present. [...] Another structure in the Wilderness is the Temple of Diana. [...] This is a circular temple with a dome constructed in ashlar buff sandstone. [...] It stands on a stylobate which supports six Doric columns and an entablature. [...] The structure is listed GradeII. [...] This appears to be in good condition, but in the early 2000s was said to be suffering from damp. [...] Other buildings known as the Rathouse and the Hermitage, have been damaged by falling trees. [...] At the north entrance to the grounds is a pair of gate piers that are listed GradeII. [...] The piers are in rusticated ashlar sandstone and are surmounted by ball finials. The gates are iron and are similar to those at the end of the lime avenue. [...] At the other end of the grounds, at the site of the former south approach, is a pair of sandstone gate piers dating from the middle of the 18th century. [...] They originally carried the carved unicorn heads that are now in the formal garden, and were left isolated when the route of the turnpike road was moved. [...] They are listed GradeII.|$|E

2500|$|As {{originally}} designed, {{the memorial}} {{consisted of a}} circular mound planted with shrubs and a <b>rockery</b> with streams and pools of water, two boulders with carved wording, and two stone pigeons. The pigeon sculptures have since been stolen and not replaced, and a fence has been added around the mound. One stone bears the words the other reads [...] The line A bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter is a quote from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament (...) [...] A metal panel next to the entrance gate in the fence repeats most of the details from the first stone. The stones, which were quarried in the Forest of Dean, were refurbished and repainted in 1999, and Worthing Borough Council continues to maintain the memorial.|$|E

These five elements can still be found in this garden. [...] The L Border, the Broad Walk and Beech Avenue form the main path through the gardens to the south which lead to the Monument. [...] Opposite Charlotte's Garden is the Topiary which leads to the Rose Garden. [...] This garden contains artifacts, including a Tea House, many of which were taken from the estate of Rostherne Manor. [...] To the south of the Rose Garden is the Tower Garden which contains a brick tower whose original purpose was to watch for sheep-stealing on the park land. [...] This garden also contains articles from Rostherne Manor. [...] Along the western border of the garden is the Arboretum which contains 880 plants in 281 species. [...] Its important trees include a Giant Redwood, a Weymouth Pine, a Mexican White Pine, an Ernest's Fir and a Chilean Incense Cedar.|$|E
2500|$|Adobe Creek drains about , arising at [...] on {{the northeastern}} flank of Black Mountain in Los Altos Hills, California. Adobe Creek {{was once a}} {{perennial}} stream, as evidenced by historical presence of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout young spend their first year in fresh water and obviously cannot survive in streams that run dry seasonally. Historically, lawsuits were filed to prevent diversion of creek water for irrigation because they caused the creek to run [...] "dry certain seasons of the year". A 1919 lawsuit against upstream creek diversion for [...] "alfalfa fields" [...] and [...] "hog wallows" [...] reads: [...] "From time immemorial...the waters of Adobe Creek have flowed into, over upon and through the lands...from Hidden Villa high in the hills, past the wonderful home gardens of Los Altos to the Santa Clara Valley {{and on to the}} sea...Charles K. Field mourns the loss of the song of the brook that made his garden with its <b>rockery</b> an enchanted spot; Shoup's children can no longer wade in the stream, because there is no stream to wade in; acres and acres of McCutchen's rhododendrons are now languishing and dying with unsatisfied thirst." [...] This written record confirms oral histories taken by local historian Don McDonald that Adobe Creek used to flow year-round. It is also consistent with Eleanor Cranston Fowle Cameron's (the sister of Senator Alan Cranston was born in 1909 and they lived on Cypress Court, north of West Edith Avenue in Los Altos Hills) account that in her youth the creek was perennial and that her [...] "father fished the steelhead that ran up from the Bay to the pool below the waterfall". On March 1, 1973 the State Water Resources Board (SWRB is now the California Department of Water Resources) granted water rights to the Purissima Hills Water District to withdraw 2.0 cubic feet per second (cfs) from the perennial reach where the SWRB had documented flows of 3.0 cfs on August 12, 1970, despite protestations by Robert and Mary Stutz who had rights to withdraw 0.005 cfs at Elena and Moody Roads, and Roy and Penny Lave who had rights to withdraw 0.008 cfs near Manresa Way and University Avenue. Today the creek's perennial sections are above Hidden Villa and between Foothill Expressway and Interstate 280 above the Manresa Way bridge.|$|E
