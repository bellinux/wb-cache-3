5|$|More recent classifications, the 2006 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Pediatric <b>Rheumatology</b> Society (PReS) classification, include palpable purpura as a {{mandatory}} criterion, together {{with at least}} one of the following findings: diffuse abdominal pain, predominant IgA deposition (confirmed on skin biopsy), acute arthritis in any joint, and renal involvement (as evidenced by the presence of blood and/or protein in the urine).|$|E
5|$|Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto {{to be close to}} Smythe's sand and gravel business, which operated a gravel pit north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair. (Smythe Park exists on the site today). In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor; a specialist in <b>rheumatology,</b> and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from a bleeding ulcer in 1971. Stafford's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn's death.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the American College of <b>Rheumatology</b> {{agreed on}} {{diagnostic}} criteria for scleroderma.|$|E

25|$|The 1999 American College of <b>Rheumatology</b> case {{definitions}} of neuropsychiatric syndromes in SLE do not define lupus headache, but rather propose several headache disorders {{loosely based on}} the International Headache Society (IHS) classification.|$|E
25|$|After {{eight years}} in an NHS general {{hospital}} as a consultant, Black opted for a move back into academic <b>rheumatology</b> by taking {{a job at the}} Royal Free teaching hospital in Hampstead, later becoming a professor and then the hospital's medical director. The <b>rheumatology</b> unit she established there has a strong interest in scleroderma: it is a national tertiary referral centre for patients suffering from the illness and is the major European centre for clinical research into the disease, with a particular focus on trying to understand the pathological process of fibrosis or scarring that characterises the condition at a histological level. The unit also has a strong tradition of high-quality teaching aimed at medical students and specialists-in-training.|$|E
25|$|Both {{minocycline}} and doxycycline {{have shown}} effectiveness in asthma due to immune suppressing effects. Minocycline {{as well as}} doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of <b>Rheumatology</b> guideline {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline.|$|E

25|$|Children with Kawasaki disease {{should be}} hospitalized {{and cared for}} by a {{physician}} who has experience with this disease. When in an academic medical center, care is often shared between pediatric cardiology, pediatric <b>rheumatology,</b> and pediatric infectious disease specialists (although no specific infectious agent {{has been identified as}} yet). Treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent damage to the coronary arteries.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Brazilian {{researchers}} Professors Domingos Baggio (an entomologist {{from the}} Biomedical Sciences Institute of the University of São Paulo), Paulo Yasuda (a microbiologist {{from the same}} institute) and Natalino Hajime Yoshinari (a physician from the <b>Rheumatology</b> Department at University of São Paulo's Medical School) started research on Lyme disease in Brazil, by suggestion of Dr. Allen Steere. At that time, LD was almost unknown among Brazilian physicians.|$|E
25|$|Neuropsychiatric syndromes {{can result}} when SLE affects the central or {{peripheral}} nervous system. The American College of <b>Rheumatology</b> defines 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric syndromes concurrent with SLE (now termed as NPSLE), {{is one of}} the most difficult challenges in medicine, because it can involve so many different patterns of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for signs of infectious disease or stroke.|$|E
25|$|The UC San Diego Medical Center is a well-regarded {{teaching}} hospital.

For the purpose of identifying people for clinical studies, a person has SLE if any 4 out of 11 symptoms are present simultaneously or serially on two separate occasions.|$|E
25|$|Sochi was {{established}} as a fashionable resort area under Joseph Stalin, who had his favorite dacha built in the city. Stalin's study, complete with a wax statue of the leader, is now open to the public. During Stalin's reign the coast became dotted with imposing Neoclassical buildings, exemplified by the opulent Rodina and Ordzhonikidze sanatoriums. The centerpiece of this early period is Shchusev's Constructivist Institute of <b>Rheumatology</b> (1927–1931). The area was continuously developed until {{the demise of the}} Soviet Union.|$|E

He did a one-year internship in internal medicine at Providence Hospital, Seattle, Washington, then a one-year residency at Presbyterian Hospital, San Francisco, California. From 1969-1970 Privitera took a Clinical Fellowship in Allergy, Immunology and <b>Rheumatology</b> at The Scripps Research Institute. He has practiced in Covina, California since 1970.|$|E
25|$|Fauci {{has made}} a number of basic {{scientific}} observations that contribute to the current understanding of the regulation of the human immune response, and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby immunosuppressive agents adapt to the human immune response. He has developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In a 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey of the American Rheumatism Association membership ranked the work of Fauci on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis {{as one of the most}} important advances in patient management in <b>rheumatology</b> over the previous 20 years.|$|E
25|$|Black's {{successful}} {{academic career}} in <b>rheumatology,</b> her NHS management role {{when she was}} medical director of her London teaching hospital, and her subsequent positions of influence (she chaired the Health Honours Committee between 2006 and 2009) gave Black a profile inside and outside medicine and led to her being championed {{by some as a}} leader of the profession and a role model for young women. Black was indubitably in the vanguard of the rise of women in medicine from the 1960s onwards: she became a consultant {{at a time when many}} women were entering medical school but few had become fully trained specialists, and this 'woman in a man's world' experience is something she is often asked to talk about.|$|E

25|$|With over 400 medical {{research}} facilities and 76 medical magazine indexes {{available in the}} country, Iran is the 19th country in {{medical research}} and is set to become the 10th within 10 years (2012). Clinical sciences are invested in highly in Iran. In areas such as <b>rheumatology,</b> hematology, and bone marrow trasplantation, Iranian medical scientists publish regularly. The Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center (HORC) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Shariati Hospital was established in 1991. Internationally, this center {{is one of the}} largest bone marrow transplantation centers and has carried out a large number of successful transplantations. According to a study conducted in 2005, associated specialized pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) services exist in almost all major cities throughout the country, where 43 board-certified or eligible pediatric hematologist–oncologists are giving care to children suffering from cancer or hematological disorders. Three children's medical centers at universities have approved PHO fellowship programs. Besides hematology, gastroenterology has recently attracted many talented medical students. The gasteroenterology research center based at Tehran University has produced increasing numbers of scientific publications since its establishment.|$|E
25|$|According to historians Lu Gwei-djen and Joseph Needham, {{there is}} {{substantial}} evidence that acupuncture may have begun around 600BC. Some hieroglyphs and pictographs from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced. However, historians Gwei-djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period. It is possible Bronze was used for early acupuncture needles. Tin, copper, gold and silver are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely, or to {{have been used in}} fewer cases. If acupuncture was practiced during the Shang dynasty (1766 to 1122BC), organic materials like thorns, sharpened bones, or bamboo may have been used. Once methods for producing steel were discovered, it would replace all other materials, since it could be used to create a very fine, but sturdy needles. Gwei-djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence, such as sharpened bones, bamboo or stones, were also used for other purposes. An article in <b>Rheumatology</b> said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of Ma-Wang-Dui from 198BC suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time.|$|E
