(Auxotrophs are usually not temperature-dependent. They can also depend on other factors.) Multiple auxotrophs can also coexist at the same time, within the same organism.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there were}} other less {{efficient}} forerunners to the methodology (such as paper, or multipronged arrays using wire brushes, toothpicks, etc.), the problem of reproducing bacterial colonies en masse in the same geometric configuration as on original agar plate was first successfully solved by <b>replica</b> <b>plating,</b> as implemented by Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg.|$|E
50|$|Esther Lederberg {{developed}} {{a method of}} <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> using velveteen attached to a piston ring.

Similar reports of the production of glycolipids BS by P. aeruginosa (Rf value 0.85) and P. cepacia (Rf value 0.9) are then in the literature (Silva et al. 2010, 2014).|$|R

5000|$|Esther Miriam Zimmer Lederberg (December 18, 1922 [...] - [...] November 11, 2006) was an American {{microbiologist}} and {{a pioneer}} of bacterial genetics. Notable contributions include {{the discovery of the}} bacterial virus λ, the transfer of genes between bacteria by specialized transduction, the development of <b>replica</b> <b>plating,</b> and the discovery of the bacterial fertility factor F (F plasmid).|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> {{is to be}} able to compare the master plate and any {{secondary}} plates, typically to screen for a desired phenotype. For example, when a colony that was present on the primary plate (or master dish), fails to appear on a secondary plate, it shows that the colony was sensitive to a substance on that particular secondary plate. Common screenable phenotypes include auxotrophy and antibiotic resistance.|$|E
50|$|Lederberg {{remained}} at the University of Wisconsin {{for most of the}} 1950s. It was there that she discovered lambda phage, did early research on the relationship between transduction and lambda phage lysogeny, discovered the E. coli F fertility factor with Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza (eventually publishing with Joshua Lederberg), devised the first successful implementation of <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> with Joshua Lederberg, and helped discover and understand the genetic mechanisms of specialized transduction. These contributions laid the foundation for much of the genetics work done {{in the latter half of}} the twentieth century.|$|E

5000|$|I {{wanted to}} respond to your {{question}} about <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> and who really invented it. I {{think it will be}} very difficult to answer that question in a convincing way. That technique was developed before I ever knew the Lederbergs ... I do know that Esther in all likelihood was responsible for getting the technique to actually work. She emphasized to me how important it was to use a particular kind of Italian velvet (or was it velveteen actually), so in my own mind I believe she was the key person in taking the idea to actual practice.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Replica</b> <b>plating</b> is a {{microbiological}} {{technique in}} which one or more secondary Petri plates containing different solid (agar-based) selective growth media (lacking nutrients or containing chemical growth inhibitors such as antibiotics) are inoculated with the same colonies of microorganisms from a primary plate (or master dish), reproducing the original spatial pattern of colonies. The technique involves pressing a velveteen-covered disk, and then imprinting secondary plates with cells in colonies removed from the original plate by the material. Generally, large numbers of colonies (roughly 30-300) are replica plated due to the difficulty in streaking each out individually onto a separate plate.|$|E
50|$|Another {{prominent}} scientist inspired {{directly by}} Dodge was Esther Lederberg, {{who worked with}} him at the New York Botanical Garden as an intern while she was an undergraduate at Hunter College, Lederberg (née Esther Miriam Zimmer) worked with Dodge under three scholarships between 1941 and 1942, conducting research in heterokaryosis in Neurospora tetrasperma. She wrote her Master's thesis on Neurospora crassa and published two papers on Neurospora crassa before beginning her studies of the bacterium Escherichia coli, and her highly influential development of <b>replica</b> <b>plating,</b> the discovery of fertility factor F (inheritable sex change due to viral infection), temperate lambda bacteriophage, and her pioneering work in transduction.|$|E

5000|$|In 1958, Joshua Lederberg {{shared a}} Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George Beadle and Edward Tatum. Microbiologists Joshua Lederberg {{and his wife}} Esther Lederberg, along with Beadle and Tatum, {{developed}} <b>replica</b> <b>plating,</b> a method of transferring bacterial colonies from one petri dish to another, which is vital to current understanding of antibiotic resistance. However, Esther Lederberg was not recognized for her vital work on this research project; her contribution was paramount to the successful implementation of the theory. Furthermore, she did not receive recognition for her discovery of the lambda phage or for her studies on the F fertility factor that created a foundation for future genetic and bacterial research.|$|E
5000|$|It was brilliantly simple: {{creative}} discoveries often are. She {{thought of}} using ordinary velveteen from a yard goods store {{to serve as}} a kind of rubber stamp. The tiny fibers of the velveteen acted like hundreds of tiny inocculating needles. The pad was carefully kept in the same orientation and used to inocculate a series of agar plates containing different media containing antibiotics or supplemented with essential nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins. Esther and Joshua used this technique as an indirect selective method to prove the spontaneous origin of mutants with adaptive advantages. ...All of these things foreshadowed our first meeting and I was appropriately in awe of her. I was just starting to use <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> in my own work and Esther immediately told me what brand of velveteen to look for and to be sure to wash the velveteen before I used them and even what detergent to use to wash them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Replica</b> <b>plating</b> is {{especially}} useful for [...] "negative selection". However, {{it is more}} correct to refer to [...] "negative screening" [...] instead of using the term 'selection'. For example, if one wanted to select colonies that were sensitive to ampicillin, the primary plate could be replica plated on a secondary Amp+ agar plate. The sensitive colonies on the secondary plate would die but the colonies could still be deduced from the primary plate since the two have the same spatial patterns from ampicillin resistant colonies. The sensitive colonies could then be picked off from the primary plate. Frequently the last plate will be non-selective. In the figure, a nonselective plate will be replica plated after the Amp+ plate {{to confirm that the}} absence of growth on the selective plate is due to the selection itself and not a problem with transferring cells. If one sees growth on the third (nonselective) plate but not the second one, the selective agent is responsible for the lack of growth. If the non-selective plate shows no growth, one cannot say whether viable cells were transferred at all, and no conclusions can be made about {{the presence or absence of}} growth on selective media. This is particularly useful if there are questions about the age or viability of the cells on the original plate.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{measuring}} fabric wrinkle based on integrating photometric stereo and image analysis techniques. In the traditional method, wrinkled fabrics are evaluated sujectively {{according to the}} grades of <b>replica</b> <b>plates</b> supplied by the American Association of Textile Chemist and Colorist (AATCC). But due to the disadvantages of subjective methods, which are tedious, time-consuming, subjective, and so on, image analysis techniques are used in this work as an objective method. However, serious problem occur when colored and patterned fabrics are tested with conventional images and processing techniques, although they work for tests of solid fabrics. In this paper, a photometric stereo method is used to extract three-dimensional surface of fabrics and successfully eliminate the influence of color and pattern. Image analysis techniques are furtherd to extract wrinkling features of these reconstructed 3 D images, {{and there is a}} good linear correlation between objective parameters and subjective AATCC grades.

50|$|The {{results of}} Luria and Delbrück were {{confirmed}} in more graphical, but less quantitative, way by Newcombe. Newcombe incubated bacteria in a Petri dish {{for a few}} hours, then <b>replica</b> <b>plated</b> it onto two new Petri dishes treated with phage. The first plate was left unspread, and the second plate was then respread, that is, bacterial cells were moved around allowing single cells in some colony to form their own new colonies. If colonies contained resistant bacterial cells before entering {{into contact with the}} phage virus, one would expect that some of these cells would form new resistant colonies on the respread dish and so to find a higher number of surviving bacteria there. When both plates were incubated for growth, there were actually as much as 50 times greater number of bacterial colonies on the respread dish. This showed that bacterial mutations to virus resistance had randomly occurred during the first incubation. Once again, the mutations occurred before selection was applied.|$|R
40|$|Protoplasts {{of genetically}} marked {{derivatives}} of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8325 were fused with polyethylene glycol and regenerated without selection.

The results of these 9 - and 10 -factor crosses were entered directly into a programmed microcomputer from prescored <b>replica</b> <b>plates.</b> The data then were condensed into an array of phenotypes, together with {{the frequency with which}} each occurred. Further analyses by computer included the calculation of coinheritance frequencies for all possible pairs of markers; after entering a proposed order for the markers being analyzed, the minimum number of crossover events required to generate each phenotypic class was calculated. The linkage relationships of markers, based on the protoplast fusion data, were entirely consistent with the linkage relationships of markers already known to exist within each of the three linkage groups previously defined by transformation. The fusion data defined an arrangement of the three linkage groups into a circular chromosome map and predicted the approximate location of four previously unmapped markers (tet- 3490, fus- 149, purC 193 ::Tn 551, and omega [Chr::Tn 551] 42) on this map...|$|R

40|$|<b>Replica</b> <b>plating</b> can be {{used for}} the {{detection}} of antibiotic resistance in normal flora. We have evaluated this application of the <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> method by comparing it with a five-colony method. The <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> method uses a single plate for each antibiotic, with a concentration just above that for borderline resistance. By the five-colony method, five colonies per sample were picked, chosen to represent all different colony morphologies present, and MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution method. The gram-negative, aerobic floras of 131 fecal samples were screened for resistance to ampicillin, cefuroxime, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline by both methods. The rate of resistance detection by the two methods did not differ statistically for any of the antibiotics tested. The breakpoint concentrations used for the replica plates in the study gave results similar to those produced by the agar dilution method and the breakpoint values of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and can thus be recommended. As the only currently used resistance detection method, <b>replica</b> <b>plating</b> facilitates an exact determination of the percentage of resistant colonies/total number of colonies (between 1 and 100 %) in a sample. This revealed an uneven distribution, with only 23 % of the samples having resistance frequencies in the range of 10 to 85 %; usually, the resistant flora either was a small minority or was very dominant in samples with resistance. This phenomenon was present for all of the antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Enterococci are Gram-positive, facultative {{anaerobic}} cocci. They {{are found in}} many environments (including milk and dairy products, vegetables, plants, cereals, and meats). Enterococci are considered commensal organisms, but can also be opportunistic pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality of humans and animals. A longitudinal study of antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus to ampicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline was conducted on an academic teaching farm. Environmental samples were collected by drag swabs at select locations prior to and after the introduction of livestock. All samples were initially processed and screened with specialized media, and then <b>replica</b> <b>plated</b> on tryptic soy agar containing a predetermined amount of antibiotic. There was some variation in the quantity of bacterial and antibiotic-resistant colonies; however, resistance to tetracycline was extremely high. The increases of too numerous to count populations were not time-dependent and appeared consistently after the placement of cows. There is little information on the prevalence and epidemiology of antibiotic resistance of Enterococci outside of the hospital setting, including on dairy farms.
