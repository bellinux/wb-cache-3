25|$|By 1973, Ashley formed his own {{short-lived}} folk-rock outfit <b>Ragged</b> <b>Robin,</b> with Richard Byers, Brian Diprose and John Thompson. They {{performed in}} clubs and colleges, and at Cambridge Folk Festival, and also held a residency at Roy Guest’s Howff in London’s Primrose Hill.|$|E
25|$|In {{the small}} marshlands, some sedges and the <b>ragged</b> <b>robin</b> may be seen. Here {{is the most}} nutritious soil on Amrum. Even the soil of Amrum's gardens is so low in {{nutrients}} that only few sorts of plants, e.g. hollyhock, will grow there without fertilising.|$|E
25|$|Nova Meadow is damp area {{containing}} moisture loving plants including lady's smock, common tussock grass, meadowsweet, <b>ragged</b> <b>robin</b> {{and yellow}} flag iris. A pond {{was created in}} 2003 to attract wildlife and {{the southern part of}} the meadow has reverted to scrubland creating a habitat for yellowhammers and linnets. In autumn it attracts thrushes, fieldfares and redwings which feed on the hawthorn berries.|$|E

There are flowers!' and she proudly {{exhibited}} a cup holding some <b>ragged</b> <b>robins,</b> dead nettles, and other common flowers which a country child would have held cheap. He admired and gained more of her confidence, so that {{she had begun to}} chatter away quite freely about 'the high, high hills that reached up to the sky, and the pretty stones,' till the door opened, and Mrs. Dixon and Bustle made their entrance.|$|R
60|$|May, {{beautiful}} May, {{had brought}} the golden flowers, and {{the trees in the}} valley behind the sleepy old town of Calcombe Pomeroy were decking themselves in the first wan green of their early spring foliage. The <b>ragged</b> <b>robins</b> were hanging out, pinky red, from the hedgerows; the cuckoo was calling from the copse beside the mill stream; and the merry wee hedge-warblers were singing lustily from the topmost sprays of hawthorn, with their full throats bursting tremulously in the broad sunshine. And Ernest Le Breton, too, filled with the season, had come down from Dunbude for a fortnight's holiday, on his premised visit to his friend Oswald, or, to say the truth more plainly, to Oswald's pretty little sister Edie. For Ernest had fully made up his mind by this time what it was he had come for, and he took the earliest possible opportunity of taking a walk with Edie alone, through the tiny glen behind the town, where the wee stream tumbles lazily upon the big slow-turning vanes of the overshot mill-wheel.|$|R
5000|$|Lychnis flos-cuculi forms a rosette of low growing foliage with {{numerous}} flower stems 20 to 90 cm tall. The stems {{rise above the}} foliage and branch {{near the top of}} the stem and end with the pink flowers which are 3-4 cm across. The flowers have five narrow petals deeply divided into four lobes giving the flower an untidy, ragged appearance, hence its common name. The [...] calyx tube is five-toothed with ten stamens. The leaves are paired, with the lower leaves spoon-shaped and stalked. The middle and upper leaves are linear-lanceolate with pointed apexes. All of the leaves are untoothed. The stems have barbed hairs pointing downward and these hairs make the plant rough to the touch. <b>Ragged</b> <b>Robins</b> bloom from May to August, occasionally later, and butterflies and long-tongued bees feed on the flowers nectar. Nevertheless, the flowers are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome. The fruits consist of small (6-10 mm) capsules opening on top by five teeth and containing many small seeds, they are found on the plants from August onwards.|$|R
500|$|As {{a result}} of their wetland nature, the Moors and Levels contain a rich {{biodiversity}} of national and international importance. They support a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold, meadowsweet, and <b>ragged</b> <b>robin.</b> The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan, Eurasian curlew, common redshank, skylark, common snipe, common teal, wigeon, and whimbrel, as well as birds of prey including the marsh harrier and peregrine falcon. [...] A wide range of insect species is also present, including rare invertebrates, particularly beetles including the lesser silver water beetle, Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni, and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important otter population. Water voles (Arvicola amphibius) are being encouraged to recolonise areas of the Levels where they have been absent for 10years, by the capture of mink (Mustela vison).|$|E
500|$|The Parrett then {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, which {{contains}} a rich biodiversity of national and international importance. It supports a vast variety of plant species, including common plants such as marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) and <b>ragged</b> <b>robin</b> (Lychnis flos-cuculi). The area is an important feeding ground for birds including Bewick’s swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), common redshank (Tringa totanus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), common teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), as well as birds of prey including the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). A wide range of invertebrate species is also present including rare insects, particularly the hairy click beetle (Synaptus filiformis), which until recently was only known in Britain from the Parrett, and other insects, including the lesser silver water beetle (Hydrochara caraboides), Bagous nodulosus, Hydrophilus piceus, Odontomyia angulata, Oulema erichsoni and Valvata macrostoma. In addition, the area supports an important European otter (Lutra lutra) population. 282 American mink (Mustela vison) have been captured after their escape from breeding farms, which is encouraging water voles (Arvicola amphibius) to recolonise areas of the Levels {{where they have been}} absent for 10years. The Levels and Moors include 32 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (twelve of them also Special Protection Areas), the Huntspill River and Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserves, the Somerset Levels and Moors Ramsar Site covering about , the Somerset Levels National Nature Reserve, Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve, and numerous Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In addition, some [...] of the Levels are recognised as an environmentally sensitive area, while other portions are designated as Areas of High Archaeological Potential. Despite this, there is currently no single conservation designation covering the entire area of the Levels and Moors.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Ashley {{celebrated his}} 60th {{birthday}} {{with a special}} concert with Robert Kirby conducting his arrangements for a six-piece chamber orchestra. Also taking part were Ashley’s friends from Fairport: Dave Pegg, Chris Leslie, Simon Nicol and Martin Allcock, plus Show of Hands’ Phil Beer, Planxty’s Johnny Moynihan, Brass Monkey’s Martin Brinsford and many other friends, including his old partners from The Tinderbox, <b>Ragged</b> <b>Robin</b> and the Steve Ashley Band. The event was recorded and released six months later as Live in Concert on Dusk Fire Records. Then in 2007 Ashley released his second album for Topic, Time and Tide, with three new string arrangements by Robert Kirby. From this collection one song [...] "Best Wishes" [...] was recorded by Fairport Convention and the female trio Grace Notes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou liest!" [...] quoth {{the one who}} {{pretended to}} be blind and who, being the lustiest villain, {{was the leader of}} the others, [...] "thou liest! For thou hast come among us as a vile spy. But thine ears have heard too much for thy body's good, and thou goest not forth from this place unless thou goest feet foremost, for this day thou shalt die! Come, brothers, all together! Down with him!" [...] Then, {{whirling}} up his cudgel, he rushed upon Robin as an angry bull rushes upon a red <b>rag.</b> But <b>Robin</b> was ready for any happening. [...] "Crick! Crack!" [...] he struck two blows as quick as a wink, and down went the Blind man, rolling over and over upon the grass.|$|R
60|$|At Northchapel Mr. Hoopdriver {{consulted}} his map {{and took}} counsel and weighed his course of action. Petworth seemed a possible resting-place, or Pullborough; Midhurst seemed too near, and any {{place over the}} Downs beyond, too far, and so he meandered towards Petworth, posing himself perpetually and loitering, gathering wild flowers and wondering why they had no names--for {{he had never heard}} of any--dropping them furtively {{at the sight of a}} stranger, and generally 'mucking about.' There were purple vetches in the hedges, meadowsweet, honeysuckle, belated brambles--but the dog-roses had already gone; there were green and red blackberries, stellarias, and dandelions, and in another place white dead nettles, traveller's-joy, clinging bedstraw, grasses flowering, white campions, and <b>ragged</b> <b>robins.</b> One cornfield was glorious with poppies, bright scarlet and purple white, and the blue corn-flowers were beginning. In the lanes the trees met overhead, and the wisps of hay still hung to the straggling hedges. Iri one of the main roads he steered a perilous passage through a dozen surly dun oxen. Here and there were little cottages, and picturesque beer-houses with the vivid brewers' boards of blue and scarlet, and once a broad green and a church, and an expanse of some hundred houses or so. Then he came to a pebbly rivulet that emerged between clumps of sedge loosestrife and forget-me-nots under an arch of trees, and rippled across the road, and there he dismounted, longing to take off shoes and stockings--those stylish chequered stockings were now all dimmed with dust--and paddle his lean legs in the chuckling cheerful water. But instead he sat in a manly attitude, smoking a cigarette, for fear lest the Young Lady in Grey should come glittering round the corner. For the flavour of the Young Lady in Grey was present through it all, mixing with the flowers and all the delight of it, a touch that made this second day quite different from the first, an undertone of expectation, anxiety, and something like regret that would not be ignored.|$|R
2500|$|Aside {{from his}} own albums, and the bands of which he has officially been a member, Steve Ashley has also {{performed}} on stage, TV, radio and recording sessions with a number other musicians. In 1968, with Tinderbox, Ashley recorded a live radio session with folk singer Shirley Collins for John Peel’s Night Ride programme on BBC Radio 1. In 1973, {{at the request of}} folk singer Anne Briggs, <b>Ragged</b> <b>Robin</b> collaborated with her on arrangements and recording sessions for her album Sing a Song for You. In 1974 Ashley recorded a live session of his songs for Capital Radio’s [...] "Sarah and Friends" [...] with Simon Nicol (guitar), Dave Pegg (bass), Dave Mattacks (drums) and Lea Nicholson (concertina). [...] In the same year he recorded a single, [...] "Old Rock ‘n’ Roll" [...] (for Gull Records) with backing from Fairport Convention. [...] In 1975 he recorded his songs [...] "Old John England" [...] and [...] "Fire and Wine" [...] for BBC Two’s show The People’s Echo in a band with Dave Pegg (bass), Richard Byers (guitar) and Bob Critchley (drums). In 1978 Ashley formed the first line-up of The Steve Ashley Band for a one-off show at Rotterdam Folk Festival, with ex-Decameron members, Dik Cadbury (bass), Bob Critchley (drums), Al Fenn (guitar) and Chris Leslie (fiddle). For some ten years after this show, Ashley and Leslie performed together intermittently in an acoustic duo.|$|E

60|$|William {{came home}} again with his {{sweetheart}} at the Whitsuntide. He had one week of his holidays then. It was beautiful weather. As a rule, William and Lily and Paul {{went out in}} the morning together for a walk. William did not talk to his beloved much, except to tell her things from his boyhood. Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all three, in a meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm, was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping from the hedges; penny daisies and <b>ragged</b> <b>robin</b> were in the field, like laughter. William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a bit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while she fingered with his hair. Paul went gathering the big daisies. She had taken off her hat; her hair was black as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded daisies in her jet-black hair--big spangles of white and yellow, and just a pink touch of <b>ragged</b> <b>robin.</b>|$|E
60|$|They started, but {{presently}} {{they came}} to high banks that showed such masses of bluebells, <b>ragged</b> <b>Robin,</b> great stitchwort and the like that Belinda {{was not to be}} restrained. She clamoured to stop the car and go up the bank and pick her hands full, and so they drew up by the roadside and Sir Richmond and Miss Grammont sat down near the car while Belinda carried her enthusiastic onslaught on the flowers up the steep bank and presently out of earshot.|$|E
60|$|So {{that she}} stood before her class unwilling to give {{herself up to}} the {{activity}} of teaching, to turn her energy, that longed {{for the country and}} for joy of early summer, into the dominating of fifty children and the transferring to them some morsels of arithmetic. There was a little absentness about her. She could not force herself into forgetfulness. A jar of buttercups and fool's-parsley in the window-bottom kept her away in the meadows, where in the lush grass the moon-daisies were half-submerged, and a spray of pink <b>ragged</b> <b>robin.</b> Yet before her were faces of fifty children. They were almost like big daisies in a dimness of the grass.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. You {{see that}} if the outside leaves are to grow last, they may {{conveniently}} grow two at a time; which they accordingly do, and exogens always start with two little {155} leaves from their roots, and may therefore conveniently be called two-leaved; which, if you please, we will for our parts call them. The botanists call them 'two-suckered,' and can't be content to call them that in English; but drag in a long Greek word, meaning the fleshy sucker of the sea-devil,--'cotyledon,' which, however, I find is practically getting shortened into 'cot,' {{and that they will}} have to end by calling endogens, monocots, and exogens, bicots. I mean steadily to call them one-leaved and two-leaved, for this further reason, that they differ not merely in the single or dual springing of first leaves from the seed; but in the distinctly single or dual arrangement of leaves afterwards on the stem; so that, through all the complexity obtained by alternate and spiral placing, every bicot or two-leaved flower or tree is in reality composed of dual groups of leaves, separated by a given length of stem; as, most characteristically in this pure mountain type of the <b>Ragged</b> <b>Robin</b> (Clarissa laciniosa), Fig. 18; and compare A, and B, Line-study II.; while, on the other hand, the monocot plants are by close analysis, I think, always resolvable into successively climbing leaves, sessile on one another, and sending their roots, {156} or processes, for nourishment, down through one another, as in Fig. 19.|$|E
6000|$|... 9. Economy {{of time is}} very {{important}} both to the insects and the flowers, because the fine working days are comparatively few, and if no time is wasted the bees will get more honey, {{and in doing so}} will fertilise more flowers. Now, it has been ascertained by several observers that many insects, bees especially, keep to one kind of flower at a time, visiting hundreds of blossoms in succession, and passing over other species that may be mixed with them. They thus acquire quickness in going at once to the nectar, and the change of colour in the flower, or incipient withering when fertilised, enables them to avoid those flowers that have already had their honey exhausted. It is probably to assist the insects in keeping to one flower at a time, which is of vital importance to the perpetuation of the species, that the flowers which bloom intermingled at the same season are usually very distinct both in form and colour. In the sandy districts of Surrey, in the early spring, the copses are gay with three flowers--the primrose, the wood-anemone, and the lesser celandine, forming a beautiful contrast, {{while at the same time}} the purple and the white dead-nettles abound on hedge banks. A little later, in the same copses, we have the blue wild hyacinth (Scilla nutans), the red campion (Lychnis dioica), the pure white great starwort (Stellaria Holosteum), and the yellow dead-nettle (Lamium Galeobdolon), all distinct and well-contrasted flowers. In damp meadows in summer we have the <b>ragged</b> <b>robin</b> (Lychnis Floscuculi), the spotted orchis (O. maculata), and the yellow rattle (Rhinanthus Crista-galli); while in drier meadows we have cowslips, ox-eye daisies, and buttercups, all very distinct both in form and colour. So in cornfields we have the scarlet poppies, the purple corn-cockle, the yellow corn-marygold, and the blue cornflower; while on our moors the purple heath and the dwarf gorse make a gorgeous contrast. Thus the difference of colour which enables the insect to visit with rapidity and unerring aim a number of flowers of the same kind in succession, serves to adorn our meadows, banks, woods, and heaths with a charming variety of floral colour and form at each season of the year.[149] ...|$|E
