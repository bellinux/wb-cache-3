5|$|In November 2007, {{several former}} Chiefs of Defenceincluding General Lord Guthrie, Admiral Lord Boyce, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Craig, Field Marshal Lord Bramall and Field Marshal Lord Ingecriticised Brown for departing from the {{military}} covenanta convention within British politics stating that in exchange for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> {{for the sake of}} national security, members of the armed forces should be suitably looked after by the government. Brown was accused by senior opposition politicians, including Conservative leader David Cameron, and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats of failing to provide proper support for soldiers and their families.|$|E

25|$|Since independence, Armenia has {{received}} support from Israel and today {{remains one of}} its major trade partners. While both countries have diplomatic relations, neither maintains an embassy in the other country. Instead, Ehud Moshe Eytam, the Israeli ambassador to Armenia is based in Tbilisi, Georgia, and visits the capital Yerevan twice a month. Israel has recognized 10 Armenians as Righteous Among the Nations for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to save Jews during the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|The Diaspora {{population}} of Ireland {{also got a}} fresh start on the islands of New Zealand during the later half of the 19th century. The ideology of striking it rich in the gold mines caused many Irish people to flock to the docks; <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> on the long voyage to potential freedom and more importantly self-sufficiency. Most famous places including both Gabriel's Gully and Otago are examples of mining sites which, with the funding of large companies, allowed {{for the creation of}} wages and the appearance of mining towns. Women found jobs as housemaids cleaning the shacks of the single men at work thereby providing a second income to the Irish family household. The subsequent money accumulated with regards to this would allow for chain migration {{for the rest of the}} family left behind.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, {{the army}} awarded 24 Medals of Honor to {{participants}} in the fight on the bluffs for bravery, most for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to carry water from the river {{up the hill to}} the wounded. Few on the non-Indian side questioned the conduct of the enlisted men, but many questioned the tactics, strategy and conduct of the officers. Indian accounts spoke of soldiers' panic-driven flight and suicide by those unwilling to fall captive to the Indians. While such stories were gathered by Thomas Bailey Marquis in a book in the 1930s, it was not published until 1976 because of the unpopularity of such assertions. Although soldiers may have believed captives would be tortured, Indians usually killed men outright and took as captive for adoption only young women and children. Indian accounts also noted the bravery of soldiers who fought to the death.|$|E

25|$|Jack {{has lost}} his {{seafaring}} father on board the Kyleclare, sunk by a U-boat on this same route, and goes to sea to support his family. His innate decency makes him join in this dangerous rescue of members of a navy whom he passionately hates for having killed his father. He comes to see the terrified German survivors not {{as part of a}} vicious murder machine but as shivering, wounded individuals, some little older than him, caught in a war that is not of their own making. The novel is premised around a view that The Kerlogue’s crew obeyed an unwritten code to save any lives they could. In <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives,</b> they recognised the drowning Germans not are combatants, but as fellow sailors and honoured what sailors traditionally believe the initials SOS stand for: “Save our Souls”.|$|E
25|$|Militarism is {{featured}} in Naphtali's history. In the ancient Song of Deborah, Naphtali is commended, along with Zebulun, for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> {{in the fight}} against Sisera; in the prose account of the event, which textual scholars regard as a much later narrative based on the poem, there is the addition that Barak, the leader of the anti-Sisera forces, hails from the tribe of Naphtali. In the Gideon narrative Naphtali are one of the tribes which join in an attack against Midianite invaders, though textual scholars regard the Gideon narrative as being spliced together from at least three earlier texts, the oldest of which describes only personal vengeance by Gideon and 300 men of his own clan, not a battle in which the rest of the northern tribes join him. In the Blessing of Jacob, which textual scholars date to 700-600 BC - and thus a postdiction, Naphtali is compared to a hind let loose, and commended for giving goodly words.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, {{with one hand and}} one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of his {{appointment}} to the bench, the position was seen as particularly risky, because it was a clear representation of anti-British authority whose placeholders were thought to be <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> should the British succeed in putting down the rebellion. [...] The most noteworthy case Sullivan sat on was a preliminary hearing in Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison, one of the Quock Walker cases where the court in 1783 decided that slavery was incompatible with the state constitution. [...] Sullivan publicly expressed opposition to slavery, and predicted in his writings that the issue would become contentious in the future.|$|E
500|$|Not {{all of the}} Lithuanian populace {{supported}} the killings. Out of a population of close to 3,000,000 (80% of it ethnic Lithuanians), a few thousands took {{an active part in}} the killings while many hundreds risked their lives sheltering the Jews. Israel has recognized 891 Lithuanians (as of [...] January 1, 2017) as Righteous Among the Nations for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to save Jews during the Holocaust. In addition, many members of the Polish minority in Lithuania also helped to shelter the Jews. Lithuanians and Poles who risked their lives saving Jews were persecuted and often executed by the Nazis.|$|E

500|$|The {{resistance}} {{were instrumental}} in saving Jews and Roma from deportation to death camps, for instance {{the attack on the}} [...] "Twentieth convoy" [...] to Auschwitz. Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation, with one estimate putting the number at some 20,000 people hidden during the war. There was also significant low-level resistance, for instance in June 1941, the City Council of Brussels refused to distribute Stars of David badges. Certain high-profile members of the Belgian establishment, including Queen Elizabeth and Cardinal van Roey, Archbishop of Malines, spoke out against the German treatment of Jews. So far, 1,612 Belgians have been awarded the distinction of [...] "Righteous Among the Nations" [...] by the State of Israel for <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to save Jews from persecution during the occupation.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the small}} size of the islands, most {{resistance}} involved individuals <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to save someone else. The British government followed a policy of not encouraging resistance in the Channel Islands. Reasons for this British policy included the fact that resistance within such [...] "parochial limits" [...] was unlikely to be effective, would be of no direct use to the war effort, and the risk of violent retaliation against British citizens in the Islands was not something the wider British population would be likely to accept (as opposed to the hostage-shootings that were occurring in continental Europe).|$|E

Helmut Hirsch, a German physicist and nuclear expert, says [...] "they are improvising with tools that were not intended for this type of situation". There are roughly 400 workers onsite <b>risking</b> <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> to prevent the situation from deteriorating even further, who sleep in a building on the plant grounds.
