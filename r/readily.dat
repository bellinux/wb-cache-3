5|$|American {{listeners}} generally <b>readily</b> understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners <b>readily</b> understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers {{around the}} world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from {{many parts of the}} English-speaking world. Both standard and nonstandard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are <b>readily</b> absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will <b>readily</b> absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were <b>readily</b> available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
5|$|Copper is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant <b>readily</b> absorbs and accumulates heavy metals, such as copper {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These are <b>readily</b> absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation. The health implications are not clear.|$|E
5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits {{in late summer}} and autumn. The fungus has been noted to fruit <b>readily</b> on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are <b>readily</b> overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Irregular {{galaxies are}} galaxies {{that can not}} be <b>readily</b> {{classified}} into an elliptical or spiral morphology.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore <b>readily</b> form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should <b>readily</b> form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can be <b>readily</b> {{grown in}} {{laboratory}} culture.|$|E
5|$|This is then <b>readily</b> {{shown to}} be true for every integer n.|$|E
5|$|Unlike H2, the {{potassium}} salt is <b>readily</b> crystallized and handled as a solid.|$|E
5|$|Algebraic {{operations}} {{can be done}} <b>readily</b> on {{the power}} series representation; for instance, Euler's formula follows from Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions. This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as harmonic analysis.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} did join the coup was {{the chief of the}} Civil Guard, Duong Ngoc Lam, a Diệm loyalist who had {{recently}} been promoted from colonel to brigadier general. He was under investigation by the junta for swindling military funds and was <b>readily</b> converted.|$|E
5|$|Apart from lead(II) acetate, lead(II) nitrate is {{the only}} common soluble lead compound. Lead(II) nitrate <b>readily</b> dissolves in water to give a clear, {{colourless}} solution. As an ionic substance, the dissolution of lead(II) nitrate involves dissociation into its constituent ions.|$|E
5|$|As Pozdniakov <b>readily</b> admits, his {{analysis}} is highly {{sensitive to the}} accuracy of the glyph inventory. Since he has not published the details of how he established this inventory, it is not possible for others to verify his work.|$|E
5|$|As {{domestic}} {{cats are}} little altered from wildcats, they can <b>readily</b> interbreed. This hybridization poses {{a danger to}} the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Asomtavruli {{is often}} highly stylized and writers <b>readily</b> formed ligatures, {{intertwined}} letters, and placed letters within letters or other such monograms.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is a {{constituent}} of tobacco smoke. The tobacco plant <b>readily</b> absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as Cobalt {{from the surrounding}} soil into its leaves. These are subsequently inhaled during tobacco smoking.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the slight}} {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} two, wild parsnip is the same taxon as the cultivated version, and the two <b>readily</b> cross-pollinate. Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n=22.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks {{invisible}} to the naked eye. Lazare Kaplan, a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can <b>readily</b> be removed.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{reaction}} of indium with the pnictogens produces the gray or semimetallic III–V semiconductors. Many of them slowly decompose in moist air, necessitating careful storage of semiconductor compounds to prevent {{contact with the}} atmosphere. Indium nitride is <b>readily</b> attacked by acids and alkalis.|$|E
5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} sinus thrombosis is not <b>readily</b> apparent. Identifying a source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E
5|$|Lutetium dissolves <b>readily</b> in weak {{acids and}} dilute sulfuric acid to form {{solutions}} containing the colorless lutetium ions, which are coordinated by between seven and nine water molecules, the average being 3+.|$|E
5|$|Most die casters perform other {{secondary}} {{operations to}} produce features not <b>readily</b> castable, such as tapping a hole, polishing, plating, buffing, or painting.|$|E
5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts <b>readily</b> {{to garden}} conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated <b>readily</b> from seed, with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|Onions have {{particularly}} large {{cells that}} are <b>readily</b> observed under low magnification. Forming a single layer of cells, the bulb epidermis is easy to separate for educational, experimental, and breeding purposes.|$|E
5|$|Plant species often {{hybridize}} more <b>readily</b> than animal species, and {{the resulting}} hybrids are fertile more often. Many plant species {{are the result of}} hybridization, combined with polyploidy, which duplicates the chromosomes. Chromosome duplication allows orderly meiosis and so viable seed can be produced.|$|E
5|$|Plants are <b>readily</b> {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded}} by irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
5|$|Plants may spread clonally {{through the}} {{production}} of daughter bulbs and division producing clumps. Narcissus species hybridise <b>readily,</b> although the fertility of the offspring {{will depend on the}} parental relationship.|$|E
5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more <b>readily</b> adapt to the rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E
5|$|Siberian {{accentors}} {{are typically}} skulking birds, <b>readily</b> disappearing into cover. They have an above average {{ability to maintain}} their body temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, <b>readily</b> available materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas usually keep a safe {{distance}} from Nile crocodiles. Though they <b>readily</b> take to water to catch and store prey, hyenas will avoid crocodile-infested waters.|$|E
5|$|Technetium-99 (99Tc) {{is a major}} {{product of}} the fission of {{uranium-235}} (235U), making it {{the most common and}} most <b>readily</b> available isotope of technetium. One gram of technetium-99 produces 6.2×108disintegrations a second (that is, 0.62GBq/g).|$|E
5|$|The bulbous base, large spores, and {{distinctive}} habitat are characteristic features {{that make this}} species <b>readily</b> distinguishable from other boletes. It has a coloration and cap texture similar to Boletus flaviporus and B.auriporus, but the spores of these species are shorter (11–15µm and 11–16µm, respectively).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves <b>readily</b> in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are <b>readily</b> hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|The metal is <b>readily</b> {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E
5|$|The rasping {{advertising}} call is <b>readily</b> {{distinguished from}} the hwitt-hwitt-hwitt of spotted crake, the monotonous clockwork tak-tak-tak-tak-tak of striped crake, or the quick-quick of Baillon's crake. The corn crake is silent in Africa.|$|E
