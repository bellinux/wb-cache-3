The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a <b>rotatable</b> joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{jet engine}} {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been working}} a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed <b>rotatable</b> cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of}} the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed <b>rotatable</b> cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One <b>rotatable</b> Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with <b>rotatable</b> nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four <b>rotatable</b> nozzles. The engine is equipped for water injection to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The water injection function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. Water injection was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E

25|$|The {{space probe}} was {{powered by a}} two-panel gallium arsenide/germanium solar array {{providing}} an average of 450 watts while in Mercury orbit.

Power was stored in a common-pressure-vessel, 23-ampere-hour nickel–hydrogen battery, with 11 vessels and two cells per vessel.|$|E
25|$|A radio {{direction}} finder {{of the kind}} then used by large passenger ships employed a <b>rotatable</b> loop antenna to determine the airship's position from any two land radio stations or ship-based transmitters from ships with known positions. During the airship's transatlantic flight to the United States in October 1928, the radio room sent 484 private telegrams and 160 press telegrams.|$|E
25|$|Only {{unsaturated}} fats can be trans or cis fat, {{since only}} a double bond can be locked to these orientations. Saturated fatty acids are never called trans fats {{because they have}} no double bonds. Therefore, all their bonds are freely <b>rotatable.</b> Other types of fatty acids, such as crepenynic acid, which contains a triple bond, are rare and of no nutritional significance.|$|E
25|$|Other propositions in 2002 and 2003 {{included}} {{building a}} new stadium in Mölndal, a neighbour municipality of Gothenburg, a new stadium built {{on the site of}} the old stadium Valhalla IP, located between Ullevi and Scandinavium, and a third suggestion wanted to demolish Gamla Ullevi and move all football activities to the larger Ullevi which would be rebuilt to a dome arena, with a <b>rotatable</b> pitch that would move it closer to the seats for regular season matches.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessors, {{which used}} an engine based on 2D {{isometric}} graphics and sprites, SimCity 4 primarily uses a 3D engine to render its graphics. The landscape and moving props such as vehicles are modeled as fully polygonal and <b>rotatable</b> 3D objects. Small buildings and props are drawn as flat images, which are pasted onto billboards; polygons with their surface normal facing into the camera. Larger buildings are modeled using a hybrid approach; a simple polygonal model defines {{the shape of}} the building, then textures are added to create detail such as doors, windows and rooftop clutter.|$|E
25|$|From {{mathematical}} {{point of}} view ligand docking represents a search for global minimum on the multidimensional surface describing the free energy of protein-ligand binding. With ligands having up to 15-20 degrees of freedom (freely <b>rotatable</b> bonds) and complex nature of energy surface, global optimum search represents generally unsolved scientific task. To tackle this computationally challenging problem Lead-Finder applies unique approach combining genetic algorithm search, local optimization procedures, and a smart exploitation of the knowledge generated during the search run. Rational combination of different optimization strategies makes Lead Finder efficient in terms of coarse sampling of ligand's phase space and refinement of promising solutions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the lead}} up to World War II, the Germans made {{successive}} improvements to their military Enigma machines. By January 1939, additional rotors had been introduced {{so that there was}} a choice of three from five (i.e. 60 wheel orders) for the army and airforce Enigmas, and three out of eight (336 wheel orders) for the navy machines. In addition, ten leads were used on the plugboard leaving only six letters unsteckered. This meant that the airforce and army Enigmas could be set up 1.5×1019 ways. In 1941 the German navy introduced a version of Enigma with <b>rotatable</b> reflector (the M4 or Four-rotor Enigma) for communicating with its U-boats. This could be set up in 1.8×1020 different ways.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s to 1930s, various card {{counters}} {{were produced}} in the UK, including the Little Dorrit counter, and the schoolgirl counter. From around 2006 Maik Remmers designed and manufactured in Germany a series of 3D card counters {{in the shape of}} skeins of wool, animals and abstract designs. These are folded and printed on back and front, with a pair of <b>rotatable</b> number discs sandwiched between the layers of card. The discs can be rotated to reveal numerals through two windows in the front layer of card. The outer surface of the card can be written-on with water-soluble ink, and the back surface of the counter contains a form where the knitter can fill in current row numbers. This is necessary as there is not enough friction to prevent the number discs from moving during storage.|$|E
25|$|The AW609 {{is powered}} by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67A {{turboshaft}} engines, which each drive a three-bladed proprotor. These engines possess roughly twice the horsepower of the similarly sized AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter. Both of the engine and proprotor pairs are mounted on a load-bearing <b>rotatable</b> pylon at the wing's ends, allowing the proprotors to be positioned at various angles. In helicopter mode, the proprotors can be positioned between a 75- and 95-degree angle from the horizontal, with 87 degrees being the typical selection for hovering vertically. In airplane mode, the proprotors are rotated forward and locked in position at a zero-degree angle, spinning at 84% RPM. The flight control software reportedly handles much of the complexity of the transitioning between helicopter and airplane modes; automated systems also serve to guide pilots to the correct tilt angle and air speed settings.|$|E
25|$|On {{the front}} {{face of the}} {{mechanism}} (see reproduction here:) there is a fixed ring dial representing the ecliptic, the twelve zodiacal signs marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is <b>rotatable,</b> marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate <b>rotatable</b> ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{armament}} {{consists of}} 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun with fume extractor {{almost at the}} end of the barrel. It is the same gun as the one used in the Type 63 amphibious light tank and can fire AP, APHE, HE, Frag-HE, HEAT, APFSDF-T and smoke rounds. The gun has maximum range of 12,200 m and maximum aimed range of 1,870 m and has a rate of fire of 3 to 5 round per minute. The Type 62 light tank is characterized by having poor accuracy, given the primitive optical gun sights that the gunner has to use and lack of a gun stabilizer (which differs it from Chinese main battle tanks), a fire control system and night vision equipment. As a secondary armament the Type 62 light tank was given the 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun (Chinese copy of Soviet 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun) mounted on a <b>rotatable</b> mount on top of the loader's hatch on the right hand side of the roof of the turret and two 7.62mm Type 59T medium machine guns, one mounted coaxially with the main gun and the other one mounted at the bow of the tank. Also a 7.62mm Type 59T anti-aircraft medium machine gun can be additionally fitted to left hand side turret hatch. The cast turret features the Soviet-style half-egg shape. The tank carriers 47 rounds for the 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun, 2,000 rounds for the two Type 59T medium machine guns and 1,250 rounds for 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E

500|$|The {{location}} of the large Pegasus engine, which was housed within the relatively small fuselage, meant that the cockpit was positioned directly forward of it, in between the later [...] "elephant-ear" [...] air intakes to the engine itself. The 'cold' jet exhaust was directed from the large fan forward of the engine compressor to <b>rotatable</b> fiberglass nozzles located {{on the sides of}} the main fuselage aft of the air intakes; the 'hot' jet exhaust from the rear of the engine were channeled via a bifurcated exhaust channel to two steel <b>rotatable</b> nozzles located somewhat aft of those used for the 'cold' jets. Additionally, bleed air was also extracted from the compressor and sent via ducts within the fuselage and wings to control nozzles, known as [...] "puffers", located upon the aircraft's nose, tail, and wing tips, which were used for stabilisation during mid-air hovers.|$|E

It is {{the first game of}} the Final Fantasy Tactics series and was released in Japan in June 1997 and in the United States in January 1998. The game combines thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. In contrast to other 32-bit era Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy Tactics uses a 3D, isometric, <b>rotatable</b> playing field, with bitmap sprite characters.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, to reach a {{destination}} players must traverse an enemy-infested countryside. Travel may be expedited with Cannon Travel Centers, where the party may be launched to faraway destinations via a giant cannon. Cannon Travel usually requires a fee, but is mandatory to visit other continents later on. Later, the party is given access to Flammie, a miniature dragon which is controlled by the player and able to fly freely across the world, represented by an overworld map. These sequences make use of the SNES's Mode 7 capability to create a <b>rotatable</b> background, giving the illusion that the ground beneath Flammie is rendered in three dimensions. While riding Flammie, the player may access either the [...] "rotated map", which presents the world as a globe, or the [...] "world map", a two-dimensional view of the overworld.|$|E

The power system has both no-break and transformer containers, with the former including a diesel generator, an inductive clutch control module and a diesel fuel tank. The transformer container houses transformers, a service generator, a direct current converter and switching racks. The radar's cooling system is a heat exchanger that makes use of inherently redundant cascade cooling machines and incorporates an integral coolant tank and control panels. The radar {{is made up of}} 2,000–2,300 transmit–receive modules and weighs [...] The system is transportable rather than mobile, as it can be moved to other prepared sites, but cannot be set up just anywhere.

500|$|Soaring pioneer Paul MacCready {{is usually}} {{credited}} with developing mathematical principles for optimizing {{the speed at}} which to fly when cross-country soaring, although it was first described by Wolfgang Späte in 1938. The speed to fly theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a [...] "McCready ring", a <b>rotatable</b> bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero 2 {{follows from}} its {{predecessor}} in simulating {{the performance of}} a disc jockey mixing one or two songs using a special turntable controller. The controller, the same unit as shipped previously with DJ Hero, includes a <b>rotatable</b> turntable to use for recording scratching, three [...] "stream" [...] buttons to match notes from the two music tracks and an effects track, and a slider to control the crossfade between tracks. These actions are presented to the players through on-screen notation that scrolls in time with the music. Players score points by performing the actions correctly, but are not penalized otherwise. By successfully completing a consecutive set of actions, the player can increase their scoring multiplier up to 4x; the multiplier returns to 1x should they miss any actions. Certain marked sections, when played correctly, fill a [...] "Euphoria" [...] (the [...] "Star Power" [...] for this game) meter which can be unleashed using another button on the controller and will temporarily double the scoring. The player can also earn the ability to rewind a song by a few seconds by playing a long string of consecutive notes. They can rewind the song by quickly spinning the turntable in reverse; the rewind effect can be used to either correct a mistake or further boost one's scoring.|$|E
500|$|Homeworld {{was highly}} {{regarded}} by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator Metacritic {{as the highest}} rated computer game of 1999, and the fourth-highest on any platform for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Michael Ryan of GameSpot claimed it had [...] "some {{of the most impressive}} graphics ever", while Jason Levine of Computer Games Magazine said that [...] "no game—ever—has made space itself look like this". Eurogamer's review praised the [...] "big, brash and colourful" [...] backgrounds, which was echoed by Levine and John Keefer of GameSpy. Multiple reviewers, such as Vincent Lopez of IGN, also praised the detail and variety of the spaceships, and Jason Samuel of GamePro noted that Relic was able to use their graphics engine to create the game's intricate cutscenes rather than relying on prerecorded videos. Greg Fortune of Computer Gaming World added that the <b>rotatable</b> camera was one of the [...] "real joys of the game", allowing the player to view the action from any angle or ship's viewpoint and [...] "creating an impressively sweeping cinematic feel". The sound and music were also lauded; Levine claimed the sound was [...] "on par with the graphics", praising how it changed when the player zoomed into or away from a battle, while Eurogamer and Lopez applauded the [...] "atmospheric" [...] soundtrack for creating the mood of the game.|$|E
500|$|Russell had {{a program}} with a movable dot by January 1962, and an early {{operational}} game with <b>rotatable</b> spaceships by February. The two spaceships were designed to evoke the curvy spaceship from Buck Rogers stories and the PGM-11 Redstone rocket. That early version also contained a randomly generated background star field, initially added by Russell because a blank background {{made it difficult to}} tell the relative motion of the two spaceships at slow speeds. The programming community in the area, including the Hingham Institute and the TMRC, had developed what was later termed the [...] "hacker ethic", whereby all programs were freely shared and modified by other programmers in a collaborative environment without concern for ownership or copyright, which led to a group effort to elaborate on Russell's initial Spacewar game. Consequently, since the inaccuracy and lack of realism in the star field annoyed TMRC member Peter Samson, he wrote a program based on real star charts that scrolled slowly through the night sky, including every star in a band between 22.5° N and 22.5° S down to the fifth magnitude, displayed at their relative brightness. The program was called [...] "Expensive Planetarium"—referring to the high price of the PDP-1 computer compared to an analog planetarium, as part of the series of [...] "expensive" [...] programs like Expensive Typewriter—and was quickly incorporated into the game in March by Russell, who served as the collator of the primary version of the game.|$|E
