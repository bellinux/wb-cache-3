40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} {{for the design}} of a <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network is developed in this study. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} a combination of geostatistical tools and factor analysis, along with a clustering technique, has been used to prioritize <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>stations</b> in terms of information content over the study area. The whole study area is divided into homogeneous subregions and a conventional variance-based approach is implemented in each subregion to rank <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>stations.</b> For this purpose, factor analysis coupled with ordinary block kriging is used to identify the number of homogeneous subregions, and then, ordinary point kriging is used to assign <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>stations</b> to each subregion. The developed scheme is quite time-efficient as it is not sensitive to initial guesses on cluster centers, there is no need to specify the number of clusters in advance and, above all, it is highly relevant to the overall objective stipulated in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network design. The proposed methodology is implemented on real data set in the south west of Iran. The results show that the proposed approach compares well with existing paradigms in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network design and only six <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>stations</b> are required to provide the necessary information. In particular, the measure of network accuracy lies somewhere in between the so called time consuming and more simplified approaches used in <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> network design...|$|R

40|$|Soil erosion is {{a global}} issue that threatens food {{security}} and causes environmental degradation. Management of water erosion requires accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal variations in the erosive power of rainfall (erosivity).

However, the time series rainfall data that has a high temporal resolution are often unavailable {{in many areas of}} the world.

Significant variations are observed even among stations located within about 15  km of each other. Error increases with increase in rain gauge spacing.

Accurate rainfall estimates are essential for agricultural purposes. Chief source of rainfall over Indian region is Monsoon. India Meteorological Department (IMD) use <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> based gridded rainfall product developed by Rajeevan et al.
