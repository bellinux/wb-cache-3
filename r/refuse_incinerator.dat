40|$|Gas-side fouling of waste-heat-recovery boilers, caused {{mainly by}} the {{deposition}} of particulate matter, reduces the heat transfer in the boiler. The fouling as observed {{on the tube}} bundles in the boiler of a Dutch <b>refuse</b> waste <b>incinerator</b> varied from thin and powdery for the economizer to thick and sintered for the superheater. Analysis of process data showed that both types of layers resulted in a 27 % decrease of the heat transfer coef cient of the bundles. To determine the important mechanisms in the deposition of particles, layers taken from the different bundles are analyzed using electron microscopy. The analysis revealed {{the existence of a}} melt in the thick deposit. The melt, giving rise to a liquid phase, increases the sticking ef ciency of the deposit and leads to larger deposition rates. For the economizer and the superheater the actual deposition rate is calculated from the change in heat transfer. On the basis of a comparison between the calculated deposition rates and deposition rates to be expected {{in the case of a}} pure diffusion and thermophoresis process, it is shown that for both types of deposits inertia-controlled transport is the dominant transport mechanism of particles.

Measurements were performed near the village of Zegveld during the period of June and July 1993. Dioxin concentrations found varied between 5 +- 2 to 60 +- 15 fg TEQ/m 3, depending on the wind direction and other weather conditions with an average value of 18 +- 18 fg TEQ/m 3 (n= 11). The high range levels were found in trajectories from the South-West, down stream from the incinerators, and relatively low levels (< 5 - 10 fg TEQ/m 3) in trajectories from West (North Sea), North and East. The long-term-average background level was calculated as 25 +- 5 fg TEQ/m 3 based on estimates of mean concentrations in the four trajectory directions, weighed with the corresponding long-term-average distribution of wind directions. This background value corresponds fairly well with a predicted value of 35 fg/m 3. Model calculations were based on the estimated national emissions and dioxin fluxes from abroad by the end of 1990. When results from both methods are mutually comparable and valid, the small difference might indicate a small, poorly significant dicline of dioxin levels in air {{in this part of the}} country during the past few years...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of municipal waste as a fuel is marked mainly by its hetero-geneous composition and relatively poor heating value. Two solutions {{have been proposed}} for its combustion, namely, in the form {{in which it is}} delivered, or after some type of preparation. Whichever solution is chosen, refuse boilers must contain certain features aimed specifically at the prevention of corrosion and fouling. Studies and investigations carried out over a 10 -year period have achieved installations characterized by high and stable efficiency, excellent availability, and low maintenance costs. After a research of curative measures to be applied to existing plants (shield block, refractory concrete), the survey has been directed towards a research of pre-ventive measures to be taken for new plants. These surveys have been principally based upon statistics in existing plants, evolution of the thermal balance-sheets in current operation, the physico-chemical analysis of fly ash, research of correlation between measurements of combustion chambers and phenomena of corrosion and fouling in convection banks.

40|$|Problem statement: Domestic waste collection, sorting and {{disposal}} are major problems {{in many developing}} countries such as Ghana. It is an undeniable fact that the environment has been engulfed in filth. This filth comprises of the garbage and waste generated in homes, workplace and industrial setups. Most of this waste has found its way into the streets, gutters, in and around the homes, dung hills and worst of all, water bodies, many of which are sources of the drinking water treated at high costs or not treated at all. Approach: Garbage needs to be sorted into various components and each of such components like textile materials, polythene, foodstuffs, metals and glassware would then have to be handled separately at the disposal or recycling site. Such a process required a certain degree of literacy, discipline and certain basic equipment, for example separate collector bins or sorting bags. In the developed world this is not much a problem because every home has different polythene bags into which the various constituents of domestic waste are put right at the generation point. Separate collection bins were also provided at vantage points for the various types of domestic garbage collection. In the developing countries these arrangements have not been feasible because of the level of literacy, lack of appreciation of the problem, non-availability of the different types of polythene bags and poverty. Currently, most garbage collection in the developing countries is done by depositing every thing into a single container from where they are hauled to be dumped in landfills or burned in <b>incinerators.</b> <b>Refuse</b> disposal by land filling requires a sizeable land {{for the sole purpose of}} refuse disposal. This may lead to (1) : Encumbering large tracks of prime land, which could not be put to other uses (2) : Pollution of ground water by the leachate from the landfills (3) : Breeding of leaches, rodents, mosquitoes and (4) : Generation of strong stench coming from the landfills, posing health hazards to communities. Incineration also produces strong odour and smoke. Results: In both methods no component of the waste was recovered for recycling. This is contrary to the practice in the developed countries where waste recycling is a major undertaking to provide raw materials e. g., glass and metal, for industry and thus reduces the exploitation of natural resources. Conclusion: To address the problem in Ghana it is necessary to devise a means of sorting-out the components of domestic waste for recycling into useful components. This study outlined the design and operation of a machine for sorting out garbage into the various components which can be recycled or utilized elsewhere...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{investigated and}} explored the overall technical and legal suggestions on mixed ash (bottom ash + fly ash) {{from the first}} BOT(built-operation then transfer) incineration plant in south Taoyuan of Taiwan, {{with the hope of}} serving as the reference for treating ash from urban <b>refuse</b> <b>incinerator</b> and making sustainable operation management policies in Taiwan. Both bottom ash and fly ash contain high-content harmful metals like lead, chrome, and cadmium, with the lead content exceeding standard value.

The results show that the increase in percentage of bottom ash could maintain post-fusing strength and produce solidification effect, but this reduced the stability of toxic heavy metals and raised their dissolution rate. Suitable mixture ratio of bottom ash and fly ash was 2 : 1, volume reduction ratio 0. 349, and weight reduction ratio 0. 4936. The mixture was fulvous and dense with gloss and adequate strength.

40|$|Background: Incinerator {{workers are}} not {{considered}} to have arsenic overexposure although they have the risk of overexposure to other heavy metals. Aim: To {{examine the relationship between}} arsenic burden and risk of occupational exposure in employees working at a municipal <b>refuse</b> <b>incinerator</b> by determining the concentrations of arsenic in the blood and urine. Settings and Design: The workers were divided into three groups based on their probability of contact with combustion-generated residues, namely Group 1 : indirect contact, Group 2 : direct contact and Group 3 : no contact. Healthy age- and sex-matched residents living in the vicinity were enrolled as the control group. Materials and Methods: Heavy metal concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Downstream rivers and drinking water of the residents were examined for environmental arsenic pollution. A questionnaire survey concerning the contact history of arsenic was simultaneously conducted. Statistical analysis: Non-parametric tests, cross-tabulation and multinomial logistic regression. Results: This study recruited 122 incinerator workers. The urine and blood arsenic concentrations as well as incidences of overexposure were significantly higher in the workers than in control subjects. The workers who had indirect or no contact with combustion-generated residues had significantly higher blood arsenic level. Arsenic contact history could not explain the difference. Airborne and waterborne arsenic pollution were not detected. Conclusion: Incinerator workers run the risk of being exposed to arsenic pollution, especially those who have incomplete protection in the workplace even though they only have indirect or no contact with combustion-generated pollutants...|$|E
30|$|These latter {{specific}} perspectives {{muster the}} needs of “in-the-round” sustainable development, including both active and passive solutions in a potential integration. Nevertheless, a further approach is emerging, pivoting on the very same core of the appropriate language and focusing on energy infrastructure itself (plant system, including vectors) in relation to landscape. It means exploring forms to eventually solve the contrast between new and existent: a research where projects become creators of beauty aimed at enhancing the energy object’s aesthetic, and thus at mitigating or camouflaging its aspect. The desire to lend an architectural image to energy artefacts has significant historical references and presents an interesting evolution (Ciorra 2013), until at last the aesthetic of the machine prevailed and relegated these elements {{to the language of}} mere infrastructural and productive functionality; such a research has concerned both larger buildings and small service facilities distributed in the territory. This comeback to a stylistic treatment of plant systems manifests itself in restyling operations of the artefact, in plant coachwork (a sort of chassis) and finally through hybridization models 8 representing the most innovative and promising line among all these project explorations. To the first category we could attribute some new interpretations in terms of industrial design, such as wind turbines 9 and electricity pylons. 10 However, the remaking process of the external container (with particular regard to power stations and larger plants) has a recent forerunner: Friedensreich Hundertwasser’s lifting of Spittelau <b>refuse</b> <b>incinerator</b> in Wien (built in 1987), besides several other examples in Italy and abroad based on different solution in terms of volumetric composition and use of materials. The hybridization method aims at returning energy artefacts to the city and transforming them into inhabited objects, with different usage possibilities other than simple productive functionality. A sort of reconciliation and humanization, which not only filter through the overcoming of anodyne envelopes, but also introduce both the perceptive and the real fruition of new spaces and more or less public functions. The difference between infrastructures integrated with energy production systems and “inhabited” energy infrastructures diminishes, expanding considerably the experimentation and implementation field of the integration concept.|$|E
