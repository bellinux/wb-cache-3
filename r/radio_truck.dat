50|$|Maintaining {{technical}} skills {{was also a}} problem, {{as much of the}} equipment—such as direction-finding <b>trucks,</b> <b>radio</b> intercept <b>trucks,</b> <b>radio</b> jamming <b>trucks,</b> inter alia—was prohibitively expensive for the Army to provide just to have it sit in storage twenty-eight days or more per month. Because of likely damage to streets, the battalion's M113 armored personnel carriers, M577 tactical operations center vehicles and M578 recovery vehicles were stored at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton; the three-hour round trip negated monthly training on the tracked vehicles.|$|R

50|$|The Swiss Army ordered 338 Saurer M6s in 1940; an {{additional}} 16 came with solid construction as <b>radio</b> <b>trucks.</b> Almost identical was the 8x8 model Saurer M8 M, inclusive the prototype 79 M8 trucks were built. Many {{components of the}} Saurer M6 also found use in the Saurer MH4. The Saurer 2DM replaced in 1978 the Sauer M6 in Military service, some of them found a second use by the Civil defense of Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|A {{military}} 4x4 variant {{known as}} the K9 was also produced and was used for several purposes including an ambulance, water carrier, recovery vehicle and <b>radio</b> <b>truck.</b> The military version often had a round hatch in the cab roof for defensive and observation purposes.|$|E
50|$|Clothier {{was born}} in 1919 in Liverpool to a devout Catholic family. He was educated at Stonyhurst College and won a senior history {{scholarship}} to read law at Lincoln College, Oxford. The outbreak of the Second World War cut short his studies and he refused {{to apply for a}} post in the Judge Advocate General's office in 1939. This led to a twenty-year-long rift with his father, a dentist who had seen dreadful jaw injuries during the First World War. Clothier joined the Royal Signals and served with the 51st (Highland) Division at the Second Battle of El Alamein, where he was responsible for laying communication lines and setting up radio equipment. He undertook deception duties in a <b>radio</b> <b>truck</b> and made transmissions from unmanned positions in English and Scottish accents to confuse the enemy. He discovered that the greatest danger came from enemy aircraft and from a lack of sleep, instanced by an occasion when he woke to discover that he was riding his motorcycle down an embankment into a minefield. Clothier acquired the nickname 'Spike' after a film character. He became a popular pianist in the officers' mess and acquired a love of flying when an American pilot offered a flight and landed on a road by a Sicilian village where they had an impromptu swim. In 1943 Clothier was transferred to Washington, D.C. where he served as a staff officer, sitting on committees dealing with technical developments and radio-frequency allocation. He continued his passion for flying by qualifying as a pilot. He also encountered the actress Mae West who was so impressed with Clothier that she said she would send her son to Oxford University to learn to speak like him. Clothier developed a lasting love of the United States during his time in Washington, D.C. When Clothier left the Army in 1946, he had reached the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.|$|E
50|$|The NNSC was {{supported}} by twenty Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, ten permanently located at ports in North and South Korea, and ten mobile teams. The Armistice did not specify the manner of operation of the teams. The Swiss and Swedish teams were of a small size, relying on their hosts to provide personnel support, vehicles, and communication equipment to report back to the Supervisory Commission. The Czech and Polish teams were much larger and fully self-sufficient, including heavy <b>radio</b> <b>trucks,</b> interpreters, cooks and mess equipment.|$|R

5000|$|In recent decades, large-caliber anti-materiel rifles, {{typically}} firing between 12.7 mm and 20 mm caliber cartridges, {{have been}} developed. The US Barrett M82A1 {{is probably the}} best-known such rifle. These weapons are typically used to strike critical, vulnerable targets such as computerized command and control vehicles, <b>radio</b> <b>trucks,</b> radar antennae, vehicle engine blocks and the jet engines of enemy aircraft. Anti-materiel rifles can be used against human targets, but the much higher weight of rifle and ammunition, and the massive recoil and muzzle blast, usually make them less than practical for such use. The Barrett M82 is designed with a maximum effective range of 1800 m, although it has a confirmed kill distance of 2430 m in Afghanistan during Operation Anaconda in 2002.During May 2017, in Iraq a Canadian Armed Forces Joint Task Force 2 sniper using a McMillan Tac-50 sniper rifle set a new world record for the longest confirmed kill shot {{at a distance of}} 3,540 m (3,871 yd).127 The shot was fired from a high-rise building and the bullet travelled for [...] "under 10 seconds" [...] before hitting the target an ISIS iinsurgent ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} as a contender with the Tamiya Clod Buster which was released two years earlier. Both were 4WD monster trucks with four wheel steering and four wheel drive using twin motors, one to each gearbox. Both trucks used a single servo to steer and another to run a heavy duty mechanical speed controller, so they were easily controlled with a common two channel <b>radio.</b> Both <b>trucks</b> came with a set of eight friction type shocks and 27 turn RS-540 motors.|$|R
50|$|The Tamiya Clod Buster is a 1/10-scale <b>radio</b> {{controlled}} monster <b>truck</b> released September 21, 1987 by the Tamiya Corporation.
