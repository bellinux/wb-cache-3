5|$|Mephedrone is a monoamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent.</b> It is a chiral {{compound}} {{and both of}} its enantiomers display similar potency as substrates at dopamine transporters. R-Mephedrone is much less potent than S-mephedrone as a substrate at serotonin transporters.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely <b>releasing</b> <b>agent)</b> and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
25|$|Tramadol is {{well-established}} as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In addition, a {{few studies}} have found that it also acts as a serotonin <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (1–10μM), similar in effect to fenfluramine. The serotonin releasing effects of tramadol could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents like fenfluramine and MDMA. However, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30μM. In addition to serotonergic activity, tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is not a norepinephrine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent.</b> Tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine.|$|E

30|$|To {{reduce the}} effort in terms of bonding {{pre-treatment}} the applied adhesives {{need to be more}} contamination tolerant or the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer has to be as low as possible to achieve a clean surface. Due to the fact, that there are no adhesives, which show the relevant tolerance for the typical <b>release</b> <b>agents,</b> the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer has to be lowered to increase the production efficiency. Unfortunately, the correlation between the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer and the CFRP-part production process has not yet been investigated in literature.|$|R
50|$|No {{selective}} DRAs {{are currently}} known. Many <b>releasing</b> <b>agents</b> of both dopamine and norepinephrine (norepinephrine-dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agents,</b> or NDRAs) and of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine are known (serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agents,</b> or SNDRAs), however. Examples of NDRAs include amphetamine and methamphetamine, and {{an example of}} an SNDRA is MDMA. These drugs are frequently encountered as drugs of abuse.|$|R
25|$|MDMA acts {{primarily}} as a presynaptic <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which arises from its activity at trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). MDMA is a monoamine transporter substrate (i.e., a substrate for DAT, NET, and SERT), so it enters monoamine neurons via these neuronal membrane transport proteins; by acting as a monoamine transporter substrate, MDMA produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane transporters (i.e., it competes with endogenous monoamines for reuptake). MDMA inhibits both vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs), the second of which (VMAT2) is highly expressed within monoamine neurons at vesicular membranes. Once inside a monoamine neuron, MDMA acts as a VMAT2 inhibitor and a TAAR1 agonist.|$|E
25|$|Both {{amphetamine}} and methylphenidate {{are predominantly}} dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. Methylphenidate {{acts as a}} norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor while amphetamine is both a <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase neuronal firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate, but causes monoamine release by reversing {{the flow of the}} monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms. The difference in mechanism of action between methylphenidate and amphetamine results in methylphenidate inhibiting amphetamine's effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered.|$|E

2500|$|Carbamazepine is a {{sodium channel}} blocker. [...] It binds {{preferentially}} to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing {{of an action}} potential. [...] Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain.

2500|$|Asphalt is {{typically}} stored and transported at temperatures around [...] Sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated {{out of the}} mixture. This mixture is often called [...] "bitumen feedstock", or BFS. Some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, {{as well as some}} handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns.|$|E
50|$|Preparing the mandrel - The beadmaker starts by dipping a mandrel, or wire (stainless steel welding wire, {{cut into}} lengths) into a <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>Release</b> <b>agents</b> are either clay based or man made, such as boron nitride.|$|R
30|$|To {{guarantee}} the demolding of the cured parts, <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are used. Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial bondability [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial bondability is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially automated bonding pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|R
30|$|Within this equation, all {{parameters}} which {{increase the}} <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer with an enlarged value (time and pressure) are {{inserted in the}} numerator, while the parameters which decrease the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer with higher value are inserted in the denominator.|$|R
2500|$|Morphine, {{the archetypal}} opioid, and other opioids (e.g., codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, dihydromorphine, pethidine) all exert a similar {{influence}} on the cerebral opioid receptor system. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, and tramadol is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with weak μ-opioid receptor agonist properties. [...] Tramadol is structurally closer to venlafaxine than to codeine and delivers analgesia by not only delivering [...] "opioid-like" [...] effects (through mild agonism of the mu receptor) but also by acting as a weak but fast-acting serotonin <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. [...] Tapentadol, with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what {{is believed to be}} a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a SNRI. The effects of serotonin and norepinephrine on pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief. Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils), seizures (tramadol), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Like amphetamines, cathinone, and ephedrine, cathine {{acts as a}} {{norepinephrine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (NRA). It also acts as a dopamine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (DRA) to {{a lesser}} extent.|$|E
50|$|Fenfluramine {{acts as a}} {{serotonin}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent,</b> phentermine as {{primarily a}} norepinephrine <b>releasing</b> <b>agent.</b> Phentermine also induces the release of serotonin and dopamine, although to a far lesser extent than it induces the release of norepinephrine.|$|E
30|$|Besides the {{characteristics}} of the raw materials (e.g. <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> formulation, resin formulation or fillers), the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer is depending on the processing during the crosslinking reaction of the resin. This dependency is subsequently discussed to identify the different influences.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Release</b> <b>agents</b> {{provide the}} {{critical}} barrier between a molding {{surface and the}} substrate, facilitating separation of the cured part from the mold. Without such a barrier in place the substrate would become fused to the mold surface, resulting in difficult clean-up and dramatic loss in production efficiency. Even when a <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> is used, factors such as irregular applications or improper <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> choice may have a dramatic effect on the quality and consistency of the finished product.|$|R

50|$|A serotonin-norepinephrine-{{dopamine}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SNDRA), {{also known}} as a triple <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (TRA), is a type of drug which induces the release of serotonin, norepinephrine/epinephrine, and dopamine in the brain and body. SNDRAs produce euphoriant, entactogen, and psychostimulant effects, and are almost exclusively encountered as recreational drugs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{serotonin}} <b>releasing</b> <b>agent</b> (SRA) {{is a type}} of {{drug that}} induces the release of serotonin into the neuronal synaptic cleft.

30|$|In addition, {{the vapor}} {{pressure}} of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> could also be relevant, if silicone oils are parts of the applied <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> At higher temperatures, those silicone oils have a relatively low vapor pressure [32], which could be critical for the CFRP-processing and would may be indicate a negative effect of an applied vacuum on the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> transfer. Nevertheless, even if the vapor pressure is reached during the production cycle, the volatile components of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> are mainly sucked outside of the laminate by the applied vacuum system within the experimental set-up (e.g. by the application of vacuum bags [27, 33]), proven by the reduction of voids after the application of an higher vacuum [13].|$|R
30|$|Applying the NDT {{technologies}} Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) and Aerosol-Wetting-Test (AWT) {{was achieved}} using the CFRP samples without further preparation before characterising their surfaces. Comparing the OSEE signal intensity with {{the concentration of}} silicon atoms as detected by XPS, the experimental data shown in Figure  10 clearly reveal that the signals obtained in OSEE studies {{are sensitive to the}} presence of even the thinnest layers of <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> investigated. Additionally, results from evaluating sizes of water droplets obtained from performing the AWT for CFRP surfaces free from <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> and contaminated with distinct amounts of <b>release</b> <b>agent,</b> respectively, are shown in Figure  10. For all the samples the same amount of water was applied, and the lateral dimensions and areas of imaged water drops show a size distribution. Basically, the portion of wider drops is observed to be significantly higher for the CFRP surface free from <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> which shows a better wettability with water as compared to the CFRP sample contaminated with <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> The elaborate studies comprising a variation of the surface concentration of the <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> reveal that even at the lowest investigated thickness of the silicone-based films the average size of water drops is significantly smaller than in case of the CFRP surfaces free from <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> That means that both OSEE and AWT investigations of CFRP adherents allow for clearly indicating the presence of a silicone-based <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> in an amount which – following Figure  1 – was demonstrated by Markatos et al. [23] to result in a strongly reduced strength of adhesive joints manufactured based on such adherents. These adherents therefore may be considered effectively contaminated. Cleaning them appropriately and testing the effect of the cleaning applying extended non-destructive testing will contribute to preventing the manufacture of adhesive joints with undesirably compromised strength.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For the {{net shape}} forming of {{composite}} products with structure of SB/CF-EP (steel backing/carbon fabric reinforced epoxy) lining, the demolding is difficult. Aiming to net shape forming of transmission screw nuts with structure of SB/CF-EP, a new solution was proposed {{in which the}} high-strength casting wax was used as the <b>release</b> <b>agent.</b> A basic demolding experiment was designed and comparative demolding experiments were conducted for three different conditions: wax and grease as <b>release</b> <b>agents</b> and no agent. The influences of different agents and agent thickness on demolding force, product sizes and surface quality were studied. In comparison with grease and no <b>release</b> <b>agent</b> the demolding force for wax was reduced by 91. 6 % and 98. 0 % respectively.
