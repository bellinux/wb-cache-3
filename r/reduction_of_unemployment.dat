At the invasion of the German troops in 1940, Vanderpoorten followed the government in exile to France, but did not follow along to London. Because the German troops in November 1942 occupied the until then unoccupied Vichy France, the freedom of Vanderpoorten became strongly restricted. He was apprehended in January 1943, on suspicion of assistance to an escape line for refugees to the United Kingdom. He was deported to Germany and died less than two weeks before the British troops liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.|$|E

In this paper we contrast the Colombian case with other countries’ experiences in terms of the methodological transformation and its empirical im-plications. Afterwards, we test the empirical support of the change of method-ology. Our results suggest specific implications on structural unemployment and its relationship to unemployed people’s educational profile; therefore, they challenge the practical application of the ILO’s standard unemployment defin-ition to the Colombian case.

[...] (175).

Smith was also a committed British Unionist. During Smith's tenure as leader the Labour party gained a significant lead in the polls over the Conservatives; on 5 May 1994, one week before Smith's death, the Conservatives suffered a major defeat in the British council elections, their worst in over 30 years. This happened in spite of the strong economic recovery and <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> which had followed the declaration of the recession's end in April 1993.

5000|$|The {{election}} {{was characterized by}} a narrower ideological {{difference between the two}} parties on economic issues. Michael Manley facilitated his comeback campaign by moderating his leftist positions and admitting mistakes made as Prime Minister, saying he erred when he involved government in economic production and had abandoned all thoughts of nationalizing industry. He cited the PNP's desire to continue the market-oriented policies of the JLP government, but with a more participatory approach. Prime Minister Edward Seaga ran on his record of economic growth and the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in Jamaica, using the campaign slogan [...] "Don't Let Them Wreck It Again" [...] to refer to Manley's tenure as Prime Minister. Seaga during his tenure as Prime Minister emphasized the need to tighten public sector spending and cut close to 27,000 public sector jobs in 1983 and 1984. He shifted his plans as elections neared with a promise to spend J$1 billion on a five-year Social Well-Being Programme, which would build new hospitals and schools in Jamaica.|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} {{aim of the}} 'Federal Government's immediate action programme to reduce youth unemployment' is undoubtedly the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> youth <b>unemployment</b> and in particular long-term unemployment among young people. In this respect one may assume that in regions with poor initial situations on the labour market and apprenticeship market the possibilities of the immediate action programme for young people will also be used more intensively. Even though this thesis is confirmed, further examination {{makes it clear that}} the range of measures is used very differently in the employment office areas. The behaviour of the labour market players is determined both by structural basic conditions and by alternative possibilities, experiences and co-operation partners. The co-operation of the employment offices with relevant labour market partners is evaluated in depth in ten selected employment office areas. The immediate action programme is seen to {{have a positive effect on}} the intensity of co-operation between the employment office and the youth welfare and social assistance offices. The analysis provides first indications of intensive co-operation between the employment office and other regional players in labour market and social policy resulting in a reduction in youth unemployment. After this the effect that regional disparities and different strategies for implementing the immediate action programme in 1999 had on the development <b>of</b> youth <b>unemployment</b> and persistent unemployment among young people between 1998 and 2000 is analysed using multivariate regression models. Here the considerable influence of the general employment trend on the regional <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> youth <b>unemployment</b> can be seen. Taking into account regional and structural basic conditions it becomes clear in addition that the use of the immediate action programme only explains to a small extent the differences in the regional development <b>of</b> youth <b>unemployment.</b> It is necessary to emphasise in particular the positive effects that the immediate action programme for young people has on the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> long-term <b>unemployment</b> among young people. The proportion of long-term unemployed young people fell more considerably in employment office areas which make increased use of wage subsidies and employment creation measures with partial qualificationfor young people than it did in other areas.
