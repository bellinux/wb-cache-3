5|$|Ohio {{exported}} around $1.3 {{billion worth}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> plastics shipments in 2006. <b>Rubber</b> <b>and</b> plastics exports make up for 7.3% of total sales. Canada is the largest importer of Ohio's $1.3 {{billion worth of}} exports, accounting for 46% of this amount. The Census Bureau expects that an addition $1.1 billion worth of material is indirectly exported, through the means of other goods that are made from rubbers and plastics, including motor vehicles and machinery.|$|E

5|$|However, despite {{increased}} production, employment {{has been}} decreasing in Ohio's <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> plastic industry. In 2000, Ohio employed around 92,000 <b>rubber</b> <b>and</b> plastics industry workers. By 2006, those rates have declined by about 26% to about 69,000 workers. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information predicts that, from 2004 to 2014, {{there will be}} 11,200 less workers in Ohio's industry. They also predict that plastics employment in Ohio will decrease by 13.7%, and that rubber products employment will decrease by 20.7%. The industry currently employs about 73,000 Ohio workers, and employs about 12.3% of the United States' rubber employees, and 7.8% of the United States' plastics employees.|$|E
