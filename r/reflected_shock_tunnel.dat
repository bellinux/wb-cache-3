The shock tunnel and the expansion tube are briefly described, before focusing on operation of the <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel.</b> It is shown that test times and flow starting times are such as to allow testing with models of reasonable size, provided that large regions of flow recirculation do not exist. Some examples of experimental scramjet studies, conducted in a <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel,</b> are presented, demonstrating that the <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> is suitable for basic studies of scramjet flow processes.

The results were analyzed and interpreted with a one-dimensional quasi-three-stream combustor code that includes finite rate combustion chemistry. The {{results of this study}} indicate that the combustion process is kinetically controlled in the experiments in both tunnels and that the presence of the nonequilibrium partially dissociated oxygen in the <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> enhances the combustion.

To over come the lack of knowledge at nozzle exit in RSTs, experimenters typically calculate the quasi-steady gas properties at nozzle exit based on assumption that the test gas is processed, in stages, by idealized waves that are essentially decoupled.

40|$|Available {{test time}} is an {{important}} issue for ground-based flow research, particularly for impulse facilities such as <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> where test times of the order of several ms are typical.

This paper reports measurements of the driver gas arrival time in the test section of the T 4 free-piston shock-tunnel over the total enthalpy range 3 – 17 MJ/kg, using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The results confirm measurements made by previous investigators using a choked duct driver gas detector at these conditions, and extend the range of previous mass spectrometer measurements to that of 3 – 20 MJ/kg.

40|$|The {{development}} of new methods of producing hypersonic wind-tunnel flows at increasing velocities {{during the last few}} decades is reviewed with attention to airbreathing propulsion, hypervelocity aerodynamics and superorbital aerodynamics. The role of chemical reactions in these flows leads to use of a binary scaling simulation parameter, which can be related to the Reynolds number, and which demands that smaller wind tunnels require higher reservoir pressure levels for simulation of flight phenomena. The use of combustion heated vitiated wind tunnels for propulsive research is discussed, as well as the use of <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> for the same purpose. A flight experiment validating shock-tunnel results is described, and relevant developments in <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> instrumentation are outlined. The use of <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels</b> for hypervelocity testing is reviewed, noting the role of driver gas contamination in determining test time, and presenting examples of air dissociation effects on model flows.

40|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{free-stream}} flow properties can be measured in hypersonic impulse facilities at the nozzle exit. This poses challenges for experimenters when subsequently analysing experimental data obtained from these facilities. Typically in a <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel,</b> a simple analysis that requires small amounts of computational resources is used to calculate quasi-steady gas properties. This simple analysis requires initial fill conditions and experimental measurements in analytical calculations of each major flow process, using forward coupling with minor corrections to include processes that are not directly modeled. However, this simplistic approach leads to an unknown level of discrepancy to the true flow properties. To explore the simple modelling techniques accuracy, this paper details the use of transient one and two-dimensional numerical simulations of a complete facility to obtain more refined free-stream flow properties from a free-piston <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnel</b> operating at low-enthalpy conditions. These calculations were verified by comparison to experimental data obtained from the facility.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{database of}} heating, pressure, and flow field measurements on a 70 -deg sphere-cone blunt body geometry in high-enthalpy, CO 2 flow has been generated through testing in an expansion tunnel. This database {{is intended to}} support development and validation of computational tools and methods to be employed {{in the design of}} future Mars missions. The test was conducted in an expansion tunnel in order to avoid uncertainties in the definition of free stream conditions noted in previous studies performed in <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Data were obtained across a wide range of test velocity/density conditions that produced various physical phenomena of interest, including laminar and transitional/turbulent boundary layers, non-reacting to completely dissociated post-shock gas composition and shock-layer radiation.

Based on these comparisons, it is recommended that computational uncertainties on surface heating and pressure, for laminar, reacting-gas environments can be reduced to +/- 10 % and +/- 5 %, respectively. However, for flows with turbulence and shock-layer radiation, there were not sufficient validation-quality data obtained in this study to make any conclusions with respect to uncertainties, which highlights the need for further research in these areas...|$|R

The work is motivated by observed anomalies between experimental and numerical studies in hypervelocity impulse facilities. In this study, experiments are conducted in the hypervelocity expansion tube that, by virtue of its flow acceleration process, exhibits minimal freestream dissociation in comparison with <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels,</b> simplifying comparison with simulations. Shock shapes of the laboratory aeroshell at angles of attack of 0, 11, and 16 deg and spherical geometries are in very good agreement with simulations incorporating detailed thermochemical modeling.

The shock standoff distance is sensitive to the thermochemical state and is used as an experimental measurable for comparison with simulations and two different theoretical models. For low-density small-scale experiments, it is seen that models based upon assumptions of large binary scaling values do not match the experimental and numerical results. In an effort to address surface chemistry issues arising in high-enthalpy groundtest experiments, spherical stagnation point and aeroshell heat transfer distributions are also compared with the simulation.

40|$|Expansion {{tubes are}} {{important}} facilities {{for the study}} of high enthalpy hypersonic flows which avoid the non-equilibrium chemical and thermal effects associated with the flow stagnation intrinsic to <b>reflected</b> <b>shock</b> <b>tunnels.</b> X 3 {{is one of the largest}} freepiston super-orbital expansion tube in the world with an overall length of approximately 69 m and is capable of generating reentry speed flows equivalent to those experienced during a hyperbolic re-entry trajectory. It was originally built with a twostage free-piston driver to achieve the high compression ratio of a large diameter compression tube without the high construction costs of designing the large diameter tube to be strong enough to resist peak driver pressure loads. However, this arrangement proved difficult in operation. This paper describes the upgrades to X 3, in respect to its physical layout. The facility has been recommissioned to incorporate a single-piston driver, a steady expansion nozzle and a new test section. Major changes have been made to the free-piston driver with a re-designed piston and launcher and a new end cap tube which is 200 mm thick to contain driver pressures up to 80 MPa. The re-designed piston introduces an area change at the primary diaphragm, ensuring that the maximum increase in total pressure and temperature can be gained as the driver gas undergoes unsteady expansion from sonic to supersonic conditions. The compression process steadily increases up to Mach 1 at the throat then gains of up to an order of magnitude in total temperature and pressure can be realised as the unsteady expansion process takes over. The area change will also increase test times; with a throat at the primary diaphragm, the piston mechanics can be more readily tuned to minimise reflection of waves off the piston which would otherwise reduce the test time. A new Mach 10 steady expansion nozzle has been developed which has increased the core flow and the test time for appropriate conditions. The dump tank has been replaced with a larger tank and test section giving a larger volume with greater potential for instrumentation...|$|R

Very good agreement between experiment and CFD is seen for all shock shapes and heat transfer distributions fall within the non-catalytic and super-catalytic solutions. We also examine spatial temperature profiles in the non-equilibrium relaxation region behind a stationary shock wave in a hypervelocity air Mach 7. 42 freestream. The normal shock wave is established through a Mach reflection from an opposing wedge arrangement. Schlieren images confirm that the shock con guration is steady and the location is repeatable. Emission spectroscopy is used to identify dissociated species and to make vibrational temperature measurements using both the nitric oxide and the hydroxyl radical A-X band sequences. Temperature measurements are presented at selected locations behind the normal shock.
