5000|$|The {{two types}} of bone marrow are [...] "red marrow" [...] (medulla ossium rubra), which {{consists}} mainly of hematopoietic tissue, and [...] "yellow marrow" [...] (medulla ossium flava), which is mainly made up of fat cells. Red blood cells, platelets, and most white blood cells arise in <b>red</b> <b>marrow.</b> Both types of bone marrow contain numerous blood vessels and capillaries. At birth, all bone marrow is red. With age, {{more and more of}} it is converted to the yellow type; only around half of adult bone marrow is red. <b>Red</b> <b>marrow</b> is found mainly in the flat bones, such as the pelvis, sternum, cranium, ribs, vertebrae and scapulae, and in the cancellous ("spongy") material at the epiphyseal ends of long bones such as the femur and humerus. Yellow marrow is found in the medullary cavity, the hollow interior of the middle portion of short bones. In cases of severe blood loss, the body can convert yellow marrow back to <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> to increase blood cell production.|$|E
50|$|Located in long {{bones are}} two distinctions of bone marrow (yellow and red). The yellow marrow has fatty {{connective}} tissue and {{is found in}} the marrow cavity. During starvation, the body uses the fat in yellow marrow for energy. The <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> of some bones is an important site for blood cell production, approximately 2.6 million red blood cells per second in order to replace existing cells that have been destroyed by the liver. Here all erythrocytes, platelets, and most leukocytes form in adults. From the <b>red</b> <b>marrow,</b> erythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes migrate to the blood to do their special tasks.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} our study {{is to examine the}} {{correlation}} of the residual <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> areas of distal femoral metaphysis with the age, gender, weight and hemoglobin (hgb) values; evaluate the results, and comprehend the importance of these residual areas {{in the light of the}} results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 140 nonsmoking patients between the ages of 26 and 72 (92 women, 48 men) who had knee MR examinations were included in the study. The residual <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> areas in the distal femoral metaphysis in MR images were examined by a radiologist. The areas were separated into grades according to their sizes. The hemoglobin values of the cases were measured. The size of the residual <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> area and the age, gender, weight and hemoglobin values of the cases were compared by using the Tukey and Chi-Square Tests. RESULTS: Although no significant differences were observed between the mean ages, weights and hemoglobin values of the grades, a significant difference was detected between the gender distribution The male group had less residual <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> in the distal femoral metaphysis than the female group (p= 0. 003). CONCLUSIONS: We observed that the hypointensities due to residual <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> observed in the T 1 WS of the distal femoral metaphysis are not related with the age, weight and hemoglobin values. No grade 2 and grade 3 patient was detected in male group. We observed that these hypointense areas showed difference according to the gender variable; however, were not affected by the hemoglobin values over certain levels...|$|R

50|$|To {{diagnose}} diseases {{involving the}} bone marrow, {{a bone marrow}} aspiration is sometimes performed. This typically involves using a hollow needle to acquire a sample of <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> from {{the crest of the}} ilium under general or local anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|On CT {{and plain}} film, marrow {{change can be}} seen {{indirectly}} by assessing change to the adjacent ossified bone. Assessment with MRI is usually more sensitive and specific for pathology, particularly for hematologic malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma. These are difficult to distinguish from the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> hyperplasia of hematopoiesis, as can occur with tobacco smoking, chronically anemic disease states like sickle cell anemia or beta thalassemia, medications such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, or during recovery from chronic nutritional anemias or therapeutic bone marrow suppression. On MRI, the marrow signal {{is not supposed to}} be brighter than the adjacent intervertebral disc on T1 weighted images, either in the coronal or sagittal plane, where they can be assessed immediately adjacent to one another. Fatty marrow change, the inverse of <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> hyperplasia, can occur with normal aging, though it can also be seen with certain treatments such as radiation therapy. Diffuse marrow T1 hypointensity without contrast enhancement or cortical discontinuity suggests <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> conversion or myelofibrosis. Falsely normal marrow on T1 can be seen with diffuse multiple myeloma or leukemic infiltration when the water to fat ratio is not sufficiently altered, as may be seen with lower grade tumors or earlier in the disease process.|$|E
50|$|The {{bone marrow}} of animals {{is widely used}} by humans as food. It {{consists}} of yellow marrow contained in long bones.

50|$|The {{stem cells}} are {{typically}} harvested directly from the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> in the iliac crest, often under general anesthesia. The procedure is minimally invasive and does not require stitches afterwards. Depending on the donor's health and reaction to the procedure, the actual harvesting can be an outpatient procedure, or can require 1-2 days of recovery in the hospital.|$|E
50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are {{the stem cells}} {{that give rise to}} all the other blood cells through the process of haematopoiesis.

5000|$|In Modic type 2 {{there are}} changes in bone marrow, with fatty {{replacement}} of formerly <b>red,</b> cellular <b>marrow</b> normally seen there. With Modic type 2 changes the marrow is substituted by visceral fat, {{the same kind}} of fat we have on our hips and bellies.|$|R
40|$|Our {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} the relevance of different factors influencing lifetime accumulated <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> dose, such as calendar year, age and sex. The lifetime dose was estimated for controls interviewed in person (N = 2811, 37. 5 % women) of the population-based representative Northern Germany Leukemia and Lymphoma Study. Data were assessed in standardized computer-assisted personal interviews. The calculation of doses {{is based on a}} comprehensive quantification model including calendar year, sex, kind of examination, and technical development. In multivariate regression models the annual <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> dose was analyzed depending on age, sex and calendar year to consider simultaneously temporal changes in radiologic practice and individual risk factors. While the number of examinations continuously rises over time, the dose shows two peaks around 1950 and after 1980. Men are exposed to higher doses than woman. Until 1970 traditional examinations like conventional and mass screening examinations caused the main dose. They were then replaced by technically advanced examinations mainly computed tomography and cardiac catheter. The distribution of the <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow</b> dose over lifetime depends highly on the technical standards and radiation protection survey. To a lesser extent it is influenced by age and sex of the subjects. Thus epidemiological studies concerning the assessment of radiatio...|$|R
50|$|The {{outer shell}} of the long bone is made of {{cortical}} bone also known as compact bone. This is covered by a membrane of connective tissue called the periosteum. Beneath the cortical bone layer is a layer of spongy cancellous bone. Inside this is the medullary cavity which has an inner core of bone marrow made up of yellow marrow in the adult and <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> in the child.|$|E
5000|$|The stroma of {{the bone}} marrow is all tissue not {{directly}} involved in the marrow's primary function of hematopoiesis. Yellow bone marrow makes up the majority of bone marrow stroma, in addition to smaller concentrations of stromal cells located in the red bone marrow. Though not as active as parenchymal <b>red</b> <b>marrow,</b> stroma is indirectly involved in hematopoiesis, since it provides the hematopoietic microenvironment that facilitates hematopoiesis by the parenchymal cells. For instance, they generate colony stimulating factors, which {{have a significant effect on}} hematopoiesis. Cell types that constitute the bone marrow stroma include: ...|$|E

He coined the term myelogeneous leukemia, (today's acute myeloid leukemia), and described in 1882 the law of dissemination concerning yellow and red bone marrow: [...] "Again, it was Neumann who provided us with the classic statement. In 1882, he enunciated the rule governing the development of yellow marrow. In effect, he recognized a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to us as [...] "Neumann's law". It states that at birth all bones that contain marrow contain <b>red</b> <b>marrow.</b> With age, the blood producing activity contracts {{toward the center of}} the body, leaving the more peripheral bones with only fatty marrow.

30|$|The {{residence}} time of all <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> {{in the body}} was estimated from the lumbar vertebrae, which contains both <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> and bone.

40|$|<b>Red</b> <b>marrow</b> {{is usually}} the dose-limiting organ during radioimmunotherapy. Several {{non-invasive}} approaches to calculate the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> dose have been proposed. We compared four approaches to analyse the differences in calculated <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> doses. The data were obtained from immunoscintigraphy of two antibodies with different <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> kinetics [iodine- 131 - 16. 88 IgM and indium- 111 -OV-TL- 3 F(ab') (2) ]. The approaches are based on, respectively, homogeneously distributed activity in the body, a red marrow-blood activity concentration ratio of 0. 3, scintigraphic quantification, and {{a combination of the}} second and third approaches. This fourth approach may be more adequate because of its independence from the chosen antibody. In addition, the influence of activity accumulation in liver, kidneys or cancellous bone on <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> dose was studied. The calculated <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> dose varied between 0. 14 and 0. 42 mGy/MBq for In- 111 -OV-TL- 3 and between 0. 13 and 0. 68 mGy/MBq for I- 131 - 16. 88. If the radiopharmaceutical shows high affinity for cancellous bone or another organ situated near the <b>red</b> <b>marrow,</b> the activity in these organs must be included in dose calculations. This study shows a large variation in calculated <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> dose and selection of the definitive non-invasive approach awaits validation...|$|E
30|$|Since the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> is a dose-limiting organ in {{radionuclide}} therapy, we {{extended the}} dosimetry {{performed in the}} previous study [4] and included the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> as a source organ, too. We found that the absorbed dose in the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> was 2.26 E- 2  mGy/MBq, i.e. 75 % {{higher than that of}} previously published [4].

50|$|This {{hardened}} matrix {{forms the}} body of the bone. Since flat bones are usually thinner than the long bones, they only have <b>red</b> bone <b>marrow,</b> rather than both red and yellow bone marrow (yellow bone marrow being made up of mostly fat).

40|$|In long {{continued}} severe anemia due to {{bleeding in}} dogs we may observe all degrees of <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> spread. The maximal <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> spread {{takes in the}} total marrow area in ribs, vertebrae and long bones. The minimal <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> spread may involve but 10 to 20 per cent of this maximal area. All gradations between these extremes are observed in this series. The extent of the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> spread is not dependent upon {{the length of the}} anemia period nor is it related to the capacity of the dog to produce new hemoglobin and red cells on standard diets. Evidence points to the liver as concerned with this hemoglobin production and liver function may set the limits for hemoglobin production on these standard diets. This in turn may determine the needful <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> spread. During favorable diet periods there is a storage of hemoglobin or hemoglobin precursors which come out later in the control periods as finished red cells. This reserve of hemoglobin producing material is not stored as mature red cells in the marrow or elsewhere but as intermediates stored probably in the liver and <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> but also perhaps in the kidney and spleen. <b>Red</b> <b>marrow</b> very rarely gives evidence of exhaustion even after many years of continuous severe anemia (Dog 18 - 114). This would seem to consist of a shrinkage of the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> area rather than a degenerative change of the <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> cells. The spleen shows some evidence of erythrogenesis in these dogs. Megakaryocytes in some instances are conspicuous (Fig. 6) and nests of nucleated red cells are found in the spleen pulp but {{it is unlikely that the}} spleen contributes any large amount of red cells to the anemic circulation in these experiments. There is no evidence that erythrogenesis occurs in the liver or lymphatic tissue in these dogs...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{correlate}} the MR {{appearance of}} the proximal femur marrow with clinical and blood parameters.

This parameter and the bulk T 1 values of femoral <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> were determined in 30 other subjects 25 - 46 years of age and correlated with their blood parameters. RESULTS: In the series of 120 subjects, the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> surface area decreased with age (P < 10 (- 4)) and was higher in female than male subjects (P < 10 (- 4)). Within each decade, the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> surface area was higher in females than in males between 25 and 65 years but neither before 25 nor after 65 years. In the series of 30 subjects, the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> surface area and bulk T 1 values of femoral <b>red</b> <b>marrow</b> were significantly negatively correlated with hemoglobin blood levels but not with blood cell counts.
