40|$|We review {{three areas}} of recent {{research}} on Hudson River bay anchovy. One {{focus has been}} the along-estuary movement of early life stages. A cohort analysis of samples collected in a spatiotemporally extensive monitoring program has confirmed that early-stage anchovy migrate up-estuary, at an estimated rate of 0. 6 km/d. Complementary fine-scale field sampling was designed to clarify behaviors that effect the migration. This work found that early-stage anchovy can show preferences for depth and can conduct periodic vertical migration. To determine whether these behaviors were sufficient to produce up-estuary migration, larval flux and velocity were estimated. These estimates were consistent with local retention rather than concerted migration. High priority {{should be given to}} examining individual migration histories through analysis of otolith microchemistry. A second focus of research on Hudson anchovy has been on local population structure, permitting comparison to anchovy in other locations. The demography of the Hudson <b>River</b> <b>anchovy</b> appears to be unique. Anchovy that spawn in the Hudson River are larger than those spawning in the Chesapeake Bay region and are mostly two years old, whereas yearlings predominate in other estuaries. Batch fecundity was lower and egg mortality higher in Hudson River than in Chesapeake Bay. A key issue arising from these recent findings {{is the degree to which}} the Hudson anchovy pool is connected with other large anchovy pools, such as Narragansett Bay and Chesapeake Bay. A third focus of research on Hudson anchovy has been analysis of interannual variability in early-stage abundance. A 3 ̆e 20 year time series of juvenile bay anchovy abundance shows that juvenile abundance has varied over one order of magnitude. There has been no significant change in abundance over the entire time series, but abundance has declined 10 -fold since a peak in the late 1980 s. Anchovy abundance was negatively associated with the abundance of early-stage striped bass, and positively associated with the abundance of early-stage tomcod. We suggest that these associations reflect direct interactions among the species and urge further work on the ecological role of striped bass in the estuary...|$|E
25|$|Filter feeders {{strain the}} water column indiscriminately for small prey, {{typically}} phyto- and zooplankton. This category of fishes includes threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), inland silversides (Menidia beryllina), and anchovies (Engraulis mordax). Some evidence suggests {{that some of these}} species are food-limited due to the depressed levels of plankton after the introduction of the Amur <b>River</b> clam. <b>Anchovies</b> have left the LSZ in favor of more productive regions of the estuary in the San Pablo and Central Bays.|$|R
50|$|In subtidal areas, {{marine mammals}} such as harbor seals and California sea lions are {{sometimes}} present in Yaquina Bay. Sea lions in the estuary are mostly male. They {{move through the}} estuary, but {{spend a lot of}} time near the Bayfront or hauled out on docks, perhaps due to the additional food or safety. Some fish species present in Yaquina Bay include English sole and sculpin, in addition to <b>river</b> lamprey, lingcod, <b>anchovies,</b> Pacific herring, sturgeon, flounder, and salmon. Clams and Dungeness crabs are also present within the bay and make up a resource for recreational fishers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Generalized {{additive}} {{models are}} proposed {{for a better}} understanding of the underlying mecha-nisms for anchovy variations in abundance. Environmental variables derived from satellite imag-ery (surface chlorophyll, sea surface temperature and wind-mixing index), river discharge (Rhône River and Ebre <b>River)</b> and <b>anchovy</b> landings (landings per unit of effort) as proxy for abundance were used, and three fishing zones were defined along the Catalan Coast. A time shift among wind index mixing, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll was observed for these variables to be significantly correlated with anchovy. Results pointed out to processes that appear to greatly influence species abundance and affect different life stages of anchovy (conditions preceding reproduction, larvae growth and survival and recruits growth). A high proportion of anchovy LPUE variability could be explained by environmental variables. Thus, some univariate models explained deviance are more than 50 %, even up to around 70 % of anchovy variability. In several cases the deviance explained by a given variable was even higher at the longer time-lags. Among all univariate and bivariate models fitted, the model that best explained anchovy LPUE variability, 79 % of total deviance, was a model proposed for the central zone, based on the additive effect of surface chlorophyll and Rhône River discharge, considering time lags of 15 and 18 months, respectively, for each variable...|$|R
40|$|Ichthyoplankton {{samples were}} {{collected}} at approximately 2 -week intervals, primarily during spring and summer 1999 − 2004, from two stations located 20 and 30 km from shore near the Columbia <b>River,</b> Oregon. Northern <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis mordax) was the most abundant species collected, and was the primary species associated with summer upwelling conditions, but it showed significant interannual and seasonal fluctuations in abundance and occurrence. Other abundant taxa included sanddabs (Citharichthys spp.), English sole (Parophrys vetulus), and blacksmelts (Bathylagidae). Two-way cluster analysis revealed strong species associations based primarily on season (before or after the spring transition date). Ichthyoplankton abundances were compared to biological and environmental data, and egg and larvae abundances {{were found to be}} most correlated with sea surface temperature. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation changed sign (from negative to positive) in late 2002 and indicated overall warmer conditions in the North Pacific Ocean. Climate change is expected to alter ocean upwelling, temperatures, and Columbia River flows, and consequently fish eggs and larvae distributions and survival. Long-term research is needed to identify how ichthyoplankton and fish recruitment are affected by regional and largescale oceanographic proce...|$|R
