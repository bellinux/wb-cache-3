Within the consortium three participating SME companies, NZI (helmet manufacturer), Lookwell (garment manufacturer) and CAP (polymer manufacturer) {{are working together}} with three research institutes (CETEM, Fraunhofer and TECOS) on a novel vital sign monitoring and accident detection system to be seamlessly integrated into helmets and garments. The project develops and tests sensors to measure vital <b>data</b> of <b>riders</b> {{in order to enhance}} the eCall by relevant <b>rider's</b> <b>data.</b> Next to the eCall functionality, i-VITAL also aims at a continuous analysis of real-time vital data to warn the rider in order to prevent possible accidents or health hazards due to fatigue, sleepiness and inattentiveness respectively. To ensure reliability of the sensor system i-VITAL will develop and integrate energy harvesting capabilities into helmets and garments in order to maximize the duty time of the system. The paper presents the i-VITAL approach for eCall enhancement and vital data acquisition and the first project results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a user-centred design {{process that has}} been used to develop an innovative simulator for research into motorcycle ergonomics and rider human factors. Building on initial user requirements and user experience elicitation exercises, an evaluation was conducted to investigate specific issues associated with simulator fidelity. An experimental approach was employed to examine the physical and functional fidelity of the simulator. Using different steering and visual feedback configurations, a battery of objective and subjective dependent variables were analysed including: user perceptions and preferences, <b>rider</b> performance <b>data,</b> <b>rider</b> workload, rider comfort issues and the first evaluation of simulator sickness for a motorcycle simulator. The results indicated that across a number of measures, aspects of functional fidelity were considered more important than the physical fidelity of the simulator. This evaluation takes the development of the simulator a stage further and the paper provides recommendations for future improvements...|$|R

This technical note discusses an alternative scheme based on artificial neural network. Wave spectral distribution over various wave frequencies was obtained for given values of significant wave height and period using feedforward back-propagation network. The <b>rider</b> buoy <b>data</b> at a site off the United States coast monitored by the National Data Buoy Center {{was used as a}} basis for network development.

Using the Heckman’s sample selection model, the paper extends the current mobility literature by describing not only a rider’s likelihood to move {{as a result of the}} new LRT service but also the movers’ orientation toward their residence distances to LRT stations. Information on the socio-economic characteristics of the movers and their residence distances to LRT stations would help planners and developers identify areas where housing growth associated with specific characteristics of the riders will occur, and plan for these areas to provide affordable housing and amenities for relocating residents...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} case-series {{study of}} pedal- and motorcyclists presenting {{to a major}} metropolitan trauma centre over an 18 month period was undertaken. The injury data were coded according {{to a number of}} outcome variables, including intracranial injury of AIS severity ≥ 2. Helmet use was coded. After stratification by <b>rider</b> type, <b>data</b> were analysed to examine the relationships between helmet use and injury using logistic regression. A total of 220 injured motorcycle riders and 137 injured pedal cyclists met the study&rsquo;s inclusion criteria, with 195 motorcycle riders and passengers (88. 6 %) and 87 pedal cyclists (63. 5 %) wearing helmets. Helmets were associated with a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the likelihood of head and intracranial injury in both rider groups. Associated with helmet use was a reduction in intracranial injury likelihood of 66 % for both helmeted motorcycle riders and pedal cyclists. The study is further evidence of the benefits offered by helmets...|$|R
40|$|Wave height {{data are}} {{sometimes}} available at different space {{locations in the}} form of average values over larger time intervals. Difficulties may arise when such data are to be used for applications such as small-term operational forecasting for which information at closer intervals of time would be necessary. This paper presents an effort made to deduce wave heights over smaller time periods from their values sampled over longer durations, {{with the help of the}} disaggregation models traditionally used in hydrology. Use has been made of basic, extended as well as condensed disaggregation models. Considering the reliability and accuracy of wave <b>rider</b> buoy <b>data,</b> the same has also been employed along with satellite data for comparison purposes and for conducting some additional investigations. It has been found that statistically advantageous disaggregation models produce more satisfactory estimates of small-interval waves and that the smaller the level difference between high-level, large-interval series and low-level, small-interval ones, the larger the accuracy of resulting estimates...|$|R

With the {{emerging}} importance of bicycling as a sustainable form of transportation, coupled with its health benefits enhancing quality of life, understanding the ways bicycle policy is being addressed by cities {{is crucial to}} its healthy growth. The City of Madison, Wisconsin adopted the Mayor's Platinum Bicycling Committee's Report, "Making Madison the Best Place in the Country to Bicycle" in 2008. The report laid {{out a number of}} specific goals with the intent of increasing Madison's bike mode share. This report provided a tangible benchmark from which to assess the city's strategies to meet this goal. Interviews with local activists and a survey of existing <b>riders</b> provided <b>data</b> from a number of perspectives in order to help us analyze the cities bike policies. Four key themes emerged during our assessment - infrastructure, education, safety and community support.

40|$|The Upper Hance {{coal seam}} in southeastern Kentucy {{was used as}} a {{template}} to examine the spatial distribution of ash yield, sulfur content and petrographic constituents relative to the geometry of the deposit. Geometric characteristics include thinning and splitting of the two main benches, leaders and <b>riders.</b> Analytical <b>data</b> showed the thick, non-split portions of the coal body to be low in ash and sulfur as well as vitrinite content, whereas the thinned and split margins were higher in ash, sulfur and vitrinite content. These relationships suggest that thick non-split portions of the Upper Hance peat accumulated in areas isolated from detrital influx while thinner marginal peat was subject to intermittent flooding from adjacent channels. Marginal peat was derived from larger trees which flourished at the mire 2 ̆ 7 s edge in the presence of adequate nutrients, whereas only stunted vegetation, subsisting in the nutrient-depleted center, contributed to interior peat accumulation. Ponds formed on the sparsely vegetated mature surface of the bog 2 ̆ 7 s interior.

40|$|The smart e-bike {{monitoring}} system (SEMS) is {{a platform for}} the real-time acquisition of usage data from electrically-assisted bikes (also called pedelecs or e-bikes). It is autonomous (runs off the bike battery), replicable (open source and open hardware), scalable (different fleet sizes) and modular (sensors can be added), {{so it can be}} used for further research and development. The system monitors location (global positioning system), <b>rider</b> control <b>data</b> (level of assistance) and other custom sensor input in real time. The SEMS data feeds an online interface for <b>data</b> analysis, for <b>riders</b> to view their own data and for sharing on social media. The basic system can be replicated by other researchers and can be extended with modules to explore various issues in e-bike research. The source code and hardware design are publicly available, under the General Public License, for non-commercial use. SEMS was implemented on 30 bikes and collected data during 10 months of real-word trials in the UK. This study details the design and implementation of the hardware and software, discusses the system use and explores features for future design iterations.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the {{combined}} effect of driver age and engine size on accident severity and at-fault risk of young <b>riders</b> of two-wheelers. <b>Data</b> from the national accident database of Greece are used to calculate accident severity and relative fault risk rates. The induced exposure technique is applied {{due to the lack of}} exposure data. A log-linear analysis is then used to examine first- and second-order effects within three-variable groups. Accident severity modelling revealed a significant second-order interaction between severity, driver age and two-wheeler engine size. On the contrary, no second-order effects were identified in fault risk modelling. Moreover, a significant effect of driver age on accident fault risk was identified. The effect of engine size was not significant. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although the Jamaica {{road traffic}} act {{mandates}} motorcycle riders to wear approved helmets, opponents {{suggest that the}} local road conditions obviate any benefits from helmet use that have been proven in Developed countries. They suggest that the narrow, winding, poorly surfaced, congested local highways do not allow motorcyclists to sustain high velocity travel. The accidents then tend to occur at lower speeds and are accompanied by less severe injuries. This study was carried out to determine the impact of helmet use on traumatic brain injuries from motorcycle collisions in patients admitted to a tertiary referral hospital in Jamaica. Methods A prospectively collected trauma registry maintained by the Department of Surgery at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Jamaica was accessed to identify all motorcycle collision victims from January 2000 to January 2007. The therapeutic outcomes of traumatic brain injuries were compared between helmeted and un-helmeted <b>riders.</b> The <b>data</b> was analyzed using SPSS Version 12. Results Of 293 motorcycle collision victims, 143 sustained brain injuries. There were 9 females (6. 3 %) {{with an average age}} of 23 +/- 7. 3 years and 134 males (93. 7 %) at an average age of 33. 4 +/- 11. 2 years (mean +/- SD). Only 49 (34. 3 %) patients wore a helmet at the time of a collision. Helmet use at the time of a collision significantly reduced the severity of head injuries (28. 6 % vs 46. 8 %, P = 0. 028) and the likelihood of sustaining intra-cranial lesions (26. 5 % vs 44. 7 %, P = 0. 03) from head injuries. Conclusion Wearing a helmet at the time of a motorcycle collision reduces the severity of head injuries. However, the prevalence of helmet use at the time of a collision is unacceptably low. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{significant}} wave height and average wave period form an essential input for operational activities in ocean and coastal areas. Such information {{is important in}} issuing appropriate warnings to people planning any construction or instillation works in the oceanic environment. Many countries over the world routinely collect wave and wind data through a network of wave <b>rider</b> buoys. The <b>data</b> collecting agencies transmit the resulting information online to their registered users through an internet or a web-based system. Operational wave forecasts {{in addition to the}} measured data are also made and supplied online to the users. This paper discusses operational wave forecasting in real time mode at locations where wind rather than wave data are continuously recorded. It is based on the time series modeling and incorporates an artificial intelligence technique of genetic programming. The {{significant wave}} height and average wave period values are forecasted over a period of 96 hr in future from the observations of wind speed and directions extending to a similar time scale in the past. Wind measurements made by floating buoys at eight different locations around India over a period varying from 1. 5 yr to 9. 0 yr were considered. The platform of Matlab and C++ was used to develop a graphical user interface that will extend an internet based user-friendly access of the forecasts to any registered user of the data dissemination authority...|$|R
40|$|Protected {{areas are}} facing serious threat due to direct and {{indirect}} impacts of human activities. Official and vistor created trails monitored and investigated for management and protection purpose. Geospatial tools are highly implacable in impact assessment and inventory research. GIS inventory was conducted to understand the spatial distribution of formal and informal trails in the study area. We estimated that the linear distribution of trails is 151 km of which 52 % are informal trails. We have explored that the minimum width along user created trails is 0. 6 meters, and the maximum width is 3 meters with a mean value of 2. 3 m. The inventory estimated the trail footprint covers an area of 69 ha in the national park (out of 2676). User activity is {{an important aspect of}} trail inventory by analysing trails attributes (width, slope, TTF) off track activities have been identified as well. Flatter and wider trails are an indictaion of ORV and management vehicles driving on trails. Hotspots such as vandalism, TTFs, and informal boundary intersections were mapped as well, clearing vegetation on an area of 138 ha in the study area. We observed that approximately 197 ha of vegetation been lost due to planned, unplanned trails and hotspots. Trail slope is significant for impact assessment can be used to estimate erosion potential and hazard assessment. Slope distribution models (with 0 to 25 interval) were developed for formal, informal trails in the national park. Steeper slope, lower width is an indication of bike riding and walking on user created trails. We verified trail parameters and user related issues (Trail technical features, width, length, activity, vandalism, informal boundary intersects, ORV, bike riding on both planned and unplanned tracks) while ground-truthing survey (appendix figure 2). Comparing our inventory results with investigations conducted around the world accuracy were found around 75 % to 78 % (varying with a spatial and spectral resolution of available data). We concluded that GIS and remote sensing is capable of conducting inventory, efficiency can be improved by using higher spatial resolution data and then integrating inventory with field survey. We recommend that park management should involve users (bike <b>riders)</b> in <b>data</b> collection process as to educate them and understand their behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The Southern Nevada Alternative Fuels Program is {{designed}} to demonstrate, in a day-to-day bus operation, the reliability and efficiency of a hydrogen bus operation under extreme conditions. By using ICE technology and utilizing a virtually emission free fuel, benefits to be derived include air quality enhancement and vehicle performance improvements from domestically produced, renewable energy sources. The project objective is to help both Ford and the City demonstrate and evaluate the performance characteristics of the E- 450 H 2 ICE shuttle buses developed by Ford, which use a 6. 8 -liter supercharged Triton V- 10 engine with a hydrogen storage system equivalent to 29 gallons of gasoline. The technology used during the demonstration project in the Ford buses is a modified internal combustion engine that allows the vehicles to run on 100 % hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen gives a more thorough fuel burn which results in more power and responsiveness and less pollution. The resultant emissions from the tailpipe are 2010 Phase II compliant with NO after treatment. The City will lease two of these E- 450 H 2 ICE buses from Ford for two years. The buses are outfitted with additional equipment used to gather information needed for the evaluation. Performance, reliability, safety, efficiency, and <b>rider</b> comments <b>data</b> will be collected. The {{method of data collection}} will be both electronically and manually. Emissions readings were not obtained during the project. The City planned to measure the vehicle exhaust with an emissions analyzer machine but discovered the bus emission levels were below the capability of their machine. Passenger comments were solicited on the survey cards. The majority of comments were favorable. The controllable issues encountered during this demonstration project were mainly due {{to the size of the}} hydrogen fuel tanks at the site and the amount of fuel that could be dispensed during a specified period of time. The uncontrollable issues encountered during this project were related to the economy and the budget cutbacks required during the project duration, which resulted in fewer bus drivers than expected the ultimate shut down of the City’s downtown bus operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of what influences riders behavior at intersection {{is important in the}} design of appropriate and sustainable road safety strategies. Most motorcycle crashes occur at intersections and rider's emotional state determines how they overcome conflicts and challenges. From a cognitive perspective, this paper seeks to explore the dynamism in riders’ emotions as they traverse these intersections. The circumplex model of affect (Russell, 1980) was used as a framework to describe <b>riders</b> changing emotions. <b>Data</b> collection was through the use of participants’ interview and on-road semi-naturalistic study into road users’ situational awareness. 18 participants who had valid license and rode their own motorcycles participated in the study. They were requested to ‘think aloud’ as they rode on a predefined 15 km urban road. Result from the analysis of the transcribed verbal protocol shows that riders emotions vacillates between high and low, negative or positive affects. It was also observed that changes in rider’s emotions is more common from the zone of high positive affect into the zone of low positive affect, and less common from the zone of low negative affect into the zone of low positive affect. This simply means riders rather than remain jittery or nervous, transit to comfortable emotional states like being calm and excited or change from being calm to becoming gloomy or sluggish as they approach or exit intersections. The implication of the findings include recommendation for road infrastructures that reduces transitions into negative emotional states which can lead to conflict at road intersection, but encouraging activities that improves safety and situational awareness. Junctions and intersections that make riders and other road users more cognitively alert and emotionally excited were recommended...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the factors underlying transit {{demand in the}} multi-destination, integrated bus and rail transit network for Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta provides an opportunity to explore {{the consequences of a}} multi-destination transit network for bus patrons (largely transit-dependent riders) and rail patrons (who disproportionately illustrate choice <b>rider</b> characteristics). Using <b>data</b> obtained from the 2000 Census, coupled with data obtained from local and regional organizations in the Atlanta metropolitan area, we estimate several statistical models that explain the pattern of transit commute trips across the Atlanta metropolitan area. The models show that bus riders and rail riders are different, with bus riders exhibiting more transit-dependent characteristics and rail riders more choice rider characteristics. However, both types of riders value many of the same attributes of transit service quality (including shorter access and egress times and more direct trips) and their use of transit is influenced by many of the same variables (including population and employment). At the same time, the factors that influence transit demand vary {{depending on the type of}} travel destination the rider wishes to reach, including whether it is the central business district (CBD) or a more auto-oriented, suburban destination. The results of the study offer new insights into the nature of transit demand in a multi-destination transit system and provide lessons for agencies seeking to increase ridership among different ridership groups. The results suggest that more direct transit connections to dispersed employment centers, and easier transfers to access such destinations, will lead to higher levels of transit use for both transit-dependent and choice riders. The results also show that the CBD remains an important transit destination for rail riders but not for their bus rider counterparts. Certain types of transit-oriented development (TOD) also serve as significant producers and attractors of rail transit trips...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The United States energy {{information}} administration states that more that 50 % of commuters drive their own cars to work. This implies that traffic congestion can be mitigated if public transit service can take {{a larger share of}} commuting trips. However, a commuter's choice depends on the utility associated with each available mode. Transit service must be improved to increase its utility and therefore attract more riders. To improve customer satisfaction and reduce operation costs, transit authorities have been striving to monitor their transit service quality and identify the key factors to attract the transit <b>riders.</b> Traditional manual <b>data</b> collection methods are unable to satisfy the transit system optimization and performance measurement requirement due to their expensive and labor-intensive nature. The recent advent of passive data collection techniques (e. g. Automated Fare Collection and Automated Vehicle Location) has shifted a data-poor environment to a data-rich environment, and offered opportunities for transit agencies to conduct comprehensive transit system performance measures. Although it is possible to collect highly valuable information from ubiquitous transit data, data usability and accessibility are still difficult to improve due to the following reasons: (1) most Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems are not designed for transit performance monitoring, hence additional passenger trip information cannot be directly retrieved. (2) Each passive data collection method has its intractable disadvantages, and requires additional domain knowledge to process. Interoperating and mining heterogeneous datasets would enhance both the depth and breadth of transit-related studies. (3) The amount of data involved is increasingly growing, and traditional data processing applications might not be suitable to handle in an efficient fashion. Such data barriers hinder the development of a large-scale transit performance monitoring system. This study attempts to fill these research gaps by developing a series of data mining algorithms for transit rider's origin and destination information extraction with transit Smart Card (SC) data. The primary data source of this study comes from the AFC system in Beijing, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) and alighting stop (destination) on a flat-rate bus are not recorded on the check-in and check-out scan. A Markov chain based Bayesian decision tree algorithm is proposed to mine the passengers' origin information using SC data. In addition, this study further proposes an integrated data mining procedure that models the travel patterns and regularities of transit riders. This procedure is able to incorporate transit riders' trip chains based on their temporal and spatial characteristics, and capture their historical travel patterns in an efficient manner. Then, {{on the basis of the}} identified travel patterns, the individual-level destination can be estimated with transfer analysis through a multi-day observation. Finally, to remove data accessibility barriers, facilitate data sharing and visualization, and conduct online data analysis for transit performance measures, an e-science of transportation platform entitled TransitNet is developed. TransitNet enables the connections and interoperability among the heterogeneous transit data sets including SC data, GPS data and Geographic Information System (GIS) data. This platform not only serves as a data-rich visualization platform to monitor transit network performance for planning and operations, it also intends to take advantage of e-science developments for data-driven transportation research and applications...|$|R
