40|$|The {{addition}} of {{small amounts of}} organoclays during the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> polycarbonates (WPCs) is a promising method for improving {{the properties of the}} recycled plastics. However, the clays can also induce the degradation of the polymer during the melt compounding and thus lower the properties of the final materials. This clay-induced degradation of polycarbonate (PC) was examined in this study. A WPC, a virgin PC (VPC) (that served as a comparison), and two commercial montmorillonites, Cloisite 15 A and Cloisite 30 B, were melt compounded in a twin-screw microextruder. The degradation of the polymer, which caused the formation of phenolic compounds and the reduction of the average molar mass, was monitored with UV spectroscopy, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and solution viscosimetry. The results reveal that the effect of the clays on the degradation depended on the amount of clay used and the chemical nature of the organic modification. When small amounts of the appropriate clay were used, the polymer degradation was minimized, and a net improvement of some properties of the recycled PC was achieved...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose ? To discuss {{integration}} of the rapid prototyping environmental aspects with the primary focus on electrical energy consumption. Design/methodology/approach ? Various manufacturing parameters have been tested on three rapid prototyping systems: Thermojet (3 DS), FDM 3000 (Stratasys) and EOSINT M 250 Xtended (EOS). The objective is to select sets of parameters for reduction of electrical energy consumption. For this, a part is manufactured in several orientations and positions in the chamber of these RP systems. For each test, the electrical power is noted. Finally, certain rules are proposed to minimize this electrical energy consumption during a job. Findings ? It is important to minimize the manufacturing time {{but there is no}} general rule for optimization of electrical energy consumption. Each RP system must be tested with energy consumption considerations under the spotlight. Research limitations/implications ? The work is only based on rapid prototyping processes. The objective is to take into consideration the complete life-cycle of a rapid prototyped part: manufacturing of raw material as far as <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> Practical implications ? Reduction of electrical energy consumption to complete a job. Originality/value ? Currently, environmental aspects are not well studied in rapid prototyping...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{patented}} {{process for the}} treatment and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and effluents from olive oil and cork industries (such as two-phase olive husks cork powder), new research {{has been carried out}} incorporating other industrial waste. In previous research, using only olive oil and cork waste, biomass pellets were obtained having high calorific values (20. 6 MJ/kg and 22. 2 MJ/kg), low moisture (8. 9 %) and relatively a low ash percentage (3. 9 %). Several new formulations and their relevance to the calorific value were now tested using other waste or by-products. The potential inclusion of olive leaves from the olive oil industry, grape husks and grape seeds from the winery industry and chestnut shells (outer shell and inner skin) from the chestnut industry has been analysed. This process will contribute to solving environmental problems resulting from the discharge of those waste and effluents and to create a viable and profitable alternative to their storage and/or deposition in landfill. The increase of other biomass sources for these types of process is extremely important from an environmental and economic management point of view. This research shows that the use of different types of raw materials as biomass sources (giving different pellets formulations) results in a different final product with different physical and chemical characteristics that may improve its quality...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{significant}} database of origin postcodes, a {{study was designed}} to estimate the current annual mileage associated with visitor trips to household waste recycling centers (HWRCs) —known as manned recycling drop-off centers in the United States—and to identify how this mileage could be reduced if a series of "bring sites" (unmanned recycling drop-off centers) in the community were enhanced to take green garden waste. The total annual distance driven by approximately 4, 677, 000 visitors to the 26 HWRCs in Hampshire, United Kingdom, is estimated to be 40 million kilometers (assuming that 60 % of visitors made dedicated trips), costing approximately £ 14 million (£ 1 = $ 1. 896 in April 2005 U. S. dollars) in private transport and emitting approximately 1, 873 tonnes of CO 2 (as carbon) into the atmosphere. Providing a network of 104 bring sites capable of accepting green waste, in addition to the existing facilities provided by the 26 HWRCs, could save approximately 8. 5 million kilometers (21 %) of vehicle travel per annum (£ 3 million in visitor transport costs and approximately 369 tonnes of CO 2 as carbon). Such a scheme would require a fleet of approximately 78 refuse collection vehicles at an annual cost to the scheme provider of slightly more than £ 1. 5 million. If HWRCs become a major channel for the return and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> electrical and electronic equipment and some newly classified hazardous waste items, space at existing sites could become an issue.

50|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{has been}} politically controversial {{because of the}} potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting, and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle. The Obama administration has disallowed <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>waste,</b> citing nuclear proliferation concerns. Critics <b>of</b> <b>reprocessing</b> worry that the recycled materials will be used for weapons. However, it is unlikely that reprocessed plutonium would be used for nuclear weapons, because it is not weapons-grade. Nonetheless, it is possible that terrorists could steal these materials, because the reprocessed plutonium is less radiotoxic than spent fuel and therefore much easier to steal. Nuclear power plants may not even notice if plutonium was stolen. It is difficult for plants to measure within even tens of kilograms, because making measurements at that accuracy is very time-consuming; consequently, it is likely that smaller amounts of plutonium could be stolen without detection. Additionally, reprocessing is more expensive when compared with spent fuel storage. One study by the Boston Consulting Group estimated that reprocessing is six percent more expensive than spent fuel storage while another study by the Kennedy School of Government stated that reprocessing is 100 percent more expensive.|$|R

Although there exist a number of technological hurdles, the main cause that has consistently plagued a solution to nuclear waste has been the politics behind it. This thesis attempts to add to the political literature behind nuclear waste disposal by examining the nuclear <b>waste</b> disposal preferences <b>of</b> members of the United States House and Senate. It then compares and contrasts those preferences with a report by President Obama 2 ̆ 7 s Blue Ribbon Commission on America 2 ̆ 7 s Nuclear Future. The hope was to determine if the commission 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation, the controversial method of geologic disposal, would be an acceptable method to the Energy Committees of both houses of Congress or if there existed an alternative disposal method that found acceptance. The study 2 ̆ 7 s results found an alternative disposal method, <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>waste,</b> was acceptable to the Congressional committees, while there was a division of support in the committees in regards to geologic disposal.

40|$|Coal {{combustion}} {{is recognized}} as {{the primary source of}} anthropogenic mercury emission in South Africa followed by gold mining. Coal is also known to contain trace concentrations of mercury which is released to the environment during coal mining, beneficiation or combustion. Therefore, determining the mercury speciation in coal is of importance in order to understand its behavior and fate in the environment. Mercury was also used, at a large extent, in the Witwatersrand Basin (South Africa) for gold recoveries until 1915 and is still used in illegal artisanal mining. Consequences of these activities are the release of mercury to the environment. Nowadays, gold (and uranium) is also recovered through the <b>reprocessing</b> <b>of</b> old <b>waste</b> dumps increasing the concern related to mercury pollution. While much effort has been put in the northern hemisphere to understand and control problems related to anthropogenic mercury release and its fate to the ecosystem, risk assessment of mercury pollution in South Africa was based, until very recently, on total element concentrations only or on non systematic fragmental studies. It is necessary to evaluate mercury speciation under the country’s semi arid conditions, which are different to environmental conditions that exist in the northern hemisphere, and characterize potential sources, pathways, receptors and sinks in order to implement mitigation strategies and minimize risk. In this study, analytical methods and procedures have been developed and/or optimized for the determination of total mercury and the speciation of inorganic and organic forms of mercury in different sample matrices such as air, coal, sediment, water and biota.
