5000|$|The PSD {{program is}} complex, and obtaining a permit {{can be costly}} for both the {{applicant}} and the permitting authority. It has been estimated, for example, that permit applicants expend 866 hours of labor and $125,120 on the average PSD permit. The administrative cost to the permitting authority for the same permit is 301 hours of labor and $23,280. Traditionally, this permitting process {{has been focused on}} controlling emissions from large industrial sources of air pollution such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, petroleum refineries, and a wide range of manufacturing plants that emit more than 250 tons per year of the regulated pollutants (in some cases the applicability threshold is 100 tons per year). Prior to the regulation of GHGs under the CAA, approximately 280 such permits were issued each year. However, GHGs are generally emitted from sources in amounts far greater than other pollutants regulated under the PSD program. So much so, that sources like office buildings and large shopping malls could easily cross the 250 ton per year threshold and become subject to PSD permitting requirements. In fact, without any action to change how the PSD program is applied, the EPA estimated that as many as 41,000 sources may require permits every year with the addition of GHGs as a regulated pollutant. To prevent the unbearable administrative burdens on permitting authorities associated with such [...] "absurd results," [...] the EPA took action on June 3, 2010 to modify the applicability criteria in the PSD regulations. This action is known as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule (Tailoring Rule). Through the Tailoring Rule, EPA raised the major source <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> for GHGs from the 100/250 ton per year levels to 100,000 tons per year of CO2 equivalent emissions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the price-setting process for Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) {{is influenced by}} Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. The findings indicate a significant positive relation between underpricing {{and the presence of}} a regulatory constraint requiring an amendment for a large price change. IPOs with positive price revisions constrained at the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> are significantly more underpriced than IPOs undertaking positive price revisions exceeding the regulatory limit. This association is reversed, albeit weaker, for IPOs with negative price revisions. Offerings with constrained downward price revisions tend to be more over-priced. Exceeding the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> and filing an amendment imposes additional cost and risk by delaying the offering. Additionally, incorporating a price change exceeding the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> is associated with an increased risk of offering failure. Thus, there are off-setting costs making it rational for issuers to “leave money on the table. ” In addition, the regulatory constraints provide a possible alternative explanation for the partial adjustment phenomenon. In response to unexpectedly high demand, the issuer might only partially adjust the offer price in order to stay within the allowable pricing threshold and avoiding delaying the offering. For positive revisions of the offer price, the results show a significant positive relationship between underpricing and offer price revision up to the point of the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold,</b> while the slope change at the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> is negative and significant. I interpret these results as consistent with the hypothesis that SEC regulations are an impediment to accurate pricing of IPOs. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{desire to}} reduce human {{exposure}} to toxic chemicals associated with consumer {{products that are}} marketed globally demands the creation of comparative toxicity assessment tools {{that are based on}} uniform thresholds of acceptable risks and guidelines for materials use across international boundaries. The Toxic Potential Indicator (TPI) is a quantitative model based on European Union (EU) regulatory standards for toxicity and environmental quality. Here, we describe a version of TPI that we developed with US <b>regulatory</b> <b>thresholds</b> for environmental and human health impacts of toxic materials. The customized US-based TPI (USTPI) model integrates occupational permissible exposure limits (PELs), carcinogen categories based on the scheme of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and median effect concentration for acute aquatic toxicity (EC 50 s). As a case study, we compare calculated scores for EU-based TPI (EUTPI) and USTPI for a large group of chemicals including 578 substances listed in the US Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). Statistical analyses show that the median difference between USTPI and EUTPI scores do not approximate to zero, implying a general discrepancy in TPI score results. Comparison of chemical ranking with Spearman's correlation coefficient suggests a positive but imperfect rank correlation. Although some discrepancies between EUTPI and USTPI may be explained by missing toxicity information in some regulatory categories, disparities between the 2 models are associated mostly with different input parameters, i. e., different <b>regulatory</b> <b>thresholds</b> and guidelines. These results demonstrate that regional differences in <b>regulatory</b> <b>thresholds</b> for material toxicity may compromise the ideals of international agreements, such as the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, and emphasis needs to be placed on eliminating inconsistencies in hazard assessment frameworks for substances...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePurpose Since 2005, {{freshwater}} fish contamination by polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorodibenzodioxins, and polychlorodibenzofurans has been assessed in the Rhone River basin (France). A large database of surface sediment contamination by PCBs is also available, opening {{the way to}} the study of biota-to-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) distribution throughout this basin. The ultimate goal {{of the study was to}} determine a sediment quality guideline (SQG) corresponding to the regulatory fish consumption limit. Materials and methods A bootstrapping procedure for determining BSAFs was applied to a data set matching the available databases of sediment and fish contamination by PCBs in the Rhone River basin. The SQG was obtained by combining the current tissue-based <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> with a characteristic BSAF value, for a species particularly prone to accumulating these compounds. As the current <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> refers to dioxins and related com- pounds, while most available sediment data deal with non- dioxin-like PCBs, a set of correlations was used to derive an SQG for the sum of seven indicator PCBs. To assess the reliability of these SQG pairs, actual fish and sediment concentrations were classified into four categories, accord- ing to a comparison with the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> for fish data and the calculated SQG. Results and discussion BSAFs were determined for 11 species. The barbel and European eel had the highest BSAFs. The common carp, a benthic species, had surpris- ingly low BSAFs, as low as pelagic and omnivorous species such as chub. The data set was also split into two parts, one comprising fish samples at or above the regulatory limit and the other samples below this threshold. Sediment concentrations and BSAFs were higher in the former group. An SQG was derived on the basis of the 75 th percentile of barbel's BSAF, equaling 26. 6 ng g− 1 dry weight (range 15. 6 - 38. 6 ng g− 1) for the sum of seven indicator PCBs. When tested against the same database, this SQG displayed an overall efficiency of about 60 % resulting from the limited reliability of sediment data and the factors influencing PCB bioavailability. Conclusions From the perspective of regulatory frame- works such as the European Water Framework Directive, a tiered monitoring strategy combining sediments (first tier) and biota (second tier) could be more relevant than a single- compartment approach. In this context, an SQG such as the one determined herein would trigger the second tier...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{persistent}} pollution of soils by an organochlorine, chlordecone (CLD {{also known as}} Kepone ©) in the French West Indies, some crops may be contaminated beyond the European <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold,</b> the maximum residue limit (MRL). Farmers {{need to be able}} to foresee the risk of not complying with the <b>regulatory</b> <b>threshold</b> in each field and for each crop, if not, farmers whose fields are contaminated would have to stop cultivating certain crops in the fields concerned. To help farmers make the right choices, we studied the relationship between contamination of the soil and contamination of crops. We showed that contamination of a crop by CLD depended on the crop concerned, the soil CLD content and the type of soil. We grouped crop products in three categories: (i) non-uptakers and low-uptakers, (ii) medium-uptakers, and (iii) high-uptakers, according to their level of contamination and the resulting risk of exceeding MRL. Using a simulation model, we computed the soil threshold required to ensure the risk of not complying with MRL was sufficiently low for each crop product and soil type. Threshold values ranged from 0. 02 μgkg− 1 for dasheen grown in nitisol to 1. 7 μgkg− 1 for yam grown in andosol in the high-uptake category, and from 1 μgkg− 1 for lettuce grown in nitisol to 45 μgkg− 1 for the leaves of spring onions grown in andosol in the medium-uptake category. Contamination of non-uptakers and low-uptakers did not depend on soil contamination. With these results, we built an easy-to-use decision support tool based on two soil thresholds (0. 1 and 1 μgkg− 1) to enable growers to adapt their cropping system and hence to be able to continue farming.

Indicators that a waste is industrial include the following: Waste type. Certain types of waste are known to be classified as industrial waste, such as treated wood; soils contaminated with non-hazardous or low levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and petroleum hydrocarbons; non-friable asbestos waste; and oil filters. In many cases, these wastes result from construction-related projects under the purview of the Facilities Division. Such operations include excavations, the removal of fencing or cooling towers, and building demolition. Waste generation history. The waste generator’s process knowledge of the waste stream can help identify the proper waste category. Sampling and analysis. If the level of contamination is unknown, sampling and analysis can help determine if the waste falls within the industrial waste classification.
