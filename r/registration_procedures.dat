25|$|Corruption {{often leads}} to many civil {{services}} being treated by governments as employment agencies to loyal supporters and so it could mean going through 20 procedures, paying $2,696 in fees and waiting 82 business days to start a business, in Bolivia, while, in Canada, it takes two days, two <b>registration</b> <b>procedures,</b> and $280 to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms {{at the expense of}} small enterprises, where most jobs are created. Often, businesses have to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which is, in effect, a tax on business.

25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter <b>registration</b> <b>procedures</b> before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E

40|$|Objective: A <b>registration</b> <b>procedure</b> of {{intraoperative}} three-dimensional rotational x-ray (3 DRX) {{imaging and}} preoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging so that intraoperative CT quality imaging is available during cochlear implant surgery, providing detailed information concerning electrode {{position in the}} cochlea {{and its relation to}} surrounding bony structures. Study Design: Retrospective case series Setting: Tertiary referral center Data: The imaging of five patients who had undergone cochlear implant surgery is used to develop a semiautomatic <b>registration</b> <b>procedure</b> to integrate intraoperative 3 DRX and preoperative CT. The method is implemented in advanced medical imaging software to compute the transformations. The electrode is segmented from the registered 3 DRX images using a semiautomated approach. The segmented electrode is superimposed onto the CT data. The methods are quantitatively validated based on expert-labeled anatomical landmarks. These landmarks are identified in the CT and 3 DRX images by an expert. Main Outcome Measure: Mean error of the <b>registration</b> <b>procedure</b> for five anatomical landmarks in millimeters. Results: Quantitative analysis showed a mean error of between 0. 5 and 1 mm for all anatomical landmarks, suggesting that the results are trustworthy. Conclusion: We developed a reliable <b>procedure</b> for the <b>registration</b> of intraoperative 3 DRX imaging and preoperative CT imaging for cochlear implant surgery. This <b>registration</b> <b>procedure</b> provides the ENT surgeon intraoperative high-quality CT imaging during cochlear implant surgery. Copyright (C) 2014 by Otology 2 ̆ 6 amp; Neurotology, Inc.
