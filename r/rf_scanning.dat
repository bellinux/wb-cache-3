40|$|Beamforming is a {{necessary}} feature of high-capacity communication links operating at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands. Due {{to the advancement of}} CMOS-SiGe processes, mm- wave phased arrays can be manufactured at low cost with compact sizes. Transmit arrays are capable of improving the low-output power of silicon PAs through beam directivity. However, reaching (relatively) high efficiency while maintaining high-linearity for QAM waveforms poses a design trade-off. Receive systems suffer from low signal levels and potentially high-power jammers from neighboring links that are not spatially rejected. High linearity is essential for attaining the most efficient communication for both transmit and receive systems. High directivity of the system suggests the need for adaptive beam-scanning methods that do not require skilled labor to determine the location of the transmitter and receiver. The first portion of the dissertation discusses the performance of two phased-array architectures (LO and <b>RF</b> <b>scanning)</b> in presence of jammers. Analytical equations are derived which incorporate the antenna array geometry, array circuit architecture, and channel non-linearity. Secondly, a low-EVM (error-vector- magnitude) direct-conversion I/Q modulator is presented at Q-band in 120 nm SiGe process. The effect of various circuit errors on modulation quality is analyzed. In particular, a new analysis and closed-form equations are presented for the impact of I/Q path compression, power- amplifier AM-AM and AM-PM non-linearity on the system EVM. The second version of implemented Q-band I/Q upconverter incorporates two 12 -bit DACs and active mixers and is demonstrated to pre-distort a 16 -QAM through an off-chip power amplifier. Finally, a novel adaptive beam-steering I /Q receiver array is proposed and demonstrated in 45 nm CMOS SOI process. The proposed architecture allows auto- steering {{in the direction of the}} incident signal and supports modulated RF signal for high-data rate communication. The technique uses combined dynamics of coupled-oscillator arrays (COA) and coupled-phased locked loops (CPLL).

40|$|The {{higher order}} fields {{present in the}} {{quadrupole}} ion trap may have beneficial effects such as increases in mass resolution in the mass-selective instability or resonance ejection modes of operation, but may also result in losses of ions due to nonlinear resonances. In this work, the reduction in ion intensities observed in the mass spectra of polyethylene glycol (PEG 1000) has been utilized to monitor the ion losses resulting from these higher order fields during the <b>rf</b> voltage <b>scans</b> in both the forward and reverse directions. Extensive ion losses were observed in reverse <b>rf</b> voltage <b>scans</b> at qz = 0. 64 (az = 0), which corresponds to octopole resonance at βz = 1 / 2.

40|$|Chemical mass shifts are {{measured}} in quadrupole ion traps operated in the mass-selective instability scan with resonance ejection. Chemical mass shift {{is the result}} of compound-dependent collisional modification of the ejection delay produced by field faults near the endcap electrode apertures. Both dissociative and non-dissociative collisions can occur but the dissociative collisions make the predominant contribution to the chemical mass shifts. Non-linear resonances due to higher order fields lead to dramatic decrease in chemical mass shifts at certain βz values. The large chemical mass shifts associated with the nitro-aromatic compounds could serve as a diagnostic for identifying this class of compounds in mixtures and a simple method of implementing this test is described based on the effect of non-linear resonance on the chemical mass shifts. Uses of chemical mass shift for high-resolution distinction of isobars and isomers are demonstrated by using the nonlinear <b>RF</b> <b>scan</b> functions in chemical mass shift experiments. By careful choice of resonance conditions, ion ejection during the prolonged ejection delay is effected exclusively by dissociative collisions while ions undergo non-dissociative collisions remain in the ion trap which can be ejected by the second RF ramp. ^ The orbitrap mass analyzer, {{a new version of the}} Kingdon trap, employs an electrostatic quadro-logarithmic field for ion trapping. A stable ion trajectory in the orbitrap field is a combination of rotation around the central electrode and harmonic oscillation along its axis. The frequency of the axial harmonic oscillation provides the basis for mass analysis that is measured by image current detection followed by the Fourier transformation. An RF front-end quadrupole system successfully couples the orbitrap mass analyzer with a continuous electrospray ionization source.

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) and tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (MSn) approaches {{play vital roles}} in the molecular analysis of {{many different types of}} analytes (e. g., proteins, peptides, etc.). The typical molecular mass spectrometry experiment involves making/sampling ions, probing ions, and transmitting/measuring ions. While the work described herein covers a broad range of technical mass spectrometry instrumentation and experimentation topics on each of these three main segments, the fundamental study of physical and chemical ionic behaviors is a common theme throughout. ^ A technique which has been previously developed to manipulate droplets generated via electrospray ionization (ESI) during the ionization process (viz. the making/sampling phase) was quantified using a mathematical model. This technique involves the controlled introduction of volatile acidic and basic reagents into the interface region of the mass spectrometer where electrospray droplets are undergoing desolvation on the sub-millisecond time scale. Quantitative pH results from this model show good correlation with experimental results. ^ Several projects were also completed involving ion transmission phases. One such projected was the construction and implementation of a miniature ion funnel interface, based off of the design reported by Julian et al. This interface is designed to increase the transmission efficiency (100 x) of ions generated via atmospheric ionization techniques into the high vacuum region of the mass spectrometer. Once the ions are inside the mass spectrometer, it was discovered that introducing a monopolar DC field during a number steps in a typical 3 -D ion trap MS experiments could result in significant enhancements in instrument performance (e. g., ion accumulation efficiency, ion/ion reaction control, mass analysis). The final phase of a mass spectrometry experiment involves measuring and detecting the ions. A novel method for performing mass analysis in a 3 -D ion trap was developed and characterized which involves scanning the quadrupolar DC potential applied to the ion trap while holding the RF potential. This `downscan 2 ̆ 7 can offer some advantages over the traditional <b>RF</b> <b>scan</b> for ions of high m/z values, including a larger scanable mass range as well as the opportunity for improved resolution at high mass. ^ Perhaps more chemically interesting is the work herein devoted to the development and characterization of several different methods to structurally interrogate ions (viz. the 2 ̆ 2 probing 2 ̆ 2 phase). The design and development of two ion activation approaches using a 3 -D ion trap mass spectrometer, dipolar direct current collision induced dissociation (DDC CID) and photodissociation (PD), have been other major areas of research. Interesting characteristics of DDC CID, relative to the conventional single-frequency resonance excitation approach commonly employed, are its non-resonant or broad-band nature and the fact that ions of all m/z values are activated simultaneously. ^ Key to the information derived from activation techniques such as the one mentioned above and from reactions performed inside the mass spectrometer is the ion type. Our research group is actively pursuing targeted chemical derivatization techniques that can be performed via ion/ion reactions (viz. reactions involving a cation and anion) in the gas-phase as part of MSn workflows for biopolymer characterization. Here, this targeted gas-phase chemistry is extended to analytes containing carboxylic acid groups and carboxylate groups using carbodiimide and fixed charge ammonium reagents, respectively. ^ In the spirit of exploring a wider range of chemistries, studies have been conducted involving non-covalently-bound cluster ions as reagent ion types. Relatively stable non-covalent cluster-type ion complexes have been used as multi-functional reagents in ion/ion reactions. This type of methodology allows for multiple covalent modifications to be achieved in a single ion/ion encounter and at the `cost 2 ̆ 7 of only a single analyte charge. These experiments spurred further investigation into the surprisingly gas phase reactive behavior of arginine residues cationized with sodium towards sulfo-NHS ester reagents. Additionally, another area of research aims to implement a means to cool a 3 -D ion trap so as to extend the lifetimes of solvated ions, which are typically short lived under ambient MS conditions. This instrumentation opens up numerous avenues for both fundamental and applicative studies {{of a wide variety of}} different chemical reactions, allowing the study of solution-phase-limited reactions using the inherent benefits of mass spectrometric analysis.

ESAs are typically realized using the hybrid connection of four discrete components: RF manifold, phase shifters or Butler matrices, antennas and T/R modules. The hybrid connection of these components increases the system size, packaging cost and introduces parasitic effects that lead to higher losses. In order to eliminate these drawbacks, {{there is a need}} to integrate these components on the same substrate, forming a monolithic phased array. RF MEMS technology enables the monolithic integration of the ESA components into one highly integrated multifunctional module, thereby enhancing ESA designs by significantly reducing size, fabrication cost and interconnection losses. A novel capacitive dual-warped beam shunt MEMS switch is presented that utilizes warped beams to enhance its RF performance. This switch exhibits an off-to-on capacitive ratio of almost 170, isolation better than 40 dB, switching speeds as low as 6 μs without the need for thin dielectrics or high dielectric constant materials. These MEMS switches are implemented into single pole three throw (SP 3 T) and single pole four throw (SP 4 T) configurations. A novel 3 -bit finite ground coplanar waveguide switched delay line MEMS phase shifter is developed with four cascaded SP 3 T dual-warped beam capacitive switches to achieve low-loss performance and simplify ESA design. The fabricated prototype unit exhibits an insertion loss of 2. 5 ∓ 0. 2 dB with a phase error of ∓ 6 °.

Topics include: • Replacement of existing copper cables between controller and pedestal using fiber-optic cable with interfaces that are not software-based intensive (black boxes); • Multiplexing pedestal control and status lines, <b>RF</b> feed commands, <b>scan</b> reference signals, and boresite video camera control; • Connecting and controlling multiple controllers and/or pedestals through one common interface cable; • Operating multiple tracking stations through one remote antenna controller; • Digitized RF telemetry signals sent along with pedestal, feed, video commands and status...|$|R
