6000|$|Certain minor {{provisions}} follow lines {{which in}} our survey of the Treaty are now familiar. Under Annex III. of the Reparation Chapter Germany is to cede up to 20 per cent of her inland navigation tonnage. Over and above this she must cede such proportion of her river craft upon the Elbe, the Oder, the Niemen, and the Danube as an American arbitrator may determine, [...] "due regard being had to the legitimate needs of the parties concerned, and particularly to the shipping traffic during the five years preceding the war," [...] the craft so ceded to be selected from those most recently built.[72] The same course is to be followed with German vessels and tugs on the Rhine and with German property in the port of Rotterdam.[73] Where the Rhine flows between France and Germany, France is {{to have all the}} rights of utilizing the water for irrigation or for power and Germany is to have none;[74] and all the bridges are to be French property as to their whole length.[75] Finally the administration of the purely German <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> of Kehl lying on the eastern bank of the river is to be united to that of Strassburg for seven years and managed by a Frenchman to be nominated by the new Rhine Commission.|$|E

The Swiss Gymnastics and Sports Museum (Schweizerische Turn- und Sportmuseum), established in 1945, was renamed as the Swiss Sport Museum in 1977. Sponsored by a foundation (Stiftung Sportmuseum Schweiz), its major focus is on ball sports, cycling, gymnastics and winter sports. The shipping museum Transport Hub Switzerland (Verkehrsdrehscheibe Schweiz) emerged from a 1954 exhibition by the Swiss Shipping Company (Schweizerische Reederei) in the <b>Rhine</b> <b>ports</b> of Basel, entitled “Our Path to the Sea.” It is also supported and run by an association of private citizens. The Swiss Historical Paper Collection (Schweizerische Papierhistorische Sammlung) was an affiliate of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum für Völkerkunde) from 1954 to 1979 before moving into independent quarters in the Gallician Mill, located in the former industrial district of St. Alban, in 1980. Now known as the Swiss Museum for Paper, Writing and Printing (Schweizerisches Museum für Papier, Schrift und Druck), it is sponsored by the Basel Paper Mill Foundation (Stiftung Basler Papiermühle). The Jewish Museum of Switzerland (Jüdisches Museum Schweiz), which presents the cultural history of Jews in Switzerland and in Basel including documents from the First Zionist Congress held in Basel in 1897, was founded by the Society for the Jewish Museum of Switzerland in 1966.|$|R

50|$|Despite the German {{trade and}} various {{measures}} for food self-sufficiency, Switzerland eventually used up her food stockpiles and suffered severe shortages of fuel through lapses in the German coal supply, increasingly relying on her forests and hydroelectric power. To help keep her people supplied with imports, and despite having no shoreline, the Swiss government developed its own merchant marine, acquiring several vessels {{that had been}} impounded for smuggling or withdrawal foreign flags. The ships were based in the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> of Basel, which gave access to the seaport of Rotterdam, until Allied bombing of a German dam interrupted it.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} manage growing volumes of {{container}} traffic for imports and exports, a new terminal for transshipment between ships, rail and lorries is being constructed in northern Basel {{in close proximity}} to the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> at Basel-Kleinhüningen. An initial step for transshipment between rail and road is planned for completion by the end of 2016. However, plans for the Limmattal Gateway near Zurich - a new large-scale terminal for trains of up to 750 metres in length - have been postponed. No action is currently being taken with regard to these plans and the planning approval procedure has been shelved.16 In mediation proceedings instigated by the FOT, however, the logistics industry has agreed that the possibility of building a gateway in Limmattal should definitely be kept open. In order to continue to meet the requirements of the regional economy in the future, the transshipment centre for intermodal transport in Dietikon is to be expanded and upgraded.|$|E

50|$|A dock was in {{operation}} in Ipswich on {{a bend in}} the River Orwell in the 8th century, and was probably established during the 7th century under the protection of the ruling house of the Kingdom of East Anglia, which reached its summit under King Raedwald. The importance of this dock, and the surrounding town which served it, has been recognized through excavation over the past fifty years. The early town of Ipswich (then called Gipeswic), centred upon the quay, extended over more than 52 hectares, the area later enclosed by the Viking age ramparts (which curtailed the Anglo-Saxon township), {{making it one of the}} largest new early post-Roman townships and emporia in northern Europe. Imported pottery of Rhenish Merovingian types, imported lava quern-stones and barrel-timbers dendro-dated to 8th century Germany, and finds of continental coinage such as 'porcupine sceattas' indicate trade through the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> towns including Domburg, Dorestad and Andernach, as part of the cultural engagement of Anglo-Saxon England with the Frisian, Frankish, Alamannic, Saxon, Thuringian and Burgundian worlds. The important 'Ipswich Ware' pottery industry, established in the town's north-east quarter probably in the late 7th century, reflected shapes and kiln technologies based on Frisian prototypes, either in imitation of imports arriving at the quay or set up by migrant Frisian workers. The Gipeswic dock was therefore the trade capital of the East Anglian Kingdom, situated not far from its royal centre at Rendlesham and Sutton Hoo. During the 7th and 8th centuries the two greatest English ports were York (Eoforwic) and London, and two principal new ports were Gipeswic in the east and Hamwic (Southampton) in the south. Like Hamwih, Gipeswic dock was therefore a point of departure and arrival for continental travel.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{cultivation}} {{and seed}} import bans {{of genetically modified}} (GM) oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), feral GM plants were found growing along railway lines and in port areas at four sites in Switzerland in 2011 and 2012. All GM plants were identified as glyphosate-resistant GM event GT 73 (Roundup Ready, Monsanto). The most affected sites were the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> of Basel and the St. Johann freight railway station in Basel. To assess the distribution and intra- and interspecific outcrossing of GM oilseed rape in more detail, we monitored these two sites in 2013. Leaves and seed pods of feral oilseed rape plants, their possible hybridization partners and putative hybrid plants were sampled in monthly intervals and analysed {{for the presence of}} transgenes by real-time PCR. Using flow cytometry, we measured DNA contents of cell nuclei to confirm putative hybrids. In total, 2787 plants were sampled.

40|$|In Switzerland, the {{cultivation}} of genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) {{and the use of}} its seeds for food and feed are not permitted. Nevertheless, the GM oilseed rape events GT 73, MS 8 ×RF 3, MS 8 and RF 3 have recently been found in the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> of Basel, Switzerland. The sources of GM oilseed rape seeds have been unknown. The main agricultural good being imported at the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> of Basel is wheat and from 2010 to 2013, 19 % of all Swiss wheat imports originated from Canada. As over 90 % of all oilseed rape grown in Canada is GM, we hypothesised that imports of Canadian wheat may contain low level impurities of GM oilseed rape. Therefore, waste fraction samples gathered during the mechanical cleaning of Canadian wheat from two Swiss grain mills were analysed by separating oilseed rape seeds from waste fraction samples and testing DNA of pooled seeds for the presence of transgenes by real-time PCR. Furthermore, oilseed rape seeds from each grain mill were sown in a germination experiment, and seedling DNA was tested for the presence of transgenes by real-time PCR. GT 73, MS 8 ×RF 3, MS 8 and RF 3 oilseed rape was detected among seed samples and seedlings of both grain mills. Based on this data, we projected a mean proportion of 0. 005 % of oilseed rape in wheat imported from Canada. Besides Canadian wheat, the <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> of Basel does not import any other significant amounts of agricultural products from GM oilseed rape producing countries. We therefore conclude that Canadian wheat is the major source of unintended introduction of GM oilseed rape seeds into Switzerland...|$|E
50|$|The first {{highway system}} {{to have been}} built, the {{extensive}} German Autobahn network famously has no general speed limit for light vehicles (although posted speed limits are in force in most sections today, {{and there is a}} blanket 80 km/h limit for trucks). The country's most important waterway is the river <b>Rhine.</b> The largest <b>port</b> is that of Hamburg. Frankfurt Airport is a major international airport and European transportation hub. Air travel is used for greater distances within Germany but faces competition from the state-owned Deutsche Bahn's rail network. High-speed trains called ICE connect cities for passenger travel with speeds up to 300 km/h. Many German cities have rapid transit systems and public transport is available in most areas. Buses have historically only played a marginal role in long distance passenger service, as all routes directly competing with rail services were in essence outlawed by a law dating to 1935. Only in 2012 was this law changed and thus a long distance bus market has also emerged in Germany since then.|$|R
40|$|BRIT XIV - The Border: {{a source}} for Innovation, MONS, Belgique, 04 -/ 11 / 2014 - 07 / 11 / 2014 We assert with Jacques Lévy and Michel Lussault (2003) that {{geography}} {{can be defined as}} a social science that is fundamentally interested by the interpretation of social control of distances. Insofar, transport and border, are from central importance in any geographic disciplinary approach. The two diametrically opposed but intricated notions are functioning as a territorial chiasmus (in reference to the rhetorical figure of speech denoting reversal or inversion). On one hand the border is be understood a political phenomenon that creates distance in proximity. On the other hand, the transport network may be interpreted as a technical artifact introducing proximity between distant places (Groupe Frontières 2004). But it can also happen that some geographical elements belong {{at the same time to}} both spatial systems. In this case they have to find out a way to conciliate apparently contradictory dimensions by inventing a singular way of solving the tensions by specific geographic dispositions (i. e. by spatial, technical or institutional arrangements). We qualify such technico-political articulation as border nodes (Beyer, 2007). The fascinating point with this type of geographical objects is that they exist as a dialectical relationship to transport networks and to borders. Their systematic analysis in a geographical perspective has been one of my recent research fields, especially in the Upper Rhine area (Beyer, 2007) and more generally in Europe (Beyer, 2008 & 2011). In this perspective, scholars have surely paid too little systematic attention to the interpretation of the spatial and political dispositions that made possible for the Rhine to play a major international transport corridor in spite of strong national discontinuities. We are convinced that border nodes as defined above are key elements in this perspective. Especially in its upstream navigable course (from Mannheim to Basle), the Rhine is characterized by an ambivalent situation, at the same time by easing connection opportunities and imposing strong political separations. The first element is illustrated by its international status that granted free navigation and provides for economic development in its ports. The second issue is characterized by strong political and military rivalries that contributed to the diplomatic but also physical shaping of the river. We aim to analyze further this interwoven reality by examining the historical development of the Upper <b>Rhine</b> <b>port</b> system and its current expression in a unifying Europe...|$|E
