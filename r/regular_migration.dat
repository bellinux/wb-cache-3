50|$|The {{coal tit}} is an all-year {{resident}} throughout almost all range, making only local movements {{in response to}} particularly severe weather; only the Siberian birds have a more <b>regular</b> <b>migration.</b> Very rarely, vagrants may cross longer distances; for example the nominate subspecies of continental Europe was recorded in Ireland once in 1960 and once before that, but apparently not since then.|$|E
5000|$|At {{present a}} growing problem is the time taken to {{reproduce}} an archive, for instance following a hardware or system upgrade. Since {{the sheer volume of}} archive data continues to grow, new hardware is always required to maintain the archive and so <b>regular</b> <b>migration</b> of data to a new system must be performed on a regular basis.

50|$|Finfoots {{are found}} in {{numerous}} habitats in the tropics {{as long as there}} is water and cover. It is uncertain why cover is so essential to finfoots, but they are extremely secretive and often overlooked. Their ranges extend from coastal creeks to fast-moving mountain streams, most commonly being found in large slow moving bodies of water. They also use swamps, reed beds, mangroves, and forest. Finfoots are territorial, probably for much of the year and certainly when breeding. They are not thought to undertake <b>regular</b> <b>migrations,</b> but some birds do regularly disperse and they are quick to colonise new areas of suitable habitat.|$|R
50|$|Great {{frigatebirds}} undertake <b>regular</b> <b>migrations</b> {{across their}} range, both regular trips and more infrequent widespread dispersals. Birds marked with wing tags on Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals {{were found to}} regularly travel to Johnston Atoll (873 km), one was reported in Quezon City in the Philippines. One male great frigatebird relocated from Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel to the Maldives 4400 km away for four months, where it fed on rich fishing grounds. Despite their extended range, birds also exhibit philopatry, breeding in their natal colony even if they travel to other colonies.|$|R
50|$|While {{details are}} {{difficult}} to establish, some researchers believe Termit may be home to the last self-sustaining population of the critically endangered addax, which at one time made <b>regular</b> <b>migrations</b> from {{what is now the}} Aïr and Ténéré Addax Sanctuary {{on the edge of the}} Ténéré desert. Several hundred dama gazelle are noted here. Though the slender-horned gazelle had previously been reported here, it was unknown by 1999 if it was still found in the area. The Saharan cheetah is reported to be very few in number, about 10. They have adopted to the searing heat of the Saharan Desert and can survive without a perennial source of water.|$|R

50|$|Most Pallas's leaf warblers {{found in}} Europe are first-year birds, and {{several reasons for}} the large {{increase}} in numbers in autumn have been proposed. In the past, these warblers were widely considered to be vagrants or reverse migrants, but were more recently thought to be undertaking a <b>regular</b> <b>migration,</b> {{taking advantage of the}} mild oceanic climate on the western fringes of Europe for overwintering. A flaw in that theory is that many birds should winter in Spain, particularly in the northwest, but Pallas's leaf warbler is rare in that country and tends to occur in the east. Spanish ornithologist Eduardo de Juana has therefore proposed that once the warblers reach northwest Europe, they then reorientate to a south easterly direction.|$|E
50|$|Small numbers, {{most likely}} {{from the western}} end of the {{breeding}} range, regularly winter in western Europe. These arrive in Great Britain in late September and October after a 3,000-3,500 km migration from the Urals, a markedly shorter distance than the 5,500-6,000 km they would need to fly to reach the normal wintering areas in southeastern Asia. Exact numbers in this population are unknown, but typically several hundred are found arriving in Great Britain each autumn; given their unobtrusive behaviour, this is probably {{only a fraction of the}} total. In the past widely considered to be vagrants, these birds are now thought to be undertaking a normal <b>regular</b> <b>migration,</b> able to take advantage of the mild oceanic climate winters on the western fringes of Europe for wintering.|$|E
50|$|It is {{native to}} {{southern}} Angola, southern DRC, Zambia, southern Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Swaziland. It occupies any arid to moist, and relatively open savanna woodlands, especially where Acacia trees are present. They frequent the edges of Miombo woodland, and occur commonly along water courses, dry riparian forest and in Acacia woodland on alluvium. It also occurs commonly on farms and in suburban gardens and parks. They require water, and disperse along tributaries of desert rivers when water flows. It is absent from areas that lack suitable fruiting trees, and seems to desert areas where bush encroachment occurs. They have no <b>regular</b> <b>migrations,</b> but wander about irregularly {{in search of food}} and water.|$|R

50|$|Individuals {{are usually}} {{sedentary}} and can {{remain in a}} specific area all year round. They have however been reported to migrate on a local scale. Circumstantial evidence from the novel presence of individuals at Incachaca Lake in the Chapare Province of Bolivia suggests that this species may migrate between the geographically separated northern Bolivian and other South American populations, and may use Incachaca as a resting place en route. Since no subspecies have been noted for this species, the world population is probably kept genetically homogenous by short migrations of individuals between the two geographically separated subpopulations. However, it remains unknown whether this species has <b>regular</b> <b>migration</b> patterns. Incidentally, the species’ discovery at Lake Incachaca was its first recorded occurrence in the cloud forest ecoregion and was also a new altitudinal record.|$|E
50|$|This species also {{occurs as}} a regular migrant to western Europe, and is seen most years in Ireland or Great Britain. While the {{pectoral}} sandpiper has not been recorded as breeding species in Europe, vagrant individuals were found in Scotland in suitable breeding habitat during summer. Many of the birds occurring in Western Europe may be on a <b>regular</b> <b>migration</b> from Asian breeding grounds to winter in Southern Africa. September 2003 saw a record influx to those two countries, with 40 found in Ireland and 150 in Great Britain. On the US Pacific coast, such stagings of migrant flocks appear to be rarer. Vagrant individuals are sometimes seen elsewhere off the usual migration routes, e.g. on the Marianas, the Marshall Islands and Palau in Micronesia; they are somewhat more frequently encountered on the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpatial {{behaviour}} was {{studied in}} the past through group concepts, such as residential or <b>regular</b> <b>migrations</b> from home to work. The will to understand travel behaviour for {{the full range of}} trip purposes and the growing personalisation of behaviour leads to adopt the term of mobility from social sciences. This change is not purely semantic. It expresses the transition from a vision based on the needs to the consideration of the strategic capabilities of the persons, from areola-based representations of a local society to network and archipelago- based representations of individual behaviours. We have used, in conjunction with the international community of travel behaviour analysts, the travel surveys introduced in the sixties to feed traffic models, to build concepts, indicators and representations of travel behaviour, to understand in depth the transformations of mobility patterns and to analyze the roles of individual rationality and social norms. The paper relates this history, highlights some key results and strong beliefs, and questions the need to explore new paradigms. © Presses Universitaires de France...|$|R

50|$|The {{study of}} skeletons found in tombs, always in cists, shows an {{evolution}} from the Neolithic. Osteoporosis was less prevalent although arthritic diseases {{continued to be}} present. Thus, diet had improved. Life expectancy progressed: men lived up to forty or forty-five years, but women only thirty. The sexual division of labour remained {{the same as that}} identified for the Early Neolithic: women busied themselves with small domestic and agricultural tasks, while men took care of larger duties and crafts. Agriculture, as elsewhere in the Mediterranean basin, was based on grain (mainly barley, which needs less water than wheat), grapevines and olive trees. Animal husbandry was already primarily concerned with goats and sheep, as well as a few hogs, but very few bovines, the raising of which is still poorly developed on the islands. Fishing completed the diet base, due for example to the <b>regular</b> <b>migration</b> of tuna. At the time, wood was more abundant than today, allowing for the construction of house frames and boats.|$|E

40|$|Parental care {{strategies}} {{have been widely}} investigated in shorebirds that undertake long-distance <b>regular</b> <b>migrations.</b> In contrast, virtually nothing is known of the parental care of nomadic, opportunistically breeding shorebirds, although the irregular and short-lived nature of their breeding potentially accentuates the trade-offs between investment in successive clutches and between the sexes. We investigated the incubation behaviour of the nomadic, opportunistically breeding Banded Stilt (Cladorhynchus leucocephalus). Seven nests, filmed continuously with day–night cameras over 2 – 7 days, revealed that both sexes contributed to incubation, with males apparently the sole carer during hatching and early brood-rearing; this is a possible adaptation, which enables females to quickly produce a second clutch if favourable conditions persist. All incubator changeovers occurred after dark; incubation shifts averaged 44. 8 ± 10. 9 (s. e. m.) h (n = 11, 17. 5 – 139. 6 h), the longest recorded for any shorebird. Incubation constancy averaged 96. 5 %; this high value is possibly an adaptation to high predation {{and the need for}} rapid embryonic development in the face of ephemeral resources for breeding. Long incubation shifts may be explained by extended foraging trips to distant areas of the partially inundated salt-lake surface, where food resources had been concentrated by wind-driven water movement...|$|R
50|$|The pipits {{range from}} entirely {{sedentary}} to entirely migratory. Insular species like the Berthelot's pipit, which is endemic to Madeira and the Canary Islands, are entirely sedentary, as are some species in warmer areas like the Nilgiri pipit. Other species are partly nomadic during the non-breeding season, like the long-legged pipit of central Africa or the ochre-breasted pipit of South America. These seasonal movements are {{in response to}} conditions in the environment, and are poorly understood and unpredictable. Longer, more <b>regular</b> <b>migrations</b> between discrete breeding and wintering grounds are undertaken by several species. The tree pipit which breeds in Europe and northern Asia, winters in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, a pattern of long-distance migration shared with other northerly species. Species may also be partly migratory, with northern populations being migratory but more temperate populations being resident (like the meadow pipit in Europe). The distances involved {{do not have to}} be that long; the mountain pipit of southern Africa breeds in the Drakensberg of South Africa and migrates north only as far as Angola and Zambia. Migration is usually undertaken in groups, and may happen both during the day and at night. There is some variation in this, for example the Sprague's pipit of North America apparently only migrates by day.|$|R
50|$|Within Africa, ten species make <b>regular</b> intra-continental <b>migrations</b> {{that are}} {{described}} as polarised; that is, they spend the non-breeding season in the tropical centre of the continent and move north and south to breed in the more arid and open savannah and deserts. This {{is the same as}} the situation in the Neotropics, where no species have this migration pattern, or tropical Asia, where a single species does. 83% of the Australian species are partial migrants within Australia or travel to New Guinea and Indonesia after the breeding season.|$|R
