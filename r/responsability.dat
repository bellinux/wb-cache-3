40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the ethical <b>responsabilities</b> of the design process, it is a priority to develop this dissertation. It seeks to {{understand the importance of}} design {{from the point of view}} of a producer of “material culture”, and the need to introduce ethics in the process of design. Also, by implementing ethical <b>responsabilities</b> in the design process, it generates the development of objects that have ethical commitment, and increases critical thinking in the designer. The design as a process, activity, and profession in the service of the humans; is capable of transforming the current reality with environmental and social problems, to achieve well-being in many aspects not only for present but future generations. This thesis contextualizes both ethical <b>responsabilities</b> and the design process; the design itself and its importance through the Culture of Design; and ethics through philosophical thinking, to establish a bond and a common purpose. Not only that, but also talks about the theory and concept of design and ethics, through the analysis of the proposals that have been published on the subject. Additionally, this research helps find the places in wich ethical <b>responsabilities</b> influences design. In order to obtain these findings; we elaborated a synthesis of the problem, what is necessary, and the function of three different fields: design, ethics and the social and environmmental context, each one of them to submit a formal proposal. The proposal was defined in three areas: Design Responsibilities, Responsibilities of the Design project and Designer Responsibilities, each one of these areas to define the priorities of the designers. We propose these three areas, because the design is the material result of the process, the designer is the person that develops the object by the process and the design project is the process itself. To evaluate our proposal, we publish surveys that helped us to categorized the priorities and add suggestions to complement our work. The responses obtained, ratified both tendencies of authors such as our thinkin...|$|R

Then the homozygote viabilities of the third chromosome were estimated under the normal (2512) and the heat-shock (371 (3) conditions. A degree of response(name as <b>Responsability)</b> {{was measured by the}} ratio of viabilities under the heat shock and the normal condition. Furthermore, the puffing patterns of the strains which have shown high and low <b>responsability</b> were analyzed with heat-induced puffs on the polytene chromosome in order to observe relationship between <b>responsability</b> and the expression of Hsp genes. The following results were obtained. 1) The lethal frequency on the third chromosome of homozygous strains was 0. 277 + 0. 042. 2) The average viabilities of non-lethal homozygous strains were estimated 0. 800 + 0. 026 and 0. 726 + 0. 026 at normal and heat shock condition, respectively. 3) The average <b>responsability</b> was estimated 0. 938 + 0. 032. The wide distribution of responsabilities represented that there were many of variants for heat-shock responses in the third chromosome of the natural population. 4) Comparing with the puffing patterns on the polytene chromosome, it was observed that the duration of the puffs of 87 A and 87 C, which were known to code Hsp 70, was longer in the strains of high <b>responsability</b> than in those of low one. ope...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} the 2001 decentralization reform in Colombia. I use data from Colombia's municipalities. I look at the effect of the 2001 reform on enrolment in pre-college schools. While all municipalities received earnmarked national transfers, withthe reform some of then now have more <b>responsabilities</b> to provide education (deeper decen-tralization) than others. Particulary important, the reform entitle the more decentralizedmunicipalities to sign subsidy contracts with private school. Departments (the regional gov-ernments) are entitle to sign this type of contracts for the less decentralized municipalities. Since the rule for municipalities to receive more <b>responsabilities</b> follows and exogenous popu-lation threshold, I can implement Regression Discontinuity Design. Enrolment is measuredthrough two variables: the number of students enroled in public schools and the number of subsidized students enroled in private schools. Results sugest that more decentralized mu-nicipalities subsidize more students in private schools. The difference is significant at all thelevels of pre-college school for the period 2004 - 2006. In 2005, the difference accounts for 20 % of enrolment in private schools and 3 % of population of school age. Besides, there are not significant differences among municipalities regarding enrolment in public schools. Decentralization, Education Reform, Quasi-experiments and Colombia...|$|R

40|$|For {{several decades}} now, {{and for a}} number of {{different}} reasons, there has been a significant reawakening of interest in Aristotle's practical philosophy. In particular it is widely held that his philosophy can work as a model for safeguarding the fundamental ethical demands without having to deny the natural essence of the human being and without having to resort to a metaphysical basis. This article sets out to question this theoretical approach. It considers in particular two main problems: the <b>responsability</b> of the individual {{and the role of the}} knowledge of good in ethics. The comparison between two recent publications (Susan Sauvé Meyer, Aristotle on Moral <b>Responsability.</b> Character and Cause, Oxford UK - Cambridge USA 1993; AAVV, Aristotle, Kant and the Stoic. Rethinking Happiness and Duty, ed. by S. Engstrom and J. Whiting, Cambridge 1996), is directed towards demonstrating that Aristotle's ethical thought does not meet demands nowadays considered essential. As for <b>responsability,</b> Aristotle succeeds in justifying <b>responsability</b> for actions but not <b>responsability</b> for character: the results are hardly acceptable (in contrast to what S. Sauvé Meyer holds). With regard to the knowledge of good, it is broadly estabilished that, in his ethics, Aristotle does not consider it to be a central theme (as in Kant's). The question is whether the lack of this particular feature is really, as many maintain, a positive characteristic. This paper aims to demonstrate that it is not the case, or at least it is not when evaluating ethical theories from a general current perspective, because nowadays the fundamental ethical problem seems indeed to be the identification of an intersubjective consent on the notions of good and evil. If, in our search for an effective model for modern reflection, we wish to turn our attention to ancient philosophy, then the Socratic/Platonic approach seems to be much more promising than that of Aristotle...|$|E
