5|$|Fleet Street {{is a major}} {{street in}} the City of London. It runs west to east from Temple Bar at the {{boundary}} with the City of Westminster to Ludgate Circus {{at the site of}} the London Wall and the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> from which the street was named.|$|E
5|$|Tanning {{and other}} {{industries}} declined sharply after the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> was routed underground in 1766. The street was widened during the late-19th century, when Temple Bar was demolished and Ludgate Circus was constructed. The {{headquarters of the}} Anti-Corn Law League were based at No.67 Fleet Street, and a blue plaque marks the location.|$|E
5|$|Fleet Street {{is named}} after the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet,</b> which runs from Hampstead to the River Thames at {{the western edge of}} the City of London. It is one of the oldest roads outside the {{original}} city and was established by the Middle Ages. In the 13th century, it was known as Fleet Bridge Street, and in the early 14th century it became known as Fleet Street.|$|E

5|$|After {{a return}} to the United States in mid-1970, Yancey entered {{inactive}} status at Norfolk on 1 October of that year. The ship was decommissioned at Norfolk on 20 January 1971, and entered the James River berthing area of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Yancey was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 January 1977. The vessel remained in the James <b>River</b> <b>fleet</b> until 16 August 1984 when she was withdrawn to be stripped of useful equipment by the U.S. Navy. She re-entered the fleet one year later, on 28 August 1985, but was withdrawn for the final time on 15 December 1989 to be prepared for sinking as an artificial reef.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Maurice oversaw early preparations, {{although}} it was primarily under his successor, Richard de Beaumis, that construction work fully commenced. Beaumis was assisted by King Henry I, who gave the bishop stone and commanded that all material brought up the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> for the cathedral should be free from toll. To fund the cathedral, Henry gave Beaumis rights to all fish caught within the cathedral neighbourhood and tithes on venison taken in the County of Essex. Beaumis also gave a site for the original foundation of St Paul's School.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to make a}} {{comprehensive}} interpretation of Roman military river boats from the 1 st - 4 th century A. D. which will be mainly oriented on the direct archaeological findings of these ships. To better understand the function {{and the use of the}} boats, the first chapter will present various military units that commanded their own flotillas, whereby commentary will be predominantly focused on the <b>river</b> <b>fleets.</b> The core of this thesis will be devoted to the issue of military river boats. In the introduction of the second part of this work, we will firstly present historical sources which will help us with the study of these boats. Based on the detailed analysis of these valuable artefacts we will show the partial typological development of the boats as well as the development of Roman shipbuilding methods and techniques. In the last chapter, the interpretation of the Roman military river boats will be supplemented with the ships known only from the written and iconographical sources as well as with sea ships which could have been operated on the rivers too. The aim of the last part will be to compare sea boats with <b>river</b> boats and <b>fleets</b> stressing the importance of those operated on rivers.

25|$|There were no Civil War battles {{fought in}} Illinois, but Cairo, at the {{juncture}} of the Ohio River with the Mississippi River, {{became an important}} Union supply base, protected by Camp Defiance. Other major supply depots were located at Mound City and across the Ohio river at Fort Anderson in Paducah, Kentucky, along with sprawling facilities for the United States Navy gunboats and associated <b>river</b> <b>fleets.</b> One of which would {{take part in the}} nearby Battle of Lucas Bend.|$|R

A ship of the Ministry of the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> of the USSR was named for him. A street in Baku was named after him, and a bust was placed there. A park in Baku also bears his name and contains a statue of him.|$|E
25|$|St Chad's Well near Battle Bridge on the <b>river</b> <b>Fleet</b> in London was {{a celebrated}} {{medicinal}} well {{and had a}} new pump house built in 1832. It was destroyed by the Midland Railway company, and is remembered in the street name of St Chad's Place. There is no independent evidence of Chad's visiting the site, but it clearly is named after him, and he certainly did travel in southern England. His association with wells seems ancient, and no doubt stems from the St Chad's Well at Lichfield, visited by pilgrims and probably the water supply of his monastery. This {{is the most likely}} explanation of the name.|$|E

It appears that cars 750, 752 and 780 {{may not have}} re-entered service at the time, and their whereabouts following {{the sale of the}} rest of the fleet is unknown.|$|R
25|$|The City of London Corporation was {{responsible}} for promoting it and the location between the other two bridges was chosen because it was realised that the disused wharfage of the lower <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> from the Thames to what became Ludgate Circus would allow access into the north bank without unduly disrupting the neighbourhood; hence its name of New Bridge Street. The Fleet can be seen discharging into the Thames at its north side. By taking an access road from its southern landing to a junction with the routes created to simplify passage between those bridges to its east and west to the south it would also add to those improvements. This created the junction at St George's Circus between Westminster Bridge Road, Borough Road and the later named Blackfriars Road which crossed the largely open parish of Christchurch Surrey. The continuation to the south at the major junction at Elephant and Castle is therefore named London Road.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 24 April, Farragut's fleet made its {{historic}} run past the Mississippi River forts that defended New Orleans from the south. Because the Rebel leaders had not coordinated {{the responsibilities of the}} forts and the associated <b>river</b> <b>fleet,</b> the action was divided into two independent parts. Each ship of the attacking column was past the forts before she had to contend with the defending Confederate vessels, which therefore received the undivided attention of the Yankee gunners when they met. Under the circumstances, only one of the River Defense Fleet managed to close with the enemy: Stonewall Jackson was able to ram USS Varuna while that unfortunate gunboat was simultaneously being rammed by Governor Moore of the Louisiana navy. Varuna sank, the only Federal ship lost that night. Stonewall Jackson did not escape unscathed. Holed by shots from other Federal ships assisting Varuna and unable to reply, she was run ashore by her crew, where they abandoned her and set her afire.|$|E
500|$|The {{eastern part}} of the street was {{destroyed}} by the Great Fire of London in 1666, despite attempts to use the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> to preserve it. Fire damage reached to about Fetter Lane, and the special tribunal of the 'Fire Courts' was held at Clifford's Inn, an inn of Chancery {{at the edge of the}} extent of the fire, to arbitrate on claimants' rights. Properties were rebuilt in the same style as before the fire.|$|E

A devastating fire in 1087, detailed in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, destroyed {{much of the city}} and the cathedral. King William I (William the Conqueror) donated the stone from the destroyed Palatine Tower on the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> towards the construction of a new, Romanesque Norman cathedral, an act sometimes said to be his last before death.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{concerns}} about undermining and vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings and compensating {{the thousands of}} people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel construction began in March 1860. The line was mostly built using the [...] "cut-and-cover" [...] method from Paddington to King's Cross; east of there it continued in a [...] tunnel under Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell then followed the culverted <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> beside Farringdon Road in an open cutting to near the new meat market at Smithfield.|$|E
500|$|In the Middle Ages, {{it was a}} broad grassy {{area known}} as Smooth Field, located beyond London Wall {{stretching}} to the eastern bank of the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet.</b> Given its ease of access to grazing and water, Smithfield established itself as London's livestock market, remaining so for almost 1,000 years. Many local toponyms {{are associated with the}} livestock trade: while some street names (such as [...] "Cow Cross Street" [...] and [...] "Cock Lane") remain in use, many more (such as [...] "Chick Lane", [...] "Duck Lane", [...] "Cow Lane", [...] "Pheasant Court", [...] "Goose Alley") have disappeared from the map after the major redevelopment of the area in the Victorian era.|$|E

The Mughals also maintained various <b>river</b> <b>fleets</b> of Dhows, which transported soldiers over rivers and fought rebels. Among its admirals were Yahya Saleh, Munnawar Khan, and Muhammad Saleh Kamboh. The Mughals also protected the Siddis of Janjira. Its sailors were renowned and often voyaged to China and the East African Swahili Coast, together with some Mughal subjects carrying out private-sector trade.|$|R

500|$|Tuesday, 4 September {{was the day}} of {{greatest}} destruction. The Duke of York's command post at Temple Bar, where Strand meets Fleet Street, was supposed to stop the fire's westward advance towards the Palace of Whitehall. He hoped that the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> would form a natural firebreak, making a stand with his firemen from the Fleet Bridge {{and down to the}} Thames. However, early on Tuesday morning, the flames jumped over the Fleet and outflanked them, driven by the unabated easterly gale, forcing them to run for it. There was consternation at the palace as the fire continued implacably westward; [...] "Oh, the confusion there was then at that court!" [...] wrote Evelyn.|$|E
500|$|The area of King's Cross was {{previously}} a village known as Battle Bridge {{which was an}} ancient crossing of the <b>River</b> <b>Fleet,</b> originally known as Broad Ford, later Bradford Bridge. The river flowed along {{what is now the}} west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in 1825. The name [...] "Battle Bridge" [...] is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Celtic British Iceni tribe led by Boudica. According to folklore, King's Cross is the site of Boudica's final battle and some sources say she is buried under one of the platforms. Platforms 9 and 10 have been suggested as possible sites. Boudica's ghost is also reported to haunt passages under the station, around platforms 8–10.|$|E
500|$|Baynard's Castle {{refers to}} {{buildings}} on two neighbouring sites in London, between where Blackfriars station and St Paul's Cathedral now stand. The {{first was a}} Norman fortification constructed by Ralph Baynard and demolished by King John in 1213. The second was a medieval palace built a short distance to the southeast and destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. According to Sir Walter Besant, [...] "There was no house in [...] more interesting than this". The original castle was built {{at the point where}} the old Roman walls and <b>River</b> <b>Fleet</b> met the River Thames, just east of what is now Blackfriars station. The Norman castle stood for over a century before being demolished by King John in 1213. It appears to have been rebuilt after the barons' revolt, but the site was sold in 1276 to form the precinct of the great priory of Blackfriars.|$|E
