50|$|At 1:38 am the {{aircraft}} began its take-off roll one degree {{to the right}} of the <b>runway</b> <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> Approximately 30 seconds later {{the aircraft}} was 1050 m down the runway when the crew realized they were approaching the plowed snow on the right edge and overcorrected to the left four degrees. When the aircraft reached 255-260 km/h, 1400 m down the runway the pilot rotated the nose wheels off the ground. At a distance of 1850 m meters from the beginning of the runway, accelerating through 275 km/h, the left main landing gear entered the 60 cm deep snow, causing the aircraft to yaw left and pitch down. The left main gear then impacted a runway edge light. Instead of aborting the take-off the pilot banked right, striking the propellers of engines 3 and 4 on the runway. The aircraft then spun to the right, flipped over and burst into flames. The forward fuselage and main wing section were completely destroyed. The force of the impact tore away the tail section and it came to rest inverted separated from the burning forward section. Many of the survivors were seated in this part of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|One common {{scenario}} {{that can lead}} to an unintentional spin is a skidding uncoordinated turn toward the runway during the landing sequence. A pilot who is overshooting the turn to final approach may be tempted to apply more rudder to increase the rate of turn. The result is twofold: the nose of the airplane drops below the horizon and the bank angle increases due to rudder roll. Reacting to these unintended changes, the pilot then begins to pull the elevator control aft (thus increasing the angle of attack and load factor) while applying opposite aileron to decrease bank angle. Taken to its extreme, this can result in an uncoordinated turn with sufficient angle of attack to cause the aircraft to stall. This is called a cross-control stall, and is very dangerous if it happens at low altitude where the pilot has little time to recover. In order to avoid this scenario, pilots are taught the importance of always making coordinated turns. They may simply choose to make the final turn earlier and shallower to prevent an overshoot of the <b>runway</b> <b>center</b> <b>line</b> and provide a larger margin of safety. Certificated, light, single-engine airplanes must meet specific criteria regarding stall and spin behavior. Spins are often entered intentionally for training, flight testing, or aerobatics.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the accident, investigators were hindered by the absence of cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder information. The Beech 99 was not a large enough plane for the FAA to require their installation. There was also no record of which pilot was to have flown the aircraft. Both pilots had used the radio during the flight instead of the non-flying pilot. Examination of radar data from Portland showed that after the plane turned to course 340 to intercept the approach, it flew through the approach and had to correct to get back on course. Investigators noted that this instruction meant the flight crew had to make a 60-degree turn less than one mile from the approach outer marker. Altitude data transmitted by the aircraft transponder showed the plane did not begin its descent along the precision glide slope until it was above it after passing Lewiston. This may have caused the flight crew to rush both the descent and the approach. The actual altimeter settings on both the captain's and the first officer's altimeters could not be determined due to fire and impact damage to the instruments. The aircraft flew into trees less than one mile from the end of runway 4 and struck the ground less than 500 ft {{to the right of the}} extended <b>runway</b> <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> There were no survivors.|$|E

50|$|It may {{be helpful}} to think of a cable pattern as a set of {{serpentine}} or wave-like cables, each one meandering around its own <b>center</b> <b>line.</b> A vast variety of cable patterns can be invented by changing the number of cables, the separations of their <b>center</b> <b>lines,</b> the amplitudes of their waves (i.e., how far they wander from their <b>center</b> <b>line),</b> the shape of the waves (e.g., sinusoidal versus triangular), and the relative position of the crests and troughs of each wave (e.g., is one wave cresting as another is crossing its <b>center</b> <b>line?).</b>|$|R

40|$|Navigation {{and control}} laws for a {{possible}} automatic landing system have been investigated. The system makes use of data from an inertial table and either an airborne or ground radar to generate signals that guide the airplane to a landing. All landing maneuvers take place within a zone that extends 6000 m out from the touchdown point, 4000 m {{on each side of}} the <b>runway</b> <b>center</b> <b>line,</b> and 540 m high. The results show that the system can adequately control the airplane on steep, curved decelerating approaches to a landing that takes place with small errors from the desired landing point and desired airplane attitude. The system studied would interface well with the scanning beam microwave landing system (MLS). The use of this system with the MLS makes it possible to incorporate an independent landing monitor...|$|E
40|$|Increases in {{the volume}} of air traffic around major terminals, {{as well as the}} advent of MLS and other {{sophisticated}} ATC techniques, have prompted the development of aircraft specifically optimized for flight in terminal areas. A modified Boeing 737, developed by NASA, is presented as an illustration of a Terminal Configured Vehicle (TCV). Among the TCV systems discussed are the electronic attitude direction indicator (EADI) and the electronic horizontal situation indicator (EHSI), both of which are advanced display systems capable of positioning the <b>runway</b> <b>center</b> <b>line</b> from a variety of glide slope paths, and with reference to time, i. e., the on-board computer can predict where the aircraft will be at a given number of seconds {{from the time of the}} analysis.

Later in 1917, the same line was continued west of Crown Point. Rexford first conceived the idea of a yellow <b>center</b> <b>line</b> in early 1917 while riding on a bus from Salem, Oregon on a dark and rainy night, and advocated it as a safety measure on the Columbia River Highway, which Rexford patrolled as a traffic officer. When Multnomah County declined to fund the project, Rexford's boss, Chief Deputy Martin T.

Rexford later described the April 1917 line as the [...] "first yellow <b>center</b> <b>line</b> ever painted on pavement" [...] in the United States. An article published in The Oregonian upon Rexford's retirement claimed that a contest with a $10,000 reward was once held to determine the originator of the highway <b>center</b> <b>line,</b> but the contest was scrapped when information from Europe revealed that ancient civilizations had used white bricks to mark the <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> of their streets.|$|R
