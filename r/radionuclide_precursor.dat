40|$|We {{present the}} Laplace-transformed {{analytical}} solution (LTAS) to the one-dimensional radionuclide transport equation for an arbitrary length decay-chain through an arbitrary combination of multiply fractured and porous transport segments subject to an arbitrary time-dependent release mode {{at the entrance}} point to the series of transport segments. The LTAS may be numerically inverted to obtain the time-dependent concentration of the radionuclides of interest at an arbitrary down gradient location. For a special case, where the source function {{is defined as the}} band release with a single <b>radionuclide</b> without <b>precursors,</b> the Laplace inverse transformation could be performed analytically, yielding a closed-form analytical solution. A computer code, TTBX, has been developed by implementing the LTAS, and benchmarked against the closed-form analytical solution. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the utility of these solutions and the importance of increased fidelity in the transport pathway for reliable performance assessment for the geological disposal of spent nuclear fuels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|During this study, 6 -hydroxy-DOPA {{could not}} be {{detected}} in the produced FDOPA batches, irrespective of its specific activity. Another impurity, the so called FDOPA-quinone, could be detected, but only in FDOPA batches with lower specific activity. The identification of this impurity {{was based on the}} exact mass, as determined by UPLC-MS, in combination with the proposed fragmentation pattern for this product. The difference in the exact mass of 6 -hydroxy-DOPA and FDOPA-quinone is only 0.02  Da, but could be readily detected by UPLC-MS. Together with the observed fragments, FDOPA-quinone could be reliably identified with this method. Why FDOPA-quinone was only identified in the FDOPA-L batch is not completely clear. The major difference in both production methods are the used concentrations of <b>precursor,</b> <b>radionuclide</b> production of [18 F]F 2 and the differences in SA of FDOPA.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a nuclear}} reactor large nuclides fission into two neutron-rich fission {{products}} (i.e. unstable nuclides). Many of these fission products then undergo radioactive decay (usually beta decay) and the resulting nuclides are left in an excited state. These usually immediately undergo gamma decay but {{a small fraction of}} them are excited {{enough to be able to}} decay by emitting a neutron in addition. The moment of beta decay of the precursor nuclides - which are the precursors of the delayed neutrons - happens orders of magnitude later compared to the emission of the prompt neutrons. Hence the neutron that originates from the precursor's decay is termed a delayed neutron. However, the [...] "delay" [...] in the neutron emission is due to the delay in beta decay, since neutron emission, like gamma emission, happens almost immediately after the beta decay. The various half lives of these decays that finally result in neutron emission, are thus the beta decay half lives of the <b>precursor</b> <b>radionuclides.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{mechanisms}} by which radionuclides were passed to humans was through the ingestion of milk from contaminated cows. Most of the rough grazing that the cows took part in contained plant species such as coarse grasses, sedges, rushes, and plants such as heather (also known as calluna vulgaris). These plant species grow in soils that are high in organic matter, low in pH, and are often very well hydrated, thus making the storage and intake of these radionuclides much more feasible and efficient. In the early stages following the Chernobyl accident, high levels of radionuclides {{were found in the}} milk and were a direct result of contaminated feeding. Within two months of banning most of the milk that was being produced in the affected areas, officials had phased out the majority of the contaminated feed that was available to the cows and much of the contamination was isolated. In humans, ingestion of milk containing abnormally high levels of iodine <b>radionuclides</b> was the <b>precursor</b> for thyroid disease, especially in children and in the immunocompromised.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} the methodology developed for calculating the cascade sum correction {{to be applied}} to experimental efficiencies obtained by means of HPGe spectrometers. The detection efficiencies have been numerically calculated by the Monte Carlo Method for point sources. Another Monte Carlo algorithm has been developed to follow the path in the decay scheme from the beginning state at the <b>precursor</b> <b>radionuclide</b> decay level, down to the ground state of the daughter radionuclide. Each step in the decay scheme is selected by random numbers taking into account the transition probabilities and internal transition coefficients. The selected transitions are properly tagged according to the type of interaction has occurred, giving rise to a total or partial energy absorption events inside the detector crystal. Once the final state has been reached, the selected transitions were accounted for verifying each pair of transitions which occurred simultaneously. With this procedure it was possible to calculate the cascade summing correction for all the gamma ray transitions present in the decay scheme. Several radionuclides such as sup 6 sup 0 Co, sup 8 sup 8 Y, sup 1 sup 3 sup 3 Ba, sup 1 sup 3 sup 1 I and sup 1 sup 5 sup 2 Eu and different detection geometries were used for testing the procedure. The results were in good agreement with the literature...|$|R
