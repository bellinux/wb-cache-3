50|$|A {{scanning}} transmission {{electron microscope}} (STEM) is a type of {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM). Pronunciation is stem or esti:i:em. As with a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM), images are formed by electrons passing through a sufficiently thin specimen. However, unlike CTEM, in STEM the electron beam is focused to a fine spot which is then scanned over the sample in a raster. The <b>rastering</b> of the beam across the sample makes STEM suitable for analytical techniques such as Z-contrast annular dark-field imaging, and spectroscopic mapping by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). These signals can be obtained simultaneously, allowing direct correlation of images and spectroscopic data.|$|E

50|$|E-beam {{lithography}} is {{not suitable}} for high-volume manufacturing because of its limited throughput. The smaller field of electron beam writing makes for very slow pattern generation compared with photolithography (the current standard) because more exposure fields must be scanned to form the final pattern area (≤mm2 for electron beam vs. ≥40 mm2 for an optical mask projection scanner). The stage moves in between field scans. The electron beam field is small enough that a <b>rastering</b> or serpentine stage motion is needed to pattern a 26 mm X 33 mm area for example, whereas in a photolithography scanner only a one-dimensional motion of a 26 mm X 2 mm slit field would be required.|$|E

50|$|Scanning voltage {{microscopy}} (SVM), sometimes {{also called}} nanopotentiometry, is a scientific experimental technique based on atomic force microscopy. A conductive probe, usually {{only a few}} nanometers wide at the tip, is placed in full contact with an operational electronic or optoelectronic sample. By connecting the probe to a high-impedance voltmeter and <b>rastering</b> over the sample's surface, {{a map of the}} electric potential can be acquired. SVM is generally nondestructive to the sample although some damage may occur to the sample or the probe if the pressure required to maintain good electrical contact is too high. If the input impedance of the voltmeter is sufficiently large, the SVM probe should not perturb the operation of the operational sample.|$|E
50|$|In {{this stage}} of the {{graphics}} pipeline, the grid points are also called fragments, for the sake of greater distinctiveness. Each fragment corresponds to one pixel in the frame buffer and this corresponds to one pixel of the screen. These can be colored (and possibly illuminated). Furthermore, it is necessary to determine the visible, closer to the observer fragment, in the case of overlapping polygons. A Z-buffer is usually used for this so-called hidden surface determination. The color of a fragment depends on the illumination, texture, and other material properties of the visible primitive and is often interpolated using the triangle vertice properties. Where available, a fragment shader (also called pixel shader) is run in the <b>rastering</b> step for each fragment of the object. If a fragment is visible, it can now be mixed with already existing color values in the image if transparency or multi-sampling is used. In this step, one or more fragments become a pixel.|$|E
5000|$|The 3D {{projection}} step {{transforms the}} view volume into a cube with the corner point coordinates (-1, -1, -1) and (1, 1, 1); Occasionally other target volumes are also used. This step is called projection, {{even though it}} transforms a volume into another volume, since the resulting Z coordinates are not stored in the image, but are only used in Z-buffering in the later <b>rastering</b> step. In a perspective illustration, a central projection is used. To {{limit the number of}} displayed objects, two additional clipping planes are used; The visual volume is therefore a truncated pyramid (frustum). The parallel or orthogonal projection is used, for example, for technical representations because it has the advantage that all parallels in the object space are also parallel in the image space, and the surfaces and volumes are the same size regardless of the distance from the viewer. Maps use, for example, an orthogonal projection (so-called orthophoto), but oblique images of a landscape cannot be used in this way - although they can technically be rendered, they seem so distorted that we cannot make any use of them.The formula for calculating a perspective mapping matrix is: ...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, modern {{electron}} microscopes deliver images at atomic scale. The precise {{atomic structure}} encodes information about material properties. Thus, an important {{ingredient in the}} image analysis is to locate the centers of the atoms shown in micrographs as precisely as possible. Here, we consider {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM), which acquires data in a <b>rastering</b> pattern, pixel by pixel. Due to this <b>rastering</b> combined with the magnification to atomic scale, movements of the specimen even at the nanometer scale lead to random image distortions that make precise atom localization difficult. Given a series of STEM images, we derive a Bayesian method that jointly estimates the distortion in each image and reconstructs the underlying atomic grid of the material by fitting the atom bumps with suitable bump functions. The resulting highly non-convex minimization problems are solved numerically with a trust region approach. Well-posedness of the reconstruction method and the model behavior for faster and faster <b>rastering</b> are investigated using variational techniques.
