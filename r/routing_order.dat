The novelty of SAFARI comes from the usage of the information of user positions in CA, router selection, and routing.

This <b>routing</b> <b>order</b> selection leads to higher throughput, mainly since users in low-congested areas are usually {{at the edge of a}} network and thus routing them first leads to shorter routing paths on the average.|$|E

We evaluate to what extent reformulating and solving the problem as a classical TSP leads to performance improvements compared to existing dedicated heuristics. We report average savings in route distance of up to 47 % when using the LKH (Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun) TSP heuristic. Additionally, we examine if combining problem-specific solution concepts from dedicated heuristics with high-quality local search features could be useful.

30|$|The {{simulation}} {{results show that}} the proposed routing algorithm SAFARI outperforms CD and distance-based routing algorithms in terms of the increased network throughput and the number of admitted users. The performance gain comes mainly from the fact that users positions are taken into account instead of neglecting them, as in the CD and distance-based routing. The information of user position is exploited in the CA and in the selection of the best router to each user to attach to. The second factor that contributes to the performance gain is the <b>routing</b> <b>order.</b> By first routing the users in low CD regions (i.e., usually users far away from the gateways), shorter paths are obtained and which leads to less strict capacity constraint and fairness is easier to achieve. The CD metric is shown to be a suitable metric for WMN and its inherent capability to avoid congested areas in the network is a very useful quality. In addition, SAFARI's LP-based rate allocation leads to user rates that can be scheduled.|$|E

40|$|Batching {{orders and}} <b>routing</b> <b>order</b> pickers is a {{commonly}} studied problem in many picker-to-parts warehouses. The impact {{of individual differences}} in picking skills on performance has received little attention. In this paper, we show that taking into account differences in the skills of individual pickers when assigning work has a substantial effect on total batch execution time and picker productivity. We demonstrate this for {{the case of a}} Finnish retailer. First, using time-stamped picking data, multilevel modeling is used to forecast batch execution times for individual pickers by modeling individual skills of pickers. Next, these forecasts are used to minimize total batch execution time, by assigning the right picker to the right order batch. We formulate the problem as a joint order batching and generalized assignment model, and solve it with an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm. For the sample company, we are able to improve state-of-the-art batching and routing methods by almost 10 % taking skill differences among pickers into account and minimizing the sum of total order processing time. Compared to assigning order batches to pickers only based on individual picker productivity, savings of 6 % in total time are achieved...|$|E

One {{of the most critical}} challenges for DMFB design is the droplet routing problem, which schedules the movement of each droplet in a time-multiplexed manner. In this paper, we propose a fast routability- and performancedriven droplet router for DMFBs. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a global moving vector analysis for constructing preferred routing tracks to minimize the number of used unit cells; (2) an entropy-based equation to determine the <b>routing</b> <b>order</b> of droplets for better routability; (3) a routing compaction technique by dynamic programming to minimize the latest arrival time of droplets. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves 100 % routing completion for all test cases on three Benchmark Suites while the previous algorithms are not. In addition to routability, compared with the state-of-theart high-performance routing on the Benchmark Suite I [3], the experimental results still show that our algorithm performed better in runtime by 40 %, reduced the latest arrival time by 21 %, reduced the used unit cells by 10 %. Furthermore, experiment results on Benchmark Suite II and III are also very promising. Based on the evaluation of three Benchmark Suites, our algorithm demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of handling complex droplet routing problem over the existing algorithms. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that the {{solution}} quality of the detailed routing phase is heavily influenced by the order in which nets are routed. To alleviate this situation a number of routing strategies have been developed that ripup and reroute (R&R) previously-routed nets that “block ” the current net. In the R&R approach, there is not a significant amount of control over the solution quality (e. g., length, delay) for the ripped-up nets. In this paper we propose a detailed router ROAD (bump&Refit based OptimAl Detailed router) that explores the solution space using an approach called bump-and-refit (B&R) in which the global routes of prior-routed nets are not changed but their track assignments are systematically altered in order to make space for the current net being routed. B&R thus does not have the above drawback of R&R. We start with an initial depth-first search method for this purpose that is optimal in finding a detailed routing solution with the minimum number of tracks irrespective of the net <b>routing</b> <b>order.</b> We then develop various optimality-preserving speedup methods including search space pruning based on clique detection and learning about and remembering unsuccessful search spaces, and second-level or lookahead transition costs. The combination of these methods results in an average speedup of 604 for small to medium VPR circuits and an extrapolated speedup of more than 5763 for larger circuits. Furthermore, comparison of ROAD run times to that of VPR’s estimated detailed routing phase show that we are almost two times faster than VPR. This is noteworthy because an optimal detailed router is able to obtain solutions in reasonable times which are also faster than those of a non-optimal (though effective) router. ...|$|E

For a Swedish company this means to have less production in Asia to the favour for Europe. The forwarders transporting goods from Europe to Sweden will have a higher impact on companies turn over than before and the importance of a good partner in the forwarder is of vital interest. The company SportAlot faces many problems with their present forwarder performing the transports from Europe to Sweden. This thesis is research in a deeper understanding of how SportAlots background problems, bad communication, price reduction possibilities, lack of quality, lack of trust and bad data, will affect a coming negotiation. The research question is: How can a retail company prepare for transport negotiation? The sub-question, Which are the drivers for change in transportation at a retail company?, will partly help to answer the main question. The writer of this thesis uses the hermeneutic view when performing the empirical oriented research with an inductive approach. The research is descriptive in the presentation of the literature review and empirical part, as well as partly explanative in the analysis part where the literature and empirical findings are put together. The research is performed by gathering qualitative data through semi-structured in-depths interviews, observations and a case study at the company SportAlot. The writer of the thesis works for SportAlot and there is therefore a risk that the objectivity is biased, even if that is tried to eliminate. The research measures what it is intended to do, and if it is done once again it will most likely give the same result again. Within another context the result will not be exactly the same, but the method will provide the practitioner with the same validity and reliability in his or her result. The research is possible to generalize for companies within the retail business having the same type of cargo as well as the same transportation costs/volume from Europe to Sweden. It is hard to find literature showing how to prepare for transportation negotiation. Instead there are much more about organizational change, change management and the negotiation itself. Literature within these fields will support the thesis and set the theoretical framework within which the empirical data is gathered. The present problems found at the case company, SportAlot, is bad delivery precision, inadequate information, a lot of non-value-adding-time is spend on unnecessary things, the employees lacks trust in the forwarder, the informational lead times are long and the transports can be too expensive compared to other forwarders. The needs SportAlot has is better delivery precision, they require information, regular statistics, possibilities to track their goods and possibility to give the forwarder penalties when it does not act as agreed. The empirical part also presents statistical data from 2010 which is a base for the request for quotation sent to the forwarders. The thesis resulted in the importance of good management that supports changes and employees that are willing to improve their work. It is important for the negotiators to have knowledge about the negotiation itself so they are prepared when they come to the negotiation and can give a well informed impression to the other party. It is also important for negotiators to be well informed about other criteria which are up for discussion within transportation at the present time. Examples of that are ISO certificates, <b>routing</b> <b>order</b> and customs clearance simplifications. By using the weighted linear model the result from the literature and the answers on the request for quotation was that forwarders DSV and NH Logistics did perform well in the analysis and are recommended for SportAlot to meet for further negotiations based on the drivers for change. The drivers for change are: decrease price, improve lead times, improve delivery precision, improve communication, improve trust and set a good base for the relationship.
