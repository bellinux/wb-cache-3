6000|$|But {{if there}} be in Liverpool anybody not too angry to listen, I want to assure him or them that my exclamatory line, [...] "Was there {{no one on}} board either of these ships to think of {{dropping}} a fender--etc.," [...] was not uttered {{in the spirit of}} blame for anyone. I would not dream of blaming a seaman for doing or omitting to do anything a person sitting in a perfectly safe and unsinkable study may think of. All my sympathy goes to the two captains; much the greater share of it to Captain Kendall, who has lost his ship and whose load of responsibility was so much heavier! I may not know a great deal, but I know how anxious and perplexing are those nearly end-on approaches, so infinitely more trying to the men in charge than a frank <b>right-angle</b> <b>crossing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Salus's sign is a {{clinical}} sign in which deflection of retinal venules {{can be seen}} on fundoscopy occurring in patients with hypertensive retinopathy. Arteriosclerosis causes shortening or lengthening of arterioles, which causes venules to be moved at points where arterioles and venules cross over. This is seen at <b>right-angle</b> <b>crossing</b> points, where the venule crosses the arteriole in a horseshoe shape.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>right-angle</b> <b>crossing</b> {{style and}} the name [...] "RAC drawing" [...] for this style were both {{formulated}} by , motivated by previous user studies showing that crossings with large angles are much less harmful to the readability of drawings than shallow crossings. Even for planar graphs, allowing some right-angle crossings in a drawing of the graph can significantly improve measures of the drawing quality such as its area or angular resolution.|$|E
5000|$|Crash experience. The volumes in the eight- and four-hour {{warrants}} may {{be reduced}} if five or more <b>right-angle</b> and <b>cross</b> traffic turn collisions have happened at the intersection in a twelve-month period.|$|R
40|$|A reticle {{permits the}} {{alignment}} of three orthogonal axes (X, Y and Z) that intersect at a common target point. Thin, straight filaments are supported on a frame. The filaments are each {{contained in a}} different orthogonal plane (S sub xy, S sub xz, and S sub yz) and each filament intersects {{two of the three}} orthogonal axes. The filaments, as viewed along the frame axis, give the appearance of a triangle with a V extending from each triangle vertex. When axial alignment is achieved, the filament portions adjacent to a triangle vertex are seen (along the axis of interest) as a <b>right-angle</b> <b>cross,</b> whereas these filament portions are seen to intersect at an oblique angle when axial misalignment occurs. The reticle is open in the region near the target point leaving ample space for alignment aids such as a pentaprism or a cube mirror...|$|R
40|$|The USNO-B Catalog {{contains}} spurious entries {{that are}} caused by diffraction spikes and circular reflection halos around bright stars in the original imaging data. These spurious entries appear in the Catalog {{as if they were}} real stars; they are confusing for some scientific tasks. The spurious entries can be identified by simple computer vision techniques because they produce repeatable patterns on the sky. Some techniques employed here are variants of the Hough transform, one of which is sensitive to (two-dimensional) overdensities of faint stars in thin <b>right-angle</b> <b>cross</b> patterns centered on bright (< 13 mag) stars, and one of which is sensitive to thin annular overdensities centered on very bright (< 7 mag) stars. After enforcing conservative statistical requirements on spurious-entry identifications, we find that of the 1, 042, 618, 261 entries in the USNO-B Catalog, 24, 148, 382 (2. 3 percent) are identified as spurious by diffraction-spike criteria and 196, 133 (0. 02 percent) are identified as spurious by reflection-halo criteria. The spurious entries are often detected in more than two bands and are not overwhelmingly outliers in any photometric properties; they therefore cannot be rejected easily on other grounds, i. e., without the use of computer vision techniques. We demonstrate our method, and return to the community in electronic form a table of spurious entries in the Catalog...|$|R
40|$|In a fan-planar {{drawing of}} a graph there is no edge that crosses two other {{independent}} edges. We study 2 -layer fan-planar drawings, i. e., fan-planar drawings such that the vertices are assigned to two distinct horizontal layers and edges are straight-line segments that connect vertices of different layers. We characterize 2 -layer fan-planar drawable graphs and describe a linear-time testing and embedding algorithm for biconnected graphs. We also study the relationship between 2 -layer fan-planar graphs and 2 -layer <b>right-angle</b> <b>crossing</b> graphs...|$|E
50|$|The Colton Crossing is the {{location}} where two main rail routes serving Southern California crossed at-grade in the City of Colton. More than 110 trains used the <b>right-angle</b> at-grade rail <b>crossing</b> each day, which, until the flyover project was completed, {{had been a}} significant cause of congestion on the main lines of UP and BNSF.|$|R
