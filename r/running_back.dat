5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official.

Notable <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> known for yards from scrimmage include Roger Craig, the first National Football League (NFL) player to have 1000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season, Walter Payton, the NFL career record holder among <b>running</b> <b>backs</b> (until broken by Emmitt Smith), and Chris Johnson, the NFL single-season record holder.
