50|$|It may {{be thought}} that the wheels are kept on the tracks by the flanges. However, close {{examination}} of a typical <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> reveals that the tread is burnished but the flange is not - the flanges rarely {{make contact with the}} rail and, when they do, most of the contact is sliding. The rubbing of a flange on the track dissipates large amounts of energy, mainly as heat but also including noise and, if sustained, would lead to excessive wheel wear.|$|E

30|$|The total mileage of Chinese {{high-speed}} railway has exceeded 16, 000  km {{since the}} Beijing–Tianjin high-speed intercity railway line {{with an overall}} length of 120  km was put into operation in 2008. With the operation speed of high-speed trains arriving at 300 – 350  km/h, the operation safety of trains has become a main concern to the railway administrators and passengers. Rail corrugation and polygonalization of high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>wheels</b> are two emergent problems influencing the operation safety and comfort of trains in the Chinese high-speed railway industry. For instance, the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway line has an overall length of 1, 318  km, and was first put into operation in 2011. After 2 – 3  months’ operation, rail corrugation occurred in some track sections. Polygonalization of high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>wheels</b> was also found to be serious after the high-speed trains were used for 1 – 2  years. Rail corrugation and polygonalization of high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>wheels</b> can not only lead to a poor passenger ride comfort and a high environment noise level but also decrease the service life of some key parts such as wheelsets, bearings, and rails. Therefore, it is significant to study the rail corrugation and polygonalization of high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>wheels</b> in high-speed <b>railway</b> lines. This paper mainly concerns the problem of rail corrugation.|$|R
40|$|Considering {{monoblock}} <b>railway</b> <b>wheels</b> for freight applications, a compressional {{state is}} {{required in order to}} guarantee the structural integrity during service. Unfortunately, adverse thermo-mechanical stresses, caused by hard braking, can reverse the beneficial compressive hoop stress to a tensile one, easing the triggering of fatigue phenomena. For this reason, periodical in-service stress measurements are required. The present paper, carried out in the frame of the EMATWHEEL Italian project co-funded by Regione Lombardia and MIUR, aims to define qualitatively and quantitatively, through non-contact ultrasonic EMAT transducers, the residual stress of <b>railway</b> <b>wheels.</b> In particular, it is here derived via the acoustical birefringence effect and elaborated by a more refined approach, with respect to the usual one.

40|$|A {{computational}} model of crack path for two-dimensional p rimary crack {{situated in a}} <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> rim is designed. The <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> rim {{is placed on the}} wheel disc of <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> with interference fit. Crack behaviour is analysed in the case of rectilinear ride of a train under rolling cont act fatigue. Plank and Kuhn criterion is used to decide whether crack will either kink and follow mode I controlled (tensile mode) path, or it will propagate coplanar mode II controlled (shear mode). If mode I controlled crack growth is more probable then a direction of crack propagation is predicted using the maximum tensile stress range criterion. In this way a relationship between stress intensity factors and crack geometry is obtained. For comparison, crack behaviour in a solid <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> which is not subjected to pre-stress loading is also analysed. In the latter case the contact forces in the wheel-rail contact are considered to have i) only normal part ii) both the normal part and tangential part...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> in {{long-term}} running had experienced the wheel damage due to fatigue crack and shelling.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation of the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of the R 7 T steel are presented. The R 7 T steel is currently employed {{in the production of}} solid high-speed <b>railway</b> <b>wheels.</b> Wheel failures due to rolling contact fatigue may occur and, on some occasions, fatigue cracks nucleate in the sub-surface region under the contact area between wheel and rail. Here, the stress field is multiaxial and the loading path is non-proportional. Specimens extracted from the rim of <b>railway</b> <b>wheels</b> were subjected to combined out-of-phase alternating torsion and pulsating compressive axial loads, a non-proportional stress state which is similar to that observed under the contact area in the wheel rim. The tests results are discussed in the light of some multiaxial fatigue theories, chosen among those based on the critical plane concept and those implementing an integral approach, with the aim of selecting a fatigue criterion suitable for the sub-surface fatigue assessment of <b>railway</b> <b>wheels...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} tribological aspects and the latest type of laboratory equipment {{which is expected to}} offer particular new knowledge in the field of <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> - rail contact phenomena diagnostics. The main considerations stated in this work imply that the coefficient of adhesion is among others dependent on contact temperature, and therefore it is possible to theoretically predict the value of the coefficient of adhesion. This fact has not been considered in the theory of adhesive contact so far. The entirely credible prognosis of the studied unfavourable effects is hardly satisfactorily solvable in theory. Hence, the authors present a new testing device by which the predicted effects will be verified. At the same time, the oscillation effect on the state of surface will be observed in the attached formulas. The work also implies that the effects evaluating possible initiations and local degradations of the contact area of <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> and rail are closely bound to the tribological effects that are comprehended here as dynamic processes.

40|$|Purpose. The paper aims at {{estimation}} of resource of strength increase for <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> disk. Methodology. The material for research was carbon steel of <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> containing 0. 57 %C, 0. 65 %Si, 0. 45 %Mn, 0. 0029 %S, 0, 014 %P, 0, 11 %Cr. A <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> was heated to the temperatures above and {{was held at}} this temperature until the completion of аustenite homogenization processes and then the disk was cooled at a growing rate to a certain temperature. A temperature interval of completion of the speed-up wheel disk cooling was 200 - 450 C. Structure was studied {{with the use of}} research methods under electronic and light microscopes. After accelerated cooling the {{estimation of}} metal structure imperfection degree was carried out with the use of X-ray structural analysis method. The stress and yielding limit of carbon steel were determined at tension, at a speed of deformation. The microhardness of steel structural components was estimated using the microhardness tester of PMT- 3 type. Findings. The properties complex of <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> carbon steel depending on the temperature of the accelerated cooling termination is determined by the correlation of soften and work-hardening processes development. The effect of work-hardening is based on blocking of mobile dislocations due to a precipitation carbon atoms and dispersion work-hardening from the formed particles of carbidic phase. At the temperatures of the accelerated cooling termination of carbon steel higher than 300 - 350 C the decrease rate of strength properties is determined by the exceeding of total soften effect from disintegration of solid solution, acceleration of spheroidithation and coalescence of cementite particles above the dislocations blocking by the carbon atoms and dispersion work-hardening. Originality. Authors proved that the strength level of the <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> carbon steel from the temperature of accelerated cooling completion is determined by the influence ratio of the solid solution satiety degree and dispersion work-hardening from a carbidic phase. For the temperatures of accelerated cooling termination 200 - 300 C a decrease of solid solution satiety degree is a basic factor, which determines the level of the strength characteristic. Practical value. When making the whole-rolled <b>railway</b> <b>wheel</b> one can increase the strength limit of disk metal using the accelerated cooling to the middle interval of temperatures, which was successfully proven by authors...|$|E
