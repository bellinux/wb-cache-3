40|$|Coastal {{zones of}} the Humboldt Current Upwelling System (HCUS) are {{composed}} both of rocky and sandy beaches inhabited by macrozoobenthic communities. These show oscillating {{changes in the}} dominance of species; the abundance of the sand crab Emerita analoga is linked to phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The biogenic surfaces of these crabs serve as substrate for opportunistic colonizers. This study is the first record of an epibiosis between E. analoga and the <b>rock</b> <b>mussel</b> Semimytilus algosus, detected at a southern Peruvian sandy beach. Mussels fouled a wide size-range of adult E. analoga (7. 3 %) but they themselves belonged to small-size classes. The largest S. algosus was 17. 4 mm in length. Highest permanence of epibionts was found on larger sand crabs (maximum between 24 and 27 mm). Significantly more mussels {{were found on the}} ventral surface (39. 4 %) compared to 10 other surface areas of the sand crab. Possible benefits and disadvantages of the observed epibiosis for both the basibiont and the epibiont are discussed...|$|E

40|$|General EcologyThe {{possible}} commensal {{relationship between}} benthic algae and zebra mussels occupying the same rocky substrate was studied at Douglas Lake in Pellston, Michigan. Chlorophyll a tests {{were used to}} analyze benthic algae concentrations on three different treatments: rocks with live zebra <b>mussels,</b> <b>rocks</b> with dead zebra <b>mussels,</b> and <b>rocks</b> with no zebra mussels with expectations to find that <b>rocks</b> with zebra <b>mussels</b> have higher benthic algae concentrations than rocks with no zebra <b>mussels,</b> and <b>rocks</b> with live zebra mussels have higher benthic algae density than rocks with dead zebra mussels. The study was divided into field survey, field study and laboratory study.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} survey of exposed rocky shores on the North Cornwall coast revealed {{an association of}} the canopy forming alga Fucus vesiculosus forma evesiculosus (L.) with mussel beds. A manipulative field experiment was carried out on an exposed shore on the North Cornwall coast to investigate the effect of limpet grazing on the recruitment of macro algae on mussel beds using limpet exclusion treatments. Due to its opportunistic, fast recruiting nature, Ulva intestinalis (L.) abundance {{was used as a}} measure of recruitment, Fucus sporelings were also considered. The recruitment of U. intestinalis was significantly affected in July and August. The recruitment of Fucus sporelings was significantly affected only in August. Post hoc tests infer that the significant reductions in recruitment were due to the presence of grazers. Wax discs were placed within treatments to identify the species grazing and to quantify grazing intensity. Grazing intensity was greater on bare <b>rock</b> than on <b>mussel</b> beds, interestingly grazing was shown to be occurring on mussel beds. All grazing was by patellid limpets. No significant difference in grazing intensity between bare <b>rock</b> and <b>mussel</b> beds was seen. Destructive sampling was conducted to examine macroalgae distribution within mussel beds. Epibiotic macroalgae was found on one fifth of mussels which were the larger individuals of the population. Fucus vesiculosus f. evesiculosus recruited primarily onto the shells of mussels.

Acotyleans are major predators of sessile marine invertebrates such as all commercial bivalves species (including pearl and <b>rock</b> oysters), <b>mussels,</b> scallops and giant clams. Many acotyleans are dull in coloration, and cryptic in their behavior, hiding in crevices and under coral during the day.

Although cotylean flatworms are conspicuous predators in subtropical and tropical ecosystems, they are difficult to study. These worms are very fragile and when disturbed can break apart.

40|$|On rocky shores, {{cover of}} macroalgae is often greater growing epibiotically on mussels {{compared}} to algae growing directly attached to rock. A survey of two shores {{on the east}} coast of Ireland confirmed that mussel beds contained greater percentage algal cover and more diverse algal assemblages com-pared to those on rock. The reasons for this difference are not clear. It has been suggested that mussel beds provide a refuge for algae from grazing gastropods. Surprisingly, we found no evidence to support this. Using wax discs, gastropod grazing patterns were found to be similar within the mussel beds as on <b>rock.</b> The <b>mussel</b> beds do not appear to provide a refuge for algae from grazing activity at this scale and we suggest other possible mechanisms for the prevalence of epibiotic algal cover on mussels. Intertidal grazers may in fact affect the epibiotic algae on mussels and thereby affect indirectly the persistence of mussel beds...|$|R
