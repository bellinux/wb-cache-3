Moreover, the comparison of the fan noise and the fluid dynamic characteristics between the counter-rotating fan and a two stage <b>rotor</b> <b>fan</b> was made. It is concluded from these experimental results that the fan noise generated from symmetric support fan is lower 3 to 6 dB than that of asymmetric support fan and the fluid dynamic characteristics of the former is superior {{to that of the}} latter. The distance between two impellers is larger, the fan efficiency and the fan noise become lower.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a counter-rotating fan was conducted with {{special attention to the}} effects of the supporter shape of the electric motor and the distance between two rotors on the fluid dynamic and fan noise characteristics. A comparison of the fan noise and the fluid dynamic characteristics between the counter-rotating fan and a two-stage <b>rotor</b> <b>fan</b> was also made. As a result it was concluded that the noise generated from a symmetrically supported fan was lower by 3 to 6 dB than that from an asymmetrically supported fan, and the fluid dynamic characteristics of the former were superior to those of the latter. The larger the distance between two rotors is, the lower the fan efficiency and the fan noise are.

This included a study of profile shape, decay characteristics, effects of rotation, and effects of varying blade loading on the wake. Rotating tri-axial hot-wire probe measurements were reported which represent the first systematic data in the near wake region of the rotor wake using this technique. It is found that the radial, tangential, and axial components of mean velocities and turbulence intensities decay very rapidly near the rotor blade trailing edge, and that increased blade loading reduces the decay rates of axial and tangential mean velocity defects and radial velocities in the wake. In particular, the presence of an almost constant wake width region for increasing axial distance shows the effects of three-dimensionality on the rotor wake flow.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the techniques, equipment, and {{results from the}} optimization of a two-axis traverse actuation system used to maintain concentricity between a sting-mounted fan and a wall-mounted nacelle in the 9 x 15 (9 Foot by 15 Foot Test Section) Low Speed Wind Tunnel (LSWT) at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC). The Rotor Alone Nacelle (RAN) system, developed at GRC by the Engineering Design and Analysis Division (EDAD) and the Acoustics Branch, used nacelle-mounted lasers and an automated control system to maintain concentricity as thermal and thrust operating loads displace the fan relative to the nacelle. This effort was critical to ensuring rig/facility safety and experimental consistency of the acoustic data from a statorless, externally supported nacelle configuration. Although the tip clearances were originally predicted to be about 0. 020 in. at maximum <b>rotor</b> (<b>fan)</b> operating speed, proximity probe measurements showed that the nominal clearance was less than 0. 004 in. As a result, the system was optimized through control-loop modifications, active laser cooling, data filtering and averaging, {{and the development of}} strict operational procedures. The resultant concentricity error of RAN was reduced to +/- 0. 0031 in. in the Y-direction (horizontal) and + 0. 0035 in. /- 0. 001 3 in. in the Z-direction (vertical), as determined by error analysis and experimental results. Based on the success of this project, the RAN system will be transitioned to other wind tunnel research programs at NASA GRC...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} model turbofan {{was tested}} in the NASA Glenn 9 - by 15 -Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel (9 x 15 LSWT) to explore far field acoustic effects associated with rotor Trailing-Edge-Blowing (TEB) for a modern, 1. 294 stage pressure ratio turbofan model. The TEB <b>rotor</b> (<b>Fan</b> 9) {{was designed to be}} aerodynamically similar to the previously tested Fan 1, and used the same stator and nacelle hardware. Fan 9 was designed with trailing edge blowing slots using an external air supply directed through the rotor hub. The TEB flow was heated to approximate the average fan exit temperature at each fan test speed. Rotor root blockage inserts were used to block TEB to all but the outer 40 and 20 % span in addition to full-span blowing. A configuration with full-span TEB on alternate rotor blades was also tested. Far field acoustic data were taken at takeoff/approach conditions at 0. 10 tunnel Mach. Far-field acoustic results showed that full-span blowing near 2. 0 % of the total flow could reduce the overall sound power level by about 2 dB. This noise reduction was observed in both the rotor-stator interaction tones and for the spectral broadband noise levels. Blowing only the outer span region was not very effective for lowering noise, and actually increased the far field noise level in some instances. Full-span blowing of alternate blades at 1. 0 % of the overall flow rate (equivalent to full-span blowing of all blades at 2. 0 % flow) showed a more modest noise decrease relative to full-span blowing of all blades. Detailed hot film measurements of the TEB rotor wake at 2. 0 % flow showed that TEB was not every effective for filling in the wake defect at approach fan speed toward the tip region, but did result in overfilling the wake toward the hub. Downstream turbulence measurements supported this finding, and support the observed reduction in spectral broadband noise...|$|E
40|$|The {{cooling air}} flow in hydro power {{electric}} generators is investigated experimentally and numerically. A fully predictive numerical approach is presented and validated, {{in which the}} inlet and outlet boundaries are eliminated from the computational domain. Instead, {{a part of the}} space outside the machine is included in the computational domain, allowing for recirculation of the cooling air. The predicted flow is therefore driven solely by the rotation of the rotating parts of the generator. In this way, the predicted flow field is independent of any experimental data at the inlet, and is determined completely by the solution. Using the fully predictive approach, a number of parametric numerical studies are performed on the rotor and stator geometries. The effect of adding geometrical details to the rotor and stator are investigated, and stator baffles and <b>rotor</b> <b>fan</b> blades are concluded to increase the volume flow rate through the machine. The volume flow rate through the machine is found to vary linearly with the rotor rotational speed, while the required rotor axial power increases cubically with the rotor rotational speed. The numerical results are validated against experimental measurements in a real electric generator. Flow visualizations, and 5 -hole probe and total pressure measurements are performed. A comparison of the numerical results and the experimental data reveals a good qualitative prediction of the flow by the fully predictive numerical approach. The sensitivity of the numerical results to different choices of inlet boundary conditions is also investigated. The level of detail in the boundary conditions proves {{to play an important role}} in predicting correct flow features. A half-scale laboratory model, based on the above studied electric generator, is specifically designed and manufactured for experimental studies of the cooling air flow. The measurement accuracy in the half-scale model is significantly improved compared to that in the real generator. The model is provided with static pressure holes and optical access for flow measurements using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The fully predictive numerical approach is shown to yield quantitatively similar results as the experimental flow measurements. The numerical simulations are also performed with inlet and outlet boundary conditions, by specifying the inlet volume flow rates from the experimental measurements. The results of the fully predictive numerical approach are shown to agree better with the experimental data, than those of the simulations with inlet and outlet boundary conditions...|$|E

Using ANSYS-CFX and SolidWorks, the cross-flow fan was modeled computationally and tested at 8, 000 rpm. A parametric study determined optimum blade stagger angle using thrust, power, and thrust-to-power ratio as desired output variables. A MarkForged Mark One 3 D printer was used to print components of a carbon-fiber composite cross-flow <b>fan</b> <b>rotor.</b> These pieces were assembled and the thrust, power, and thrust-to-power ratio of the 3 D printed rotor were measured.
