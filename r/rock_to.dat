5|$|Apart {{from the}} depth and {{consistent}} nature of the alluvium, Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme dryness. The pointed shape of the cliff above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> the cave, {{and there are no}} vertical joints in the rock above.|$|E
5|$|Because of the holiness of Noble Sanctuary itself—being a {{place where}} David and Solomon had prayed—Umar {{constructed}} a small prayer house in the southern corner of its platform, taking care to avoid allowing the <b>Rock</b> <b>to</b> come between the mosque and the direction of Kaaba so that Muslims would face only Mecca when they prayed.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream {{was a major}} {{commercial}} success. The {{strong influence}} of heavy metal and progressive rock on the album helped to legitimize alternative <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> mainstream radio programmers and {{close the gap between}} alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} rock {{are found in}} the pass and its vicinity. Quartz {{monzonite}} forms many of the cliffs, while the crags are biotite gneiss. The glaciation, which dates to as recently as 12,000 years ago, smoothed much of the <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> the point of it being slippery.|$|E
5|$|Acid Tongue is {{the second}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis, {{released}} in September 2008 (see 2008 in music) through Warner Bros. and Rough Trade Records. Inspired by jam sessions, the album was recorded in January 2008 in Van Nuys, California {{with the intent of}} capturing a more live feeling than 2006's Rabbit Fur Coat. Lewis worked with a number of guest musicians and wrote the album with boyfriend Johnathan Rice. Lewis, Rice, Jason Lader, and Dave Scher produced the album. Acid Tongue features musical styles ranging from indie <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> alternative country and Americana.|$|E
5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Another feud {{created for}} Over the Edge {{involved}} Triple H and The Rock, who would {{meet each other}} in a standard singles match at the event. Triple H had interfered in one of The Rock's matches, and later threw him off the stage. The script called for The <b>Rock</b> <b>to</b> portray an injury to his arm that required him to wear a plaster cast. Shane, acting his role as co-owner of WWF and ally of Triple H, further aggrieved The Rock by forbidding him to wear the cast for Over the Edge.|$|E
5|$|As Liz is {{returning}} to studio 6H, the TGS with Tracy Jordan studio, she meets Jack. In his office, he tells her about a promotion he is planning to launch called SeinfeldVision, a month of programming starring Jerry Seinfeld made possible with footage from his sitcom, Seinfeld, being edited into programs. After hearing of Jack's plan, Jerry Seinfeld arrives at 30 <b>Rock</b> <b>to</b> confront Jack. Jack and Jerry agree to shorten the promotion to just one night.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn Mine or Wythburn Mine {{opened in}} 1839 by the gill between Whelpside and Helvellyn Screes. It was {{operated}} by a succession of different owners, driving five levels through mostly barren <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> explore three mineral veins. It finally closed in 1880 when Manchester Corporation acquired the land for the Thirlmere reservoir. Only a few hundred tons of galena {{came out of the}} mine; probably insufficient to cover its costs.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to <b>rock)</b> <b>to</b> form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E
5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, remounting guns dislodged by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the <b>Rock</b> <b>to</b> increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E

5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing <b>rock)</b> <b>to</b> breed in just a few locations.|$|E

5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the Dome of the <b>Rock</b> <b>to</b> be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The Dome of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{original}} repertoire {{consisted of}} {{rhythm and blues}} covers, but after Zappa joined the band he encouraged them to play his own original material, and the name was changed to The Mothers. The musical content of Freak Out! ranges from rhythm and blues, doo-wop and standard blues-influenced <b>rock</b> <b>to</b> orchestral arrangements and avant-garde sound collages. Although the album was initially poorly received in the United States, it was a success in Europe. It gained a cult following in America, where it continued to sell in substantial quantities until it was discontinued in the early 1970s.|$|E
