5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological <b>resilience</b> is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the <b>resilience</b> of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of <b>Resilience</b> in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego <b>resilience,</b> industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

5|$|In response, Gingrich {{stated that}} he had not quit the race for the Republican nomination, and pointed to his {{experience}} running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build a Republican majority in the house and working for decades to build a Republican majority in Georgia. Some commentators noted Gingrich's <b>resilience</b> throughout his career, in particular with regards to his presidential campaign.|$|E
25|$|The idea of 'resilience building' is debatably at {{odds with}} the concept of <b>resilience</b> as a process, since it is used to imply that it is a {{developable}} characteristic of oneself. Those who view <b>resilience</b> as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage <b>resilience.</b> Bibliotherapy, positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for <b>resilience</b> building. In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, <b>resilience.</b>|$|E
25|$|Demographic {{information}} (e.g., gender) {{and resources}} (e.g., social support) {{are also used}} to predict <b>resilience.</b> Examining people's adaptation after disaster showed women were associated with less likelihood of <b>resilience</b> than men. Also, individuals who were less involved in affinity groups and organisations showed less <b>resilience.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2013 study {{examined}} adolescents who illustrated <b>resilience</b> to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral <b>resilience</b> found among girls and higher emotional <b>resilience</b> found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being {{negatively associated with}} <b>resilience</b> to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills {{as a form of}} intervention. Emotional intelligence has been illustrated to promote <b>resilience</b> to stress and as mentioned previously, the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression. One factor that is important in <b>resilience</b> is the regulation of one’s own emotions. Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated <b>resilience</b> and has a positive correlation with positive affect.|$|E
25|$|Contrasting {{research}} {{finds that}} strategies to regulate and control emotions, {{in order to}} enhance <b>resilience,</b> allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness. While initial studies of <b>resilience</b> originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety that emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to <b>resilience</b> in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity. Patients with improved <b>resilience</b> were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans, providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological <b>resilience.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 100 cities across six continents {{are part of}} the program, as of May 2016. All 100 cities have {{developed}} individual City <b>Resilience</b> Strategies with technical support from a Chief <b>Resilience</b> Officer (CRO). The CRO ideally reports directly to the city’s chief executive and helps coordinate all the <b>resilience</b> efforts in a single city.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} regarding <b>resilience</b> is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, {{by defining}} specific psychological and affective states in certain ways, controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term <b>resilience</b> is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of <b>resilience</b> {{will lead to}} inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on <b>resilience</b> has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.|$|E
25|$|Temperamental and {{constitutional}} disposition is {{considered as a}} major factor in <b>resilience.</b> It is one of the necessary precursors of <b>resilience</b> along with warmth in family cohesion and accessibility of prosocial support systems. There are three kinds of temperamental systems that play part in <b>resilience,</b> they are the appetitive system, defensive system and attentional system.|$|E
25|$|Finally, <b>resilience</b> research, {{such as that}} by Emmy Werner, has {{demonstrated}} that many high-risk children display <b>resilience</b> and develop into normal, happy adults despite problematic developmental histories.|$|E
25|$|Fostering <b>resilience</b> in {{children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental <b>resilience,</b> as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role {{in children}}'s <b>resilience.</b> Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental <b>resilience.</b> Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster <b>resilience.</b> <b>Resilience</b> research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the <b>resilience</b> of parents.|$|E
25|$|Ecological <b>resilience</b> and the {{thresholds}} {{by which}} <b>resilience</b> is defined are closely interrelated {{in the way}} that they influence environmental policy-making, legislation and subsequently environmental management. The ability of ecosystems to recover from certain levels of environmental impact is not explicitly noted in legislation, however, because of ecosystem <b>resilience,</b> some levels of environmental impact associated with development are made permissible by environmental policy-making and ensuing legislation.|$|E
25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high <b>resilience</b> to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the <b>resilience</b> aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower <b>resilience</b> were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect of <b>resilience</b> in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E
25|$|Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize <b>resilience</b> {{discourse}} and its rising popularity in their book, Resilient Life. The authors assert that policies of <b>resilience</b> {{can put the}} onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied {{to the emergence of}} neoliberalism, climate change theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting <b>resilience</b> draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards localized, laissez-faire responses.|$|E

25|$|Psychological <b>resilience</b> {{is defined}} as an individual's ability to {{successfully}} adapt to life tasks {{in the face of}} social disadvantage or highly adverse conditions.

25|$|Closely {{linked to}} <b>resilience</b> is {{adaptive}} capacity, {{which is the}} property of an ecosystem that describes change in stability landscapes and <b>resilience.</b> Adaptive capacity in socio-ecological systems refers {{to the ability of}} humans to deal with change in their environment by observation, learning and altering their interactions.|$|E
25|$|A 56.6% of gravids {{presented}} total CESD-10 scores 10 or more indicating depressed mood.

Logistic regression analysis could not establish any risk factor for depressed mood among studied subjects; however, having an adolescent partner and a preterm delivery related to a higher risk for lower <b>resilience.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Resilience</b> {{refers to}} ecosystem's {{stability}} and capability of tolerating disturbance and restoring itself. If the disturbance is of sufficient magnitude or duration, a threshold may be reached where the ecosystem undergoes a regime shift, possibly permanently. Sustainable use of environmental {{goods and services}} requires understanding and consideration of the <b>resilience</b> of the ecosystem and its limits. However, the elements which influence ecosystem <b>resilience</b> are complicated. For example, various elements such as thewater cycle, fertility, biodiversity, plant diversity and climate, interact fiercely and affect different systems.|$|E
25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological <b>resilience</b> is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait <b>resilience.</b> This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of <b>resilience,</b> but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged <b>resilience</b> among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E

25|$|In {{military}} studies it {{has been}} found that <b>resilience</b> is also dependent on group support: unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. <b>Resilience</b> is highly correlated to peer support and group cohesion. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of psychological breakdowns than units with low cohesion and morale. High cohesion and morale enhance adaptive stress reactions.|$|E
