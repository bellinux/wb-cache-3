Two prototypes were constructed before the program was terminated.|$|E
5|$|The four-strong party which visited London, {{as well as}} {{newly elected}} Alfred Ayrton made up five members of a 13-man {{sub-committee}} which controlled club affairs.

5|$|When the DDL {{project began}} in 1966, the ships' <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> support patrol boats during anti-infiltration {{operations}} and complement the Navy's existing destroyer force. The intention {{was that the}} DDLs would be fast, simply armed and smaller than conventional destroyers. It was also hoped that a common DDL hull design {{could be used to}} produce variants optimised for different roles. The RAN and British Royal Navy (RN) held discussions in 1967 on jointly developing DDLs, but the RN withdrew from the project when the Australians insisted on arming the ships with United States-designed weapons.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise {{the influence of the}} press (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how different parts of the media would cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair– he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended {{for a role}} on The Young and the Restless instead. The <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be portrayed as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E

USASTAF's <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> command the Twentieth Air Force as well as the Eighth Air Force, which at the time was moving from Europe to Okinawa. The Eighth Air Force was led by James Doolittle (who had been promoted to general) and was being reequipped with B-29s. The Commonwealth Tiger Force, which was to include Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand heavy bomber squadrons and attack Japan from Okinawa, was also to come under the command of USASTAF when it arrived in the region during late 1945.|$|E
5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E
5|$|Following her commissioning, Australia hosted several {{official}} events. On 30 June, King George V and Edward, Prince of Wales, visited Australia to farewell the ship. During this visit, King George knighted Patey on the ship's quarterdeck—the {{first time}} a naval officer was knighted aboard a warship since Francis Drake. On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the Agents-General of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lewis Harcourt, and the High Commissioners of other British Dominions. That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks. Journalists and cinematographers were allowed aboard to report on Australia prior to her departure, and an official reporter was embarked for the voyage to Australia: his <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> promote the ship {{as a symbol of}} the bond between Australia and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|However, the court's <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> rule {{on whether}} {{publication}} was legal, not {{whether it was}} wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, the USAAF's XX Bomber Command began flying combat {{operations}} with B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers from air bases near Kharagpur in northeastern India. Although the Command's primary <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attack industrial {{targets in the}} Japanese home islands, approximately 50 percent of its missions were undertaken to support other Allied operations in the Pacific. The XXBomber Command reported to the USAAF's Twentieth Air Force, which was personally directed from Washington, D.C., by {{the commander of the}} USAAF General Henry H. Arnold, rather than the Allied theatre commanders in India and China. Major General Curtis LeMay assumed command of XXBomber Command on 29August after Arnold relieved its first commander.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, the {{authority}} of the SS expanded further when the senior SS officer in each military district also became its chief of police. Most of these SS and police leaders held the rank of SS-Gruppenführer or above, and answered directly to Himmler in all SS matters within their district. Their <b>role</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> police the population and oversee the activities of the SS men within their district. By declaring an emergency, they could bypass the district administrative offices for the SS, SD, SiPo, SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV; concentration camp guards), and Orpo, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.|$|E
