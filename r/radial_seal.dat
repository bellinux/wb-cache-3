50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators {{is that there}} is always some mixing of the fluid streams, and they can not be completely separated. There is an unavoidable carryover of a small fraction of one fluid stream into the other. In the rotary regenerator, the carryover fluid is trapped inside the <b>radial</b> <b>seal</b> and in the matrix, and in a fixed-matrix regenerator, the carryover fluid is the fluid that remains in the void volume of the matrix. This small fraction will mix with the other stream in the following half-cycle. Therefore, rotary and fixed-matrix regenerators are only used when it is acceptable for the two fluid streams to be mixed. Mixed flow is common for gas-to-gas heat and/or energy transfer applications, and less common in liquid or phase-changing fluids since fluid contamination is often prohibited with liquid flows.|$|E

In this paper the tribological characteristics of a fluid system are focused. The experimental investigations contained investigations on the physical and the tribochemical interactions within the tribological system. For analysing the physical phenomena, which are basically characterised by intermolecular forces, a drop shape analysis system was utilised {{in order to determine}} the surface energy of lubricants and the interface energy at the lubricant-solid body contact respectively.

Results of the experimental investigations were used to examine the validity of the models. Manufacturing technology offers various options of improving the tribological performance of fluid systems. Two different manufacturing processes have been presented, which offer the opportunity to supply surfaces for tribological demands.

40|$|Predictions are {{presented}} for a selected compressor using longer hole-pattern seals with L/D ratios from 0. 5 to 2. 5. Results {{were obtained for}} back-to-back and in-line compressors with the seal located at mid-span and at 82 % of rotor span respectively, considering different seal lengths, <b>radial</b> <b>seal</b> clearances, as well as constant clearance and convergent-tapered seal geometries. Predictions of the synchronous rotordynamic coefficients and leakage were estimated using a code developed by Kleynhans and Childs with zero preswirl and constant pressure ratio of 0. 5. This code does not include moment coefficients; which can affect the results. Results of all configurations show an increase of stiffness and damping coefficients with increasing seal length. In addition, {{a significant reduction in}} leakage (approximately 47 percent) as L/D increases is exhibited for constant clearance and convergent-tapered hole-pattern seals. For the back-to-back compressor, the stability analysis predicts that the system is stable for all speeds and L/D ratios. In fact, the rotor cylindrical-bending mode becomes more stable with lengthening the seals, for both constant clearance and convergent-tapered hole-pattern seals. For constant clearance seals (Case A), the synchronous response at mid-span show a critical speed at 8, 000 rpm (cylindrical-bending mode) for all L/D ratios, while a reduction of 85 percent in the peak response is exhibited as L/D increases. Case B, in which the radial clearance is increased as L/D increases to have the same leakage as case A, slightly increases the synchronous response of the model compared to case A. For convergent-tapered seals (Case C), the synchronous response at mid-span shows a higher critical speed (9, 000 rpm) for all L/D ratios, and a larger reduction (89 percent) in peak response with increasing L/D, compared to Case A. However, the magnitude of the peak response is larger for convergent-tapered seals than that for constant clearance seals, for all L/D ratios. For in-line compressor, the stability analysis predicts two critical speeds at 6, 000 (conical mode) and 18, 000 rpm (first bending mode) respectively. Both modes are predicted to be stable for all speed and L/D ratios. Synchronous response at the mid-span for Case A shows the peak response at the first critical speed is slightly reduced as L/D increases while the response at the second critical speed is increased for most of the cases. In addition, the second critical speed is reduced from 18, 000 to 13, 000 rpm, which is not a concern because it remains above the running speed. This was also the trend for convergent-tapered hole-pattern seal. In addition, the increase of radial clearance in Case B slightly increases the amplitude of vibration, compared to Case A...|$|E

By using a Non-Intrusive Uncertainty Quantification simulation based on a Sparse Arbitrary Moment Based Approach, it is possible to predict the radial distribution of uncertainty in stagnation pressure and yaw angle at the exit of the turbine blades. This work shows that the impact of gap uncertainties propagates radially from the tip towards the hub of the turbine and the complete span is affected by a variation of the rotor tip gap.

Much knowledge is available on oil lubricated seals but {{a good understanding of}} grease lubricated seals is lacking. In this thesis, first the lubrication, pumping and sealing mechanisms of oil and grease lubricated <b>radial</b> lip <b>seals</b> have been discussed. The first paper reviews the public literature. This review has shown that very little is known on grease lubrication in <b>radial</b> lip <b>seals.</b> The primary lubrication, sealing and pumping mechanisms found for oil lubricated seals are micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication between the seal and shaft roughness and tangential deformations of the seal surface for a pumping action. These mechanisms are important but it is felt that other effects have to be included for explaining differences seen in grease lubricated <b>radial</b> lip <b>seals.</b> One effect in grease lubrication is the normal stress effect which is described in the second paper. It is shown that the grease rheology and especially the normal stress effect {{play a significant role in}} film formation in grease lubricated seals. The model predicts that 50 to 60 % of the load carrying capacity can be generated by the normal stress effect for a low contact pressure bearing seal depending on the operating conditions. The oil bleed model presented in the third paper describes the release of oil from the grease. This model is based on viscous flow through the porous soap microstructure and the driving force is the pressure gradient resulting from centripetal forces. It is shown that the soap fibre distribution has to become anisotropic during oil bleed and the model has been validated with experiments at different temperatures and rotating speeds. The model can be used with good confidence for longer periods of time and can be used as input for replenishment models.
