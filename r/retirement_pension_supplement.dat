40|$|The {{programs}} providing {{income to}} the elderly in the Netherlands may be char-acterized according to {{a limited number of}} salient features. First, there is a distinct cutoff at age sixty-five. Broadly speaking, all persons age sixty-five or over are entitled to the same general old age pension (AOW, we refer to this as social security). Most other benefits (e. g., disability, unemployment, welfare) expire when someone turns age sixty-five. Second, both over and under age sixty-five, next to the entitlement programs guaranteed by law, relatively many people who stop working are entitled to other benefits, for example, occupa-tional <b>pensions</b> <b>supplementing</b> social security for persons over age sixty-five and early <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions</b> for persons under age sixty-five. Strictly speak-ing, benefits of the latter type {{are not part of the}} social security system. How-ever, these benefits provide powerful incentives to retire next to the benefits provided by social security. Until recently, studies about the incentives provided by social security to retire in the Netherlands were scarce (see sec. 7. 2 below and app. B). In fact...|$|R

40|$|This article takes {{issue with}} the {{neoliberal}} conception of justice that has informed much of <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> policy in recent decades. Drawing upon an appraisal of a spectrum of liberal philosophical perspectives, it develops an evaluative framework that specifies the appropriate normative foundations of the design of <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> systems. We contend that justice is comprised of three core principles: need, which legitimates the social minimum {{that is necessary to}} sustain an adequate standard of living for the least advantaged; desert, which provides a justification for allocating income in accordance with differentials in work participation prior to retirement; and equality, which provides a normative rationale for universal citizenship entitlements.

Despite {{the growth in}} real aggregate demand by more than 2 percent, the output response was dampened as domestic demand growth spilled primarily into a boom in consumer goods imports.
