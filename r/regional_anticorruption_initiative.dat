40|$|Following a {{political}} transition, Peru launched a police reform in 2001. This study focuses on {{internal and external}} impediments to the reform. The highly transparent and democratic process won public support and the backing of rank-and-file officers, but failed to overcome opposition from police leadership. The strength of senior police opposi-tion {{is directly related to}} financial interests threatened by <b>anticorruption</b> <b>initiatives.</b> In the external environment, government weakness and lack of presidential support present critical breaking points. Additional external weaknesses include the politically independent profile of the Interior Ministry reform team, the lack of {{a political}}ly negotiated reform plan, and the absence of international backing. Presidential support failed at a criti-cal moment when police challenged the Interior Minister. Noting the limitations of different evaluative criteria in policing reforms, the article argues that important advances have been achieved in policing in Peru even as short-term impacts are limited. The police reform launched in Peru in mid- 2001 presents an interesting case studyboth because the process itself demonstrates considerable creativity and innova...|$|R

40|$|The recently-adopted OECD {{convention}} outlawing bribery {{of foreign}} public officials is welcome {{evidence of how}} much {{progress has been made}} in the battle against corruption. The financial crisis in East Asia is an indication of how much remains to be done. Corruption is by no means a new issue but it has only recently emerged as a global issue. With the end of the Cold War, the pace and breadth of the trends toward democratization and international economic integration accelerated and expanded globally. Yet corruption could slow or even reverse these trends, potentially threatening economic development and political stability in some countries. * As the global implications of corruption have grown, so has the impetus for international action to combat it. In addition to efforts in the OECD, the Organization of American States, the World Trade Organization, and the United Nations General Assembly, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have both begun to emphasize corruption as an impediment to economic development. * This book includes a chapter by the Chairman of the OECD Working Group on Bribery discussing the evolution of the OECD convention and what is needed to make it effective. Other chapters address the causes and consequences of corruption, including the impact on investment and growth and the role of multinational corporations in discouraging bribery. The final chapter summarizes and also discusses some of the other <b>anticorruption</b> <b>initiatives</b> that either have been or should be adopted by governments, multilateral development banks, and other international organizations. ...|$|R
40|$|China is a high-corruption state. Yet, {{despite its}} {{prevalence}} and entrenchment, corruption has not undermined China’s economy, social stability {{and the political}} legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. Corruption inches in, and the Party fights back. Corruption and anti-corruption efforts have reached a stalemate. One conventional explanation of China’s ability to manage the impact of corruption is China’s “authoritarian resilience”. A neglected aspect in the authoritarian thesis {{is the degree to}} which China is learning from the international best practice based on the principles of transparency, the rule of law and public participation. In enhancing anti-corruption enforcement, the Party has done more than it is willing to admit in creating institutions that may in the long run pose serious challenges to its rule. This paper argues that anticorruption enforcement in China goes beyond relying on the authoritarian measures, such as extra-legal detention or the use of the death penalty. The fact that the Party can still hold on to its position in the battle against corruption can be better explained by the Party’s ability to learn from overseas experiences and to introduce a series of <b>anticorruption</b> <b>initiatives</b> which are rule-of-law based, transparency-centered and democracy-driven. One of the best examples of China’s extensive borrowing from international best practices is China’s active participation in the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the faithful implementation of the relevant treaty obligations. Interestingly, while China pushes back any UN-based supervisory mechanism in the broadly defined human rights areas, it has followed in good faith the recommendations of the UNCAC. While a reform initiative may be doomed if it is introduced to improve citizens’ civil and political rights, it becomes possible when introduced to enhance anticorruption enforcement. postprin...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Corruption {{has been one}} of the major {{international}} concerns of the past decade. It is an issue that affects all countries, rich and poor, in different ways and to differing degrees. Exactly how corruption affects particular societies has, however, been the subject of some discussion in the literature. The major international institutions promoting governance reforms have, for example, persistently argued that corruption has a direct negative impact upon overall economic growth levels and can depress the climate for attracting international investment; although these are far from universally-held assumptions, even in the mainstream economics literature. Amidst heightened international concern for tackling the abject poverty which continues to affect such large sections of humanity (expressed most clearly in the evolution of the millennium development goals or MDGs), perhaps the most important concern that has been expressed about corruption is that it disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized, through excluding them from access to services or reducing the funds available for direct use in social programmes. Donor-country fears over corruption in the handling of development aid monies may also act to erode the political will necessary to ensure adequate international funding of the actions needed to meet MDG targets, whilst within Southern countries perceptions of widespread corruption within political life can act decisively to depress popular support for state reforms and/or open democratic political systems. Clearly, then, corruption – its extent, nature, dynamics, causation and how it might be tackled – is an issue of fundamental importance to those working in the field of international development. One of the things noticeable on a first exploration of the literature on corruption and development is the singular lack of attention that was devoted to the issue for most of the period since the second world war and, in turn, the sudden rediscovery of the issue towards the end of the 1980 s and the explosion of international legislative initiatives, institutional formation and academic work that has occurred since then. Clearly, the end of the bipolar geopolitical world of the cold war and the onslaught of contemporary globalization appear to have presented considerable opportunities for international collaboration in placing the issue at the centre of the international stage. Nevertheless, those very same global processes also present Preliminary version – not for citation without the permission of the authors important challenges to the international community in dealing with the issue because of the difficulties involved in tracing international flows of capital, the increasing complexity of international criminal networks and non-criminal tax evasion networks and the complex and hazy lines between the private and public sectors. Since the early 1990 s large amounts of public money have been spent on the development of new legislation at national and international levels, the creation of national anti-corruption programmes and the evolution of anticorruption departments within just about every major international development institution. The impact of such measures, however, has been, at best, partial. As such, whilst the international community should continue to do what it can to raise the international profile of corruption and how it might be better combatted, we argue that it is even more important that a more detailed independent assessment of the effectiveness of existing interventions is carried out. Our position is that the first steps towards such a review of international <b>anticorruption</b> <b>initiatives</b> must involve subjecting the ways in which the issue has been constructed in the mainstream development arenas to closer scrutiny. This workshop is intended to be a first step in this direction. As such, this paper is intended to generate debate about the meaning of corruption, its complexity, how it relates to particular areas of development policy intervention and the means whereby it might be combated (if indeed this is considered feasible or even desirable). Given this, what follows is (i) deliberately provocative, (ii) deliberately broad and (iii) deliberately polemical. We thought long and hard about how best to organize this session and in the end decided to organize it around the presentation of a series of key myths which we have identified as important amongst those involved in anticorruption activities and research. Some of these myths relate to the academic community, some to a kind of general common sense amongst development practitioners and some to those involved in the implementation of anti-corruption initiatives. Here, they are organized into four broad sections dealing with (a) basic definitions, (b) states and markets, (c) actors and <b>anticorruption</b> <b>initiatives</b> and (d) economic factors...|$|R
