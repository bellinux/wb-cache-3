40|$|In China, the Lower Jingjiang Reach (LJR) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yangtze River {{could be}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{complicated}} areas in terms <b>of</b> channel migration. <b>The</b> river had undergone many channel changes in the reach since the 18 th century. Intensive human activities in recent decades, such as <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> upstream dams and revetments, had directly affected the channel migration characteristics. The revetment would significantly diminish migration, whereas the reduced sediment caused by dams would increase bank erosion and bank failure risks. Satellite imageries of Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) were employed to quantify <b>the</b> planform migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reach from 1983 to 2013 and to investigate <b>the</b> possible effect <b>of</b> human activities on the LJR channel evolution. Apart from the commonly used planform morphometric parameters, the migration direction was introduced {{to predict the future}} migration trends. Results showed that the LJR was gradually changing to a straighter channel, with sinuosity reducing from 2. 09 to 1. 9 and river length decreasing from 125. 32 km to 113. 31 km in the past 30 years. Planform morphometric parameters, such as migration rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel centerline and erosion and deposition areas and rates, also decreased drastically in the past 30 years. <b>The</b> migration rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel centerline decreased from 31. 05 m·year− 1 in 1983 – 1988 to 11. 62 m·year− 1 in 2009 – 2013. The lateral erosion and deposition areas decreased from 21. 32 and 25. 73 km 2 in 1983 – 1988 to 4. 83 and 5. 83 km 2 in 2009 – 2013. All of these findings indicate that the LJR tended to be in a steady state from 1983 to 2013 and was totally controlled by <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> revetments. However, <b>the</b> undercutting was strengthened because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restrictive effect <b>of</b> <b>revetments</b> on lateral migration in the LJR. Moreover, the channel migrated to <b>the</b> left <b>bank</b> with a visible tendency as the total migration area to <b>the</b> left <b>bank</b> was approximately two times that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>bank</b> during <b>the</b> period. Consequently, <b>the</b> left <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LJR should be <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> more attention in future migrations, and <b>bank</b> <b>revetments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>bank</b> should be kept reinforced and adjusted with <b>the</b> change <b>of</b> water and sediment conditions...|$|R

50|$|Marble {{intarsia}} (opere di commessi), called pietre dura in English for the semi-precious hardstones {{combined with}} colored marbles that are employed, is an intarsia of coloured stones inlaid in {{white or black}} marble. Early examples in Florence date from the mid fifteenth century and reached a peak of refinement and complexity in <b>revetments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medici Chapel, produced under Medici patronage in the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, which was established by Ferdinando I de’ Medici. Later complex designs and refinement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art developed in Naples circa <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th century. <b>The</b> floor <b>of</b> St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is a particularly notable example of marble intarsia. Later this form of decoration became a feature of baroque interior design, particularly so in the Sicilian Baroque designs following <b>the</b> earthquake <b>of</b> 1693.|$|R

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of inner-shelf circulation along the central Oregon coast during the 2004 upwelling season is described using a 70 -km-long array <b>of</b> moorings along <b>the</b> 15 -m isobath. Circulation at three stations located onshore of a submarine bank differed {{from that of a}} station north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> despite <b>the</b> relatively uniform wind forcing and inner-shelf bathymetry present. During upwelling-favorable winds, strong southward alongshelf flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> no alongshelf flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> and increasing southward flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> During downwelling-favorable winds, strong northward flow occurred in the inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> while weak flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These alongshelf differences in inner-shelf circulation were due to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> which isolated <b>the</b> inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> from <b>the</b> regional upwelling circulation that was evident at the northernmost station. As a result, circulation onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was driven primarily by local wind forcing, while flow north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was only partially driven by local winds. A secondary mode of variability, attributed to <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional upwelling jet due to remote forcings, contributed <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variability observed north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> With <b>the</b> time-dependent wind forcing present, acceleration was an important term in the depth-averaged alongshelf momentum equation at all stations. During upwelling, bottom stress and acceleration opposed the wind stress north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> while bottom stress was weaker onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> where <b>the</b> across-shelf momentum flux and the alongshelf pressure gradient balanced <b>the</b> residual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceleration and stresses. During downwelling, waters onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> surged northward at magnitudes much larger than that found north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These spatial variations developed as the season progressed and the regional upwelling circulation intensified, explaining known variations in growth and recruitment of nearshore invertebrate species...|$|R
