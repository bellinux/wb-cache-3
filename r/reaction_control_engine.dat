Typically, NASA has relied mostly on the use of ThermoCouples (TC) for this type of thermal monitoring due to the variability of constraints required to accurately map rapidly changing temperatures from ambient to glowing hot chamber material. Obtaining accurate real-time temperatures in the JR spectrum is made even more elusive by the changing emissivity of the chamber material as it begins to glow. The parameters evaluated prior to APS testing included: (1) remote operation of the A 40 M camera using fiber optic Firewire signal sender and receiver units; (2) operation of the camera inside a Pelco explosion proof enclosure with a germanium window; (3) remote analog signal display for real-time monitoring; (4) remote digital data acquisition of the A 40 M's sensor information using FUR's ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2. 8 software; and (5) overall reliability of the system.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{contracts}} {{have been issued}} by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to explore candidate technologies considered to be important for the Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) effort. One aspect of the NGLT effort is to explore the potential of incorporating non-toxic propellants for Reaction Control Subsystems (RCS). Contract NAS 8 - 01109 has been issued to Aerojet to develop a dual thrust <b>Reaction</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Engine</b> (RCE) that utilizes liquid oxygen and ethanol as the propellants. The dual thrust RCE incorporates a primary thrust level of 870 lbf, and a vernier thrust level of 10 - 30 lbf. Aerojet has designed and tested a workhorse LOX igniter to determine LOX/Ethanol ignition characteristics {{as part of a}} risk mitigation effort for the dual thrust RCE design. The objective of the ignition testing was to demonstrate successfid ignition from GOX to LOX, encompassing potential two-phase flow conditions. The workhorse igniter was designed to accommodate the full LOX design flowrate, as well as a reduced GOX flowrate. It was reasoned that the initial LOX flow through the igniter would flash to GOX due to the inherent heat stored in the hardware, causing a reduced oxygen flowrate because of a choked, or sonic, flow condition through the injection elements. As LOX flow continued, the inherent heat of the test hardware would be removed and the hardware would chill-in, with the injected oxygen flow transitioning from cold GOX through two-phase flow to subcooled LOX. Pressure and temperature instrumentation permitted oxygen state points to be determined, and gas-side igniter chamber thermocouples provided chamber thermal profile characteristics. The cold flow chamber pressure (P(sub c)) for each test was determined and coupled with the igniter chamber diameter (D(sub c)) to calculate the characteristic quench parameter (P(sub c) x D(sub c)), which was plotted as a function of core mixture ratio, MR(sub c). Ignition limits were determined over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, and ignition was demonstrated with oxygen inlet conditions that ranged from subcooled 173 R LOX to 480 R GQX.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{contracts}} were {{issued by the}} Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) un der {{the auspices of the}} Exploration Systems Mission Directorate to de velop and expand the maturity of candidate technologies considered to be important for future space exploration. One such technology was to determine the viability of incorporating non-toxic propellants for R eaction Control Subsystems (RCS). Contract NAS 8 - 01109 was issued to A erojet to develop a dual thrust <b>Reaction</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Engine</b> (RCE) that ut ilized liquid oxygen and ethanol as the propellants. The dual thrust RCE incorporated a primary thrust level of 870 lbf, and a vernier thru st level of 10 - 30 lbf. The preferred RCS approach for the dual thru st RCE was to utilize pressure-fed liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol pr opellants; however, previous dual thrust feasibility testing incorporated GOX/Ethanol igniters as opposed to LOX/Ethanol igniters in the de sign. GOX/Ethanol was easier to ignite, but this combination had syst em design implications of providing GOX for the igniters. A LOX/Ethan ol igniter was desired; however, extensive LOX/Ethanol ignition data over the anticipated operating range for the dual thrust RCE did not e xist. Therefore, Aerojet designed and tested a workhorse LOX igniter to determine LOX/Ethanol ignition characteristics as part of a risk m itigation effort for the dual thrust RCE design. The objective of the ignition testing was to demonstrate successful ignition from GOX to LOX, encompassing potential two-phase flow conditions anticipated being present in real mission applications. A workhorse igniter was desig ned to accommodate the full LOX design flowrate, as well as a reduced GOX flowrate. It was reasoned that the initial LOX flow through the igniter would flash to GOX due to the latent heat stored in the hardwa re, causing a reduced oxygen flowrate because of a choked, or sonic, flow condition through the injection elements. As LOX flow continued, the hardware would chill-in, with the injected oxygen flow transitioning from cold GOX through two'phase flow to subcooled LOX. The Workh orse igniter was well instrumented: Pressure and temperature instrumentation permitted oxygen state points to be determined in the igniter oxidizer manifold, and gas-side igniter chamber thermocouples provide d chamber thermal profile characteristics. The cold flow chamber pres sure (Pc) for each test was determined and coupled with the igniter chamber diameter (De) to calculate the characteristic quench parameter (Pc x Dc), which was plotted as a function of core mixture ratio, MRc. Ignition limits were determined over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, and ignition was demonstrated with oxygen inlet conditions that ranged from subcooled 210 deg R LOX to 486 deg R GOX. Once ign ited at cold GOX conditions, combustion was continuous as the hardwar e chilled in and the core mixture ratio transitioned from values near 1. 0 to over 12. 5. Pulsing is required in typical RCS engines; therefore, the workhorse igniter was pulse tested to verify the ability to pr ovide the required ignition for a pulsing RCE. The minimum electrical pulse width (EPW) of the dual thrust RCE was 0. 080 seconds. Igniter pulse tests were performed at three conditions: (1) an EPW of 0. 080 se conds at 25 % duty cycle for 400 pulses; (2) an EPW of 0. 160 seconds a nd a 5 % duty cycle for 124 pulses; (3) an EPW of 0. 160 seconds and a 50 % duty cycle for 380 pulses. Successful ignition of LOX/Ethanol was demonstrated over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, with the empirically determined LOX/Ethanol ignition limits extending the previous database established for GOX/Ethanol ignition limits. Although th e observed chill-in characteristics of the hardware varied significan tly with flowrate, ignition was readily achieved. Combustion was marg inal at extremely fuel-rich conditions, and it fluctuated as the oxygen passed rough the twophase flow regime during the period of hardware chill-in. Pulse testing showed good repeatability with 100 percent r e-ignition for all pulses. Certain pulse-to-pulse repeatability requirements for actual RCS operation may necessitate establishment of mini mum oxygen flow rates and engine thrust levels for satisfactory engin e performance...|$|E

Implementation of nontoxic propellants in high performance propulsion systems offers NASA an opportunity to consider other options than current hypergolic propellants. The PCAD Project is emphasizing technology efforts in <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> system (RCS) thruster designs, ascent main engines (AME), and descent main engines (DME). PCAD has a series of tasks and contracts to conduct risk reduction and/or retirement activities to demonstrate that nontoxic cryogenic propellants can be a feasible option for space missions. Work has focused on 1) reducing the risk of liquid oxygen/liquid methane ignition, demonstrating the key enabling technologies, and validating performance levels for <b>reaction</b> <b>control</b> <b>engines</b> for use on descent and ascent stages; 2) demonstrating the key enabling technologies and validating performance levels for liquid oxygen/liquid methane ascent engines; and 3) demonstrating the key enabling technologies and validating performance levels for deep throttling liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen descent engines. The progress of these risk reduction and/or retirement activities will be presented...|$|R
