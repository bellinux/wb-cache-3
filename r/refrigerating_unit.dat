It is concluded that periodic ice moving avoids the increased heat resistance that creates a decreased evaporating temperature.

50|$|The hot climate at Le Port led {{the team}} {{in charge of the}} INNOVAL project to prepare a cooling {{strategy}} for different seasons. During the winter, natural ventilation is sufficient to cool offices and during the mid-season between the winter and the summer, natural ventilation is completed with ceiling fans. However, during the summer, natural ventilation coupled with ceiling fans are not sufficient, consequently, air conditioning has to be used. In buildings in Reunion Island, a significant percentage of the energy consumed is due to air conditioning, therefore, the air conditioning system selected here is an efficient one with a Variable Refrigerant Flow ensuring reliability and energy savings. Moreover, a software tool automatically regulates the power of cooling in relation to office use. Finally, while in Reunion Island, people are used to cooling below 24 °C, the air conditioning of the building cannot cool below 26 °C which is adequate with ceiling fans and natural ventilation. Indeed, with the assistance of ceiling fans, the felt temperature is reduced by 5 °C allowing a final felt temperature of 21 to 22 °C. In order to optimize the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>unit</b> power, the temperature adjustment consists of applying a difference of 5 °C between the outside and the inside. For example, if the outside temperature is 34 °C, the temperature adjustment will be 29 °C. All these choices in operation have led to a decrease from 100 kW to 30 kW in the power required by the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
