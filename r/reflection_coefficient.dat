25|$|Many {{electrical}} properties of networks of components (inductors, capacitors, resistors) may be expressed using S-parameters, such as gain, return loss, voltage {{standing wave ratio}} (VSWR), <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> and amplifier stability. The term 'scattering' is more common to optical engineering than RF engineering, referring to the effect observed when a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on an obstruction or passes across dissimilar dielectric media. In the context of S-parameters, scattering refers {{to the way in}} which the traveling currents and voltages in a transmission line are affected when they meet a discontinuity caused by the insertion of a network into the transmission line. This is equivalent to the wave meeting an impedance differing from the line's characteristic impedance.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry {{can be used}} {{to model}} the (complex) {{refractive}} index of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in determining parameters of one or more thin film layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their reflection properties, not only are the predicted magnitude of the p and s polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the p and s reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used in situ to control production processes for instance.|$|E

In this scenario, since the number of range-angle-Doppler bins, in which actual targets are detected, is {{much smaller than the}} total number of radar bins, most of <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are zero, and thus, the radar signal model can be assumed sparse. We assume that complex <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> during pulse repetitions are constant.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approximate}} method to derive simple expressions for the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> of P- and SV-waves for a thin transversely isotropic layer with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI) {{embedded in a}} homogeneous VTI background. The layer thickness {{is assumed to be}} much smaller than the wavelengths of P- and SV-waves inside. The exact <b>reflection</b> and transmission <b>coefficients</b> are derived by the propagator matrix method. In the case of normal incidence, the exact <b>reflection</b> and transmission <b>coefficients</b> are expressed in terms of the impedances of vertically propagating P- and S-waves. For subcritical incidence, the approximate <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are expressed in terms of the contrast in the VTI parameters between the layer and the background. Numerical examples are designed to analyze the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> at normal and oblique incidence, and investigate the influence of transverse isotropy on the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Despite giving numerical errors, the approximate formulae are sufficiently simple to qualitatively analyze the variation of the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> with the angle of incidence...|$|R
30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{unwanted}} {{effect of the}} CMB on the PcP spectra, the spectral ratios of PcP/P were examined. Similar to the above procedure, we estimated the P wave <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> at the CMB {{as a function of}} frequency. The obtained <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> did not always coincide with theoretical values due to the uncertainty in focal mechanisms, large differences in P and PcP take-off angles, and other unknown causes. Thus, we corrected only the fluctuations in the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> around the average values in the frequency range 1 – 3  Hz. The <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> at the ICB are multiplied by the fluctuations in <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> at the CMB, which can result in either amplifying an apparently small PKiKP/PcP due to a large peak in the PcP spectrum or reducing a large PKiKP/PcP due to a small peak in the PcP.|$|R
25|$|The {{propagation}} (as well as <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient)</b> of {{the ordinary}} ray is simply described by no {{as if there were}} no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between no and ne). However it is in fact an inhomogeneous wave whose power flow (given by the Poynting vector) is not exactly {{in the direction of the}} wave vector. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of calcite as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that {{of the ordinary}} ray, which remains fixed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study {{measures}} and orthogonal polynomials with asymptotically periodic <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> It's {{known that the}} support of the orthogonality measure of such polynomials consists of several arcs. We show how the measure of orthogonality can be approximated (resp. described) by the aid of the related orthonormal polynomials if the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are additionally of bounded variation (modN). As an interesting byproduct we obtain that the orthogonality measure is (up to N points) absolutely continuous on the whole circumference, if the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> {an} are of bounded variation (modN) and satisfy limn→∞an= 0. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> remain asymptotically periodic if point measures are added on the support.

The appropriate solutions satisfy the required boundary conditions at the stress-free surface to obtain the expressions of the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> of reflected quasi-P (qP) and quasi-SV (qSV) waves in closed form for the incidence of qP and qSV waves. A particular model is chosen for numerical computation of these <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> for a certain range of the angle of incidence.

40|$|The {{measured}} {{density and}} conductivity of a 181 m ice core {{are used to}} calculate a profile of complex <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> It is confirmed that the amplitude <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> due to the conductivity variations are negligible {{in comparison to the}} amplitude <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> due to the density variations.

The modeled power return is compared with the results of a short pulse electromagnetic reflection survey near the drill site. We also convolve the profile of complex <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> with a depth invariant input wavelet to produce a synthetic radargram for the top part of the ice sheet. The phase change given to wavelets reflecting from the conductivity variations has a negligible effect on the synthetic radargram.

500|$|Many {{waveguide}} filter components work {{by introducing}} a sudden change, a discontinuity, to the transmission {{properties of the}} waveguide. [...] Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point. [...] This arises in the following way: the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction, {{the ratio of the}} two being known as the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient.</b> [...] This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the impedance that caused the reflection. [...] This impedance must be reactive, that is, it must be a capacitance or an inductance. [...] It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed—it is all either transmitted onward or reflected. [...] Examples of components with this function include irises, stubs, and posts, all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur.|$|E

[...] However, to completely characterise the <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the phase of ρ must also be found. [...] This is done on a slotted line by measuring {{the distance of the}} first minimum from the DUT. [...] Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted. [...] The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted. [...] The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum. [...] This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position.|$|E
500|$|Slotted lines {{can measure}} {{standing}} waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, {{a number of}} other parameters including <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficient</b> and electrical impedance. [...] A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. [...] This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. [...] The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. [...] This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter.|$|E

40|$|Such {{reservoir}} rocks {{as heavy}} oils {{are characterized by}} significant attenuation and, in some cases, attenuation anisotropy. Here, we discuss the influence of attenuation on PP- and PS-wave <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> for anisotropic media with the main emphasis on models with VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) symmetry. Concise analytic solutions obtained by linearizing exact plane-wave <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients</b> are verified by numerical modeling. To make a substantial contribution to <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients,</b> attenuation has to be strong, with the quality factor Q not exceeding 10. For such highly attenuative media, it is also necessary to take attenuation anisotropy into account if {{the magnitude of the}} Thomsen-style attenuation-anisotropy parameters is relatively large. Our formalism also helps to evaluate the influence of the inhomogeneity angle (the angle between the real and imaginary parts of the slowness vector) on <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients.</b> A nonzero inhomogeneity angle of the incident wave introduces additional terms into both PPand PS-wave <b>reflection</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which makes conventional AVO (amplitude-variation-with-offset) analysis inadequate for strongly attenuative media.
