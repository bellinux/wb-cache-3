5|$|Other {{than the}} main <b>rides,</b> <b>The</b> Wizarding World of Harry Potter {{is also home}} to gift shops, {{restaurants}} and other tourist attractions. Several of these are recreations of locations in the Harry Potter books while others have been created specifically for the park. A recreation of Hogsmeade is housed at Islands of Adventure while a recreation of Diagon Alley is housed at Universal Studios Florida.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ride</b> {{has been}} used in {{television}} shows and advertisements. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> was featured in a Specsavers advertisement when two elderly people <b>rode</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> after mistaking <b>the</b> train for a park bench.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPoint-of-decision prompts may be {{appropriate}} to promote walking, instead of using a mechanized mode of transport, such as a train, in airports. To our knowledge, no current studies describe the development of messages for prompts in this setting. MethodsIn-person {{interviews were conducted with}} 150 randomly selected airport travelers who <b>rode</b> <b>the</b> train to their departure gate. Travelers reported various reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train to their gate. They were asked about messages that would encourage them to walk. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted for reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for messages to encourage walking to the departure gate. ResultsTravelers reported not knowing walking was an option (23. 8 %), seeing others <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train (14. 4 %), and being afraid of getting lost (9. 2 %) as reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. Many indicated that directional signs and prompts promoting walking as exercise would encourage them to walk instead of <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. ConclusionsSome reasons for <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train in an airport may be modifiable by installing point-of-decision prompts. Providing directional signs to travelers may prompt them to walk to their gate instead of <b>riding</b> <b>the</b> train. Similar prompts may also be considered in other community settings.

50|$|At Seoul Land, {{teams had}} {{to ride a}} rollercoaster and watch out for a complex {{mathematical}} equation that was being held up on a sign as they <b>rode</b> <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> If they solved it {{by the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>ride,</b> they received their next clue. Otherwise, they had to <b>ride</b> <b>the</b> rollercoaster again.|$|R

5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E

25|$|On May 27, 2016, several {{passengers}} {{boarded the}} White Water Landing <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> operator was {{not paying attention}} and started <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> without putting <b>the</b> restraint bars down. As the raft ascended the lift hill, the onboard guests started to panic and started yelling at <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators. One of the passengers stood up, trying to get <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operator's attention. Soon after this, one of <b>the</b> <b>ride</b> operators realized what was going on, and stopped <b>the</b> <b>ride.</b> <b>The</b> same <b>ride</b> operator jumped onto the catwalk, and closed the restraints through a panel. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> went through <b>the</b> layout normally. No injuries were reported, but some guests were shaken up. <b>The</b> <b>ride</b> operated normally {{for the rest of}} the day.|$|R
5|$|Since 1 July 2010, a {{smart card}} system has {{provided}} frequent travelers with multi-ride (eight trips) or periodic tickets.

5|$|The first {{character}} {{introduced to}} the reader is a girl named Lola, who shares a college dormitory room with five other girls, including the narrator. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts {{to escape from the}} totalitarian world of school and society. She <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> buses at night and has brutish, anonymous sex with men returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first part of the book ends when Lola is found dead, hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase.|$|E
5|$|The {{makeshift}} raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> deep waves, {{while the men}} are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E

50|$|Shuswap-Revelstoke was {{a provincial}} electoral {{district}} in the Canadian province of British Columbia from 1979 to 1991. <b>The</b> <b>riding</b> was formed by merging the northern portions of <b>the</b> Revelstoke-Slocan <b>riding</b> with <b>the</b> Shuswap <b>riding.</b> <b>The</b> successor <b>riding</b> for <b>the</b> Revelstoke area is the current Columbia River-Revelstoke riding.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} morning Sissener {{suggests}} the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an urgency to live life to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E
5|$|Yankovic {{desired to}} release the song on a record label, {{although}} no label wanted to sign him at the time. Thus, Yankovic borrowed some money from Dr. Demento and pressed up one thousand copies of the four-track EP by himself. Yankovic then distributed the EP to various record stores, selling them through consignment deals. Yankovic released the record under Placebo Records, a one-off label founded by Yankovic {{for the sole purpose}} of distributing the EPs. Due to the underground success of the record, Yankovic was eventually able to secure a short-lived record deal with TK Records, who released the title song as a single. Due to the fact that only one thousand copies of the Another One <b>Rides</b> <b>the</b> Bus EP were made, today it is considered a very rare record to locate.|$|E

5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he were a man, she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E
5|$|Evan loads {{hundreds}} of animals onto the Ark {{in front of}} {{hundreds of}} spectators and live news crews, who continue to mock him. Later, Long and the policemen arrive with a wrecking ball crew to try and destroy the ark, since it violates numerous building codes in Prestige Crest. When the wrecking crew threatens to demolish the ark within three minutes, a brief rainstorm occurs, prompting some of the spectators to leave. The rain also prevents the crew from proceeding, buying Evan a little time. Evan connects Long's profiteering ethics and what God had already {{told him about the}} original form of Prestige Crest, and realizes that the dam under Long Lake had violated building codes and will likely prepare to burst. Evan warns to those present must immediately board the ark, and many have do so when the prophesied flood is triggered soon after the dam bursts. Prestige Crest is catastrophically destroyed, and the ark later <b>rides</b> <b>the</b> flood through the streets and landmarks of Washington, D.C.. The ark reaches its final destination in front of the Capitol, which disrupts the vote on the Public Land Act bill. Long becomes outraged that the flood did really happen. Evan informs Long that the flood was actually caused by his poor design of the dam, which prompts the other Congressmen also present to turn against Long.|$|E
