Not all waste can be completely removed by these processes-resulting in some residual waste loading following cleaning. Completely removing this residual waste would be prohibitively expensive; therefore, it will be stabilized by filling the tanks with grout. Acceptable residual waste loading inventories were determined using one-dimensional groundwater transport modeling to predict future human exposure based on several scenarios.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{millions}} of gallons of radioactive liquid and sludge wastes stored in underground tanks. These wastes must be retrieved, transferred to treatment facilities, and processed for disposal. Before <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> the <b>storage</b> tanks, the sludge and liquid wastes will typically be combined to create a mixture of suspended solids, generally referred to as a slurry; the slurry is then pumped from the tank to the treatment facilities by pipelines. Since the wastes are radioactive, it is critically important that the slurries are transported safely and successfully. The consequences of pipeline plugging are unacceptable from the perspectives of schedule, cost, and safety. The baseline method of ensuring that the transport properties of the slurries are correct is to sample the slurry in the tank and analyze the sample in the laboratory. This method has some problems. First, there is a delay between the time that the sample is taken and the time that the analytical results are reported. For some types of analysis, this delay could be from 24 to 48 hours. Second, although the tank is being mixed to keep tile solids in suspension during this period, {{there is no way to}} determine whether the contents of the tank are homogenous unless multiple samples are collected at various depths and locations.

40|$|RCRA Sect. 3004 (j) prohibits {{storage of}} wastes {{that have been}} {{prohibited}} from land disposal, unless that storage is {{for the purpose of}} accumulating sufficient quantities of hazardous wastes to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal. This requirement was incorporated as part of the Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) regulations. Under the LDR storage prohibition, facilities may only store restricted wastes in containers and tanks. As stated in the Third LDR rule, storage of prohibited waste is only allowed in non-land based storage units since land-based storage is a form of disposal. The EPA has recognized that generators and storers of radioactive mixed waste (RMW) may find it impossible to comply with storage prohibition in cases where no available treatment capacity exists. Additionally, under the current regulatory interpretation, there is no provision that would allow for storage of wastes for which treatment capacity and capability are not available, even where capacity is legitimately being developed. Under the LDR program, restricted wastes that are disposed of, or placed into storage before an LDR effective date, are not subject to the LDR requirements.

The combination of a treated catchment feeding runoff water to a planted area coupled with surface storage is defined as a water harvesting agrisystem. Surface storage in order to be efficient requires evaporation control and in most cases seepage control. Various methods are available for economical seepage control but the cost of the currently used evaporation control methods are high enough to preclude their use for growing conventional crops using water harvesting agrisystems. A promising solution is the use of the compartmented reservoir to reduce evaporation loss.

Fruit ripened after 5 weeks of storage did not soften {{to the same}} extent as normally ripened fruit, they lacked juice, and had a dry, mealy texture. Pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharides were solubilized from the mesocarp of the fruit using phenol:acetic acid:water (PAW) treatment to yield PAW-soluble material and cell wall material (CWM). The carbohydrate composition and relative molecular weight (Mr) of polysaccharide fractions released from the CWM by sequential treatment with cyclohexane-trans- 1, 2 -diamine tetra-acetate, 0. 05 m Na 2 CO 3, 6 m guanidinium thiocyanate, and 4 m KOH were determined. Normal ripening of nectarines resulted in solubilization of pectic polymers of high Mr from CWM during the first 2 d at ripening temperatures.

40|$|Expansins are {{cellular}} proteins {{expressed in the}} course of cell wall loosening during fruit ripening. There is no information about the relationship between expansins and ripening of chilling injury (CI) -affected banana fruit. Banana fruit were pre-treated with 0 or 1000 mu L/L propylene (functional ethylene analogue) for 16 h and then stored at 7 degrees C. Cl symptoms of untreated control fruit appeared after 4 days, while propylene pre-treated fruit showed CI symptoms after 7 days. Thus, stimulation of ripening with propylene applied prior to storage at low temperature tended to alleviate Cl. The fruit were stored for 8 days at 7 degrees C and then transferred to 22 degrees C, followed by treatment with 1000 mu L/L propylene to initiate ripening. The propylene treatment accelerated color change, increased ethylene production rate and caused a more rapid decrease in peel and pulp firmness. Two banana expansins, AY 083168 and AF 539540 (GeneBank), were chosen as the target genes MaExp 1 and MaExp 2, respectively. RNA blotting analysis showed no accumulation of either MaExp 1 or MaExp 2 transcripts in banana fruit during low temperature storage. Expansin genes were expressed more intensively in propylene pre-treated fruit than in control fruit upon <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> cold <b>storage</b> for propylene-initiated ripening. The results suggest that increased tolerance of banana fruit pre-treated with propylene to low temperature-induced chilling was related to higher post-storage ethylene production rates and enhanced expression of MaExp 1 and MaExp 2.

The aim is to suggest approaches to streamline material shipments and inventory management system enhancing interaction between warehouse and production. The study was initiated with a comprehensive survey of the internal inventory management process. This was made by observations and interviews with operators. Continued work in the study included detailed mapping of materials transport, which mainly was done through observations and interviews. The survey showed that the inventory management process was inefficient in terms of time and resources. A major part of Lundqvist’s internal transports were shown to constitute searching for materials. This resulted in the production suffering from impaired supply of materials. Inventory management process was showed to be interference sensitive and very critical for the production. The study resulted in an inventory management system and a layout solution. The inventory management system was designed for using stock cards and pick lists.

The repackaging and transportation activities were implemented by a Russian consortium which includes the Sosny Company, Tekhsnabeksport (TENEX) and Mayak Production Association. High activity of the water of the fuel storage basin posed serious risk and challenges to the fuel <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> containers and repackaging for transportation. The risk centered on personnel exposure, even above the basin water, due to the high water activity levels caused by Cs- 137 leached from fuel elements with failed cladding. A team of engineers from the U. S.

Matsum. and Nakai] plug {{seedlings}} {{were stored}} at 15 °C {{in the light}} at a photosynthetic photon flux density of 15 µmol·m(- 2) ·s(- 1) or in darkness for 6 days, to evaluate their chloroplast ultrastructure, and associated photosynthetic characteristics. Storage in the dark caused swelling, disordered granal arrangement, and starch grain disappearance in the chloroplasts. In contrast, the chloroplasts stored in the light were relatively normal. As a result, the light-stored seedlings had a significantly higher chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm, and Pn than did dark-stored seedlings. Regardless of whether the seedlings were stored in light or darkness, the Gs and Ls of the seedlings significantly decreased, while the Ci obviously increased when the Pn decreased after 6 days of storage. This result suggests that the decreased Pn is not solely a stomatal effect, as the effects on the chloroplasts contributed to this photosynthetic inhibition. Six days after transplanting, seedlings that were stored in the light or darkness for 2 or 4 days showed complete recovery of chloroplast ultrastructure, chlorophyll content, Fv/Fm, Gs and Pn. When the storage period increased to 6 days, the dark-stored seedlings had a significantly lower Fv/Fm and Pn than the light-stored and control seedlings 6 days after transplanting, which was mainly ascribed to incomplete recovery of chloroplast ultrastructure. Furthermore, the light-stored seedlings exhibited a significantly higher shoot dry weight during storage and a higher percentage dry weight increase after transplanting than the dark-stored seedlings. These effects were enhanced by prolonged storage (4 to 6 days). This study demonstrated that dim light during storage is beneficial for maintaining chloroplast ultrastructure as well as photosynthetic efficiency in watermelon seedlings, thus contributing to the rapid recovery of post-storage photosynthetic performance, which ensures the transplant quality of the seedlings after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|E

Os frutos foram colhidos em abril de 2003 e 2004. Três dias após a colheita, parte dos frutos foi tratada com 1, 0 µL. L- 1 de 1 -MCP e armazenada sob atmosfera do ar (AA) e AC com baixo etileno. O tratamento com 1 -MCP retardou o aumento da taxa de produção de etileno e reduziu a respiração após remoção de câmara fria, resultando assim no retardo da perda de firmeza da polpa e na redução do desenvolvimento de pericarpo translúcido e senescente. O tratamento com 1 -MCP não apresentou efeito significativo sobre os teores de sólidos solúveis. Frutos armazenados sob AA apresentaram alto metabolismo, resultando em baixo potencial de armazenamento, mesmo na presença do 1 -MCP. Máxima conservação da qualidade pós-colheita de kiwi 'Bruno' foi observada em frutos tratados com 1 -MCP e armazenados sob AC com baixo etileno.

40|$|Results of two {{experiments}} conducted between 1977 and 1979 on overwinter {{storage of}} seven temperate zone hardwood species commonly planted in southern Ontario indicate that temperature of storage and {{method of packaging}} can markedly affect physiological quality of planting stock. Root growth capacity and overall growth potential of cold-stored stock at 0. 5 and 5 °C were comparable with those of normal spring-lifted controls. Storage at temperatures of — 5 and — 10 °C resulted in low root growth capacity and was generally detrimental to seedling performance in comparison with spring-lifted nursery control stock that {{had been exposed to}} winter chilling out of doors. At 10 °C there was considerable root and bud growth during the storage period from November to April. Of the five packaging methods examined, seedlings totally enclosed, or seedlings with only their roots enclosed within Kraft bags with a plastic liner, with moist peat surrounding the roots, showed the least shoot water stress and generally had the highest root growth capacity. Root growth capacity of stored seedlings of Acer saccharum Marsh., Acer saccharinum L., Fraxinus americana L., Quercus rubra L., Juglans nigra L., and Betula papyrifera Marsh, was significantly correlated with shoot xylem water potential at time of <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage.</b> Shoot xylem water potential appears promising as a rapid measure of physiological quality.

40|$|O "bitter pit" é um distúrbio fisiológico pós-colheita em maçãs, ocasionado pela deficiência de Ca e agravado pela presença de elevados níveis de Mg, N e K nos frutos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a viabilidade prática da infiltração de maçãs 'Gala' com Mg, visando a avaliar, em pré-colheita, o risco de ocorrência de "bitter pit" durante o armazenamento refrigerado, bem como a identificar os atributos minerais do fruto associados à ocorrência do distúrbio. Em 50 talhões de pomares localizados no município de Fraiburgo-SC, foram coletadas amostras de 25 frutos / talhão, cerca de 20 dias antes do início da colheita comercial, sendo os mesmos infiltrados a vácuo com Mg e avaliados quanto à incidência (%) e severidade (manchas / fruto) de "bitter pit". Nos mesmos talhões, na maturação comercial, foram coletadas amostras de 120 frutos / talhão, sendo que 100 frutos foram armazenados em câmara fria convencional durante quatro meses (0 ± 0, 5 ºC e 90 - 95 % UR), e 20 frutos foram utilizados para a análise mineral (teores de Ca, Mg, K e N).

This work was carried out to assess the practical viability of 'Gala' apples infiltration with Mg, for preharvest identification of bitter pit risk during cold storage, as well as, to identify the mineral attributes associated with the occurrence of the disorder. Fruits were sampled in 50 plots of apple orchards located in Fraiburgo, SC (Southern Brazil). Samples of 25 fruits / plot were harvested about 20 days before commercial harvesting, and then vacuum infiltrated with Mg and assessed for incidence (%) and severity (pits / fruit) of bitter pit. Samples of 120 fruits were harvested in the same plots, at the commercial maturity. One hundred fruits were stored in conventional cold storage for four months (0 ± 0. 5 ºC and 90 - 95 % RH) and 20 fruits were analyzed for mineral content (Ca, Mg, K, and N).

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate changes in the physiological properties including firmness, stiffness, weight, background colour, ethylene production and respiration of ‘Cripps Pink’ apple stored under different temperature and atmosphere conditions,. This research also seeks to establish mathematical models for the prediction of changes in firmness and stiffness of the apple during normal atmosphere (NA) storage. Experiments were conducted to determine the quality changes in ‘Cripps Pink’ apple under three sets of storage conditions. The first set of storage conditions consisted of NA storage at 0 oC, 2. 5 oC, 5 oC, 10 oC, 20 oC and 30 oC. In the second set of conditions the apples were placed in NA cold storage at 0 oC for 61 days, followed by NA storage at the aforementioned six temperatures. The third set of conditions consisted of controlled atmosphere (CA) (2 kPa O 2 : 1 kPa CO 2) at 0 oC storage for 102 days followed by NA storage at the six temperatures mentioned previously. The firmness, stiffness, weight loss, skin colour, ethylene and carbon dioxide production of the apples were monitored at specific time intervals during storage. Firmness was measured using a HortPlus Quick Measure Penetrometer (HortPlus Ltd, Hawke Bat, New Zealand); stiffness was measured using a commercial acoustic firmness sensor-AFS (AWETA, Nootdorp, The Netherlands). Experimental data analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism 4. 03, 2005 software package. The Least-Squares method and iterative non-linear regression were used to model and simulate changes in firmness and stiffness in GraphPad Prism 4. 03, 2005 and DataFit 8. 1, 2005 softwares. The experimental results indicated that the firmness and stiffness of ‘Cripps Pink’ apple stored in NA decreased with increases in temperature and time. Under NA, the softening pattern was tri-phasic for apples stored at 0 oC, 2. 5 oC and 5 oC for firmness, and at 0 oC and 2. 5 oC for stiffness. However, there were only two softening phases for apples stored at higher temperatures. NA at 0 oC, 2. 5 oC and 5 oC improved skin background colour and extended the storage ability of apples compared to higher temperatures. CA during the first stage of storage better maintained the firmness and stiffness of the apples. However, it reduced subsequent ethylene and carbon dioxide (CO 2) production after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage.</b> Steep increases in ethylene and CO 2 production coincided with rapid softening in the fruit flesh and yellowing of the skin background colour, under NA conditions. The exponential decay model was the best model for predicting changes in the firmness, stiffness and keeping quality of the apples. The exponential decay model satisfied the biochemical theory of softening in the apple, and had the highest fitness to the experimental data collected over the wide range of temperatures. The softening rate increased exponentially with storage temperature complying with the Arrhenius equation. Therefore a combination of the exponential decay model with the Arrhenius equation was found to best characterise the softening process and to predict changes in the firmness and stiffness of apples stored at different temperatures in NA conditions...|$|E
40|$|Fraser fir (Abies fraseri [Pursh] Poir.) is a {{coniferous}} tree {{native to the}} southern Appalachian Mountains in the United States. Due to its restricted native range in a high-elevation habitat and long reproductive process, the forces of anthropogenic global climate change and invasive pests have made this species vulnerable to extinction (Conifer Specialist Group 1998). Research on ways to propagate mass numbers of conifers like the Fraser fir and restore forest productivity includes clonal propagation through somatic embryogenesis. Such research is critical to help ensure the survival of this species for both environmental and economic reasons. Fraser fir {{is the most popular}} Christmas tree in the United States and the primary Christmas tree species grown in North Carolina, where Christmas tree sales alone brought in a revenue of over $ 75 million dollars in 2011 (NCDA 2012). To explore potential methods of increasing embryogenic tissue initiation and growth, embryogenic tissue initiation and capture media were supplemented with the redox chemical sodium thiosulfate (158. 09 mg/L) and were compared to control media. Although the redox medium yielded a higher average percent initiation (29. 3 % versus 26. 9 %), the results were not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). To assess the effects of toxic carbohydrate hydrolysis products in autoclaved media, growth of embryogenic tissue was recorded for capture media with autoclaved sucrose and compared to the growth of tissue on media with filter-sterilized sucrose. The non-significant results suggest that filter-sterilization of sucrose is not necessary and does not inhibit embryonic tissue proliferation. High-mass initiations were selected for cryopreservation and were analyzed for new growth after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> cryogenic <b>storage.</b> Ongoing research includes production of somatic embryos from designated high-yielding cultures removed from cryostorage, propagation of those cultures on maturation media, and germination of normal somatic embryos on germination media to effectively create highly efficient protocols for the somatic embryogenesis of Fraser fir.

Schott var. esculenta) following harvest {{was carried out in}} Samoa in 2001 in response to rotting and weight loss problems. The study investigated the possibility that storage of corms at 5 oC causes chilling damage, thus enhancing corm rot, and to confirm the beneficial effects of sodium hypochlorite as a rot control dip. 320 freshly harvested 8 months old mature corms were randomly divided into two groups. One group was dipped in a 0. 1 % solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and the other in water, for 2 minutes and packed into perforated plastic bags so that each contained 40 corms. The bags were then randomly selected into 4 groups so that each dip treatment was represented in every group. The four groups were cool stored for 2 weeks at temperatures of 5 oC, 10 oC, 15 oC and ambient. (25 oC) respectively. After 2 weeks, the bags were removed from the coolers, stored at ambient and sampled every 7 days for weight and corm loss. Results showed that over the two weeks of on shelf display following <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> cool <b>storage,</b> corms that were stored at 5 oC sustained the least corm rot at 15. 8 %, followed by 10 oC at 16. 5 % with the highest at 50. 5 % for 15 oC. These results show that chilling damage did not occur at the storage temperature of 5 oC and that the best temperature range to store taro corms in order to minimise corm rot when removed to ambient for on-shelf display is 5 to 10 oC. Dipping in a 0. 1 % solution of sodium hypochlorite significantly reduced corm rot from 34. 2 % to 26. 0 % and weight loss from 4. 0 % to 3. 7 %. However the chemical dip had no significant effect on the number or weight of rootlets that sprouted from the stored corms...|$|R
