40|$|The {{range of}} {{applications}} of epithermal neutron scattering experiments has been recently extended {{by the development}} of the <b>Resonance</b> <b>Detector.</b> In a <b>Resonance</b> <b>Detector,</b> resonant neutron absorption in an analyzer foil results in prompt emission of X- and grays which are detected by a photon counter. Several combinations of analyzer foils and photon detectors have been studied and tested over the years and best results have been obtained with the combination of a natural uranium and (i) Cadmium–Zinc–Telluride (CZT) semiconductor, (ii) Yttrium–Aluminum–Perovskite (YAP) scintillators. Here we compare the performance of the CZT semiconductor and YAP scintillator as <b>Resonance</b> <b>Detector</b> units. Two <b>Resonance</b> <b>Detector</b> prototypes made of natural uranium foil viewed by CZT and YAP were tested on the VESUVIO spectrometer at the ISIS spallation neutron source. The results show that both YAP and CZT can be used to detect epithermal neutrons in the energy range from 1 up to 66 eV. It was found that the signal-to-background ratio of the measurement can significantly be improved by raising the lower level discrimination threshold on the g energy to about 600 keV.

Different choices of converter foils and gamma spectrometers are being compared {{as part of an}} optimization and selection process within the TECHNI project. This paper reports on the design of a silicon detector system and some preliminary tests on the VESUVIO spectrometer. The detector has a good efficiency in the X-ray energy range, where two intense photon peaks (at 12 and 48 keV) are expected to be emitted following neutron capture in a uranium converter foil. The detector energy resolution has been improved by nitrogen vapor cooling of the silicon chip and by careful design of the preamplifier electronics. Neutron time of flight spectra have been measured on VESUVIO when the converter foil is placed in the neutron beam. In that case, the detector response is dominated by a continuum due to Compton detection of gammas of higher energy.

This yields a photodetector with a strongly resonant, narrowband photocurrent response in the infrared, limited at low frequencies by the Schottky barrier, not the bandgap of silicon. Here we report a grating-based hot electron device with significantly larger photocurrent responsivity than previously reported antenna-based geometries. The grating geometry also enables more than three times narrower spectral response than observed for nanoantenna-based devices.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate superconducting {{coplanar waveguide}} resonators in external magnetic fields and present two strategies to reduce field-induced dissipation channels and resonance frequency shifts. One of our approaches is to {{significantly reduce the}} superconducting ground-plane areas, which leads to reduced magnetic field-focussing and thus to lower effective magnetic fields inside the waveguide cavity. By this measure, the field-induced losses can be reduced {{by more than one}} order of magnitude in mT out-of-plane magnetic fields. When these resonators are additionally coupled inductively instead of capacitively to the microwave feedlines, an intrinsic closed superconducting loop is effectively shielding the heart of the resonator from magnetic fields by means of flux conservation. In total, we achieve a reduction of the field-induced resonance frequency shift by up to two orders of magnitude. We combine systematic parameter variations on the experimental side with numerical magnetic field calculations to explain the effects of our approaches and to support our conclusions.

The response of the YAP detector to the radiative capture g emission from the uranium analyser foil has been characterized with a biparametric measurement of a reference Pb sample, which allowed simultaneous measurements of both neutron time-offlight and gamma pulse height (energy) spectra. The analysis of the gamma pulse height and neutron time-of-flight spectra permitted to identify the signal and background components.
