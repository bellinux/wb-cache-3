40|$|This {{report is}} about the design of an audio {{amplifier}} which is stable for all passive loads. If stability analysis of an opamp is done, the ‘classical’ approach is to derive its transfer function. Investigation of the open loop gain and a phase/gain margin determine {{the stability of the}} opamp. Designing an opamp which is stable for all passive loads, would result in deriving all transfer functions for all different loads. This is a never ending story. Therefore a new way of testing the stability of an opamp is investigated in this report. A research paper [10] showed that by adding an extra zero and pole to the output impedance of an amplifier, the phase shift can be adjusted. The idea is raised that if one will place enough zeros and poles in the output impedance, the complete phase shift can be controlled. This idea is the basis for this report. Basic equations are tried to be found in order to design such a stable amplifier. The theory is tested with the aid of simulations with ideal components.

The former unit is the usual one {{in the literature on}} comparable nanotransistors (see Refs. [2 – 9]) and with this correction the order of magnitude of the drain current per width agrees with that of the comparable transistors. It is found that the theoretical results are larger than the experimental ones by about a factor of ten. Such a failure has to be expected given the simplicity of our model. First, for an improvement it is necessary to proceed from potentials resulting in a self-consistent calculation. Second, our representation of the transistor by an effectively one-dimensional system probably underestimates the backscattering caused by the relatively abrupt transition between contacts and electron channel. Third, the drain current in a <b>real</b> <b>transistor</b> is reduced by impurity interaction, in particular, by inelastic scattering. As a final remark we note that in transistors with a gate length in the micrometer scale short-channel effects may occur which are structurally similar to the ones discussed in this article (see Sect. 8.4 of [10]). Therefore, a quantitatively more reliable quantum calculation would be desirable allowing to distinguish between the short-channel effects on micrometer scale and quantum short-channel effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{harmonic}} distortion introduced by MOS transistors is a property of major importance regarding their analog applications. In recent papers we presented a new integral function method (IFM) to calculate total {{harmonic distortion}} (THD) and the third harmonic component (HD 3) of MOSFET based on the direct analysis of the non-linearity of the DC IDS-VDS characteristic of the device for a fixed gate voltage. To evaluate this non-linearity, we defined an integral function, which will be called D hereafter, to calculate an integral equation of the IDS-VDS characteristic, {{and in order to}} eliminate the even harmonics, a second function, which we call D 3 was also defined. In this paper we generalize the IFM to analyze the case where several MOSFET pairs (balanced 2 -MOSFET and double balanced 4 -MOSFET structures) are used in order to eliminate the even harmonics. <b>Real</b> <b>transistors</b> always show some mismatch in their parameters that become apparent even in these balanced circuits.

In many real situations, however, and specifically in organic devices, the injection of charge carriers from metals into semiconductors {{can be an}} inefficient process that is non-Ohmic. This has an adverse impact {{on the performance of}} thin film transistors and makes the analysis of electrical measurements a complex task because contact effects need to be disentangled from transistor properties. This paper deals with the effects of non-Ohmic contacts on the modeling of organic transistors and gives specific rules on how to extract the <b>real</b> <b>transistor</b> parameters (mobility, threshold voltage, and contact resistances) using only electrical measurements. The method consists of a differential analysis of the transfer characteristic curves (current versus gate voltage) and exploits the different functional dependences of current on gate voltage which is induced by the presence of contact resistances. This paper fully covers the situations from constant carrier mobility to power law gate-voltage-dependent mobility, from constant contact resistance to gate-voltage-dependent contact resistance, and in the linear and in the saturation regime of the operation of the transistor. It also gives important criteria for the validation of the extracted parameters to assess whether the conditions for the application of the method are fulfilled.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{different}} driver topologies for RF Doherty {{power amplifiers}} (DPAs). The investigation {{is based on}} the simulation of four different driver configurations in Matlab and Advanced Design Systems (ADS) tools. The topologies of the two-stage PA are as follows: (1) cascaded class-AB and a DPA, (2) two-stage cascaded DPAs, (3) DPA with embedded class-ABs and (4) DPA with embedded Dohertys as drivers. Using ideal transistor models, the analysis of the different two-stage power amplifier topologies have been compared through Matlab simulations. The results show that the two-stage cascaded DPA provide the best performance since its efficiency in back-off is higher than the other topologies. To verify the Matlab simulations, the different topologies have been designed and simulated in ADS using <b>real</b> <b>transistor</b> models. The driver and final-stage designed based on 10 W (CGH 40010 F) and 45 W (CGH 40045 F) GaN-HEMT transistors from Cree devices respectively. The required fundamental source and load impedances are obtained from the source- and load-pull simulations. Moreover, the second and third harmonic terminations have been simulated and tuned {{in order to get the}} highest possible Power- Added Efficiency (PAE). These amplifiers have made the basis to simulate the four different two-stage power amplifier efficiencies. The ADS simulation results are in good agreement with the Matlab simulations and confirm that the two-stage cascaded DPAs outperforms the other topologies in term of efficiency. All four different topologies have been designed in band-I (2. 11 - 2. 17 GHz). The two-stage cascaded Doherty PA exhibits the highest PAE. It consists of the Doherty driver-stage that exhibits a peak output power of 42 dBm, a power gain of 13 dB, a PAE of 60 % at 6 dB back-off and 74 % at peak output power. The Doherty-final-stage has 58 % PAE at 6 -dB back-off and a peak PAE of 73 %. Its power gain and peak output power are 12 dB and 50 dBm, respectively. The simulation results of the two-stage-cascaded DPA provides 26 dB power gain at 50 dBm peak output power, a PAE of 58 % at 6 -dB back-off and 73 % PAE. The desired topology (2) exhibits 3 % and 5 % more PAE comparing to the topology (1) and (3) at 6 -dB output back-off respectively. In addition it has about 3 % more PAE comparing to the topology (4) at the peak output power. Regarding to the total gain, topology (1) has the highest gain. However, topology (4) has a very flat gain of 30. 5 - 31. 5 dB over Pout = 34 - 49. 5 dBm which can result in a more linear behavior. The obtained results demonstrate the importance of the driver topology on total efficiency of the two-stage power amplifiers when signals with large PAPR are used...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Electric and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. There is {{increasing}} use of commercial components in space technology {{and it is important}} to recognize that the space radiation environment poses the risk of permanent malfunction due to radiation. Therefore, the integrated circuits used for spacecraft electronics must be resistant to radiation. The effect of using the MOSFET device in a radiation environment is that the gate oxide becomes ionized by the dose it absorbs due to the radiation induced trapped charges in the gate-oxide. The trapped charges in the gate-oxide generate additional space charge fields at the oxide-substrate interface. After a sufficient dose, a large positive charge builds up, having the same effect as if a positive voltage was applied to the gate terminal. Therefore, the transistor source to drain current can no longer be controlled by the gate terminal and the device remains on permanently resulting in device failure. There are four processes involved in the radiation response of MOS devices. First, the ionizing radiation acts with the gate oxide layer to produce electron-hole pairs. Some fraction of the electron-hole pairs recombine depending on the type of incident particle and the applied gate to substrate voltage, i. e. the electric field. The mobility of the electron is orders of magnitude larger than that of the holes in the gate oxide, and is swept away very quickly in the direction of the gate terminal. The time for the electrons to be swept away is on the order of 1 ps. The holes that escape recombination remain near their point of origin. The number of these surviving holes determines the initial response of the device after a short pulse of radiation. The cause of the first process, i. e. the presence of the electric field, is the main motivation for design method described in this dissertation. The second process is the slow transport of holes toward the oxide-silicon interface due to the presence of the electric field. When the holes reach the interface, process 3, they become captured in long term trapping sites and this is the main cause of the permanent threshold voltage shift in MOS devices. The fourth process is the buildup of interface states in the substrate near the interface The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of the novel Switched Modular Redundancy (SMR) method for mitigating the effects of space radiation on satellite electronics. The overall idea of the SMR method is as follows: A charged particle is accelerated in the presence of an electric field. However, in a solid, electrons will move around randomly in the absence of an applied electric field. Therefore if one averages the movement over time there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction. On applying an electric field charge carriers will on average move in a direction aligned with the electric field, with positive charge carriers such as holes moving in the direction of field, and negative charge carriers moving in the opposite direction. As is the case with process one and two above. It is proposed in this dissertation that if we apply the flatband voltage (normaly a zero bias for the ideal NMOS transistor) to the gate terminal of a MOS transistor in the presence of ionizing radiation, i. e. no electric field across the gate oxide, both the free electrons and holes will on average remain near their point of origin, and therefore have a greater probability of recombination. Thus, the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices will be less severe for the gate terminal in an unbiased condition. The flatband conditions for the <b>real</b> MOS <b>transistor</b> is discussed in appendix E. It was further proposed that by adding redundancy and applying a resting policy, one can significantly prolong the useful life of MOS components in space. The fact that the rate of the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices is dependant on the bias voltage applied to the gate terminal is a very important phenomenon that can be exploited, since we have direct control and access to the voltage applied to the gate terminal. If for example, two identical gates were under the influence of radiation and the gate voltage is alternated between the two, then the two gates should be able to withstand more total dose radiation than using only one gate. This redundancy could be used in a circuit to mitigate for total ionizing dose. The SMR methodology would be to duplicate each gate in a circuit, then selectively only activating one gate at a time allowing the other to anneal during its off cycle. The SMR algorithm was code in the “C” language. In the proposed design methodology, the design engineer need not be concerned about radiation effects when describing the hardware implementation in a hardware description language. Instead, the design engineer makes use of conventional design techniques. When the design is complete, it is synthesized to obtain the gate level netlist in edif format. The edif netlist is converted to structural VHDL code during synthesis. The structural VHDL netlist is fed into the SMR “C” algorithm to obtain the identical redundant circuit components. The resultant file is also a structural VHDL netlist. The generated VHDL netlist or SMR circuit can then be mapped to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Spacecraft electronic designers increasingly demand high performance microprocessors and FPGAs, because of their high performance and flexibility. Because FPGAs are reprogrammable, they offer the additional benefits of allowing on-orbit design changes. Data can be sent after launch to correct errors or to improve system performance. System including FPGAs covers a wide range of space applications, and consequently, they are the object of this study in order to implement and test the SMR algorithm. We apply the principles of reconfigurable computing to implement the Switched Modular Redundancy Algorithm in order to mitigate for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects in FPGA’s. It is shown by means of experimentation that this new design technique provides greatly improved TID tolerance for FPGAs. This study was necessary in order to make the cost of satellite manufacturing as low as possible by making use of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. However, these COTS components are very susceptible to the hazards of the space environment. One could also make use of Radiation Hard components for the purpose of satellite manufacturing, however, this will defeat the purpose of making the satellite manufacturing cost as low as possible as the cost of the radiation hard electronic components are significantly higher than their commercial counterparts. Added to this is the undesirable fact that the radiation hard components are a few generations behind as far as speed and performance is concerned, thus providing even greater motivation for making use of Commercial components. Radiation hardened components are obtained by making use of special processing methods in order to improve the components radiation tolerance. Modifying the process steps is one of the three ways to improve the radiation tolerance of an integrated circuit. The two other possibilities are to use special layout techniques or special circuit and system architectures. Another method, in which to make Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) circuits tolerant to ionizing radiation is to distribute the workload among redundant modules (called Switched Modular Redundancy above) in the circuit. This new method will be described in detail in this thesis...|$|R
