40|$|Abstract: Great Lakes divers pride {{themselves}} in being hardy, tough, and robust {{in order to}} dive under innately challenging environmental conditions, suggests qualitative focus group data collected from New York SCUBA divers. Since Great Lakes participants tend to dive in both fresh and saltwater, dive three or four seasons a year, belong to dive clubs, and subscribe to dive magazines more often than other divers, {{it was hypothesized that}} these segments of divers would report lower degrees of constraints. In 1999, a total of 869 New York State divers <b>returned</b> <b>mail</b> surveys (37 % response rate). Divers with Great Lakes experience did report significantly lower constraint levels for 7 of 11 factors than divers who had not used these lakes. All other hypothesized relationships were also supported; divers using both fresh and saltwater tended to experience constraints to a lower degree (differing significantly on 6 factors), as did year-round divers (10 factors), dive club members (6 factors), and magazine subscribers (7 factors), with one exception: magazine subscribers experienced higher degrees of constraint for conflict with other users. These results suggest that Great Lakes divers are able to negotiate perceived constraints more successfully than other types of divers, supporting the notion that they are a hardier and more robust “breed. ” In addition, dive clubs and magazines also seem to be associated with lower levels of constraint, suggesting their socializing, supportive, and educational influence on divers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} locate those sampled has {{important}} implications for response rates and thus the success of survey research. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine predictors of locating women requiring tracing using publicly available methods (primarily Internet searches), and to determine the additional benefit of vital statistics linkages. Methods Random samples of women aged 65 – 89 years residing in two regions of Ontario, Canada were selected from a list of those who completed a questionnaire between 1995 and 1997 (n = 1, 500). A random sample of 507 of these women had been searched on the Internet as part of a feasibility pilot in 2001. All 1, 500 women sampled were mailed a newsletter and information letter prior to recruitment by telephone in 2003 and 2004. Those with <b>returned</b> <b>mail</b> or incorrect telephone number(s) required tracing. Predictors of locating women were examined using logistic regression. Results Tracing was required for 372 (25 %) of the women sampled, and of these, 181 (49 %) were located. Predictors of locating women were: younger age, residing in less densely populated areas, having had a web-search completed in 2001, and listed name identified on the Internet prior to recruitment in 2003. Although vital statistics linkages to death records subsequently identified 41 subjects, these data were incomplete. Conclusion Prospective studies may benefit from using Internet resources at recruitment to determine the listed names for telephone numbers thereby facilitating follow-up tracing and improving response rates. Although vital statistics linkages may help to identify deceased individuals, these may be best suited for post hoc response rate adjustment. </p...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{describe}} retention strategies that were useful and those that were not in a longitudinal study of emerging adults. BACKGROUND: A longitudinal study examining the transition to young adulthood among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes, which had success in retention, provided the context for describing retention strategies. RATIONALE: A challenge in longitudinally designed studies is retention of participants because the loss decreases power for statistical analysis. Given that emerging adulthood {{is a period of}} instability, retention is particularly challenging among this population. However, longitudinal studies are the best way to understand developmental changes, and {{it is also important to}} increase our knowledge of health outcomes during emerging adulthood. DESCRIPTION: Retention strategies used in the study are described, including promoting a positive relationship with participants, maintaining contact with participants, having a study staff with good interpersonal skills, using incentives, conveying respect for participants, and using user-friendly data collection. OUTCOMES: Useful strategies to promote a positive relationship included sending cards and newsletters to participants, maintaining consistency of contact person, and expressing appreciation for participant's time and effort. Useful strategies for maintaining contact with participants included obtaining contact information at every data collection point, maintaining birth dates and chart numbers in tracking databases, monitoring <b>returned</b> <b>mail,</b> and using Web search engines. Other useful strategies were providing incentives to participants, employing staff with good interpersonal skills, providing participants with choices when appropriate, and using user-friendly data collection. One strategy, using contests, was not found useful. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges of conducting longitudinally designed studies with emerging adults, multiple retention strategies can be used that are useful to retention. IMPLICATIONS: It is feasible to conduct longitudinal studies with emerging adults despite the challenges...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. This article {{examines}} the factors related to an individual's decision to purchase a given amount of long-term care insurance coverage. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SETTING. Primary data analyses were conducted on an estimation sample of 6, 545 individuals who had purchased long-term care (LTC) insurance policies in late 1990 and early 1991, and 1, 248 individuals who had been approached by agents but chose not to buy such insurance. Companies contributing the two samples represented 45 percent of total sales during the study year. STUDY DESIGN. A two-stage logit-OLS (ordinary least squares) choice-based sampling model {{was used to examine}} the relationship between the expected value of purchased coverage and explanatory variables that included: demographic traits, attitudes, risk premium, nursing home bed supply, and Medicaid program configurations. DATA COLLECTION. Mail surveys were used to collect information about individuals' reasons for purchase, attitudes about long-term care, and demographic characteristics. Through an identification code, information on the policy designs chosen by these individuals was linked to each of the <b>returned</b> <b>mail</b> surveys. The response rate to the survey was about 60 percent. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. The model explains about 47 percent of the variance in the dependent variable-expected value of policy coverage. Important variables negatively associated with the dependent variable include advancing age, being married, and having less than a college education. Variables positively related include being male, having more income, and having increasing expected LTC costs. Medicaid program configuration also influences the level of benefits purchased: state reimbursement rates and the presence of comprehensive estate recovery programs are both positively related to the expected value of purchased benefits. Finally, as the difference between the premium charged and the actuarially fair premium increases, individuals buy less coverage. CONCLUSIONS. An important finding with implications for policymakers is that changes in Medicaid policy affect the decisions of consumers regarding the acquisition of private LTC policies as well as the level of protection chosen. This is particularly important to states interested in pursuing public-private partnerships in long-term care financing...|$|E

Objective: To evaluate {{the relationship between}} the rate of patient care errors, the clinic climate in outpatient medical practices and health care provider personality and temporal affects Study Design: This research created and tested a new survey, the Outpatient Medical Clinic Safety Climate. The instrument was created through cognitive interviews and pilot testing between June - August 2008. Primary data was collected with surveys between February and May 2009. The surveyed population included every Nurse Practitioner and Certified Nurse Midwife holding current 2009 Minnesota licensure within all types of outpatient specialty and primary care clinics. The final instrument was administered to 2, 576 advanced practice nurses resulting in a 52 % response rate (AAPOR RR 1). The survey data was collected through a mail, return mail process; non-respondents received a second copy of the survey four weeks after the initial mailing. <b>Returned</b> <b>mail</b> surveys were keyed as well as scanned into SAS data sets {{with the assistance of the}} HPRF Survey Center. Survey dimensions included: reported error rates, clinic climate and culture, as well as individual respondent's temporal affect and personality traits (moral exemplarism). Error reporting frequency rates, including adverse events, near misses and accidents waiting to happen, were collected by self report for both the respondent and their clinic. Latent variable development focused on identification of climate, culture, moral exemplarism, and temporal affect. Exploratory factor analysis allowed for the grouping of survey items into scale scores. After scale scores were created, univariate and bivariate analysis was undertaken to further test the model and variables. Generalized linear modeling was utilized for final modeling. Final models included separate models for personal and clinic errors reported. Principal Findings: For personal errors, those made by the respondent, the presence of a safety climate and a medication reconciliation process increased the number of reported errors. For those errors made in the clinic (clinic errors, medical errors, adverse events, near misses, and accidents waiting to happen) multiple culture scales were significant as well as the existence of a safety climate. Culture scales: formal communication about safety, error reporting process and just culture as well as safety climate all correlated with increased reported clinic error. Temporal affect - causal beliefs and moral exemplarism scales were not found to be meaningful contributors to any of the models. Conclusions: For personal errors, relatively little of the overall model is explained by climate and culture factors; alternately clinic errors, medical errors, adverse events, near misses, and accidents waiting to happen are strongly related to by the clinic's culture and climate. As climate and culture are shared perceptions, then it seems reasonable that for the clinic as a whole these factors would explain more of the error model...|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} consists {{mainly of}} Rose’s mother Gertrud Leon’s letters {{to her in}} the years 1938 - 1942; other family members’ letters are also included. There are about 175 letters, 40 postcards and 20 telegrams including <b>returned</b> <b>mail</b> from Rose to her mother. Bernhard’s and Gertrud’s planned emigration to Cuba and then the USA is the main topic in the telegrams. In the letters, Gertrud talks a lot about her daily life and what other family members are doing; she also asks about Rose’s life and comments on what Rose tells her. The letters from other family members contain similar topics. The more recent correspondence between Peter Leon and Beate Niemann (2002 - 2003) deals with the past of Beate’s Nazi parents and their connection to the Leons, in whose house Beate was born. All correspondence as described above is located in Series I. The collection includes also some personal documents of the Rollmann/Koburger-Reiss family (1884 - 1986), family friends of the Wegner/Leons, located in Series II. The following individuals are mentioned in this collection:Leon, Bernhard; Leon, Gertrud; Leon, Peter; Mayer (née Leon), Ilse Jeanette; Mayer, Julius; Niemann, Beate; Wegner, Rose; Wegner, Steven. See inventory listRose Wegner, born in 1909, was the penultimate of Bernhard and Gertrud Leon's five children. Apparently, the family changed their name from Loewy to Leon. Bernhard was the youngest of six children in a family that had long lived in Berlin. He married Gertrud Markwald, whose family was also originally from Berlin. Rose had a sister, Ilse Jeanette, born in 1903, and three brothers, Arno, born in 1905, Heinz, born in 1907, and Gerhard, born in 1911. In Berlin, the Leons belonged to Rabbi Leo Baeck's congregation in Fasanenstrasse. Heinz emigrated to England when he was 18 or 19 years old, in approximately 1926. He would later help his siblings come to England. On March 31, 1933, Rose went to England and, thereafter, traveled back and forth between England and Germany. In 1936, Rose, who was a professional silversmith, returned to Germany to collect the silver from her workshop. In 1938, Rose married Steven Wegner (born March 14, 1901), another German refugee whom she met in England. Steven had been born Sally but changed it because he disliked that name. The Leon children attempted to get Bernhard and Gertrud out of Germany. They arranged for a visa to Cuba for their parents (emigration to Britain which was at war with Germany, was obviously not permitted). Bernhard died on April 16 th, 1941 of natural causes, aggravated perhaps by political conditions in Germany. The visa process was delayed by the bureaucratic need to resubmit the papers for Gertrud alone. Eventually, the plan for Gertrud to emigrate collapsed and, in 1943, she was deported to Theresienstadt, where she again encountered Rabbi Leo Baeck. On September 10, 1944, Gertrud was deported to Auschwitz and was murdered there. Other relatives were also victims of the Holocaust, including Bernhard's older brother Moritz, who was thrown from stairwell of his fourth story apartment during a raid by the police. Moritz's maid, Grete, who tried to protect him, was stomped to death. In England, the three Leon brothers served in the British army. Heinz died of cancer in service in North Africa. After the war, Ilse met Leo Baeck again, who informed the family of Gertrud's deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz. Arno returned after the war to Germany with the British Occupation Forces and is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Duesseldorf. Ilse (married to Julius Meyer with her children Daisy and Harald) and Gerhard remained in Britain. Rose and Steven remained in the greater New York metropolitan area, where they raised two children, Bryan (*summer 1939) and Marian. Steven died on May 17, 1968. In 2002, Beate Niemann approached Peter Leon, Gerhard’s son in London, to ask him about his family’s past because she was born in 1942 in Gertrud’s house at Manfred-von-Richthofen-Str. 125 in Berlin Tempelhof. Her parents had “bought” the house from Gertrud. Niemann’s father was SS-Sturmbannfuehrer Bruno Sattler. Niemann tried {{to find out more about}} her own and the Leon family. Her story was eventually filmed by the documentary film maker Yoash Tatari (DVD can be found in the LBI’s audio-visual collection) and published in 2003 by WDR (West German Broadcasting.) Peter Leon forwarded his whole conversation with Beate Niemann to his cousin Marian, Rose’s daughter. digitizedLetters # 73 and # 74 from and # 25, # 32, # 42, # 43, and # 53 from 1941 are not extant.
