5|$|The {{most recent}} disk <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> phase changes {{was formed in}} 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's {{long-term}} polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (wobble) of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Mugabe survived two {{assassination}} attempts. In the first, {{which took}} place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, {{and asked him to}} remain in his position {{in the event of a}} ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.|$|E
5|$|The new European {{states that}} had {{formed in the}} second half of the 19th century {{typically}} had traditions of war memorials, but nothing on the scale that would later emerge from World War I. Italy built various war memorials after unification in the 1860s, but there was little agreement about who should be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> within the new Italian state. Romania erected a number of heroically styled memorials after the Romanian War of Independence in 1877 and 1878, usually celebrating famous leaders associated with Romanian independence, but also including the occasional modest local monuments Bulgaria and Serbia constructed many war memorials after the end of the First Balkan War in 1913. The public played little role in these eastern European memorials, however, which were typically constructed by the central state authorities.|$|E

25|$|In January 1987, a {{convention}} for arson investigators from California {{was held in}} the city of Fresno. During and after the convention, several suspicious fires were set in Bakersfield. This, combined with the recovery of a single unmatched fingerprint left on a piece of notebook paper as part of a time-delay incendiary device, led Captain Marvin G. Casey of the Bakersfield Fire Department (BFD) to suspect that an arson investigator from the Los Angeles area was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> arsons.|$|E
25|$|These {{modelling}} exercises {{provide insight}} into the relationships between the deformation styles we observe today and the processes that are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> end-results. In order to perform the numerical and analogue simulations, data had to be collected in order to describe the geomechanical properties of the various tectonostratigraphic units and environments that characterise the Majella anticline and its bordering area. Representative samples were collected by the various operational units of the Project and laboratory deformation experiments were performed in Eni and in NorskHydro mechanical laboratories.|$|E

25|$|The Free State unit the Dublin Guard, and in {{particular}} their commander, Paddy Daly, were widely held to be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> killings. They, however, claimed that the prisoners had been killed while clearing roads by landmines laid by Republicans. When questioned in the Dáil by Labour Party leader Thomas Johnson, Richard Mulcahy, the National Army's commander-in-chief, supported Daly's story. A military Court of Enquiry conducted in April 1923 cleared the Free State troops of the charge of killing their prisoners.|$|E
25|$|A unit {{operation}} {{is a physical}} step in an individual chemical engineering process. Unit operations (such as crystallization, filtration, drying and evaporation) are used to prepare reactants, purifying and separating its products, recycling unspent reactants, and controlling energy transfer in reactors. On the other hand, a unit process is the chemical equivalent of a {{unit operation}}. Along with unit operations, unit processes constitute a process operation. Unit processes (such as nitration and oxidation) involve the conversion of material by biochemical, thermochemical and other means. Chemical engineers <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> are called process engineers.|$|E
25|$|Those {{gains were}} short-lived, however. The {{arbitration}} award had not required the employers {{to recognize the}} unions, leading some workers {{to believe that the}} government, not the SLC, was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> improvements in their wages and hours. In addition, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters attempted to claim all of the members as its own, breaking off relations with the SLC. Race riots in Chicago in 1919 dissolved what little trust black packinghouse workers had in white-led unions. Once the arbitration award expired in 1919 employers fired union activists; by 1922, after a failed strike, the SLC was defunct.|$|E
