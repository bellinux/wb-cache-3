50|$|The <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> to {{outlying}} suburbs became especially {{pronounced in}} the 1950s, partly due to incentives made by council planners to create industrial areas in Penrose and Rosebank Road (amongst others) and thus rid the inner city area of noise, pollution and heavy traffic. This was mirrored {{by the development of}} suburban shopping malls (the first being LynnMall in 1963) which enticed retailers to vacate the inner city as well. Attempts by the council to halt this pattern by constructing numerous public car parking buildings met with varying success. The rise of suburban supermarket and mall shopping that was created in places such as Pakuranga from 1965 onwards has been added to by the appearance of Big Box retailers in places such as Botany and the North Shore.|$|R

When regions weigh workers' and capitalists' welfare equally, the core region will set its subsidy low enough that the industry re- locates to the larger region, restoring an efficient allocation. When workers' welfare is weighted more heavily, the core may pay subsidies that are high enough to prevent a <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry.</b> agglomeration; asymmetric regions; subsidy competition; Welfare...|$|E

Hungary is a considerable area to study the pattern of “new economic geography”. In paper we identify, explain and forecast the impact of globalisation, on regional and small unit /local level.

40|$|While {{globalization}} is often perceived to present opportunities {{for developing countries}} {{as a result of}} the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> and the development of a new international division of labor, the least developed countries (LDCs) have for the most part experienced declining shares of global trade and investment. This has led some to characterize such 'fourth world' countries as 'structurally irrelevant' to global capital accumulation, and to infer that patterns of urbanization in LDCs are largely unaffected by globalization. Yet a number of aspects of the global economy have important implications for cities in LDCs, including increased international economic interaction, rapid technological change, changes in regional economies, and the increased influence of transnational organizations. This paper explores the impact of these phenomena in the context of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a city in an LDC that has experienced major socio-economic and spatial change as a result of increased interaction with the global economy.

Korea was a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, and gained independence after World War II. This historical relationship between Japan and Korea can be interpreted as one of economic integration and division. We focus on the period of division and estimate {{the effect of}} the loss of the accessibility to the Korean market on the growth in postwar Japanese cities. By using a difference-in-differences (DD) methodology, we confirm that cities located close to Korea showed a relatively greater decline after the division of the colonial market, implying that accessibility to markets positively affects economic growth. Moreover, our results suggest that the large Japanese migratory movement observed in 1950 - 1970 can be interpreted as the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> that resulted from the division shock in 1945.

Support has been provided by the Spanish Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología (CICYT) under the research programme, Exclusion and Integration in the Welfare State: The ‘safety net’ of social protection in Spain (SEC 97 - 1377). The process of Europeanization implies a certain confluence of resources and outputs among the diverse regimes of social security. This is mainly due to structural constraints (social dumping and <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries)</b> and institutional inputs (sentences by European Court of Justice).
