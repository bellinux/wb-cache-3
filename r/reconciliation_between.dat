5000|$|Siger {{was accused}} of {{teaching}} [...] "double truth"—that is, saying one thing could be true through reason, and that the opposite could be true through faith. Because Siger was a scholastic, he probably did not teach double truths but tried to find <b>reconciliations</b> <b>between</b> faith and reason.|$|R

Men from town assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him, but Will claims he accidentally started the fire by dropping his cigar.|$|E
5|$|In November 1267, {{parliament}} met at Marlborough. Here {{an important}} provision was issued {{that would become}} known to history as the Statute of Marlborough. This statute incorporated the clauses of the Dictum of Kenilworth that dealt with the restoration of royal power, and <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> the loyalists and the rebels. The Statute of Marlborough became a basis for royal government, {{and the relationship between}} the king and his subjects, and as such the Dictum lived on in English constitutional history.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, he was {{released}} on bail by court order. A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing {{to show up for}} a hearing on a murder case in Islamabad. He was placed under house arrest in Karachi. A day later, he {{was released}} on $5,000 bail. His release, rearrest, and then release again was regarded as a sign of growing <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> Musharraf's government and the PPP. After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{death on}} 28 December 1694 (O.S.) {{eventually}} led to a formal but cool <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> WilliamIII and Anne, now heir to the throne.

5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{continued}} to conspire against Emeric, although Pope Innocent III continued urging Andrew {{to launch a}} crusade. On 10 March 1199, Emeric forced Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác, who was a supporter of Andrew, to give him documents that proved the conspiracy against him. In the summer of that year, Emeric defeated Andrew's army near Lake Balaton, which made Andrew flee to Austria. A papal legate named Gregory arrived in Hungary to mediate a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> the two brothers. According to the brothers' treaty, Emeric once again granted Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew {{in the summer of}} 1200.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{discharged}} Palatine Theodore Csanád {{and restored}} Julius Kán {{in the second}} half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis is reliable, Andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, Chagni {{was on the}} {{frontier}} between two ethnic groups who were frequently in conflict: the Gumuz and the Amhara. The Gumuz reportedly rebelled against Ethiopian rule four separate times between 1950 and 1990. However once {{the border between the}} two regions was drawn in 1992, dividing the former Metekel awraja between them, tensions lessened and local elders were able to negotiate peaceful <b>reconciliations</b> <b>between</b> the two groups. Around 1957, the primary school in Chagni was at the westernmost end of the telephone lines in Gojjam.|$|R
5|$|Civil war flared {{again when}} the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and Mark Antony failed just as the first had {{almost as soon as}} its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then {{launched}} a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife Fulvia raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Perugia. Her death led to partial <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of Sextus Pompeius, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval Battle of Naulochus.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Renoart of Nephin, Bohemond's vassal, married Isabel the heiress of Gibelcar, {{without his}} authorization. The High Court of Tripoli ordered the {{confiscation}} of Renoart's fiefs. However, {{he decided to}} resist and gained the support of Leo of Cilicia and Aimery, King of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Bohemond traveled to Acre in summer 1204 to meet Marie of Champagne. Her husband, Baldwin, had been recently crowned emperor in Constantinople. He did homage to her, acknowledging the suzerainty of the Latin Emperors over Antioch. Marie tried to mediate a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> Bohemond and Leo of Cilicia, but she died in August.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1961, {{conferences}} {{were held}} at Coquilhatville (modern-day Mbandaka) and later in Antananarivo, Madagascar to attempt to broker a peaceful <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> the secessionist factions and the central government {{in the face of}} a rebel government in the Eastern Congo led by Antoine Gizenga. It was believed that, with Lumumba dead, it might be possible to create a federal constitution that could reconcile the three parties. The agreements instead led to more uncertainty. The ousting of Ngalula, the chief organiser of the South Kasai state, in July hastened internal collapse.|$|E
50|$|Judaism, like Christianity, {{reflects}} differing views between {{conservative and}} liberal adherents. Orthodox Judaism maintains the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriage amongst {{members of the}} same sex. The Orthodox Union in the United States supported a federal Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. However, {{it is important to note}} that recent research by Chana Etengoff & Colette Daiute suggest that positive <b>reconciliations</b> <b>between</b> sexual minority individuals and Orthodox Jewish family members is possible (a process referred to as theistic mediation), both with and without clinical support.|$|R

5|$|Leo {{tried to}} gain {{the support of the}} Holy See against Bohemond, {{promising}} to unite the Armenian Church with Rome. Pope Innocent III sent Cardinal Soffred Gaetani to Antioch in late spring 1203. Bohemond declined to meet the papal legate, stating that the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem had excommunicated him for his debate with the Hospitallers. Gaetani mediated a <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> Bohemond and the Hospitallers, but Bohemond insisted that the papal legate could not be mentioned in the agreement, because the Holy See could not make a judgement about feudal rights in the principality.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{national}} <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 {{was signed}} on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France and brought back most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As {{a part of the}} Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada {{should call}} on the United Nations Security Council to seriously engage itself in the {{resolution}} of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and to investigate the conduct of both parties during the conflict with respect to international law. The Government of Canada should also initiate a dialogue with the Government of Sri Lanka, in conjunction with the international community, aimed at laying the groundwork for a political <b>reconciliation</b> <b>between</b> the communities. If these efforts fail, the Government of Canada should consider financial and diplomatic sanctions, including, but not limited to, advocating for Sri Lanka’s suspension from the Commonwealth, as well as incentives.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} selected {{assets and}} liabilities from the FFA household sector and from the 1989 and 1992 SCF.
