According to the IUCN there are 21 threatened species in Puerto Rico: 2 mammals, 8 breeding birds, 8 <b>reptiles,</b> and 3 amphibians. The U.S. federal government lists 5 mammals, 2 amphibians, 8 birds, and 10 <b>reptiles</b> under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Puerto Rican government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER), produces its own threatened species list which includes 18 critically endangered species (3 amphibians, 7 birds, 3 <b>reptiles,</b> 2 fish and 3 invertebrates), and 14 endangered species. The DNER follows the IUCN classification scheme for species' priority assignment.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to state <b>reptiles,</b> state birds {{have been more}} rapidly adopted, with the first state designating one in 1927 and the fiftieth in 1973.

5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. <b>Reptiles</b> are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the eastern massasauga rattlesnake, is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. <b>Reptiles</b> are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most <b>reptiles</b> in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E

5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant <b>reptiles</b> had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of <b>reptiles,</b> when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been <b>reptiles</b> rather than mammals.|$|E
