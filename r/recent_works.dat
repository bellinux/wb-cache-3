5|$|Further {{repairs and}} {{fittings}} were done 1935–1936 by Caroe & Passmore (primarily to the Lady Chapel), and in 1960 by George Pace (the interior porch, and light fittings). The museum and chapel of St Padarn {{are the most}} <b>recent</b> <b>works,</b> aside from the re-casting and re-hanging of the peal of bells.|$|E
5|$|More <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> have {{improved}} {{sections of the}} highway in Perth. Great Eastern Highway's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange. The design is a diamond interchange, with free-flowing traffic on Roe Highway, and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements. Construction of the $101.5million project began in late 2010, and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012.|$|E

5|$|These {{numbers are}} (by ancient standards) consistent, {{and this could}} be {{interpreted}} that a number around 1,200 is correct. Among modern scholars some have accepted this number, although suggesting that the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis. Other <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> on the Persian Wars reject this number1,207 being seen {{as more of a}} reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliadand generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|A few <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> {{have become}} a part of the modern repertoire, {{including}} scores and theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers are not part of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical music had become linked to the Italian Communist Party, while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed. Despite this, a number of composers gained international reputations in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} {{electronic}} music championing culminated in 1971 {{with the publication}} of Kaegi's unique record release, a 7-inch record titled Von Sinuston zur elektronischen Musik ("From Sine Wave to Electronic Music"). In the 12 pages accompanying booklet, Kaegi analyses the basic constituents of electronic music like sine wave, sound synthesis, ring modulation or electronic oscillator, with sound examples provided on the disc as well as excerpts from his most <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> of the time, Kyoto, 1970, Thai Clarinet, 1970, Hydrophonie I, 1969 and Illumination Expo'70 Osaka, 1969. The latter piece was commissioned by the Swiss government to be used as background music for the Swiss pavilion at the World Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan, a project he undertook with composer and contemporary music promoter André Zumbach (born 1931), then head of music at Radio Suisse Romande.|$|E

25|$|His <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> consist {{mainly of}} {{instrumental}} works like Arabian Concerto, The Symphony of Return, Chants of the East, {{as well as}} the Concerto Al-Andalus, Suite for Oud and Orchestra, as well as a piece called Sharq. In Arabic, the word 'sharq' means 'East' or 'Orient', and the piece is a musical case-history or a musical memoir of the Arabic musical legacy that was written by Khalife for 100 choral singers and 100 musicians. Additional <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> include Mouda'aba (Caress), Diwan Al Oud, Jadal Oud duo, Oud Quartet, Al Samaa in the traditional Arabic forms and Taqasim, a duo for oud and double bass. Marcel Khalife’s compositions has been performed by several orchestras, notably the Kiev Symphony Orchestra, the Academy of Boulogne Billancourt Orchestra, The San Francisco Chamber Orchestra, the Orchestra of the city of Tunis, the Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra and the Absolute Ensemble. Lorin Maazel recently conducted Khalife's orchestral works.|$|E

25|$|<b>Recent</b> <b>works</b> about Ford's {{depictions of}} Native Americans {{have argued that}} {{contrary}} to popular belief, his Indian characters spanned a range of hostile to sympathetic images from The Iron Horse to Cheyenne Autumn.

The distinguishing mark of Ford's Indian-themed Westerns is that his Native characters always remained separate and apart from white society.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, as both Althusserian Marxism and Lacanian {{psychoanalysis}} {{went into}} decline (after Lacan died and Althusser {{was committed to}} a psychiatric hospital), Badiou published more technical and abstract philosophical works, such as Théorie du sujet (1982), and his magnum opus, Being and Event (1988). Nonetheless, Badiou has never renounced Althusser or Lacan, and sympathetic references to Marxism and psychoanalysis are not uncommon in his more <b>recent</b> <b>works</b> (most notably Petit panthéon portatif / Pocket Pantheon).|$|E

The walls, executed in opus africanum style, and the entablature of the portico were restored between 1903 and 1910. Claude Poinssot discovered a crypt beneath the cella in 1955.

Traditionally the Shanghe region west of the canal has been prone to frequent flooding, while the Xiahe region to its east has been hit by less frequent but immensely damaging inundations caused by failure of the Grand Canal levees. <b>Recent</b> <b>works</b> have allowed floodwaters from Shanghe to be diverted safely out to sea.|$|E
