40|$|A new method, <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, for {{decreasing}} N 2 O from {{fluidised bed}} combustion, {{was investigated in}} a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed boiler. Previous measurements, showing that the N 2 O is decreased to one fourth (25 ppm), and NO to half(40 ppm) with maintained sulphur capture, were confirmed. Supplementary information on <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging was obtained from additional measurements. By adjusting the temperature and the air ratio {{it was possible to}} reduce the CO emission. Thus, the N 2 O emission can be reduced to the level of 25 ppm, with the emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO maintained at about same level as with normal air staging. Low load in combination with <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging resulted in:further reduced emissions. The effect of <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging on the emissions from peat {{is similar to that of}} bituminous coal. There is no negative effect of <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging on the combustion efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract - Two {{methods for}} the {{reduction}} of nitrous oxide emissions, afterbuming and <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, are investigated in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. With afterburning the N 2 O emission can be reduced by 90 % or more, using an amount of secondary fuel corresponding to 10 % of the total energy input. With <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging {{it is possible to}} reduce the emission of N 2 O to one fourth (25 ppm), without significantly affecting the other emissions. With <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging no secondary air is used in the combustor and an air-ratio of about unity is maintained throughout the combustion chamber.

40|$|<b>Reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging is {{a method}} to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emissions}} from circulating fluidized bed boilers (FBBs). Tests in a 12 MW circulating FBB show that the N 20 emission can be lowered to one fourth without affecting the emissions of NO,SO 2 or CO and without adverse effects on the combustion efficiency. The focus of the paper is on the conditions in the combustion chamber. Measurements inside the combustion chamber reveal how the combustion conditions are affected by <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging compared to normal air staging. These measurements confirm the working principle of <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, namely to provide more oxidizing conditions in {{the lower part of}} the combustion chamber and lower stoichiometry in the upper part of the combustion chamber...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} two high efficiency steel filters in the exhaust of an uranium oxide grit blaster at the Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee. The filters were installed in a specially designed filter housing with a reverse air-pulse cleaning system for automatically cleaning the filters in-place. Previous tests conducted on the same filters and housing at LLNL under controlled conditions using Arizona road dust showed good cleanability with <b>reverse</b> <b>air</b> pulses. Two high efficiency steel filters, containing 64 pleated cartridge elements housed in the standard 2 {prime} x 2 {prime} {times} l{prime} HEPA frame, were evaluated in the filter test housing using a 1, 000 cfm slip stream containing {{a high concentration of}} depleted uranium oxide dust. One filter had the pleated cartridges manufactured to the authors specifications by the Pall Corporation and the other by Memtec Corporation. Test results showed both filters had a rapid increase in pressure drop with time, and <b>reverse</b> <b>air</b> pulses could not decrease the pressure drop. The authors suspected moisture accumulation in the filters was the problem since there were heavy rains during the evaluations, and the pressure drop of the Memtec filter decreased dramatically after passing clean, dry air through the filter and after the filter sat idle for one week. Subsequent laboratory tests on a single filter cartridge confirmed that water accumulation in the filter was responsible for the increase in filter pressure drop and the inability to lower the pressure drop by <b>reverse</b> <b>air</b> pulses. No effort was made to identify the source of the water accumulation and correct the problem because the available funds were exhausted...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, {{a method}} for {{reduction}} of N 2 O emissions, was studied in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. The effect of combustor air-ratio, bed temperature, load and limestone addition ratio was investigated. The results indicate that if only the air distribution is changed, the emission of N 2 O can be decreased to one fourth compared to normal air staging at a temperature of 850 °C, with maintained low emissions of NO,´SO 2 and CO. With increased bed temperature, 870 °C, in combination with increased limestone addition, from Ca/S molar ratio = 3 to 4, {{it was possible to}} reduce N 2 O by 90 vol% with low emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO. The method was less efficient at low load, because of the lower cyclone temperature. Also the effect of redistribution of some of the air added in the cyclone outlet to the cyclone inlet was studied. This did not, however, give any improvement in the boiler used compared to adding all of the air in the cyclone outlet. There {{was no significant difference in}} combustion efficiency between <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging and normal air staging...|$|R
40|$|Passive cooling is {{an ancient}} {{technique}} used in <b>air</b> <b>reconditioning</b> and ventilation. Despite its historical use, its relevance in building design has never ceased. To be sure, with the increasing interest in saving energy and preserving the environment, passive cooling stands out as a sustainable possibility. However, {{this is not always}} a viable option, and its practicality is determined mainly by the system's functionality, the type of activities involved in the space to be cooled, and the surrounding area's bioclimatic variables (i. e. temperature, humidity, and diurnal temperature differences). In areas under consideration for passive cooling systems, bioclimatic charts are helpful. Comprehensive charts, in which yearlong hourly meteorological data are projected on a psychrometric chart, help to determine the fits required by a particular location. In this paper, psychrometric charts were developed for eight locations in Oman, and a systematic procedure on the selection and viability of using passive cooling techniques is provided through meteorological data. Givoni's passive cooling zones are used and the applicability of each technique is quantified. The eight study locations are widely scattered around and Oman, and possess great geographical diversity. The presented results can help delineate the applicability of each passive cooling technique for residential buildings at each of the study locations and their proximities...|$|R
