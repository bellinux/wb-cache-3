5|$|Apatosaurus excelsus was the {{original}} type species of Brontosaurus, first named by Marsh in 1879. Elmer Riggs <b>reclassified</b> Brontosaurus as a synonym of Apatosaurus in 1903, transferring the species B.excelsus to A.excelsus. In 2015 Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson argued that the species was distinct enough {{to be placed in}} its own genus, so they <b>reclassified</b> it back into Brontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be <b>reclassified</b> as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been <b>reclassified</b> as inverse agonists.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Shikishima {{was based}} at Sasebo during 1914–15 and was then {{assigned}} to the Second and Fifth Squadrons, in that order, {{for the rest of}} the war. After the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, she was <b>reclassified</b> as a first-class coast defence ship on 1 September 1921, and was used to train submarine crews until the ship was <b>reclassified</b> as a transport on 1 April 1923. Shikishima continued to be used as a training hulk for the Sasebo Naval Barracks until she was scrapped in January 1948 at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s, all but Hiei were reconstructed and <b>reclassified</b> as battleships. After {{the signing of}} the London Naval Treaty in 1930, Hiei was reconfigured as a {{training}} ship to avoid being scrapped. Following Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Treaty, all four underwent a massive second reconstruction in the late 1930s. Following the completion of these modifications, which increased top speeds to over , all four were <b>reclassified</b> as fast battleships.|$|E

5|$|Apatosaurus is a genus in {{the family}} Diplodocidae. It {{is one of the}} more basal genera, with only Amphicoelias and {{possibly}} a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only Brontosaurus is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or <b>reclassified</b> as diplodocines. Brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its only species was <b>reclassified</b> as A.excelsus in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that Brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, Apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Early {{descriptions}} of the species came from Carl Ludwig Willdenow, who named it Lichen carneus in 1787, and Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard, who, in 1790, named it Auricularia corticalis. However, the sanctioned name is Thelephora quercina, given by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, and sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in {{the first volume of}} his Systema Mycologicum. The specific name quercina is in reference to Quercus, the generic name for oak. A number of authors (including Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Lucien Quélet and Giacomo Bresadola) <b>reclassified</b> Bulliard's Auricularia corticalis throughout the 19th century, while Persoon's Thelephora quercina was <b>reclassified</b> by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, who placed it in Corticium as Corticium quercinum. However, in 1879, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke transferred the species to his newly described genus Peniophora, declaring it the type species. Despite subsequent attempts at reclassification, Cooke's name is the one currently used.|$|E
