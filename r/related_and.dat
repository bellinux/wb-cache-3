5|$|The {{second major}} {{division}} of the ancestral Pawnees was the Southern, or Black Pawnees.

5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are <b>related</b> <b>and</b> this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E

50|$|The ICSP has {{a number}} of {{subcommittees}} dealing with issues regarding the nomenclature and taxonomy of specific groups of prokaryotes. These include the following: Aeromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Genera Agrobacterium and Rhizobium; Bacillus <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Genus Brucella; Burkholderia, Ralstonia <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Campylobacter <b>and</b> <b>related</b> bacteria; Clostridia <b>and</b> Clostridium-like organisms; Comamonadaceae <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Family Enterobacteriaceae; Flavobacterium- and Cytophaga-like bacteria; Gram-negative anaerobic rods; Family Halobacteriaceae; Family Halomonadaceae; Genus Leptospira; Genus Listeria; Methanogens; Suborder Micrococcineae; Families Micromonosporaceae, Streptosporangiaceae and Thermomonosporaceae; Class Mollicutes; Genus Mycobacterium; Nocardia <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Family Pasteurellaceae; Photosynthetic prokaryotes; Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas <b>and</b> <b>related</b> organisms; Suborder Pseudonocardineae; Staphylococci and streptococci and Family Streptomycetaceae.|$|R
5|$|Babakotia is an extinct genus of {{medium-sized}} lemur, or strepsirrhine primate, from Madagascar {{that contains}} a single species, Babakotia radofilai. Together with Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris, and Mesopropithecus, it forms the family Palaeopropithecidae, {{commonly known as the}} sloth lemurs. The name Babakotia comes from the Malagasy name for the indri, babakoto, to which it and all other sloth lemurs are closely related. Due to its mix of morphological traits that show intermediate stages between the slow-moving smaller sloth lemurs and the suspensory large sloth lemurs, it has helped determine the relationship between both groups and the closely <b>related</b> <b>and</b> extinct monkey lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are <b>related</b> <b>and</b> closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 it was suggested that the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and Pseudomonas are <b>related</b> <b>and</b> might be synonyms.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are <b>related</b> <b>and</b> get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium {{published}} a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris {{in the section}} Delabechea along with the <b>related</b> <b>and</b> newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. Unique to the section, all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma. The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, belonging to a different clade within the Sterculioideae.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Latiolais {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} a cladogram (tree of descent) {{that attempts to}} show the phylogenetic relationships of 34 species within the family Strombidae. The authors analysed 31 species in the genus Strombus (including Strombus canarium) and three species in the allied genus Lambis. The cladogram was based on DNA sequences of both nuclear histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase I protein-coding gene regions. In this proposed phylogeny Strombus canarium, Strombus vittatus (a synonym for Doxander vittatus) and Strombus epidromis (Labiostrombus epidromis) are closely <b>related,</b> <b>and</b> appear to share a common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely <b>related,</b> <b>and</b> it may have given rise to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure <b>related,</b> <b>and</b> the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the year}} 2000, taxonomic studies using cladistical {{analyses}} of multiple organ systems, shell morphology (including fossil species) and modern molecular phylogenetics {{have resulted in}} the drawing up of what experts believe is a more accurate phylogeny of the Bivalvia. Based upon these studies, a new proposed classification system for the Bivalvia was published in 2010 by Bieler, Carter & Coan. In 2012, this new system was adopted by the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for the classification of the Bivalvia. Some experts still maintain that Anomalodesmacea should be considered a separate subclass, whereas the new system treats it as the order Anomalodesmata, within the subclass Heterodonta. Molecular phylogenetic work continues, further clarifying which Bivalvia are most closely <b>related</b> <b>and</b> thus refining the classification.|$|E

5|$|The Blackstone Hotel was {{designed}} by architect Benjamin Marshall, of Marshall and Fox, in 1909. Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building. According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development, the hotel's exterior and interior are considered {{an excellent example of}} neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture; the nomination form for the building's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire. However, the two styles are <b>related,</b> <b>and</b> the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools. The design was influenced by Marshall's trip to Paris, after which he completed the hotel.|$|E
5|$|The Estonian embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer stated {{what are}} now called von Baer's laws in 1828, noting that related animals begin their {{development}} as similar embryos and then diverge: thus, {{animals in the}} same family are more closely <b>related</b> <b>and</b> diverge later than animals which are only in the same order and have fewer homologies. von Baer's theory recognises that each taxon (such as a family) has distinctive shared features, and that embryonic development parallels the taxonomic hierarchy: not the same as recapitulation theory.|$|E

Nevertheless, the couple went ahead with their marriage, following which they were abducted and killed by Babli's relatives.|$|E

They may not be related to the comet of 1106, but rather a comet that returned about 50 years before that. Subgroup I also includes comets seen in 1695, 1880 (Great Southern Comet of 1880) and in 1887 (Great Southern Comet of 1887), as well as the vast majority of comets detected by the SOHO mission (see below).|$|E

5|$|The last {{surviving}} raphine species, the Rodrigues solitaire, probably became extinct before 1778. The dodo survived until 1662 or 1690.
