40|$|Static power {{consumption}} {{is a major}} concern in nanometre technologies. Along with technology scaling down and higher operating speeds of CMOS VLSI circuits, the leakage power is getting enhanced. As process geometries are becoming smaller, device density increases and threshold voltage as well as oxide thickness decrease to keep pace with performance. Two novel circuit techniques for leakage current reduction in inverters with and without state retention property are presented in this work. The powerdissipation during inactive (standby) mode of operation can be significantly reduced compared to traditional power gating methods by these circuit techniques. The proposed circuit techniques are applied to inverters and the results are compared with earlier inverter leakage minimization techniques. Inverter buffer chains are designed using new state retention low leakage technique and found to be dissipatinglower power with state retention. All low leakage inverters are designed and simulated in cadence design environment using 90 nm technology files. The leakage power during sleep mode is found to be better by X 63 times for novel method. The total power dissipation has also reduced by a factor of X 3. 5, compared to earlier sleepy keeper technique. The state <b>retention</b> <b>feature</b> is also good compared to earlier leakage power reduction methodologies...|$|E
40|$|Several pathologies {{associated}} with the bladder have wide impacts on society. Overactive bladder (OAB) and interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) are chronic urological conditions characterized by pain, urinary frequency, and urgency with or without urinary incontinence. The estimated prevalence of OAB and IC/PBS is more than 34 {{million people in the}} U. S. alone. The American Cancer Society estimated a total of 68, 810 new bladder cancer cases and 14, 100 deaths from bladder cancer in the U. S. in 2008. Treatment options include oral medications, transdermal patches and intravesical instillations of therapeutic solutions. Direct intravesical instillation is considered an effective option, especially for those who remain refractory to oral and transdermal formulations due to intolerable side effects and skin irritations, respectively. Intravesical treatment, however, requires repeated instillations due to rapid drug voiding by urination, and the frequent urinary catheterizations involve risk of urinary infection and patient discomfort. An alternative, site-specific local delivery approach was created using a reservoir-based drug delivery device. This novel passive device was designed to release drug in a predetermined manner once inside the bladder. The device also possesses a <b>retention</b> <b>feature</b> to prevent accidental voiding. The device can be implanted into and retrieved from the bladder by a non-surgical cystoscopic procedure. (cont.) In vivo tests using lidocaine, a local anesthetic used for IC/PBS treatment, showed that a sustained and local treatment to the bladder can be achieved with the device. The lidocaine bladder tissue concentration was found to be a thousand-fold higher than the lidocaine plasma concentration at three and six days in a rabbit model. The device approach has the potential to achieve localized therapy to the bladder while minimizing side effects. Future studies may use the device for other therapeutic agents in the treatment of OAB, IC/PBS, and bladder cancer. by Heejin Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|Solar {{energy is}} clean, safe, and limitless; hence, tapping solar energy would be {{beneficial}} at global scale. In order to realize a solar-driven energy conversion device, semiconducting materials are required that absorb sunlight and accomplish an unhindered electron injection from valence band to conduction band, enabling performance of electric work in the circuit. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to generate hydrogen for its use as fuel {{is considered to be}} a feasible alternative and sustainable energy system. Ideal materials for photoelectrochemical water splitting are semiconductors, which Fujishima and Honda first demonstrated using TiO 2. As a result, this field of research has gathered significant attention by the research fraternity to achieve a highly efficient system producing hydrogen and oxygen by splitting up of water using most of the solar spectrum supplemented by a little or no electrical energy. Metal oxides, in particular, TiO 2 and WO 3, possess congenial electronic structure leading to good photoactivity and chemical stability. Further, their low cost and availability in abundance make them the chosen material for photoanodic reactions in aqueous electrolytes [1]. TiO 2 has been a material extensively studied for water photooxidation [2]. More recently, TiO 2 nanotubes (TNT) have gained much attention due to its simple synthesis [3] and enhanced photoelectrochemical performance over its nanoparticle counterpart. Despite the improved performance of TiO 2 nanotubes, enhancing the visible light activity as well as reducing the charge recombination losses is required to increase water-splitting efficiency if practical applications are to be realized. On the other hand, tungsten trioxide (WO 3) is a visible light photoactive material [4] with a bandgap of approximately 2.7 eV. Although it is a promising material by itself, coupling it with TiO 2 has shown to be beneficial in many applications [5]. The formation of heterojunctions of two semiconductors is an appealing method to increase visible light activity while maintaining the properties of each component. Moreover, the incorporation of WO 3 is, in particular, ambient due to the nearly similar ionic radius of W+ 6 to that of Ti 4 +. As a result of which WO 3 can be easily coupled into the TiO 2 lattice during anodization process. Titania nanotubes incorporated with tungsten oxide have been reported to possess enhanced optical and electronic properties compared to its pure form [6 – 14]. Further, this mixed oxide composite nanotube shows a unique photon energy <b>retention</b> <b>feature,</b> i.e., the photon to electrical energy conversion process does not cease immediately after curbing the photon influx but stops gradually. This feature in TiO 2 [*]+[*]WOx nanotubes has not been studied in depth. Investigations angled from the energy retention viewpoint of this metal oxide composite and its effect over dye-sensitized solar cell and photoelectrochemical water splitting was conceptualized in this endeavor.|$|E

Neo institutional approach is used by the author. Methods involve comparative analysis, cross-national analysis, and classification. The original solution of tasks {{associated with the use of}} a single system-approach to the sociological study of state awards in the sphere of education and science, is extrapolated from institutional economics.   Results. The basic approaches to the determination of the nature and functions of awards institutions in the field of education and science are considered; its relationship with other social, economic and political trends of contemporary politics in Russia is noted. The basic conditions of non-material motivation of workers of scientifically-educational area in modern Russia in comparison with other countries, including the post-Soviet territory states are defined. Both officially established rules and other requirements to candidates on reception of the state honourable distinctions, observed with the Soviet period are considered. The study identifies the main factors that influence the perception of the role of changes in modern society awards, offers solutions to the identified problems.   Scientific novelty. The critical analysis of working rules of the Russian legislation regulating an order (procedures) of rewarding has allowed to reveal major disadvantages of the Russian institute of the state awards: opacity of estimated judgements considering the work of the applicant for the award; absence of accurate hierarchy of the state awards and quantity indicators at measurement of merits and results of activity; value of awards loss in the opinion of a society and separate citizens, etc. Ways of the solution of the revealed problems are offered. In particular, the author points out that it is necessary to create an incentive system intended not only for remote prospect (for example, upon reaching a pension age), but also for the current labour period; material remuneration should be a sufficient impulse for professionals and based on a recognition of achievements, first of all, by colleagues (of the same profession), not unauthorized people. It is necessary to work out quantity indicators for an estimation of activity of educators and academics. Introduction of the structured requirements to this activity is to make objective process of representation to the state awards and will generate professional work standards. Moreover, it is necessary to lower qualifications on presence of the certain experience and to remove some other restrictions for the state recognition.   Practical significance.

40|$|The {{coastal waters}} of the {{northern}} portion of the California Current System experience a seasonal decline in oxygen concentrations and hypoxia over the summer upwelling season that results in negative impacts on habitat for many organisms. Using a regional model extending from 43 °N to 50 °N, with an oxygen component developed in this study, drivers of seasonal and regional oxygen variability are identified. The model includes two pools of detritus, which was an essential addition {{in order to achieve}} good agreement with the observations. The model was validated using an extensive array of hydrographic and moored observations. The model captures the observed seasonal decline as well as spatial trends in bottom oxygen.

The distances between the reproduced index studs were measured to ± 0. 01 mm with a digital caliper. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests, ANOVA and t-test were used for data analysis (α= 0. 05). Results: ANOVA revealed significant differences between the groups only in the vertical dimension (p value = 0. 001). There were significant differences between the two tray and alginate types only in the vertical dimension (p value < 0. 001 and p value = 0. 011). There were no significant differences between the adhesive and non-adhesive groups. There were significant differences in the means of all the dimensions of the two trays as compared with master model. Iralgin alginate group exhibited significant differences in the means of all the three variables compared to the main cast; Xantalgin alginate exhibited differences only in the longitudinal dimension. Non-adhesive group exhibited significant differences in all the three dimensions but the adhesive group did not reveal significant differences only in the vertical dimension. Conclusion: Perforated tray, Xantalgin alginate and use of adhesive produced more accurate casts in all the dimensions compared to corresponding groups. In cases in which an adhesive is not used dimensional accuracy will improve via perforated trays. By using an adhesive with non-perforated tray, Xantalgin alginate has more accurate results; use of an adhesive along with perforated trays produces better results with Iralgin alginate, but no improvements are achieved with Xantalgin.

40|$|The Web {{has become}} an {{essential}} part {{in the lives of}} individuals on a global scale. The Web provides information, data, and unprecedented international communicative powers. Because there is so much information available and the information may appear to be fairly anonymous, it is necessary to evaluate what one finds on the Web. How can Web users believe all the information that is available on it? Is the information authoritative, reliable, and trustworthy? And, from the reverse perspective, how can Web developers or providers make Web users confident about the information on the Web?There currently is no research-based Web site evaluation instrument aimed at evaluating school district Web sites. In addition, the problem {{of this study is to}} respond to the expressed need of the East Central Indiana School Study Council (ECISSC) school corporations' superintendents for a set of guidelines for developing their Web sites and to develop an evaluation tool for assessing the Web site's effectiveness. The researcher specifically examines the degree of quality of the Web sites using the researcher-developed checklist containing 137 items divided among 10 categories: authority, accuracy, objectivity, currency, coverage and intended audience, interaction and transaction features, navigational aids, non-text features, professional development, and recruitment features. Of the 10 Web evaluation categories, navigational aids (50. 42 %), accuracy (42. 06 %), and authority (41. 8 %) are the highest rated components. ECISSC Web contents receiving the lowest ratings include recruitment and <b>retention</b> <b>features</b> (6. 74 %), interaction and transaction features (8. 70 %), currency (8. 95 %), and professional development (9. 33 %). The findings of this study provide specific guidance to individual school corporations to retain quality Web site components and to further the development and refinement of specific elements in each of the 10 identified Web assessment categories. Individual school corporations and ECISSC school corporations' profiles are presented to assist school officials in their efforts to improve school Web site designs and contents. The 10 Web evaluation categories and 137 -checklist items can be used to assess and improve school Web site and can increase their effectiveness and efficiency to promote enhanced school-community relations and understanding among stakeholders.

40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{has attempted to}} elucidate the relation between implicit and explicit forms of memory. This talk focuses on the specificity of implicit and explicit memory: the extent to which, and sense in which, memory performance reflects <b>retention</b> of specific <b>features</b> of a stimulus that was perceived during a study episode, {{the formation of a}} specific association between two previously presented stimuli, or a specific response that was made to a previously encountered stimulus. Cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data will be considered that illuminate the nature and theoretical implications of the different kinds of memory specificity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an industry case study {{for measuring the}} performance of {{software as a service}} (SaaS) product features in order to prioritize development efforts. The case is based on empirical data from HubSpot and it is generalized to provide a framework applicable to other companies with large scale software offerings and distributed development. Firstly, relative value is measured by the impact that each feature has on customer acquisition and <b>retention.</b> Secondly, <b>feature</b> value is compared to feature cost and specifically development investment to determine feature profitability. Thirdly, feature sensitivity is measured. Feature sensitivity is defined as the effect a fixed amount of development investment has on value in a given time. Fourthly, features are segmented according to their location relative to the value to cost trend line into: most valuable features, outperforming, underperforming and fledglings. Finally, results are analyzed to determine future action. Maintenance and bug fixes are prioritized according to feature value. Product enhancements are prioritized according to sensitivity with special attention to fledglings. Underperforming features are either put on “lifesupport”, terminated or overhauled...|$|R
