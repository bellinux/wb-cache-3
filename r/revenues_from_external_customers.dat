We derive elementary properties of the vector of opti-mal order quantities in this system. In particular, we derive bounds on the sensitivity (or, more mathematically, the derivative) of the optimal order quantity at each stage to the vector of the current inventory levels. Our analysis uses the concept of L-natural-convexity, which was studied in discrete convex analysis (Murota (2003)) and recently used by Zipkin (2008) for studying single-stage inventory systems with lost sales. We also remark on how our analysis extends to models with capacity constraints and/or backordering...|$|R

One possible option in software projects {{is the use of}} a project management methodology. This exploratory research examines why organisations with an existing project management methodology are transitioning to an internationally-recognised methodology, and why organisations that do not have a project management methodology are implementing an internationally-recognised methodology. Results of five case studies suggest that while an in-house project management methodology can work well within an organisation, the benefits of using an internationally-recognised methodology should be considered. These include: the assurance that the organisation is using what is considered to be best-practice; demand <b>from</b> <b>external</b> <b>customers</b> that a recognised methodology is used; assistance with external recruitment; and the availability of suppliers of the methodology for training and support...|$|R

We investigate the relationship of host country-specific advantages (host CSAs) in the form of market attractiveness, SSAs and subsidiary sales as they affect subsidiary performance. From an original primary dataset of 101 British multinational (MNE) subsidiaries in six South East Asian countries, our analysis reveals three significant findings. First, host market attractiveness has a statistically positive impact on the performance of subsidiaries. Second, the three traditional SSAs of general management, marketing capabilities and invested capital enhance subsidiary performance. Third, we examine geographic direction and types of customers for subsidiary sales by following international accounting standards. We find that these subsidiaries generate on average 95 percent of total sales from the Asia Pacific region and 91 percent of total sales <b>from</b> <b>external</b> <b>customers.</b> Our findings have important research and managerial implications...|$|R

In manufacturing field, job shop is the interesting type of work for the students due to its variety challenges, machine layout advantages for variety requirements and its appropriateness with practical competency aim. In usual way these product media are initiated from structured exercise goods and research result as internal project, but with an industrial collaboration concept it could be combined with the needs <b>from</b> <b>external</b> <b>customer</b> with good order handling arrangement by management. Since job shop had the fluctuation consequence due to variety process required, developing practical program with Batch Product could widening students practical product spectrum. Regarding the characteristic differences between Job Shop, Batch and Research Project related with competency that students should get, creating batch and project assembly area separately from job shop caused better time schedule and order handling properness. This combination is buffering media work that keep the education operation is running, encourages the student practical product to gain comprehensive activities in each area and more focus handling of all involved parties to each kind of jobs.

40|$|Despite {{the past}} decade’s {{increased}} adoption of scientific methodologies by startups, most still fail to scale into large companies. The paralyzing plethora of advice, theory and models recommended to startups is poorly matched by practical {{advice on the}} applicability and implications of actually following the recommendations. In this action-based research I, an IT consultant for twelve years and founder/co-founder of several startups, try out and evaluate the applicability of methodologies for applying scientific management principles to innovation in early-stage startups. In {{the first part of}} my research, I use an naive explorative hands-on approach which results in insights into the limited applicability of popular methodologies such as Growth Hacking and The Lean Startup. These limitations are especially pronounced for early-stage startups who are yet to launch a minimum viable product (MVP), as well as those that have trouble to decide which hypotheses are the riskiest. Most actionable insights during this part stemmed from the engagement in various thought-experiments and reflections, and not <b>from</b> <b>external</b> <b>customer</b> feedback. To remedy this, and to thoroughly evaluate the applicability of a pre-launch market assessment method, I engage in market opportunity discovery following the recommendations set forth by Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI). This hands-on in-depth approach yielded seemingly high-quality actionable insights with direct implications for the product and marketing strategy of the studied early-stage startup. In the discussion part, I reflect over the applicability of the evaluated methodologies and argue that the main difference between applicable and non-applicable methodologies is whether they are manufacturing-based or needs-based. Finally, I reflect over possible implications and suggest that a startup community wide change of mindset from manufacturing-based methodologies such as The Lean Startup to needs-based methodologies such as Outcome-Driven Innovation will minimize the startup innovation-process variability and increase startup efficiency dramatically on a global scale...|$|R

40|$|Rent {{state is}} one of the {{theories}} that many analysts and researchers working on matters regarding developing countries have used to justify the lack of political and economical development in countries relying on <b>revenues</b> obtained <b>from</b> <b>external</b> resources called rent. Specifically, this theory concerns with the states relying heavily on godsend revenues: <b>revenues</b> generally obtained <b>from</b> natural and underground resources for instance, oil. According to the theory, rent states tend to exhibit qualities of self-sufficiency by using the <b>revenues</b> accrued <b>from</b> these natural sources to stabilize themselves and their intimate companions in the political, economic and other areas of cooperation. In this paper, various works of writers and theorists of rent state have been analyzed with specific emphasis on the notion that the structure of rent governments is an important obstacle to the formation of a democratic and politically developed society. The paper further emphasizes that such conditions eventually result in the development of non-democratic and authoritative regimes in those countries regardless of the rent resource being employed. Consequently, the probability of political and economic corruption, and the jeopardizing of civil society organizations increases beyond limit, to a large extent, in order to preserve individual authority and control of the god-given wealth.

The best {{customer care}} programmes go further than a simple concentration on the (<b>external)</b> <b>customer</b> and recognise the fact that, especially in large organisations, intermediate departments or sections involved in the supply of a service are themselves customers of one another.

Genuine customer care is thus a by-product of internal relationships and culture, which renders it a leadership issue that should be part of an overall organisational strategy.

Since employees are arguably an organizations most important asset, organizations have an incentive to invest in, direct, and promote the development of their employees. As an organization, the U. S.

This thesis reviews the Navys personal and professional development program and examines possible use of 360 -degree feedback in the development of naval personnel. Three-hundred sixty-degree feedback, also known as multi-source or multi-rater feedback, is a development tool that allows a person to receive feedback from his superiors, peers, subordinates, and in some cases, <b>from</b> internal and <b>external</b> <b>customers.</b> The Royal Australian Navy and the U.

Evaluations of those 360 -degree feedback initiatives have concluded that 360 -degree feedback is beneficial to program participants. However, the Navy has yet to implement a Navy-wide 360 -degree feedback program.

Data collection were done among 149 households in Chai Prakan, Fang and Mae Ai districts, Chiang Mai, Thailand. A weighted multi-goal programming was employed with eight model objectives/goals covering economic, social and environmental aspects. These were maximization of annual equivalent value (AEV) of cropping systems, employment and <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> non-timber forest products and minimization of <b>revenue</b> variance, dependence <b>from</b> <b>external</b> inputs, expenditure on pesticides, nitrogen use, soil erosion. This study looked at trade-offs between decisions at the farm and watershed level, economic and environmental objectives, economic and social objectives, and social and environmental objectives. If decisions on optimal land use were done at the farm level, farm land in the watershed would be allocated to mixed fruit trees and annual crops while if they were done at the watershed level, land would be planted to fruit trees and some forests and not so much annual crops. Trade-off analysis between different objectives revealed that expenditure on pesticides or nitrogen use as well as soil erosion could be substantially reduced for only a relatively small decrease in the annual equivalent value and employment. On the other hand, employment could not be much reduced without scarifying farmers’ income. Nevertheless, further reductions in the environmental goals would lead to rapid rates of reduction in employment and the annual equivalent value...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{public sector}} {{entities}} {{have been exposed to}} accounting reforms under an umbrella of New Public Management (NPM). The main purpose of adoption of accounting reforms is to increase efficiency in decision-making by producing useful accounting information. However, it is argued that the adoption of accounting reforms by {{public sector entities}} in developing countries is attributed to the seeking of financial legitimacy, rather than increasing organisational efficiency (Mzenzi, 2013; Mkasiwa, 2011; Adhikari and Mellemvik, 2011; Tambulasi, 2007; Sarker, 2006). Therefore, it is the interest of this study to research the use of accounting information by public sector entities in developing countries. This study is based on an interpretative approach and employs an exploratory case study strategy with two cases (LGAs) in order to accomplish four specific objectives. The roles and responsibilities of LGAs and their multiple actors in delivering public services to the citizens, and their roles in budgetary decision-making attributed by the adopted accounting practices, represent the major motivation of this study. Institutional theory and its three branches, which are Old Institutional Economics (OIE), New Institutional Sociology (NIS) and New Institutional Economics (NIE), were used {{in the process of developing}} the initial model, and the overall interpretation of findings. The findings of this study revealed three dimensions of instrumental-conceptual use, which included conceptual use, decision relevant, and recommendations use of accounting information in decisions related to estimations and collections of own source revenue. Furthermore, the study’s findings showed that legitimating use was the main dimension of the symbolic use of accounting information in the budget approval, as well as in the decision about estimating and collecting <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> <b>external</b> sources. It further identified 22 factors influencing the use of accounting information in the budget decision-making processes. The study findings also revealed that instrumental-conceptual use of accounting information increases both an organisation’s budget efficiency as well as its external financial legitimacy. On the other hand, the symbolic use of accounting information decreases the organisation’s budget efficiency and the actual external financial legitimacy but increases the promised external financial legitimacy. This is attributed, mainly, by external institutional pressures that result in decoupling behavior in the use of accounting information in budgetary decision-making processes. In addition, the findings revealed that budget efficiency and acquired financial legitimacy are interdependent. This means that the high financial legitimacy acquired can indicate high budget efficiency in the situation the instrumental-conceptual use exists than the symbolic legitimating use of accounting information. The study proposes a model of the determinants of the use of accounting information in budget decision-making processes for budget efficiency and external financial legitimacy. It informs reformers, practitioners, policy-makers and researchers about the necessary measures to undertake to make sure that NPM reforms, especially accounting reforms, enhance both efficiency and financial legitimacy in the public sector organisations through the use of accounting information...|$|R
