The sexually explicit images or video may be made by a partner of an intimate relationship with the knowledge and consent of the subject, or it may be made without his or her knowledge.

Halder and Jaishankar (2013) define revenge porn as: [...] "an act whereby the perpetrator satisfies his anger and frustration for a broken relationship through publicizing false, sexually provocative portrayal of his / her victim, by misusing the information that he may have known naturally and that he may have stored in his personal computer, or may have been conveyed to his electronic device by the victim herself, or may have been stored in the device with the consent of the victim herself; and which may essentially have been done to publicly defame the victim".|$|E

Along with journalist Sarah Jeong, they have argued that it is harmful to associate <b>revenge</b> porn with <b>pornography</b> which revolves around consent.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} the criminal law in respect to <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> and the adequacy of existing civil law remedies for serious invasions of privacy by means of <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography.</b> Introduction Privacy issues are currently on the agenda of public debate, largely as a consequence of technological developments which have created new avenues for the invasion of privacy. On 24 June 2015 the Legislative Council agreed to a Motion by Mick Veitch MLC for the Standing Committee on Law and Justice to inquire into remedies for the serious invasion of privacy in NSW. The terms of reference of the Inquiry are: (a) the adequacy of existing remedies for serious invasions of privacy, including the equitable action of breach of confidence; (b) whether a statutory cause of action for serious invasions of privacy should be introduced; and (c) any other related matter. In a media release issued by the Standing Committee on Law and Justice, the Committee Chair, Natasha Maclaren-Jones MLC, made reference to the issue of <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography,</b> stating: The proliferation of social media has meant that invasions of privacy through online forums, such as the alarming trend of jilted lovers posting sexually explicit photographs of ex-partners on the internet, has immediate and vast reaching repercussions. It is in this context that this paper considers: 	The role of the criminal law in respect to <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography,</b> particularly in light of new offences against <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> introduced in South Australia, Victoria and the United Kingdom.

This article considers the existing remedies under the criminal law to <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> and examines the Summary Offences (Filming and Sexting Offences) Amendment Act 2016 (SA) that came into operation on 28 October 2016. The new Act updates and strengthens the criminal law in South Australia in this area. This article notes that the criminal law is not the exclusive means to address <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> {{and that there is}} a need for a wider approach that includes effective civil legal remedies and education and cultural change. However, the criminal law still has a vital role to play in setting the boundaries of acceptable modern behaviour.

40|$|Drawing on gender-role {{stereotypes}} and defensive attribution theory, this study investigates {{the influence of}} perpetrator-victim sex, observer sex and observer sexting experience on perceptions of seriousness and responsibility {{in the context of}} <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography.</b> Two-hundred and thirty-nine university students read one of two versions of a hypothetical scenario, responded to items concerning their perceptions of the situation described, and responded to items concerning their sexting experience. Men were more likely to believe the situation was serious when it involved a male perpetrator and a female victim rather than vice versa. However, perpetrator-victim sex did not influence women’s perceptions. Participants without sexting experience were more likely than participants with sexting experience to believe the situation was serious, and to hold the victim responsible. Whilst there is a growing body of literature regarding <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> from a legal perspective, {{there is little or no}} research on perceptions of <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> situations.

40|$|Purpose: The {{disclosure}} of private images {{with the intent}} of causing distress is often described as ‘revenge pornography’. In the UK, this newly legislated crime has received a high level of media attention following several high profile cases, however there is a paucity of research in this area. Methods: 168 adults (UK general public) completed an online survey using a vignette approach. Views of the influence of perpetrator-victim relationship length and reason for termination were considered alongside perception of an offence, the necessity of police intervention, what extent <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> creates psychological harm in victims, and victim blaming. Findings: Perpetrator-victim relationship length and reason for relationship breakdown did not influence perceptions of victim blame. Participants believed that the situation described in the vignettes was likely to be an offence, and that police intervention is somewhat necessary. Participants believed that the scenario was ‘very likely’ to create fear, and ‘moderately likely’ to create psychological/mental harm in victims. In line with the literature relating to stalking and sexual assault, men blamed the victim significantly more than women. Furthermore, women rated police intervention significantly more necessary than men. Implications: The public are recognising that <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> is an offence, with consequences being fear and psychological harm, showing an awareness of the impact on victims. However, there are sex differences in the perceptions of <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> and victim blame and this could be addressed by raising awareness of this crime. This research, which highlights that the public are aware of some of the harm caused, may encourage victims in coming forward to report such a crime. Originality: There is a paucity of research into <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography,</b> and this study {{is one of the first}} in this area...|$|E

However, in this article in keeping with a relational approach to gender, we focus on men and masculinities, seen within the context of and gender power relations, and the diverse interrelations of men and masculinities with information and communication technologies (ICTs). This includes addressing to some of the shortcomings of contemporary studies of men and masculinities that neglect ICTs; the different kinds of social relations of men and masculinities to ICTS, in work, organizations, and social change more generally; and the implications of ICTs for sexualities and sexual violences, ending with the current case of online <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography.</b> As such, we seek to bring two areas of scholarship, critical studies on men and masculinities (CSMM) and studies of ICTs, into closer dialogue. We begin with a brief overview of academic debates in studies on men and masculinities without ICTs, followed by an examination of some aspects of the relations of men, masculinities and ICTs, with a final short discussion of the case of ICTs, sexualities, sexual violences and <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography...</b>|$|E
40|$|Facilitated by {{developments}} in technologies, the non-consensual posting of sexually explicit images {{of someone else}} for revenge, entertainment or political motive – so called ‘revenge porn’ – has become a global phenomenon. This ground breaking book argues that these fundamental and recurring issues about how victims are violated can {{be understood in terms}} of gender and sexual dynamics and constructions, binary gender and sexual positioning and logics, and the use of sexual meanings. Using a discourse analytical approach the authors examine <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> through the words of the perpetrators themselves, and study the complex ways in which they invoke, and deploy, gender and sexuality-based discourses to blame the victim. They explore strategies to curb the phenomenon of revenge porn, and by placing their research in a broader social and political context, the authors are able to examine the effectiveness of current legislative frameworks, education and awareness raising, victim support, perpetrator re-education programmes, along with wider political considerations. This enhanced understanding of the perpetrator mind set provides important insights into the use of social media to facilitate gender violence, and holds the promise of more effective interventions in future. This is a unique resource for students, academics, researchers, and professionals interested in <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> and related issue...|$|E

The vast majority of revenge porn is committed by men on women ex-partners. In this paper, we discursively analyse men’s electronic texts accompanying their posting of explicit images on arguably the most popular revenge porn-specific website MyEx. com. Situating our analysis as a contemporary form of online gendered violence and abuse, we show the complex ways in which manhood acts are invoked by men to account for their practices.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{exponential}} growth in the use of technology, which has now become and everyday part of our lives. Technology created with good intentions is now being used to facilitate criminal behaviour. Traditional offences such as domestic and sexual violence are now moving from the terrestrial to the cyber world. This transference to a new medium allows perpetrators to commit offences remotely, rather than face-to-face, and can provide offenders with a perceived cloak of anonymity. Recognition of this is provided for as part of the expansion of domestic violence and victim injury definitions to include injuries other than the merely physical. In Australia and overseas, we are seeing the introduction of legislation aimed specifically at the use of technology to commit traditional crimes. The focus of this paper examines the emerging trend of cyber offences, particularly as they relate to domestic and sexual violence, and analyses criminal justice responses both in Australia and internationally. It also explores the emergence of new offences and socially deviant behaviours such as <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography...</b>|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the problem of}} <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography</b> (“revenge porn”) in New Zealand. It argues that the Harmful Digital Communications Act 2015 provides an insufficient remedy due to its broad wording, and that the intention and harm requirements of the offence are problematic. This essay advocates for {{the introduction of a}} specific revenge porn offence to be inserted into the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961. It begins by exploring revenge porn’s impact on victims, and discusses the current legal remedies available here and in comparative jurisdictions. It then proposes a new offence that would focus on the elements of the revenge porn act itself, rather than requiring that the perpetrator intends to cause harm and that the victim actually suffers harm. This essay argues that the introduction of such an offence would provide an effective deterrent for initial and subsequent disclosers of revenge porn alike, and clarify the scope of revenge porn in New Zealand for victims, perpetrators, and the courts. Further, such an offence would place a reasonable limit on freedom of expression and send a clear social message as to revenge porn’s criminal nature...|$|E
40|$|The {{government}} {{can and should}} stop providing financial incentives {{in the form of}} copyright protection for the production and distribution of pornographic works that cause direct harms, such as child pornography, <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography,</b> crush pornography and filmed sexual abuse. The Article proceeds in five parts. Part I provides an overview of the relationship of copyright law to pornography. Copyright law, viewed in a certain light, plays a structural role in the commoditization of sex and sexual images. In most jurisdictions in the United States, buying and selling sex is illegal, but when sex-for-hire is fixed in a tangible medium of expression, it becomes an act of free speech protected by the First Amendment. That tangible medium also gains protection under copyright law. Pornographers use copyright law to facilitate profitable commercial exploitation of their works. Against this background, Part II explores the ways in which copyright law in general is not content neutral. Indeed, in order to obtain a protectable copyright, one must demonstrate the existence of 2 ̆ 7 original 2 ̆ 7 content. Once a copyright is secured, copyright law constructs operate to suppress (by labeling as 2 ̆ 7 infringing, 2 ̆ 7 and thus illegal) any content that is substantially similar to or derivative of the copyrighted work. From an analytic perspective that suppression operates as a form of content-based, government-sponsored censorship in the broadest sense of the word. To be sure, copyright law allows for 2 ̆ 7 fair use 2 ̆ 7 as a right or privilege, or as an affirmative defense to an allegation of copyright infringement. In this way, copyright law includes a mechanism that seeks to soften the suppressive aspect of copyright enforcement. Whether an unauthorized use is 2 ̆ 7 fair 2 ̆ 7 is a legal determination that is, by definition, not content neutral (i. e., it requires substantive consideration of the allegedly offending work). Thus robust copyright protection for any book, image, film, or other copyrightable work requires (at least) two content-specific inquiries by the government: first as to the originality of the initial work, and second as to any fair use by any allegedly offending work. Part III considers the relationship between pornography and copyright law. Numerous legal scholars have offered critiques and defenses of pornography that are sophisticated and sustained. One of the most well-known critiques of pornography takes a harms-based approach. It considers the potential harm to actual human beings during the production, distribution, or consumption of pornography. This part of the Article applies this harms-based framework in the copyright context and considers how labeling such works non-progressive or non-useful would put them beyond the purview of the Intellectual Property Clause of the U. S. Constitution. Types of pornography that would lose copyright protection under this framework include child pornography, crush pornography, <b>revenge</b> <b>pornography,</b> and pornography in which the performers are physically abused or endangered. Part IV argues that the government’s withholding of copyright protection from this narrowly defined band of pornographic works will reduce the incentives for its creation and distribution. Thus copyright law could become a powerful tool in the hands of pornography’s opponents. Part V argues that there is, in fact, a clear precedent for amending the Copyright Act to deny protection to 2 ̆ 7 non-progressive 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 non-useful 2 ̆ 7 pornographic works. In the trademark context, the Lanham Act prohibits the federal registration of 2 ̆ 7 scandalous 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 immoral 2 ̆ 7 marks. Such content-specific restriction {{has been found to be}} constitutionally permissible. Although that prohibition is enforced inconsistently, it nevertheless suggests the contours of legitimate, content-based denial of formal governmental protection for certain intellectual property...|$|E
