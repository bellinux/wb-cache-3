The DEAs consist {{of a combination of}} different materials for the dielectric and electrode layers. The combination of these layers causes incompatibilities in their interconnections. Dramatic differences in the mechanical properties and bad adhesion of the layers are the principal causes for the reduction of the actuation displacement and strong reduction of lifetime. Common DEAs achieve actuation displacements of 2 % and a durability of some million cycles. The following investigations represent a new approach to solving the problems of common systems. The investigated DEA consists of only one basic <b>raw</b> <b>polymer,</b> which was modified according to the required demands of each layer.

In this study, we present {{a new class of}} CHT-based PEC hydrogels amenable to stabilization by chemical crosslinking. The photocrosslinkable anionic methacrylated gellan gum (MeGG) was complexed with cationic CHT and exposed to light, forming a PEC hydrogel. The chemical characterization of the photocrosslinkable PEC hydrogel by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed absorption peaks speciﬁc to the <b>raw</b> <b>polymers.</b> A signiﬁcantly higher swelling ratio was observed for the PEC hydrogel with higher CHT content. The molecular interactions between both polysaccharides were evaluated chemically and microscopically, indicating the diffusion of CHT to the interior of the hydrogel.

The photocrosslinkable feature of MeGG further allowed the formation of cell-laden microscale hydrogel units with different shapes and sizes.

Both sets of irradiated samples produced analogous EPR spectra, indicating that the type and distribution of free radicals generated by γ-irradiation are similar to those generated by β-irradiation.

In our previous work, we proposed the use of ionic liquids as plasticizing agents {{for the creation of}} porous structures from a semi-crystalline natural-based polymer. The current work intended to complement the previous studies, evaluating the ability of ionic liquid (IL) to plasticize blends of starch with poly (lactic) acid, with different ratios of starch and PLA of 50 : 50 and 30 : 70, and its effect on supercritical fluid foaming process (SCF) and providing more insights on the mechanisms involved. For this purpose, SPLA blends were modified and processed using 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([bmim]Cl). Supercritical fluid foaming was studied at different soaking times (1, 3 and 6 h) using carbon dioxide at 20. 0 MPa and 40 oC. The blends were characterized by different techniques, such as infra-red spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and compression and tensile mechanical analysis. The morphology of the foamed structures was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. The results suggest that after 3 h of soaking time an equilibrium state of carbon dioxide into the bulk samples is attained, yielding structures with 6 % and 15 % of porosity, for SPLA 70 and SPLA 50 respectively. The solubility of carbon dioxide withinthe matrices was studied for the same conditions and the results demonstrate a higher sorption degree in the samples doped with ionic liquid. Sorption and desorption diffusion coefficients of supercritical CO 2 in the SPLA matrix were determined for the <b>raw</b> <b>polymer</b> and for the SPLA doped with [bmim]Cl.

The separation process utilizes four distillation towers to navigate around the azeotropes. After a thorough economic analysis, the proposed process is found to be economically viable. It has an estimated IRR of 84. 9 % and NPV of $ 384, 963, 400 at a 15 % discount rate using an acrylic acid price of $ 1. 75 /lb. The process is predicted to become profitable in year 3. If the product price decreases by 45 % to $ 1. 20 /lb (the current market price of acrylic acid), the estimated IRR will be 45 % with a NPV of $ 114, 552, 700 at a 15 % discount rate. The process will then become profitable in year 4...|$|R
40|$|GC-MS {{study of}} ethanol extract of Andrographis paniculata {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} hydrocarbons ((E) -tetradec- 3 -ene), alcohol (6 -methyl heptan- 1 -ol), aromatics (undecan- 5 -ylbenzene, dodecan- 5 ylbenzene, undecan- 2 -ylbenzene, (2 -methylundecan- 6 -yl) benzene and dioctyl phthalate). Some of the identified compounds {{were found to be}} green <b>raw</b> materials for <b>polymer</b> industries and pharmaceutical companies. Corrosion inhibition potentials of the ethanol extract of Andrographis paniculata was also investigated and {{it was found that the}} extract inhibited the corrosion of mild steel in HCl solution through the mechanism of physical adsorption. Quantum chemical approaches have been used to investigate the active components of the extract that are responsible for the inhibition of the corrosion of mild steel in HCl solution. The results obtained, indicated that the most active ingredient responsible for the corrosion inhibition process is pentadecanoic acid. Other compounds with lesser activity include 6 -methyl hepta- 1 -ol, methyl palmitate, methyl icosanoate, methyl stearate, oleamide, dicotyl phthalate and ethyl docosanoate are the active...|$|R
40|$|Corn is {{the largest}} and most {{important}} agricultural commodity in America. Zein, one of the components in corn, has long been investigated for uses other than food and feed. Zein is a unique and complex material, and {{it is one of the}} few cereal proteins extracted in a relatively pure form. Today, because of environmental concerns, interest in zein utilization is again growing. Some of the more important research on zein is more than 50 years old. Most of this work has been either forgotten, lost, or difficult to locate. Much of this work was done at the USDA laboratory in Peoria, IL. Since most early zein literature is still easily accessible at that laboratory, this review on zein has been prepared making use of this old literature. This review reexamines the old literature and reconciles it with new zein research to illustrate some of the unique properties of and opportunities for zein. Zein has been examined as a possible <b>raw</b> material for <b>polymer</b> application since the early part of the 20 th Century. Gorham (1821...|$|R
