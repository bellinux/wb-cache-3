In reality, the country was controlled extra-constitutionally by the Polish United Workers' Party, which used its own <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> to supervise all governmental institutions specified in the constitution. The post of President of Poland was replaced with the collective Council of State, [...] but Bierut, the party's first secretary, remained the effective leader of Poland.

500|$|In 1915 Stella {{became a}} pupil at the North London Collegiate School, then {{situated}} in Camden Town. The school, founded in 1850 by Frances Buss, {{was among the}} first [...] in England to offer girls an academic education, and by 1915 was widely recognised as a model [...] girls' school. [...] After the haphazard teaching methods of her governesses, Stella initially had difficulty in adjusting [...] to the strict discipline of the school, and found many of its <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>practices</b> oppressive. She shared this attitude with her contemporary Stevie Smith, the future Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry winner, who joined the school in 1917. Although a moderate performer in school subjects, Stella found outlets for her talents by writing stories for her fellow-pupils, becoming vice president of the Senior Dramatic Club, and featuring prominently in the school's Debating Society [...] of which she became the honorary secretary.|$|E

Marie received the love that was offered her, frankly, affectionately, and with her whole heart. She owned to her lover how well and truly she had loved him, and there, before her brother and his wife, plighted to him her troth, and promised to him then the obedience and love, which she soon hoped to owe him as his wife. Such declarations are usually made in private, but the friends now assembled had no secrets from each other, and they all felt that strange times made strange scenes necessary.|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of explicit instruction {{has been well}} documented in SLA research. Despite numerous positive findings, however, the issue continues to engage scholars worldwide. One issue that was largely neglected in previous empirical studies - and one that may be crucial for the effectiveness of explicit instruction - is the timing <b>and</b> integration of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice.</b> The present study investigated the extent to which grammar explanation (GE) before practice, grammar explanation during <b>practice,</b> <b>and</b> individual differences impact the acquisition of L 2 declarative and procedural knowledge of two grammatical structures in Spanish. In this experiment, 128 English-speaking learners of Spanish were randomly assigned to four experimental treatments and completed comprehension-based task-essential practice for interpreting object-verb (OV) and ser/estar (SER) sentences in Spanish. Results confirmed the predicted importance of timing of GE: participants who received GE during practice were more likely to develop and retain their knowledge successfully. Results further revealed that the various combinations of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> posed differential task demands on the learners and consequently drew on language aptitude and WM to a different extent. Since these correlations between individual differences and learning outcomes were the least observed in the conditions that received GE during practice, we argue that the suitable integration of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>practice</b> ameliorated task demands, reducing the burden on the learner, and accordingly mitigated the role of participants’ individual differences. Finally, some evidence also showed that the comprehension practice that participants received for the two structures was not sufficient for the formation of solid productive knowledge, but was more effective for the OV than for the SER construction...|$|R
