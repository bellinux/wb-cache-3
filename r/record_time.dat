50|$|Technically, any DV {{cassette}} {{can record}} any variant of DV video. Nevertheless, manufacturers often label cassettes with DV, DVCAM, DVCPRO, DVCPRO50 or DVCPRO HD and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> {{with regards to}} the label posted. Cassettes labeled as DV indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> of baseline DV; another number can indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> of Long Play DV. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO have a yellow tape door and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> when DVCPRO25 is used; with DVCPRO50 the <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> is half, with DVCPRO HD it is a quarter. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO50 have a blue tape door and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> when DVCPRO50 is used. Cassettes labeled as DVCPRO HD have a red tape door and indicate <b>recording</b> <b>time</b> when DVCPRO HD-LP format is used; a second number may be used for DVCPRO HD recording, which will be half as long.|$|R

5|$|The 2007 season brought Zersenay his {{greatest}} medal haul, as he succeeded on grass, track and road. For {{the first time}} in his career he overcame all opposition, including five-time champion Kenenisa Bekele, to become the 2007 World Cross Country Champion. The hot conditions in Mombasa forced a number of runners out of the race, but Zersenay maintained his pace to finish over twenty seconds ahead of the next runner. At the Cáceres Half Marathon, he stated his intention to try for the world record and, although he won the race, poor pacing left him some distance from a <b>record</b> <b>time.</b> He returned to the Great Manchester Run and again improved his best, recording 27:24, but this was not enough to beat Micah Kogo who won in a UK all-comers <b>record</b> <b>time.</b> He competed at the Prefontaine Classic for the first time, and set a two miles best of 8:19.34, although he was some distance behind winner Craig Mottram.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We develop {{methodology}} for conducting inference based on record values and <b>record</b> <b>times</b> {{derived from a}} sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. The advantage of using information about <b>record</b> <b>times</b> as well as record values is stressed. This point is a subtle one, since if the sampling distribution F is continuous {{then there is no}} information at all about F in the <b>record</b> <b>times</b> alone; the joint distribution of any number of them does not depend on F. However, the <b>record</b> <b>times</b> and <b>record</b> values jointly contain considerably more information about F than do the record values alone. Indeed, {{in the case of a}} distribution with regularly varying tails, the rate of convergence of the exponent of regular variation is two orders of magnitude faster if information about <b>record</b> <b>times</b> is included. Optimal estimators and convergence rates are derived under simple, speci®c models, and shown to be surprisingly robust against signi®cant departures from those models. However, even under our special models the estimators have irregular properties, including an unde®ned information matrix. To some extent these dif®culties may be alleviated by conditioning and by considering the relationship between maximum likelihood and maximum probability estimators...|$|R
