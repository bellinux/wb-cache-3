40|$|The {{angle of}} heel on account of turning {{is one of the}} {{mandatory}} stability criteria for passenger ships. Formula used for calculations of this criterion contained in the International Code on Intact Stability [13] is criticized at present. Agendas of the Sub-committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC) for the first (2014) and the second (2015) sessions contain the item on revision of this criterion and corresponding regulation. The paper presents some shortcomings of the criterion. Turning tests of a freely maneuvering model of a passenger ship have been executed aiming at gathering data for the future discussion and its facilitation. The paper presents results of the tests together with preliminary conclusions that confirm the need of the revision of the regulation and put forward concerns on application of such values as initial metacentric height (GMo) and <b>righting</b> <b>lever</b> <b>curve</b> (GZ(?)) calculated for a ship laying still for calculation of a ship’s heel caused by turn...|$|E
40|$|The ship {{capsizing}} {{problem is}} one of the major challenges in naval architecture. The criterion of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regarding capsize stability is still not including dynamic loads. Existing mathematical models of ships taking into account all degrees of freedom as well as uidstructureinteraction can hardly be used for stability analysis with common methods from nonlinear dynamics theory due to their complexity. For the development of new better suited models a test environment has been created. A rst prototype for an experimental capsize analysis is presented in this paper. The motivation to study extreme roll motions of oating structures is the way current stability criteria rely on static as-sumptions. The rollrestoring moments, called righting moments in calm water, are calculated at various heeling angles. Dividing the righting moment by the weight of the ship the <b>righting</b> <b>lever</b> <b>curves,</b> Fig. 1, are obtained. The slope of the right-ing <b>lever</b> <b>curve</b> at 0 is called initial stability or metacentric height GM. National and international rules on intact stability make demands on minimum values and characteristics of these curves [3]. Model tests and practical experience show that the current stability criteria do not always correspond to the danger of capsizing. In order to overcome these shortcomings the dy-namic behavior of the ship has to be included. Consequently, we propose to develop a criterion based on dynamic calculations. Bifurcations in the ship's dynamics are indicators for an upcoming capsizing [4]. Two capsizescenarios were found by path following methods. Fig. 2 shows pathes for different encounter angles of the waves for the wave height h as the control parameter. The angle 0 means following seas, 90 means beam seas. For encounter angles between 20 and 50 it can b...|$|R

Offline and online classification results of rat’s brain signals show that the Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) outperforms other neural networks.

50|$|If a ship floods, {{the loss}} of {{stability}} {{is caused by the}} increase in KB, the centre of buoyancy, and {{the loss of}} waterplane area - thus a loss of the waterplane moment of inertia - which decreases the metacentric height. This additional mass will also reduce freeboard (distance from water to the deck) and the ship's angle of down flooding (minimum angle of heel at which water will be able to flow into the hull). The range of positive stability will be reduced to the angle of down flooding resulting in a reduced <b>righting</b> <b>lever.</b> When the vessel is inclined, the fluid in the flooded volume will move to the lower side, shifting its centre of gravity toward the list, further extending the heeling force.

Correct choices were reinforced with a probability of. 95 or. 05 under blinking or static houselights, respectively. After performance stabilized, disruptive effects of free access to food pellets prior to sessions (prefeeding) and intraperitoneal injection of haloperidol were examined on multiple behavioral measures (i. e., the number of trials completed, percent of correct responses, and reaction time). Resistance to prefeeding depended on the probability of food delivery for the number of trials completed and reaction time. Resistance to haloperidol, on the other hand, was not systematically affected by the probability of food delivery for all dependent measures.
