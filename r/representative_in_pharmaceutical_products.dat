40|$|Recently, it was {{revealed}} that generic miltefosine capsules for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, a fatal parasitic disease, were possibly counterfeit products. Here we report on the methods to characterize and identify miltefosine <b>in</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> and the procedures that were used to assess the quality of these suspected counterfeit products. Characterization and identification of miltefosine were done with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, a simple, rapid and inexpensive colorimetric test was developed and evaluated for the detection of miltefosine <b>in</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>products</b> {{that can be used in}} the field. The complementary analytical techniques presented here were able to determine qualitatively or (semi-) quantitatively the presence or absence of miltefosine <b>in</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> preparations and could identify suspected counterfeit miltefosine capsules. This finding of a suspected counterfeit drug intended to treat a neglected disease in a resource-poor country emphasizes the urgent need to develop more simple inexpensive assays to evaluate drug quality for use in the fiel...|$|R

40|$|The {{biopharmaceutical}} {{classification system}} (BCS) {{has been developed}} to provide a scientific approach for classifying drug compounds based on solubility as related to dose and intestinal permeability {{in combination with the}} dissolution properties of the oral immediate release dosage form. BCS is to provide a regulatory tool for replacing certain bioequivalence (BE) studies by accurate in vitro dissolution tests. This review gives three dimensionless numbers which are used in BCS are absorption number, dissolution number, dose number. Biowaver is an important tool for formulation development. Bioavailability (BA) and BE play a central role <b>in</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>product</b> development, and BE studies are presently being conducted for New Drug Applications (NDAs) of new compounds, in supplementary NDAs for new medical indications and product line extensions, in Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) of generic products, and in applications for scale-up and post-approval changes. The principles of the BCS classification system can be applied to NDA and ANDA approvals as well as to scale-up and post approval changes in drug manufacturing.
