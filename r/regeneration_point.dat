40|$|Introduction to Regenerative Simulation A {{stochastic}} system {{is said to}} be regenerative if with probability one there exists an in nite sequence of increasing random times, called <b>regeneration</b> <b>points,</b> at which the system "stochastically restarts.

When the simulated {{stochastic system}}s have a regenerative structure, we can use the approach introduced by [1] to obtain the point estimate, the variance of the estimate, and the con dence interval. [1] considers an M/G/ 1 queue and wants to estimate the average queuing time, Q, and the average waiting time, W. The point estimate of Q is given as Q(n) = k= 1 k k= 1 k where k is the sum of the queuing times for all customers served during the kth tour and k is the number of customers served during the kth tour.
