In {{a very short period of}} time, Spanish control had collapsed across Honduras; only two small Spanish pockets remained – at Gracias and San Pedro. Montejo sent Gonzalo de Alvarado to San Salvador to seek assistance, which was readily supplied in the form of 100 Indian auxiliaries, 1000 Indian carriers, livestock, arquebuses, crossbows, gunpowder, ammunition, shields, spears, armour and iron. Further supplies were forthcoming from San Miguel, but similar <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Guatemala were largely rebuffed, as a response to Montejo's policies which were perceived as undermining the rights of Guatemalan colonists.|$|E

50|$|AppleSearch was a client/server application, {{although}} {{the vast majority}} of the logic was located in the server. The server portion periodically crawled a set of administrator-configured locations on hard drives, CD-ROMs and the network using AppleShare, indexing the documents it found after converting them to plain text using the Claris XTND document conversion system. A later version of the server, 1.5, could also be pointed at selected WAIS servers, using their indexes directly in addition to local ones. The same server also acted as a WAIS server, respond to WAIS <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> it over the internet. The server also offered a set of AppleEvents for use from Mac programs.|$|E
50|$|Historians {{consider}} the Old Regular Baptists {{a branch of}} the Primitive Baptists that held to a stricter order but were more liberal in doctrine, allowing for different views on the atonement. While the doctrine of some Old Regular Baptists would be in harmony with the majority of Primitive Baptists today (Particular Atonement, instant regeneration), others among the Regulars hold to a more modified Calvinism and Fuller's view of the atonement, and yet there are others holding to General Atonement. These differences led to the light-is-life split {{that took place in the}} Union Association. This division soon spread to other associations brought on by <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> them from the Union Association, resulting in the isolation of the Mud River Association and the formation of the Bethel Association.

5000|$|In {{the decades}} {{preceding}} the war, the Dutch became increasingly discontented with Habsburg rule. A {{major cause of}} this discontent was heavy taxation imposed on the population, while support and guidance from the government was hampered {{by the size of}} the Habsburg empire. At that time, the Seventeen Provinces were known in the empire as De landen van herwaarts over and in French as Les pays de par deça - [...] "those lands around there". The Dutch provinces were continually criticised for acting without permission from the throne, while it was impractical for them to gain permission for actions, as <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the throne would take at least four weeks for a response to return. The presence of Spanish troops under the command of the Duke of Alba, brought in to oversee order, further amplified this unrest.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common failure {{involved}} the drive's read-write head mechanism losing its alignment. Due to lack of hardware support for detecting track zero position, Commodore DOS formatting routines and many complex software copy-protection schemes (which used data stored on nonstandard tracks on floppies) {{had to rely on}} moving the head specified number of steps in order {{to make sure that the}} desired head position for formatting or reading the data was reached. Since after physically reaching track zero, further movement attempts caused the head drive mechanism to slam (producing the infamous, loud, telltale knocking sound) into a mechanical stop, the repetitive strain often drove the head mechanism out of precise alignment, resulting in read errors and necessitating repairs. As a side note: some demos exploited the sound generated by the head moving stepper motor to force the disk drive to play crude tunes ("Bicycle Built For Two" [...] was one) by varying the frequency of step <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the motor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} to cloak {{or not is}} often based upon the HTTP referrer, the user agent or the visitor's IP; but more advanced techniques can be also based upon the client's behaviour analysis after a few page requests: the raw quantity, the sorting of, and latency between subsequent HTTP <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> a website's pages, plus {{the presence of a}} check for robots.txt file, are some of the parameters in which search engines spiders differ heavily from a natural user behaviour. The referrer tells the URL of the page on which a user clicked a link to get to the page. Some cloakers will give the fake page to anyone who comes from a web directory website, since directory editors will usually examine sites by clicking on links that appear on a directory web page. Other cloakers give the fake page to everyone except those coming from a major search engine; this makes it harder to detect cloaking, while not costing them many visitors, since most people find websites by using a search engine.|$|E

As such, Web accelerators must address some common server issues such as: capacity, performance, and availability. A set of Oracle 9 iAS Web Cache instances can be grouped into a loosely coupled cluster to help solve these issues. When clustered, the cache capacity increases linearly. In addition, the number of cacheable miss <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the application Web server is reduced linearly. Also, the impact on site availability and performance of an individual Oracle 9 iAS Web Cache node failure in a cluster is reduced considerably...|$|E

40|$|When {{picking a}} cache {{replacement}} policy for file systems, LRU (Least Recently Used) {{has always been}} the obvious choice, because of the temporal locality found in programs and data. However, in the case of Sun NFS servers much of the locality is filtered out by the client cache. It has been conjectured that this filtering of locality by the client caches render LRU ineffective as a server cache replacement policy. This study disproves the conjecture by simulating a NFS server cache with real world traces. Traces were taken of NFS read and write <b>requests</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> an NFS server.

This paper explores a key design question for this approach: which files should be replicated ? We find that the popular policy of replicating readonly files offers little benefit. A policy that replicates readonly portions of read-mostly files, however, implicitly coordinates with client cache invalidations and thereby allows almost all read operations to be offloaded. In a read-heavy trace, 75 % of all operations and 52 % of all data transfers can be offloaded...|$|E
