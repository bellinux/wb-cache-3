Since the introduction of plague, endemic foci have continued to expand, and spatiotemporal variability {{in the distribution of}} human plague has been observed. To assess the movements of R. rattus and evaluate the risk of dispersion of the disease, a field study at the scale of the habitats (houses, hedges of sisals, and <b>rice</b> <b>fields)</b> in the plague villages was carried out during high and low seasons of plague transmission to humans. The systemic oral marker Rhodamine B was used to follow rats' movements. Baits were placed in different habitats, and trapping success was carried out once a month for 3 months after the bait distribution. Plague indicators (reservoirs' abundance, flea index, Y. pestis prevalence in fleas, and Y. pestis antibody prevalence in rats) were determined. The highest abundance of rats and marking efficiency were observed in the sisal hedges and the <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> Marked <b>rats</b> were captured most commonly near the points where baits were initially placed. The main movements of rats were observed between the houses and sisal hedges. Major differences were observed between the seasons of high and low plague transmission.

40|$|Rice field rat’s {{population}} occasionally undergoes widespread eruption in Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Myanmar following {{extreme weather}} event. Asynchronous or aseasonal planting of crops {{in response to}} unusual weather events can extend the period that high quality food is available to rodents. Consequently, rodents may extend their breeding season and a population eruption {{is more likely to}} occur. However, it is unclear the association between {{the quality and quantity of}} food and the reproductive success of female rice field rats. An improved understanding of the effects of food availability and quality on rodent reproduction could enable better forecasts of rodent outbreaks in response to unusual weather events which could lead to asynchronous or aseasonal planting of crops. We studied how the breeding performance of the <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> <b>rat,</b> Rattus argentiventer, responded to food supply at different stages of the rice crop in the Philippines. Our results suggest that rice plants at the booting to ripening stages provided high quality food for rice field rats and it drove higher conception rate of female rats at these stages of the rice crop. We contend that the extension of the growing season by 3 to 4 weeks provides high quality food for rodents for an extended period, which in turn provides sufficient conditions for a population eruption.

40|$|Rodents cause {{significant}} damage to lowland rice crops across Cambodia and farmers are increasingly turning to chemical rodenticides for pest rodent management. Concern {{about the potential}} damage of these chemicals to human and environmental health provides the impetus for a search for alternative rodent management strategies, with particular interest in ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM). EBRM has {{a strong emphasis on}} non-chemical methods including the Trap Barrier System (TBS) and uses knowledge of pest rodent ecology to design effective interventions that limit population growth. For Cambodia, almost nothing was known at the start of this study regarding the identity, distribution and ecology of the country’s rodent pests. This research was designed to document this knowledge in parallel with a rodent management trial carried out at Somrong Commune in Kampong Cham Province of Cambodia, with the practical aim of informing on the outcomes of the trial and assisting with future development of EBRM in Cambodia. The large physical scale of the study and the relatively short time frame available for research led me to develop an action research approach that combined traditional positivist biological research with a more constructivist approach and participatory methods to gain access to and utilize local knowledge about rats. This research documents Cambodian pest rodents in lowland rice field cropping systems, through a combination of nation-wide collecting followed by detailed taxonomic assessments, and the use of farmer meetings and interviews to estimate the history and severity of the problem in each area. A total of nine rodent pest species were identified but both the pest rodent community and the severity of the associated problems vary from province to province. One species, the <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> <b>rat</b> (Rattus argentiventer), appears to be actively spreading and is not yet found in the northwestern provinces. A more detailed study in Somrong Commune found seven species and documented aspects of habitat use, breeding biology and movement. The inclusion of local knowledge in the study added a spatial and temporal scale to the study that could not have been obtained through conventional means, and which led to novel hypotheses about pest rodent ecology in the Somrong landscape, presented {{in the form of a}} heuristic landscape model. Criteria are developed for assessing the rigour and reliability or trustworthiness of the results. Particular attention is paid to the potential value of ‘expert’ knowledge which is rarely used in participatory research but which holds enormous potential for research into technical issues. The results of the TBS trial carried out in Somrong Commune were analysed to assess whether implementation of this method resulted in lower levels of rodent damage and higher rice yields relative to a single control commune, Lvea, and whether the farming community in Somrong is likely to adopt the method in the future. Although some farmer survey data suggest that yields improved in Somrong during the TBS trial, statistical analysis of the quantitative data set fails to yield compelling evidence of any benefit from use of TBS. The results emphasize the important role of landscape factors, especially the annual flooding cycle of the Mekong River, in determining the spatial and temporal distribution of rodent damage. Analysis of the relationship between rat captures and claimed yield increases also suggests that the TBS was not primarily responsible for the yield increase—too few rats were captured to account for the additional yield, even under extreme scenarios for how individual rodents cause damage to rice crops. Somrong farmers are unlikely to continue with the TBS method after completion of the project due to many perceived technical problems with implementing the method, and other concerns over its high labour and monetary costs. The ecological results of this study are used to suggest various alternative means by which Somrong farmers might combat the problem of rodent pests. Finally, a new approach is recommended for gaining an appreciation of rodent ecology on a landscape scale. This approach uses a combination of generalities about rodent biology and ecology, field observations, and incorporates local knowledge from local ‘experts’. This approach is likely to yield a faster and more complete understanding of the spatial and temporal dimensions of a local rodent community than more conventional approaches and will hopefully lead to more effective and relevant rodent management recommendations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Rice</b> <b>field</b> <b>rats</b> are an {{important}} pre-harvest pest of lowland irrigated rice farming systems in Vietnam. Farmers often apply traditional control measures too late for economic benefits to be achieved, due to the progressive inability of rice plants to compensate for damage. The use of computer simulation modelling was examined as a potential alternative approach to the management of rodents in lowland rice crop ecosystems. It was projected that 16 farmers {{who are involved in}} action learning cycles using crop simulation models to look at the relationship between timing and effectiveness of different control methods, would change their behaviour about rodent management, so that management is preventative rather than reactionary to pest damage. The study was conducted in three villages (2 treatment villages and 1 reference village) during the autumn-winter cropping season (July-November) in 2009, in An Giang Province in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Effects of alternative rodent management practices were explored using APSIM modelling in a farmer participatory approach. The changes in rodent control practices of farmers before and after the involvement in the APSIM modelling approach are also discussed. The study showed that APSIM modelling adequately simulated actual yields at different rodent damage intensities, for the different growth stages of the rice crop. Pre-season yield predictions in response to rat management were the same for farmers 2 ̆ 7 actual rice yields at the treatment and reference sites. The use of the modelling was an integral component of the learning cycle for farmers and extension workers in achieving a clear understanding of the rationale for changing their traditional rodent control strategies. Farmers subsequently changed the timing of rodent management to the tillering stage of crop development instead of later in crop growth after most damage has been done. It is believed that the model has the potential for application in other provinces of Vietnam with similar rice farming systems to those in the Mekong Delta...|$|R

Our hypotheses were: 1) macrophyte richness and biomass decrease with increased rice crop age; and 2) macrophyte species of <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> are a subsample of natural wetlands and species loss will increase with crop age. We investigated three <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> of each different ages (old, intermediate and new ones) and three natural intermittent wetlands for this study.

Dojo loach, a recently introduced species well adapted to rice cultivation cycles in its native range, used <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> as reproduction ground.

40|$|Irrigation of <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> in Bangladesh with arsenic-contaminated {{groundwater}} transfers tens of cubic {{kilometers of}} water and {{thousands of tons of}} arsenic from aquifers to <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> each year. Here we combine observations of infiltration patterns with measurements of porewater chemical composition from our field site in Munshiganj Bangladesh to characterize the mobility of arsenic in soils beneath <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> We find that very little arsenic delivered by irrigation returns to the aquifer, and that recharging water mobilizes little, if any, arsenic from <b>rice</b> <b>field</b> subsoils. Arsenic from irrigation water is deposited on surface soils and sequestered along flow paths that pass through bunds, the raised soil boundaries around fields. Additionally, timing of flow into bunds limits the transport of biologically available organic carbon from <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> into the subsurface where it could stimulate reduction processes that mobilize arsenic from soils and sediments. Together, these results explain why groundwater irrigated <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> act as net sinks of arsenic from groundwater. Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.

Irrigation water {{management}} problems will arise {{if there is}} a shortage of water in <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> Shortage of water in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> can be evaluated by the efficiency of existing irrigation. Based on the Indonesian‟s irrigation design criteria 65 %, the project efficiency for Irrigation Planning is 65 %. This value when compared to some countries in Asia was still much greater. This might be caused by undeterminating the water losses in the <b>rice</b> <b>field.</b> The study aims to determine the efficiency of irrigation in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> (Field Application Efficiency) is actually through direct measurements in the field, started at the land preparation up to the growth of rice plants. Measurements were taken at one tertiary JKr 21 Kr in Krueng Jreue Irrigation Region. To evaluate the efficiency of irrigation in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> used two methods of measurement. Inflow-outflow method for measuring the delivery of irrigation water in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> (Vf) which use the modified pipes that serves as the entrance and exit of water in the tertiary, the difference between incoming water and outgoing water is the amount of water used in <b>rice</b> <b>fields.</b> Water balance in the field is measured using Drum technique method with a diameter of 50 cm and height 125 cm. The drums are planted in the ground and a quarter of the height of the drum located above the surface. By this equipment, the evapotranspiration parameters, percolation and effective rainfall can be obtained. These results showthat the efficiency of irrigation in <b>rice</b> <b>fields</b> (Ea) of 65. 29 %. It means that actually the project efficiency is 42. 44 % far below than Indonesian‟s criteria...|$|R
