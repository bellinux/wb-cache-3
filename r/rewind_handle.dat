The rewind knob held a film speed reminder, covering ASA 8-800/DIN 10-30, but no folding <b>rewind</b> <b>handle.</b> The frame counter needed to be reset manually. It counted down from the number of exposures in the roll to zero.|$|E

Furthermore, Dejay has also founded her own record label, <b>Rewind</b> Records, which <b>handles</b> the management and promotion for the Pancakes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Quantum {{zero-knowledge}} proofs and quantum proofs {{of knowledge}} are inherently difficult to analyze because their security analysis uses rewinding. Certain cases of quantum <b>rewinding</b> are <b>handled</b> {{by the results}} by Watrous (SIAM J Comput, 2009) and Unruh (Eurocrypt 2012), yet in general the problem remains elusive. We show {{that this is not}} only {{due to a lack of}} proof techniques: relative to an oracle, we show that classically secure proofs and proofs of knowledge are insecure in the quantum setting. More specifically, sigma-protocols, the Fiat-Shamir construction, and Fischlin’s proof system are quantum insecure under assumptions that are sufficient for classical security. Additionally, we show that for similar reasons, computationally binding commitments provide almost no security guarantees in a quantum setting. To show these results, we develop the “pick-one trick”, a general technique that allows an adversary to find one value satisfying a given predicate, but not two...|$|R
