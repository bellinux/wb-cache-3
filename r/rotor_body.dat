50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the <b>rotor</b> <b>body,</b> to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

Most notably, {{they are used to}} separate materials, e. g. blood plasma and serums, and produce genetically engineered substances. Centrifuge rotors hold sample containers. Centrifugal forces equaling 25, 000 times the force of gravity act on operating rotors and samples at speeds of 20, 000 r/min. Unlike present conventional solutions (rotors made of special aluminum alloys), the load-bearing structures of the lightweight rotors presented here are made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP). Given the fibers extremely high load-bearing capacity, lightweight rotors manufactured with this novel technology set new standards for weight, stability and service life compared to current concepts. In addition, the time typically need ed to heat aluminum rotors is reduced by at least 50 %. This complicated design principle necessitates suitable forming tools that reproduce the complex geometries (e. g. undercuts). Therefore, generative (laminate) methods of geometry generation are used for mold making.

To investigate the validity of this doubt, in this present work a small uni-coil shaded-pole induction motor is analyzed in 2 D and 3 D {{and the results are}} compared. In order to maintain the paper size as compact, the analysis is limited to the air-gap flux density distribution, variation of the main winding inductance against current and the force acting on the rotor body; which are the important components of the motor performance. It is found that although 3 D analysis consumes several times more computing time and storage space, improvement achieved in performance by use of 3 D analysis is not very significant. % rms difference between the two cases is obtained as 0. 76 % for the main winding inductance and 0. 59 % for the force acting on the <b>rotor</b> <b>body.</b> Also the air-gap flux density distribution obtained from the two types of analysis is found to be very close to each other.

40|$|The fatigue {{phenomenon}} {{is said to}} be responsible for more than 80 % of structural failures and operational accidents. One of the most important branches of industry, where unexpected outages can cause extremely expensive costs is the power producing industry. The steam turbine rotors represent large, expensive and, in the case of failure, potentially dangerous components. Their local properties generally differ from one forging to another, or if we compare head and bottom parts of the original ingot, or central and circumferential locations of one <b>rotor</b> <b>body</b> respectively, or if we compare the properties of separate discs, e. g. in the case of welded rotors. These differences stem from both even slight changes in the chemical composition (of separate heats or even within one ingot), heat treatment and in the differences in technology with respect to the real shape and size of the forgings in question. At present, questions on quantitative evaluation of remaining lifetime (to avoid failure) become urgent and, because fatigue is the most frequent cause of material degradation and resulting structural components failures, the remaining lifetime assessment is based on the evaluation of mechanical properties before and after some time of service. The original material data are usually tested by means of classic test specimens, which can hardly be used in the case of components in service, where there is no possibility to withdraw a sufficient volume of representative material for the manufacturing of a classic test specimen. In such cases today, methods of semi-destructive removal of a small volume of test material are utilized. This makes it possible to produce miniature test specimens.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{aeroelastic}} stability of a wind turbine rotor in the dynamic stall regime is investigated. Increased flexibility of modern turbine blades {{makes them more}} susceptible to aeroelastic instabilities. Complex oscillation modes like flap/lead-lag are of particular concern, which give way to potential structural damage, see Chaviaropoulos (1999), Chaviaropoulos et. al. (2003). We study the stall induced oscillations in pitching direction and in combined flapwise, lead-lag wise directions. The aerodynamic loads acting on the <b>rotor</b> <b>body</b> in the stall regime are nonlinear. We consider a wide ranging parametric variation and underline their effect on the aeroelastic instability and overall nonlinear dynamical behavior of the system. A common engineering dynamic stall model (Onera) {{has been used to}} calculate the aerodynamic loads, (see Tran and Petot (1981), Dunn and Dugundji (1992). The aerodynamic loads are captured well by this model in the dynamic stall regime and are subsequently used to predict the bifurcation behavior and the chaotic routes of the aeroelastic system under study are. The aerodynamic loads are given in terms of differential equations which are combined with the governing equations of the aeroelastic system; the resulting system of equations are solved by a 4 th order variable step Runge-Kutta method. In the pitching oscillation study we consider the following parameters: nondimensional airspeed (U), mean angle of attack, initial condition, structural nonlinearity and reduced frequency (k) and amplitude of external forcing. The self excited and forced system reveal existence of quasi-periodic and chaotic response. For different mean angle of attack, quasi-periodic response have been obtained with different initial conditions. A cubic structural nonlinearity has been seen to alter the bifurcation pattern of the above system. Varying k as a bifurcation parameter in the forced system shows presence of period- 3 orbits near chaos. The second case of flap/edgewise oscillation in the stall regime identifies nondimensional rotational speed of the rotor along with structural stiffnesses and nonlinearity as most important parameters of the self excited system. However, no chaotic response has been obtained. External forcing shows presence of higher harmonics and quasi-harmonics in the response. Once again, no chaotic attractor has been found.

40|$|Multi-level {{inverters}} play {{a significant}} role in high power drive systems for induction motors. Interest in multi-level inverters started with the three-level, neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter. Now there are many topologies for higher number of levels such as the, flying capacitor and cascaded H-bridge etc. The advantage of multi-level inverters is the reduced voltage stress on the switching devices, lower dv/dt and lower harmonic content. The voltage space vector structure in a multi-level inverter has a hexagonal periphery similar to that in a two-level inverter. In the over-modulation region in multi-level inverters, there is the presence of lower order harmonics such as 5 th and 7 th in the output voltage, and this can be avoided by using a voltage space vector scheme with more than six polygonal voltage space vectors such as 12, 18, 24 etc. These polygonal voltage space vectors can be generated by using multi-level inverter topologies, by cascading two-level inverter structures with asymmetric DC-links. This thesis deals with the development of 12 -sided and 18 -sided polygonal voltage space vector schemes for induction motor drives. With the 12 -sided polygonal structure, all the 5 th and 7 th harmonic orders and 6 n± 1, n= 1, 3, 5 [...] are absent throughout the modulation range, and in the 18 -sided voltage space vector scheme, 5 th, 7 th, 11 th and 13 th harmonics are absent throughout the modulation range. With the absence of the low order frequencies in the proposed polygonal space vector structures, high frequency PWM schemes are not needed for voltage control. This is an advantage over conventional schemes. Also, due to the absence of lower order harmonics throughout the modulation range, special compensated synchronous reference frame PI controllers are not needed in current controlled vector control schemes in over-modulation. In this thesis a method is proposed for generating 12 -sided polygonal voltage space vectors for an induction motor fed from one side. A cascaded combination of three two-level inverters is used with asymmetrical DC-links. A simple space vector PWM scheme based only on the sampled reference phase amplitudes are used for the inverter output voltage control. The reference space vector is sampled at different sampling rates depending on the frequency of operation. The number of samples in a sector is chosen to keep the overall switching frequency around 1 kHz, in order to minimize switching losses. The voltage space vectors that make up the two sides of the sector in which the reference vector lies, are time averaged using volt-sec balance, to result in the reference vector. In the proposed 12 -sided PWM scheme all the harmonics of the order 6 n± 1, n= 1, 3, 5 [...] . are eliminated from the phase voltage, throughout the modulation range. In multi-level inverters steps are taken to eliminate common-mode voltage. Common-mode voltage is defined as one third of the sum of the three pole voltages of the inverter for a three phase system. Bearings are found to fail prematurely in drives with fast rising voltage pulses and high frequency switching. The alternating common-mode voltage generated by the PWM inverter contributes to capacitive couplings from stator body to <b>rotor</b> <b>body.</b> This generates motor shaft voltages causing bearing currents to flow from rotor to stator body and then to the ground. There can be a flashover between the bearing races. Also a phenomenon termed EDM (Electro-discharge machining) effect occurs and may damage the bearings. Common-mode voltage has to be eliminated in order to overcome these effects. In multi-level inverters redundancy of space vector locations is used to eliminate common-mode voltages. In the present thesis a 12 -sided polygonal voltage space vector based inverter with an open-end winding induction motor is proposed, in which the common-mode voltage variation at the poles of the inverter is eliminated. In this scheme, there is a three-level inverter on each side of the open-end winding of the induction motor. The three-level inverter is made by cascading two, two-level inverters with unequal DC-link voltages. Appropriate space vectors are selected from opposite sides such that the sum of the pole voltages on each side is a constant. Also during the PWM operation when the zero vector is applied, identical voltage levels are used on both sides of the open-end windings, in order to make the phase voltages zero, while the common-mode voltage is kept constant. This way, common-mode voltage variations are eliminated throughout the modulation range by appropriately selecting the voltage vectors from opposite ends. In this method all the harmonics of 6 n± 1, n= 1, 3, 5 [...] and triplen orders are eliminated. In the 12 -sided polygonal voltage space vector methods, the 11 th and 13 th harmonics though attenuated are not eliminated. In the 18 -sided polygonal voltage space vector method the 11 th and 13 th harmonics are eliminated along with the 5 th and 7 th harmonics. This scheme consists of an open-end winding induction motor fed from one side by a two-level inverter and the other side by a three-level inverter comprising of two cascaded two-level inverters. Asymmetric DC-links of a particular ratio are present. The 12 -sided and 18 -sided polygonal voltage space vector methods have been first simulated using SIMULINK and then verified experimentally on a 1. 5 kW induction motor drive. In the simulation as well as the experimental setup the starting point is the generation of the three reference voltages v, vB and vC. A method for determining the sector in which the reference vector lies by comparing the values of the scaled sampled instantaneous reference voltages is proposed. For the reference vector lying in a sector between the two active vectors, the first vector is to be kept on for T 1 duration and the second vector for T 2 duration. These timing durations can be found from the derived formula, using the sampled instantaneous values of the reference voltages and the sector information. From the pulse widths and the sector number, the voltage level at which a phase in the inverter has to be maintained is uniquely determined from look-up tables. Thus, once the pole voltages are determined the phase voltages can be easily determined for simulation studies. By using a suitable induction motor model in the simulation, the effect of the PWM scheme on the motor current can be easily obtained. The simulation studies are experimentally verified on a 1. 5 kW open-end winding induction motor drive. A V/f control scheme is used for the study of the drive scheme for different speeds of operation. A DSP (TMS 320 LF 2407 A) is used for generating the PWM signals for variable speed operation. The 12 -sided polygonal voltage space vector scheme with the motor fed from a single side has a simple power bus structure and it is also observed that the pole voltage is clamped to zero for 30 % of the time duration of one cycle of operation. This will increase the overall efficiency. The proposed scheme eliminates all harmonics of the order 6 n± 1, n= 1, 3, 5 …for the complete modulation range. The 12 -sided polygonal voltage space vector scheme with common-mode elimination requires the open-end winding configuration of the induction motor. Two asymmetrical DC-links are required which are common to both sides. The leg of the high voltage inverter is seen to be switched only for 50 % duration in a cycle of operation. This will also reduce switching losses considerably. The proposed scheme not only eliminates all harmonics of the order 6 n± 1, n= 1, 3, 5 …for the complete modulation range, but also maintains the common-mode voltage on both sides constant. The common-mode voltage variation is eliminated. This eliminates bearing currents and shaft voltages which can damage the motor bearings. In the 18 -sided polygonal voltage space vector based inverter, the 11 th and 13 th harmonics are eliminated along with the 5 th and 7 th. Here also an open-end winding induction motor is used, with a two-level inverter on one side and a three-level inverter on the other side. A pole of the two-level inverter is at clamped to zero voltage for 50 % of the time and a pole of the three-level inverter is clamped to zero for 30 % of the time for one cycle of operation. The 18 -sided polygonal voltage space vectors show the highest maximum peak fundamental voltage in the 18 -step mode of 0. 663 Vdc compared to 0. 658 Vdc in the 12 -step mode of the 12 -sided polygonal voltage space vector scheme and 0. 637 Vdc in the six-step mode of a two-level inverter or conventional multi-level inverter (where Vdc is the radius of the space vector polygon). Though the schemes proposed are verified on a low power laboratory prototype, the principle and the control algorithm development are general in nature and can be easily extended to induction motor drives for high power applications...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of active}} blade pitch control to {{increase}} helicopter rotor/body damping is studied. Control is introduced through a conventional nonrotating swashplate. State variable feedback of <b>rotor</b> and <b>body</b> states is used. Feedback parameters include cyclic rotor flap and lead-lag states, and body {{pitch and roll}} rotations. The use of position, rate, and acceleration feedback is studied for the various state variables. In particular, {{the influence of the}} closed loop feedback gain and phase on system stability is investigated. For the rotor/body configuration analyzed, rotor cyclic inplane motion and body roll-rate and roll-acceleration feedback can considerably augment system damping levels and eliminate ground resonance instabilities. Scheduling of the feedback state, phase, and gain with rotor rotation speed can be used to maximize the damping augmentation. This increase in lead-lag damping can be accomplished without altering any of the system modal frequencies. Investigating various rotor design parameters (effective hinge offset, blade precone, blade flap stiffness) indicates that active control for augmenting rotor/body damping will be particularly powerful for hingeless and bearingless rotor hubs...|$|R
40|$|Time {{accurate}} numerical simulations {{were performed}} using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow solver OVERFLOW for a heavy lift, slowed-rotor, compound helicopter configuration, tested at the NASA Langley 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel. The {{primary purpose of}} these simulations is to provide support {{for the development of}} a large field of view Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) flow measurement technique supported by the Subsonic Rotary Wing (SRW) project under the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics program. These simulations provide a better understanding of the <b>rotor</b> and <b>body</b> wake flows and helped to define PIV measurement locations as well as requirements for validation of flow solver codes. The large field PIV system can measure the three-dimensional velocity flow field in a 0. 914 m by 1. 83 m plane. PIV measurements were performed upstream and downstream of the vertical tail section and are compared to simulation results. The simulations are also used to better understand the tunnel wall and body/rotor support effects by comparing simulations with and without tunnel floor/ceiling walls and supports. Comparisons are also made to the experimental force and moment data for the <b>body</b> and <b>rotor...</b>|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to document the tip vortex geometries and interactional effects betwen a hovering <b>rotor</b> and a <b>body</b> representing a simplified helicopter fuselage. The wide-field shadowgraph technique was used to visualize the rotor tip vortices and to obtain quantitative information on the trajectories, with and without {{the presence of the}} body. It was found that the effects of the body caused significant changes to both the radial contraction and axial displacements of the tip vortices compared to the isolated case. Direct impingement of the tip vortices on the body surface was also observed, and found to cause large local wake deformations. The rotor performance was significantly affected by the body, producing a higher figure of merit relative to the isolated case...|$|R

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests are}} {{reported}} in which the unsteady aerodynamic interactions between rotor wake and a body are examined for the case of low-speed flight. A wide-field shadowgraph is employed to visualize the rotor-tip vortices during the interactions, and the pressure signatures are measured and correlated with wake trajectories. Consideration is given to unsteady potential-flow theory to estimate the pressure loads from measured wake trajectories. The pressure signatures are very different upstream of, downstream of, and at the wake-impingement point, at which point large transient loads are transferred to the <b>body.</b> <b>Rotor</b> wake is characterized, and the wake filaments impinge on the advancing {{side of the body}} first. The pressure signatures present a complex and varying range of patterns, but it is determined that vortex surface interactions can be modeled using potential-flow analysis...|$|R
