40|$|The {{validity}} of the commonly held view that Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) diseases are rare in Asia is challenged in this article by a thorough {{analysis of the data}} available, often in languages other than English. The entire spectrum of Hib disease, not only meningitis, was taken into account, and over 100 reports from 25 countries were explored. Hib was the leading agent among nontuberculous childhood meningitis cases in two-thirds of 48 studies from 22 countries. Data from six countries showed that all the classical manifestations of invasive Hib diseases are also found in Asia, except epiglottitis, which was nearly absent. In Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China Hib disease is rare, but otherwise the incidences seemed not to deviate much from those in Europe until recently, around 25 per 100, 000 for meningitis and at least 40 per 100, 000 per year for the classical Hib manifestations combined at age 0 - 4 years. In total, more than 200, 000 cases of Hib disease are estimated to occur annually in Asia. Because nonbacteraemic Hib pneumonia <b>remains</b> mostly <b>undetected,</b> the total burden is probably significantly greater.

40|$|Despite its {{widespread}} presence among grazing ruminants, dicrocoeliosis, {{also known}} as "small liver fluke" disease, is poorly known and often underestimated by researchers and practitioners in many countries. This is primarily due to the multiple parasitic infections which affect ruminant livestock and mask the pathology of dicrocoeliosis, to the difficulties in diagnosing it with coprological techniques and, finally, to the few effective drugs found. Furthermore, the biological cycle of Dicrocoelium, which requires a snail and an ant as intermediate hosts, and {{the high number of}} ecological and epidemiological variables affecting the disease make it difficult to set up experimental designs to study dicrocoeliosis. In the past 50 years, many aspects of this disease have been broadly investigated (aetiology, life cycle, diffusion, epidemiology, pathogenesis and immunology) but its diagnosis and treatment still remain moot issues. Dicrocoeliosis often <b>remains</b> clinically <b>undetected</b> and its diagnosis is mostly based on adult dicrocoelia recovered in the liver post mortem or on egg detected at coprological examination.

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{believed}} to arise from mutant stem cells in colonic crypts that undergo a well-characterized progression involving benign adenoma, the precursor to invasive carcinoma. Although a number of (epi) genetic events {{have been identified as}} drivers of this process, {{little is known about the}} dynamics involved in the stage-wise progression from the first appearance of an adenoma to its ultimate conversion to malignant cancer. By the time adenomas become endoscopically detectable (i. e., are in the range of 1 – 2 mm in diameter), adenomas are already comprised of hundreds of thousands of cells and may have been in existence for several years if not decades. Thus, a large fraction of adenomas may actually remain undetected during endoscopic screening and, at least in principle, could give rise to cancer before they are detected. It is therefore of importance to establish what fraction of adenomas is detectable, both as a function of when the colon is screened for neoplasia and as a function of the achievable detection limit. To this end, we have derived mathematical expressions for the detectable adenoma number and size distributions based on a recently developed stochastic model of CRC. Our results and illustrations using these expressions suggest (1) that screening efficacy is critically dependent on the detection threshold and implicit knowledge of the relevant stem cell fraction in adenomas, (2) that a large fraction of non-extinct adenomas <b>remains</b> likely <b>undetected</b> assuming plausible detection thresholds and cell division rates, and (3), under a realistic description of adenoma initiation, growth and progression to CRC, the empirical prevalenc...|$|R

Now that we know those genes don't exist in humans we can target them to control disease."

50|$|Insulin {{resistance}} (IR) is {{a pathological}} {{condition in which}} cells fail to respond normally to the hormone insulin. The body produces insulin when glucose starts to be released into the bloodstream from the digestion of carbohydrates in the diet. Normally this insulin response triggers glucose being taken into body cells, {{to be used for}} energy, and inhibits the body from using fat for energy. The concentration of glucose in the blood decreases as a result, staying within the normal range even when a large amount of carbohydrates is consumed. When the body produces insulin under conditions of insulin resistance, the cells are resistant to the insulin and are unable to use it as effectively, leading to high blood sugar. Beta cells in the pancreas subsequently increase their production of insulin, further contributing to a high blood insulin level. This often <b>remains</b> <b>undetected</b> and can {{contribute to the development of}} type 2 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults. Although this type of chronic insulin resistance is harmful, during acute illness it is actually a well-evolved protective mechanism. Recent investigations have revealed that insulin resistance helps to conserve the brain's glucose supply by preventing muscles from taking up excessive glucose. In theory, insulin resistance should even be strengthened under harsh metabolic conditions such as pregnancy, during which the expanding fetal brain demands more glucose.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{proliferation}} of malware {{attacks on the}} Internet, understanding these malicious behaviors plays {{a critical role in}} crafting effective defense. Advanced malware analysis relies on virtualization or emulation technology to run samples in a confined environment, and to analyze malicious activities by instrumenting code execution. However, virtual ma-chines and emulators inevitably create artifacts in the execution environment, making these approaches vulnerable to detection or subversion. In this paper, we present MALT, a debugging frame-work that employs System Management Mode, a CPU mode in the x 86 architecture, to transparently study armored malware. MALT does not depend on virtualization or emulation and thus is immune to threats targeting such environments. Our approach reduces the attack surface at the software level, and advances state-of-the-art debugging transparency. MALT embodies various debugging functions, including register/memory accesses, break-points, and four stepping modes. We implemented a prototype of MALT on two physical machines, and we conducted experiments by testing an array of existing anti-virtualization, anti-emulation, and packing techniques against MALT.

The hostile {{nature of these}} environments, however, significantly {{increases the likelihood of}} failures in the robots 2 ̆ 7 subsystems. The difficulty and delay in the detection and subsequent correction of these faults makes the post-fault performance of the robots particularly important. An approach to dealing with failures is to build failure-tolerant manipulators, where the damaged system can be operated with minimal performance degradation. Though there has been considerable work in the area of failure tolerance, existing methods rely on effective failure detection.

Tools for identifying failure-tolerant regions of a manipulator 2 ̆ 7 s workspace are developed so that task completion can be guaranteed with common control schemes even if failures remain undetected.

The following original results are presented in the context of both of these models: • an analytic expression for the low-frequency temperature is found for a hyperbolic tangent background profile, valid in the entire parameter space; it is well-known that the spectrum is approximately thermal at low frequencies, but a universally valid expression for the corresponding temperature is an original development; • an analytic expression for the spectrum, valid over almost the entire frequency range, when the velocity profile parameters lie in the regime where the low-frequency temperature is given by the Hawking prediction; previous work has focused on the low-frequency thermal spectrum and the characterization of the deviations from thermality, rather than a single analytic expression; and • a new unexplored regime where no group-velocity horizon exists is examined; the Hawking spectra are found to be non-zero here, but also highly non-thermal, and are found, in the limit of small deviations, to vary with the square of the maximum deviation; the analytic expression for the case with a horizon is found to carry over to this new regime, with appropriate modifications. Furthermore, the thesis examines the results of a classical frequency-shifting experiment in the context of fibre-optical horizons. The theory of this process is presented for both a constant-velocity and a constantly-decelerating pulse, the latter case taking account of the Raman effect. The resulting spectra are at least qualititively explained, but there is a discrepancy between theory and experiment that has not yet been accounted for.
