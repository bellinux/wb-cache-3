50|$|Self-tapping screws {{are widely}} used for driving into sheet metal or {{plastics}} and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into a pre-pierced hole. Self-drilling screws have some ability to cut a thread, as for a tap. Others work not by cutting, but rather by <b>roll-forming</b> the thread, pushing excess material {{out of the way}} by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed.|$|E
50|$|Another {{failure mode}} {{that may occur}} without any tearing is ductile {{fracture}} after plastic deformation (ductility). This may occur {{as a result of}} bending or shear deformation (inplane or through the thickness). The failure mechanism may be due to void nucleation and expansion on a microscopic level. Microcracks and subsequent macrocracks may appear when deformation of the material between the voids has exceeded the limit. Extensive research has focused in recent years on understanding and modeling ductile fracture. The approach has been to identify ductile forming limits using various small-scale tests that show different strain ratios or stress triaxialities. An effective measure of this type of forming limit is the minimum radius in <b>roll-forming</b> applications (half the sheet thickness for materials with good and three times the sheet thickness for materials with low formability).|$|E

40|$|When {{non-linear}} {{finite element}} analysis (FEA) of cold-formed thin-walled steel sections subject to compression is carried out, an initial perturbation must be introduced in the model in order to trigger the failure due to instability. The most usual way is to introduce an equivalent initial imperfection in the model (conventional models) that includes the effects of geometric imperfections and residual stresses due to the <b>roll-forming</b> manufacturing process, possible loading eccentricity, etc. It is thought that results would be more accurate if the actual measured geometric imperfections and the actual residual stresses induced from manufacturing were introduced.

40|$|The {{conventional}} design of forming rolls depends {{heavily on the}} individual skill of roll designers {{which is based on}} intuition and knowledge gained from previous work. Roll design is normally a trial an error procedure, however with the progress of computer technology, CAD/CAM systems for the cold <b>roll-forming</b> industry have been developed. Generally, however, these CAD systems can only provide a flower pattern based on the knowledge obtained from previously successful flower patterns. In the production of ERW (Electric Resistance Welded) tube and pipe, the need for a theoretical simulation of the <b>roll-forming</b> process, which can not only predict the occurrence of the edge buckling but also obtain the optimum forming condition, has been recognised. A new simulation system named "CADFORM" has been devised that can carry out the consistent forming simulation for this tube-making process. The CADFORM system applied an elastic-plastic stress-strain analysis and evaluate edge buckling by using a simplified model of the forming process. The results can also be visualised graphically. The calculated longitudinal strain is obtained by considering the deformation of lateral elements and takes into account the reduction in strains due to the fin-pass roll. These calculated strains correspond quite well with the experimental results. Using the calculated strains, the stresses in the strip can be estimated. The addition of the fin-pass roll reduction significantly reduces the longitudinal compressive stress and therefore effectively suppresses edge buckling. If the calculated longitudinal stress is controlled, by altering the forming flower pattern so it does not exceed the buckling stress within the material, then the occurrence of edge buckling can be avoided. CADFORM predicts the occurrence of edge buckling of the strip in tube-making and uses this information to suggest an appropriate flower pattern and forming conditions which will suppress the occurrence of the edge buckling...|$|E

The effect of ellipse preforming on the cross-sectional {{size of the}} square steel pipe was investigated by experiment and three-dimensional finite element simulation. When designing a <b>roll-forming</b> machine for a square steel pipe, {{the diameter of the}} paired top and bottom rolls is usually set larger than that of the side roll pair, thereby avoiding interference between the roll axes driven by electric motors.

A square pipe was formed from a preformed elliptical pipe to make the width and height of the corner part equal. As a result of ellipse preforming, the peripheral length of a square product increases {{and the size of the}} corner part of that product decreases.
