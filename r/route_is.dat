50|$|In Dutch {{towns and}} cities, many bike-only <b>routes</b> <b>are</b> not {{alongside}} the roadway, {{nor do they}} run close-by and parallel to major car routes: rather, cycle <b>routes</b> <b>are</b> often completely separate from motor vehicle routes. In many cases, dedicated bike <b>routes</b> <b>are</b> far more direct than the local car <b>routes</b> <b>are</b> to common destinations, such as town centres. This complete separation of bicycle routes from motor vehicle <b>routes</b> <b>is</b> called the unravelling of modes and is an important feature of modern Dutch urban design and traffic management.|$|R
