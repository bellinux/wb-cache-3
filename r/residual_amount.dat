5|$|On September 11, 2009, Hardy {{was arrested}} on charges of {{trafficking}} in controlled prescription pills and possession of anabolic steroids, after a search of his house yielded 262 Vicodin prescription pills, 180 Soma prescription pills, 555 milliliters of anabolic steroids, a <b>residual</b> <b>amount</b> of powder cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Over a year later, the district attorney announced that Hardy would plead guilty to the charges. On September 8, 2011, Hardy was sentenced to ten days in jail, 30 months of probation, and a fine of $100,000. Hardy served his jail sentence from October 3 to 13, 2011.|$|E

40|$|Some Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains produce {{extracellular}} cellulose, a long polymer of glucose with β- 1 - 4 glycosidic bonds. This study {{evaluated the}} efficacies of selected enzymatic and chemical treatments in inactivating STEC and degrading/removing the cellulose on STEC surfaces. Six cellulose-producing STEC strains {{were treated with}} cellulase (0. 51 to 3. 83 U/ 15 ml), acetic and lactic acids (2 and 4 %), {{as well as an}} acidic and alkaline sanitizer (manufacturers' recommended concentrations) under appropriate conditions. Following each treatment, <b>residual</b> <b>amounts</b> of cellulose and surviving populations of STEC were determined. Treatments with acetic and lactic acids significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced the populations of STEC, and those with lactic acid also significantly decreased the amounts of cellulose on STEC. The <b>residual</b> <b>amounts</b> of cellulose on STEC positively correlated to the surviving populations of STEC after the treatments with the organic acids (r = 0. 64 to 0. 94), and the significance of the correlations ranged from 83 to 99 %. Treatments with cellulase and the sanitizers both degraded cellulose. However, treatments with cellulase had no influence on the fate of STEC, and those with the sanitizers reduced STEC cell populations to undetectable levels. Thus, the correlations between the <b>residual</b> <b>amounts</b> of cellulose and the surviving populations of STEC caused by these two treatments were not observed. The results suggest that the selected enzymatic and chemical agents degraded and removed the cellulose on STEC surfaces, and the treatments with organic acids and sanitizers also inactivated STEC cells. The amounts of cellulose produced by STEC strains appear to affect their susceptibilities to certain sanitizing treatments...|$|R

50|$|Par. 105. The {{concept of}} capital {{maintenance}} {{is concerned with}} how an entity defines the capital that it seeks to maintain. It provides the linkage between the concepts of capital and the concepts of profit because it provides the point of reference by which profit is measured; it {{is a prerequisite for}} distinguishing between an entity's return on capital and its return of capital; only inflows of assets in excess of amounts needed to maintain capital may be regarded as profit and therefore as a return on capital. Hence, profit is the <b>residual</b> <b>amount</b> that remains after expenses (including capital maintenance adjustments, where appropriate) have been deducted from income.

50|$|Although banned for use {{in foods}} by many countries, {{potassium}} bromate is typically used in the United States as a flour improver (E number E924). It acts to strengthen the dough and to allow higher rising. It is an oxidizing agent, and under the right conditions will be completely used up in the baking bread. However, if too much is added, or if the bread is not baked long enough or not at a high enough temperature, then a <b>residual</b> <b>amount</b> will remain, which may be harmful if consumed. Potassium bromate might also {{be used in the}} production of malt barley, for which application the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prescribed certain safety conditions, including labeling standards for the finished malt barley product. It is a very powerful oxidizer (E° = 1.5 volts, comparable to potassium permanganate).|$|E
5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed steel strip {{is superior to}} that of acid pickled steel strip primarily because acid pickling imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not. This penalty {{is a result of}} chemical reactions that occur after acid pickling and serve as a catalyst for oxidation. The primary pickling agent is hydrochloric acid (HCl). Although the steel strip is thoroughly rinsed with clean water after immersion in the HCl bath, some <b>residual</b> <b>amount</b> of chlorine (Cl) remains {{on the surface of the}} strip. Chlorine reacts very readily with oxygen to form chlorides, so the free Cl acts as something of a [...] "magnet" [...] for oxygen. This mechanism makes acid-pickled steel more prone to picking up oxygen, whereas there is no comparable mechanism at work with EPS mechanical pickling.|$|E

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{increase in}} cancer prevalence {{has led to}} a substantial cost rising in Medical Oncology. Of particular importance are highly expensive drugs used to treat various types of cancers in developing countries like Albania. Hence, pharmacoeconomics may {{play an important role in}} reducing the drug wastage and financial burden placed on patients, family and society in general; of course, without adversely impacting patient’s health outcomes. Our aim was to calculate cost-savings effect of a centralized unit, which allows <b>residual</b> <b>amounts</b> of unused drugs to be reused by patients whose treatments are elaborated in the same working day. We calculated in a comprehensive manner the number of saved vials (flasks) for seven drugs generated from <b>residual</b> <b>amounts</b> of the same working day and, converted them into cost-saving monetary value. We did not take into account prescribed drug dosages that fitted exactly with doses contained in a vial. Over a six month period, there were: a total of 6558 prescriptions for a total of 1180 patients, a total of 1524 saved vials and, a total cost-saving of 134, 348 (•). The saved value represents 6. 2 percent of the cytostatic drugs budget for 2005. Our experience confirms the economic benefit of waste reduction and cost-savings effect due to a centralized unit of anticancer drug processing. The centralized unit increases also the drug traceability from preparation to patient...|$|R
30|$|Leaching by {{thiosulfates}} is more advantageous technology (Muir and Aylmore 2005; Aylmore 2005): it is {{less expensive}} and more environment friendly. The low cost of the reagents and no such a big need in the site decontamination make thiosulfate leaching attractive from an economical point of view. The difficulty limiting application of the thiosulfate (S 2 O 32 -) or polythionate (SxO 62 -) leaching lies in their industrial production. Use of well-known reactions of polythionates production with halogens may lead i) to increase of the cost and ii) to degradation of equipment due to <b>residual</b> <b>amounts</b> of the halogens.|$|R
