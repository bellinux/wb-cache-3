25|$|Styles {{debuted in}} Ring of Honor (ROH) at its third show, 2002's A Night of Appreciation, and {{quickly became a}} main eventer (e.g., {{performing}} in main event matches against Low Ki for the ROH World Championship at Honor Invades Boston). After failing to win the title, {{he became the first}} holder of the Number One Contender's Trophy, which was viewed within the promotion as a secondary championship at the time. At the One Year Anniversary Show in February 2003, Styles competed against Low Ki and Paul London in a three-way match, which was won by London. After this, Styles competed by himself and defeated The Backseat Boyz (Johnny Kashmere and Trent Acid), The Carnage Crew (HC Loc and Tony DeVito), and The S.A.T. (Joel and Jose Maximo), to receive a title shot for the ROH Tag Team Championship. He chose Amazing Red as his partner, and the two defeated The Prophecy (Christopher Daniels and Xavier) to win the championship. Styles then feuded with London, who was upset that he had chosen Red as his partner, wrestling to a draw at Night of the Grudges. Styles and Red then defeated The Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark Briscoe) on three separate occasions, but lost to The Prophecy. At Wrath of the Racket, Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff put <b>Red</b> <b>out</b> of action and Styles picked Homicide as his replacement partner. Styles and Homicide beat The Prophecy, but Styles had to vacate the title due to Red being sidelined by a legitimate injury.|$|E
