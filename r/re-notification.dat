40|$|In {{a climate}} of public sector austerity, the demand for {{accurate}} information about disease epidemiology rises as health program managers try to align spending to health needs. A policy of case <b>re-notification</b> to improve HIV information quality resulted in a nine-fold {{increase in the number}} of case reports received in 2013 by the Portuguese HIV surveillance office. We used value stream mapping to introduce improvements to data processing practices, identify and reduce waste. Two cycles of improvement were trialled. Before intervention, processing time was nine minutes and 28 seconds (95 %CI 8 : 53 - 10 : 58) per report. Two months post intervention, it was six minutes and 34 seconds (95 % CI 6 : 25 - 6 : 43). One year after the start of the project, processing time was five minutes and 20 seconds (95 % CI 1 : 46 - 8 : 52) ...|$|E
40|$|Developing and {{implementing}} a meaningful safety {{plan is a}} collaborative process undertaken by the worker and family together to address immediate safety issues and set goals for the intervention. This resource guide describes practical tips to assist family support workers develop and implement a safety plan with their clients, and draws upon the principles from the Signs of Safety practice framework (Department for Child Protection, 2011; Turnell, 2012) and evidence based practices for working with families at risk of abuse and neglect (De Panfillis, 2006). Developing a meaningful safety plan is a collaborative process undertaken by the family and worker together and focuses on a fundamental question: what needs to happen to ensure the children will be safe in their own family? The goal of intensive home-based support programs for vulnerable high-risk families is ensuring that children stay safe and remain within their family. Intensive home based family support programs aim to reduce <b>re-notification</b> or re-substantiation risk, close the case without court involvement, prevent the removal of children into alternative care, or facilitate family reunification. These programs are usually of long term duration (up to 12 months) and require frequent weekly worker contact with families. This practice resource was written by Marie Iannos at the Australian Centre for Child Protection and Greg Antcliff at the Benevolent Society...|$|E
40|$|Background Information on {{recurrent}} tuberculosis {{can provide}} {{an indication of the}} effectiveness of tuberculosis services and identify patients who are most vulnerable. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the incidence of, and investigate risk factors for, recurrent episodes of tuberculosis in England and Wales. Methods Episodes of recurrent tuberculosis were identified among prospectively collected records of tuberculosis cases reported to the Health Protection Agency between 1998 and 2005. An episode of recurrent tuberculosis was defined as a re-notified case in the same patient after at least 12 months from the date of the initial notification. To estimate incidence, follow-up time was calculated for all cases until <b>re-notification</b> or censure. Multivariable Cox proportionate hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HR) for recurrence of tuberculosis and investigate the risk associated with clinical, demographic and microbiological factors. Results Five hundred and eighty-eight recurrent tuberculosis events were identified among 53 ? 214 cases reported between 1998 and 2005, a rate of 4. 1 (95 % CI 3. 8 to 4. 5) episodes per 1000 person years of follow-up. Factors independently associated with a greater risk of recurrent tuberculosis were HIV co-infection (HR 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 13 to 2. 38) and belonging to a South Asian ethnic group (HR 1. 54, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 1. 93). Conclusion Tuberculosis recurrence is uncommon in England and Wales despite the absence of a universal directly observed treatment policy. The identification of HIV co-infection as a risk factor for recurrent tuberculosis is consistent with findings elsewhere. The higher risk among South Asians, however, requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{co-occurrence of}} {{domestic}} violence (DV) and child maltreatment is high. Response to both problems has historically been via two different systems. However, child protection workers are increasingly {{asked to respond to}} this co-occurrence since research has identified that exposure to DV can negatively impact on children and that child maltreatment often co-occurs with DV. This study looks at child protection systems response to families affected by DV by using two research methods. First, a systematic review was conducted using research papers focusing on child protection workers response to families experiencing DV. Second, a critical discourse analysis of current Australian child protection policies was conducted. Findings from the systematic review show that child protection workers' response to abused mothers went from treating them as 'mad' in the 1980 s, to labelling them 'failure to protect' in the 1990 s and early 2000. These findings showed continued focus on abused mothers rather than on perpetrators of DV. Some contradictions were found around child removal data. However, important links were found between <b>re-notification</b> of children and subsequent removal. Findings from the Australian policy analysis revealed that most policies referred to DV as a child protection issue and used a feminist definition of DV. However, not all states had detailed guidelines on how to intervene safely and effectively with families affected by DV. Discussions and recommendations focus around the pressing need for more DV expertise within child protection systems. It also discusses the issue of responsibility placed on abused mothers while perpetrators of DV remain invisible. Finally, it discusses the response to children exposed to DV compared to the response to children exposed to DV who are also victim of direct child maltreatment. The key recommendations of this study are to have DV expertise within the child protection systems, to empower abused mothers rather than blaming them, which implies putting the responsibility back on the perpetrator of DV and to have resources and systems in place before responding to child exposure to DV as child maltreatment per se...|$|E
