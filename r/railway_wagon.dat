25|$|The firm of Galloway, Bowman and Glasgow {{became the}} repair {{facility}} for the fledgling Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{which had no}} workshops of its own. In 1830–31 the partnership constructed its first steam locomotive, the Manchester and by the following year had produced the Caledonian. They had wooden wheels on to which were shrunk welded metal tyres. The wheels were built by John Ashbury, who was later to become a notable engineer {{in his own right}} and the owner of the eponymous <b>railway</b> <b>wagon</b> works at Openshaw.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, a more {{powerful}} steam crane was ordered, {{to be capable of}} lifting 35tons and loading it directly onto a <b>railway</b> <b>wagon.</b> This was ordered from local makers Stothert & Pitt in 1875, although to the Fairbairn pattern. As for the later Fairbairn cranes, the original cell plate was changed to a design of a single flat plate stiffened by riveted T section ribs, rather than the original cellular structure. In August 1878 the crane had been completed and tested, at a cost of £3,600 for the machinery, plus the masonry foundations.|$|E
25|$|As Engström {{had a lot}} {{of earlier}} {{experience}} about rolling stock, his contribution on company's <b>railway</b> <b>wagon</b> building was significant. Wagon building balanced the wintertime pits in demand. The main customer was Finnish State Railways and the other customers were private railway operators with the standard 5 ft and narrow gauges. The company produced mainly freight wagons, but also some passenger coaches. The wagon production was ended in 1916, by when the company had built 1,980 closed and 963 open freight wagons and 80 coaches. This makes Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works the second biggest producer of railway wagons in Finland until then, right after the State Railways' Engineering Works.|$|E

25|$|Three {{guns were}} {{converted}} into railway guns 130/50 NRaut (Raut = rautatietykki, railway gun) in 1964 in the Hanko Coastal Artillery Battalion. The <b>railway</b> <b>wagon</b> {{was attached to}} rails with clamps and supported from the sides by wooden planks and support beams on track sides. In 1972 the three guns were converted back to static coastal guns and installed on Glosholma fort of the Suomenlinna Coastal Artillery Regiment. Three spare gun shields were used on 152/46 VLo guns installed in Sommarö fort on Replot and two other gun shields as armoured observation posts on the test fire sites at Puolustusvoimien Tutkimuskeskus (Finnish Defense Forces Research Facility) and Keuruun Pioneerivarikko (Keuruu Engineering Depot). In the 1980s it was attempted to convert the ammunition of the 130/50 N guns as sea target shells for 130 TK turret guns, but the project failed. The three guns in Glosholma were removed from service in the 1990s, but left on their positions. Additionally two spare guns were in storage. One gun was placed on display in Kuivasaari in 2005. The origin of the designation N (also Nl or NI) is uncertain, but most likely stood for Neuvostoliittolainen (from Soviet Union). The gun had a nickname Nikolajev in Finland.|$|E
25|$|During the Interim Peace Finland began {{constructing}} Salpa Line {{to fortify}} the new border to replace Mannerheim Line fortifications. Salpa Line artillery included six 152/45 C guns. In the Continuation War 152/45 C {{was involved in}} the fighting again and several guns were lost to barrel explosions or simply worn out. Some guns lost in the Winter War were recaptured bringing the total to 78 pieces in 1943. By the 1st of May 1944 the number had dropped to 60. During World War II 152/45 C guns were also used as anti-aircraft guns. The guns, designed originally before aircraft had been invented, were not especially effective in this role even after the modifications that had been done. Despite the limitations they were used against enemy bomber formations, especially in the defense of Helsinki and also against fighters. Finland also used 152/45 C guns as railway guns. The first trials with a 152/45 C gun mounted in a <b>railway</b> <b>wagon</b> in Finland was performed in 1924 and the gun was given the designation of 152/45 CRaut. Winter War mobilization plans called for two gun railway battery, but due to equipment problems only a single gun was available for most of the war. In Continuation War the battery was expanded to four guns. On 21.9.1941 the battery was renamed as 2nd railway battery after 1st railway battery had been formed from captured Soviet 180 mm railway guns. The battery was disbanded and the guns removed from the railway wagons after the war, but the plans for re-forming it remained in place. In 1962 there were three guns reserved for forming a railway artillery battery.|$|E

In his book Tramps Abroad, writer Mark Twain spoke of the break of gauge at Albury and changing trains: [...] "Now comes a singular thing, the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the unaccountable marvel that Australia can show, namely the break of gauge at Albury. Think of the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth".|$|E
50|$|The German State <b>Railway</b> <b>Wagon</b> Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband) or DWV was an {{association}} of the German state railways Länderbahnen founded in 1909.

The German State <b>Railway</b> <b>Wagon</b> Association could, unlike the Prussian State <b>Railway</b> <b>Wagon</b> Association, stipulate standard wagon designs {{for the whole of}} Germany. It developed a total of eleven different wagon types, the Verbandsbauart (literally: association type) or DWV wagons. In addition to entire goods wagons, types of bogie were also specified.|$|E
