Our theoretical analysis starts with <b>radiation</b> <b>damped</b> optical Bloch equations for all relevant 13 atomic levels. These master equations are generalized by considering technical phase noise of the driving lasers. From the Doppler broadened complex susceptibility we obtain the stationary output power from semiclassical laser theory. The finite overlap of the driving Gaussian laser beams defines an ellipsoidal inhomogeneous gain distribution. Therefore, we evaluate the intra-cavity field inside a ring laser self-consistently with Fourier optics.

40|$|A {{classical}} computation {{of gravitational}} bremsstrahlung in ultra-planckian collisions of massive point particles {{is presented in}} an arbitrary number d of toroidal or non-compact extra dimensions. Our method generalizes the post-linear formalism of General Relativity to the multidimensional case. The total emitted energy, {{as well as its}} angular and frequency distribution are discussed in detail. In terms of the gravitational radius r_S of the collision energy, the impact parameter b and the Lorentz factor in the CM frame, the leading order radiation efficiency in the Lab frame is shown to be of order (r_S/b) ^{ 3 (d+ 1) } gamma_{cm} for d= 0, 1 and of order (r_S/b) ^{ 3 (d+ 1) } gamma_{cm}^{ 2 d- 3 } for d> 1, up to a known d-dependent coefficient and a ln gamma_{cm} factor for d= 2, while the characteristic frequency of the radiation is gamma/b. The contribution of the low frequency part of the radiation (soft gravitons) to the total radiated energy is shown to be negligible for all values of d. The domain of validity of the classical result is discussed. Finally, it is shown that within the region of validity of our approach the efficiency can obtain unnatural values greater than one, which is interpreted to mean that the peripheral ultra-planckian collisions should be strongly <b>radiation</b> <b>damped.</b> Comment: 38 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

When radiation is important, the particles undergo <b>radiation</b> <b>damping</b> (which slowly decreases emittance turn after turn) and quantum excitation causing diffusion which leads to an equilibrium emittance.

40|$|A Lagrangian {{from which}} derive the third post-Newtonian (3 PN) {{equations}} of motion of compact binaries (neglecting the <b>radiation</b> reaction <b>damping)</b> is obtained. The 3 PN {{equations of motion}} were computed previously by Blanchet and Faye in harmonic coordinates. The Lagrangian depends on the harmonic-coordinate positions, velocities and accelerations of the two bodies. At the 3 PN order, the appearance of one undetermined physical parameter λ reflects an incompleteness of the point-mass regularization used when deriving the equations of motion. In addition the Lagrangian involves two unphysical (gauge-dependent) constants r'_ 1 and r'_ 2 parametrizing some logarithmic terms. The expressions of the ten Noetherian conserved quantities, associated with the invariance of the Lagrangian under the Poincaré group, are computed. By performing an infinitesimal "contact" transformation of the motion, we prove that the 3 PN harmonic-coordinate Lagrangian is physically equivalent to the 3 PN Arnowitt-Deser-Misner Hamiltonian obtained recently by Damour, Jaranowski and Schäfer.
