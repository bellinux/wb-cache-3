40|$|Abstract—The {{reliability}} of individual team members has a substantial and complex {{influence on the}} success of multirobot missions. When one robot fails, other robots must be retasked to complete the tasks that were assigned to the failed robot. This in turn increases the likelihood of these other robots failing, since they have more work to do. Existing multirobot task allocation systems consider robot failures only after the fact–by replanning after a failure occurs. We hypothesize that it should be important to consider <b>robot</b> <b>reliabilities</b> when generating an initial plan. In this paper we test this hypothesis {{in the context of the}} multirobot exploration problem. We take a simple exhaustive planner and compare the plan it chooses against the optimal plan that takes into account robot failures and the backup plans that occur after failure. Our results show that for this problem domain, making an initial plan without regards to individual <b>robot</b> <b>reliabilities</b> results in choosing a suboptimal plan most of the time, and that the difference in mission performance between the chosen plan and the optimal plan is usually substantial. In brief, in order to successfully plan we must ’plan to fail’. Index Terms—Multirobot systems, reliability, task allocation. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{considerable}} risk {{to human}} life associated with modern military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) and urban search and rescue (USAR) has led professionals in these domains to explore the use of robots to improve safety. Recent studies on mobile robot use in the field have shown a noticeable lack of reliability in real field conditions. Improving mobile <b>robot</b> <b>reliability</b> for applications such as USAR and MOUT requires {{an understanding of how}} mobile robots fail in field environments. This paper provides a detailed investigation of how ground-based mobile robots fail in the field. Forty-four representative examples of failures from 13 studies of mobile <b>robot</b> <b>reliability</b> in the USAR and MOUT domains are gathered, examined, and classified. A novel taxonomy sufficient to cover any failure a ground-based mobile robot may encounter in the field is presented. This classification scheme draws from established standards in the dependability computing [30] and human-computer interaction [40] communities, as well as recent work [6] in the robotics domain. Both physical failures (failures within the robotic system) and human failures are considered. Overall <b>robot</b> <b>reliability</b> in field environments is low with between 6 and 20 hours mean time between failures (MTBF), depending on the criteria used to determine if a failure has occurred. Common issues with existing platforms appear to be the following: unstable control systems, chassis and effectors designed and tested for a narrow range of environmental conditions, limited wireless communication range in urban environments, and insufficient wireless bandwidth. Effectors and the control system are the most common sources of physical failures. Of the human failures examined, slips are more common than mistakes.

AR allows us to exploit the sensor information of the sensors values and the system model to derive tests of the consistency of the sensor data.

40|$|During major {{disasters}} {{or other}} emergencies, Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) teams {{are responsible for}} extricating casualties safely from collapsed urban structures. The rescue work is dangerous due to possible further collapse, fire, dust or electricity hazards. Sometimes the necessary precautions and checks can last several hours before rescuers are safe to start the search for survivors. Remote controlled rescue robots provide the opportunity to support human rescuers to search the site for trapped casualties while they remain in a safe place. The research reported in this thesis aimed to understand how robot behaviour and interface design {{can be applied to}} utilise the benefits of robot autonomy and how to inform future human-robot collaborative systems. The data was analysed in the context of USAR missions when using semi-autonomous remote controlled robot systems. The research focussed on the influence of robot feedback, <b>robot</b> <b>reliability,</b> task complexity, and transparency. The influence of these factors on trust, workload, and performance was examined. The overall goal of the research was to make the life of rescuers safer and enhance their performance to help others in distress. Data obtained from the studies conducted for this thesis showed that semi-autonomous <b>robot</b> <b>reliability</b> is still the most dominant factor influencing trust, workload, and team performance. A robot with explanatory feedback was perceived as more competent, more efficient and less malfunctioning. The explanatory feedback was perceived as a clearer type of communication compared to concise robot feedback. Higher levels of robot transparency were perceived as more trustworthy. However, single items on the trust questionnaire were manipulated and further investigation is necessary. However, neither explanatory feedback from the robot nor robot transparency, increased team performance or mediated workload levels. Task complexity mainly influenced human-robot team performance and the participants’ control allocation strategy. Participants allowed the robot to find more targets and missed more robot errors in the high complexity conditions compared to the low task complexity conditions. Participants found more targets manually in the low complexity tasks. In addition, the research showed that recording the observed robot performance (the performance of the robot that was witnessed by the participant) can help to identify the cause of contradicting results: participants might not have noticed some of the robots mistakes and therefore they were not able to distinguish between the <b>robot</b> <b>reliability</b> levels. Furthermore, the research provided a foundation of knowledge regarding the real world application of USAR in the United Kingdom. This included collecting knowledge via an autoethnographic approach about working processes, command structures, currently used technical equipment, and attitudes of rescuers towards robots. Also, recommendations about robot behaviour and interface design were collected throughout the research. However, recommendations made in the thesis include consideration of the overall outcome (mission performance) and the perceived usefulness of the system in order to support the uptake of the technology in real world applications. In addition, autonomous features might not be appropriate in all USAR applications.

Failure type and frequency data were collected from 15 robots representing three manufacturers and seven models over a period of three years, in a variety of environments. Standard manufacturing measures for product reliability were used. The results show that overall MTBF and availability have improved since the previous analysis but are still low. The MTBF across all robot types was 24 hours and availability was 54 %. The control system was the most common source of failures (32 %), followed by the mechanical platform.

The reliability analysis of any system provides an understanding about the likelihood of failures occurring in the system/component and the increased insight about its inherent weakness.

However, much of this work leads to complex and nonintuitive analysis, which results in many techniques being impractical due to computational complexity or lack of appropriately complex models for the manipulator. In this paper, we will consider the application of notions and techniques from fuzzy logic, fault trees, and Markov modeling to robot fault tolerance. Fuzzy logic lends itself to quantitative reliability calculations in robotics. The crisp failure rates which are usually used are not actually known, while fuzzy logic, due to its ability to work with the actual approximate (fuzzy) failure rates available during the design process, avoids making too many unwarranted assumptions. Fault trees are a standard reliability tool that can easily assimilate fuzzy logic. Markov modeling allows evaluation of multiple failure modes simultaneously, and is thus an appropriate method of modeling failures in redundant robotic systems. However, no method of applying fuzzy logic to Markov models was known to the authors. This opens up the possibility of new techniques for reliability using Markov modeling and fuzzy logic techniques, which are developed in this paper.

30|$|From the literature, one {{can observe}} that {{approaches}} discussed so far for reliability analysis use probabilistic assumptions and crisp historical data {{which is in}} general limited and contains vagueness, uncertainty, etc. Practically, for system reliability analysis, constant failure rate model is being utilized, {{because most of the}} technical systems show this type of behavior, having some kind of uncertainties (Das 2008; Knezevic and Odoom 2001). Unfortunately, crisp historical data are not sufficient to account for the available uncertainties. Using vague, limited and imprecise data and information about any system such as a robotic system modeling analysis and optimization of the system’s overall performance are very difficult. Thus, the issue of <b>robot</b> <b>reliability</b> is related to uncertainty, and in lack of proper knowledge, it is difficult to analyze and predict its behavior. In addition, a system analyst is unable to suggest any necessary action to optimize the performance of a robotic system by enhancing its reliability. Fuzzy sets as suggested by many researchers are used to account for the uncertainties involved in the available information, i.e., in the extracted data (Chen 1994; Cai 1996; Bai and Asgarpoor 1996). In view of above limitations and the applicability of fuzzy set theory for quantifying involved uncertainties, Sharma et al. (2008) analyzed the performance of a complex robotic system using fuzzy lambda–tau(FLT) methodology. In FLT, traditional lambda–tau method (Mishra 1992) is coupled with fuzzy set theory and α-cut interval arithmetic operations to analyze fuzzy reliability of any repairable system, and has been employed to analyze the fuzzy reliability of various industrial systems including butter–oil, paper, and fertilizer manufacturing plants, waste clean up manipulator etc (Komal et al. 2009, 2010; Kumar et al. 2012). It is noticed that FLT gives wide spreads for computed fuzzy reliability parameters of any complex repairable system with numerous components.|$|E

However, it was not know {{the extent to which}} humans would trust them. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify factors that influence trust in domestic service robots across a range of users with different capabilities and experience levels. Twelve younger adults (aged 18 - 28) and 24 older adults (12 low technology users and 12 high technology users) aged 65 - 75 participated in a structured interview, card-sorting task, and several questionnaires. Most participants had heard about or seen robots, but indicated they had little experience with them. However, most had positive opinions about robots and indicated they would trust a robot to assist with tasks in their homes, though it was dependent on the task. Before making a decision to trust a robot, participants wanted to know a lot of information about the robot such <b>robot</b> <b>reliability,</b> capabilities, and limitations. When asked to select their trust preference for human versus robot assistance for specific tasks, participants had preferences for both human and robot assistance, although it was dependent on the task. Many participants defined trust in robots similar to definitions of trust in automation (Ezer, 2008; Jian et al., 2000). Additionally, they had high rates of selection for adjectives used to describe trust in automation and also selected some adjectives used to describe trust in humans when asked to select characteristics they most associated with trustworthy and untrustworthy robots. Overall, there were some differences between age and technology experience groups, but there were far more similarities. By carefully considering user needs, robot designers can develop robots that have the potential to be adopted by a wide range of people. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|NASA has {{expressed}} interest in using modular self-repairable robotic teams for the exploration and colonization of Mars. One of the reasons often given for using repairable <b>robots</b> is increased <b>reliability.</b> Analytical tools are needed for estimating the reliability of robotic missions {{in order to determine}} if this reasoning is correct, and for what types of missions. In this paper we present the first method for analytically predicting the probability of mission completion for teams of repairable mobile robots. We then apply this method to compare the reliability of repairable and non-repairable robot teams for an example mission scenario. Our results show that for this simple mission, with reasonable assumptions regarding costs, teams of repairable robots with spare components are superior to teams with spare non-repairable robots...|$|R
40|$|With {{science fiction}} of yore being reality {{recently}} with self-driving cars, wearable computers and autonomous <b>robots,</b> software <b>reliability</b> is growing increasingly important. A critical pre-requisite {{to ensure the}} software that controls such systems is correct is the availability of precise specifications that describe a program 2 ̆ 7 s intended behaviors. Generating these specifications manually is a challenging, often unsuccessful, exercise; unfortunately, existing static analysis techniques often produce poor quality specifications that are ineffective in aiding program verification tasks. ^ In this dissertation, we present a recent line of work on automated synthesis of specifications that overcome many of the deficiencies that plague existing specification inference methods. Our main contribution is a formulation of the problem as a sample driven one, in which specifications, represented as terms in a decidable refinement type representation, are discovered from observing a program 2 ̆ 7 s sample runs in terms of either program execution paths or input-output values, and automatically verified {{through the use of}} expressive refinement type systems. ^ Our approach is realized as a series of inductive synthesis frameworks, which use various logic-based or classification-based learning algorithms to provide sound and precise machine-checked specifications. Experimental results indicate that the learning algorithms are both efficient and effective, capable of automatically producing sophisticated specifications in nontrivial hypothesis domains over a range of complex real-world programs, going well beyond the capabilities of existing solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) {{have been}} {{operating}} on Mars {{for more than}} three years. The extremely high reliability demonstrated by these rovers is a great success story in robotic design. This reliability comes at a high cost, however, both in the initial cost of developing the rovers and in the ongoing operational costs for their mission extensions. If it were possible to design rovers with reliability more in line with their mission requirements (in the case of MER, 90 days), considerable cost reductions could be achieved. This will be even more important for future planetary robotic missions due to greatly increased mission durations. In this paper we present an overview of our ongoing {{research in the area of}} predicting <b>robot</b> mission <b>reliability,</b> and we show how a mission designer can trade off reliability against costs in order to find an optimal reliability target for a given robotic mission. Our results show that for a given mission there is an optimal reliability range with respect to cost and that having rovers with reliability that is too low or too high is suboptimal from an economic standpoint. This suggests that a better cost-reliability tradeoff can be obtained by 2 ̆ 2 planning to fail 2 ̆ 2 by designing rovers which have lower reliability than current legacy designs...|$|R
