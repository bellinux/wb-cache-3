40|$|We {{investigate}} whether recoveries following normal <b>recessions</b> differ from recoveries following <b>recessions</b> {{that are associated}} with either banking crises or housing crises. Using a parametric panel framework that allows for a bounce-back in the level of output during the recovery, we find that normal <b>recessions</b> are followed by strong recoveries in advanced economies. This bounce-back is absent following <b>recessions</b> associated with banking crises and housing crises. Consequently, the permanent output losses of <b>recessions</b> associated with banking crises and housing crises are considerably larger than those of normal <b>recessions...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, <b>recessions</b> {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century <b>recessions</b> is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date <b>recessions</b> before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. <b>recessions</b> back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions.

Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global <b>recession.</b> A copy was sent to the newly elected President Franklin D.

The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to Robert Skidelsky, helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 London Economic Conference opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.|$|E

The findings are found to be robust across B 2 B and B 2 C industries, different time periods, and firms which vary on the proportion of their global revenue from U. S. sales.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>recessions</b> and productivity {{growth has been}} the focus of an important body of theoretical and empirical research in the last two decades. We contribute to this literature by presenting new evidence on the evolution of productivity in the aftermath of <b>recessions.</b> Our method allows us to distinguish between frontier and (in-) efficiency effects of <b>recessions.</b> We present international evidence for a panel of 70 countries for the 1960 - 2000 period. Our results reveal that the average cumulative impact of <b>recessions</b> on productivity up to four years after its end is negative and significant. This, however, results from a mixture of mechanisms. The level of frontier production increases, but the rate of technical progress decreases, leading to a fall in frontier production. Efficiency also falls, lending support for the idea that <b>recessions</b> tend to reduce, rather than increase, economic restructuring. Long and deep <b>recessions</b> are also shown to have distinctive impacts on productivity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recessions</b> often {{happen after}} periods of rapid {{accumulation}} of houses, consumer durables and business capital. This observation {{has led some}} economists, most notably Friedrich Hayek, to conclude that <b>recessions</b> often reflect periods of needed liquidation resulting from past over-investment. According to the main proponents of this view, government spending or {{any other form of}} aggregate demand policy should not be used to mitigate such a liquidation process, as doing so would simply result in a needed adjustment being postponed. In contrast, ever since the work of Keynes, many economists have viewed <b>recessions</b> as periods of deficient demand that should be countered by activist fiscal policy. In this paper we reexamine the liquidation perspective of <b>recessions</b> in a setup where prices are flexible but where not all trades are coordinated by centralized markets. The model illustrates why liquidations likely cause <b>recessions</b> characterized by deficient aggregate demand and accordingly suggests that Keynes' and Hayek's views of <b>recessions</b> may be closely linked. In our framework, interventions aimed at stimulating aggregate demand face a trade-off whereby current stimulus postpones the adjustment process and therefore prolongs the <b>recessions,</b> but where some stimulative policies may nevertheless remain desirable...|$|R

Inclusion of exogenous variables means that the observed interdependence between banking crises and <b>recessions</b> disappears - indicating that the observed interdependence is a result of easily observable common causes rather than unobserved links...|$|R
