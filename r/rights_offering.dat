UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company.

Developing a nested logit model and employing a new, internationally unique, dataset (the population of SEOs by Swedish public firms, 1986 - 1999), we find strong evidence supporting three explanations for the choice between <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> and private placements: (i) Firms controlled by large family owners choose uninsured <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> to avoid control threats. (ii) Private placements and, to a lesser degree, underwritten <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> are chosen by potentially undervalued firms to reduce adverse selection costs. (iii) Private placements are also used to reduce contracting costs in newly established product market relationships...|$|R

For this reason, stock-exchange rules don't require that shareholders approve <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> {{if the company}} offers at least 20% of outstanding shares at a discount.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to find whether the subscription rights trade at their fundamental values in Finnish <b>rights</b> <b>offerings.</b> The secondary objectives of the study are to find whether the stock price of the issuing firm correctly adjusts to the de-attachment of the rights on ex-rights day; if there is an announcement date effect on the date of announcement; and how large is the discount to theoretical ex-rights price used in pricing of the offerings. DATA: The data on <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> and historical share prices is sourced from Nasdaq OMXH Stock Exchange. The sample of offerings is downloaded with use of Bloomberg Professional. The sample consists of all executed <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> in OMX Helsinki and its predecessor Helsinki Stock Exchange during time period 2003 - 2013. The size of the sample is 45 <b>rights</b> <b>offerings.</b> Characteristics of the <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> are picked from respective stock exchange announcements. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The study finds that on average the subscription prices trade at 20, 4 percent discount to their fundamental values when measured by daily closing prices. Other findings include the stock prices to underreact to the de-attachment of the rights; the abnormal return on the announcement date to equal - 1, 3 percent; and the discount to theoretical ex-rights price to equal 36, 0 percent. The study does not argue that abnormal gains can be experienced in practice by participating in <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> but implies that it could be highly possible...|$|R

This research investigates the market reaction to both “unsweetened ” and “sweetened ” <b>rights</b> <b>offerings</b> (with simultaneous distribution of bonus shares) during the announcement and subscription periods, and tests three hypotheses – the signaling, the issue price irrelevance and the improved liquidity (enhanced investor base) hypotheses.

However, for “sweetened ” <b>rights</b> <b>offerings,</b> a positive market reaction is detected supporting the sweetener effect of bonus issues.
