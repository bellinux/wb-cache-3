There, oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte, completing the circuit.

2500|$|Challenges {{exist in}} SOFC systems {{due to their}} high {{operating}} temperatures. One such challenge {{is the potential for}} carbon dust to build up on the anode, which slows down the internal <b>reforming</b> <b>process.</b> Research to address this [...] "carbon coking" [...] issue at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based cermet (heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal) can reduce coking and the loss of performance. Another disadvantage of SOFC systems is slow start-up time, making SOFCs less useful for mobile applications. Despite these disadvantages, a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum, thereby reducing cost. Additionally, waste heat from SOFC systems may be captured and reused, increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80%–85%.|$|E
2500|$|MCFCs hold several {{advantages}} over other fuel cell technologies, including their resistance to impurities. They are not prone to [...] "carbon coking", {{which refers to}} carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel <b>reforming</b> <b>process.</b> Therefore, carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system. The Department of Energy claims that coal, itself, might even be a fuel option in the future, assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen. MCFCs also have relatively high efficiencies. They can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50%, considerably higher than the 37–42% efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. Efficiencies can {{be as high as}} 65% when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine, and 85% if heat is captured and used in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Romm, {{the author}} of The Hype About Hydrogen (2005), devoted two {{articles}} in 2014 to updating his critique {{of the use of}} fuel cells in cars. He stated that FCVs still had not overcome the following issues: high cost of the vehicles, high fueling cost, and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure. [...] "It would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades." [...] Most importantly, he said, [...] "FCVs aren't green" [...] because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced, as 95% of it is, using the steam <b>reforming</b> <b>process.</b> He concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an FCV fleet [...] "either now or in the future." [...] Greentech Media's analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014. In 2015, Clean Technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. So did Car Throttle.

This dissertation explores {{the extent to which}} women have participated in the law <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in Malawi compared to their male counterparts in view of the right to equality and non-discrimination as well as the right to dignity which recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of each human being enshrined under sections 19 and 20 of the Constitution and other international human rights instruments. The writer briefly discusses the establishment of the Commission, its mandate and functions, the law <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> to contextualize the study and contemporary debates on law reform give insights into what law reform is about and ought to be. Using methodologies such as the Grounded theory and the dung beetle within the Grounded theory, the Womenâ€™s Law Approach, sex and gender analysis, actors and structures and the human rights approach the study reveals the interplay of gender in the law <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> Data collection methods including FGD, key informants, in-depth interviews, participant observations and desk research were used. She shows law reformsâ€™ failure to tap from womenâ€™s lived realities and experience in order to adequately address womenâ€™s issues and concerns throughout the law <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> The study finds that more men than women participate in the law <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> Participation in the law <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> is gendered since the majority of law reform programmes are dominated by men while only six of them are dominated by women. Also, finds that there are inadequate guidelines to ensure gender equality. Further, that gender neutral laws discriminates against women as it uses the male norm to which women must conform to, for them to benefit from the laws. It reveals dichotomies in participation in the law <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> It unearths hidden, visible and invisible powers that have an effect on womenâ€™s participation as well as identify barriers to women participation in the law reform process.,Malawi Law Commission and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD...|$|R

40|$|Owing to {{the high}} energy content of {{hydrogen}} {{and the possibility of}} converting this energy in fuel cell devices into electric power without any pollutant emissions, hydrogen has grown {{to be one of the}} most useful sources of energy, especially if it is produced from renewable sources. In recent years, the development of an efficient process for hydrogen production has become an important goal for energy researchers. Numerous studies have evaluated the catalytic reforming of glycerol for hydrogen production both experimentally and thermodynamically. To enhance hydrogen pro-duction and make the production process efficient, researchers have investigated different <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> under a wide range of operating conditions. Moreover, the main focus of these studies was the development of a high-perfor-mance reforming catalyst that can increase the hydrogen yield and decrease carbon formation and processing costs. Several <b>reforming</b> <b>processes</b> can be used to produce hydrogen from glycerol.

40|$|The Decentralised Water <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in Zimbabwe {{has largely}} been {{informed}} by the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) process based on the 1992 Dublin Principles onWater. The attempt to reform one sector (water), under the IWRM rubric, when other key sectors are in disarray (agriculture, energy) and when social and government institutions, in general, are not functioning as they should, made it more complicated. The decentralised water <b>reform</b> <b>process,</b> with support {{from a number of}} donors, was perceived to be a technical process which would result in better water management in Zimbabwe. The research in Zimbabwe, however, shows that instead of establishing order within the water sector, the <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> {{has largely been}} disorderly since it downplays the political nature of the water <b>reform</b> <b>process.</b> In attempting to change the water legislation, the reform brought out the different and competing interests on water.

40|$|This {{paper on}} the Indian <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> and the {{implications}} of the South-East Asian crisis gives an overview of the reform policies in India as well as an assessment of the impacts of these policies, especially in relation to employment and incomes. This assessment is then juxtaposed with the South-East Asian crisis in 1997 - 1999. The authors discuss to what extent the crisis in South-East Asia has an effect on the <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in India, {{not only in terms of}} changes in the international markets (trade and capital) but also in terms of drawing lessons from the crisis in South-East Asia for the <b>reform</b> <b>process</b> in India.

They conclude that a sound industrial policy is needed to increase the productivity in the Indian economic reform policy which should be applied in line with trade and investment policies.
