The {{purpose of this study was}} to see if gardeners of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe (PBPN) in Kansas were more likely to have positive health indicators than non-gardeners. The objective was to discover if PBPN gardeners were more likely than non-gardeners to eat the <b>daily</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>amount</b> of fruit (2 servings) (Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, 2015 a), eat the <b>daily</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>amount</b> of vegetables (3 servings) (Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, 2015 b), meet the weekly recommended amount of PA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009), perceive their health to be good, and determine if PBPN gardeners meet the weekly recommended amount of PA through gardening activities.

To correct for the endogeneity of the food environment, we use an identification strategy based on aggregate drivers of food stores’ location, and on the regional political climate affecting retail liberalization reforms. The results show that increased access affects positively the probability of consuming the daily-recommended amounts of FV, as well as the probability of consuming more portions of FV.

50|$|Inadequate {{magnesium}} intake {{can cause}} fasciculations, especially after a magnesium loss due to severe diarrhea. Over-exertion and heavy alcohol consumption are also {{risk factors for}} magnesium loss. As 70-80% {{of the adult population}} does not consume the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> <b>amount</b> of magnesium, inadequate intake may also be a common cause. Treatment consists of increased intake of magnesium from dietary sources such as nuts (especially almonds), bananas, and spinach. Magnesium supplements or pharmaceutical magnesium preparations may also be taken. However, too much magnesium may cause diarrhea, resulting in dehydration and nutrient loss (including magnesium itself, leading to a net loss, rather than a gain). It is well known as a laxative (Milk of Magnesia), though chelated magnesium can largely reduce this effect. Cheaper methods of the chelation process may be unsatisfactory for some people (e.g. mild diarrhea). Magnesium supplements recommend that they be taken only with meals, and not on an empty stomach.|$|E

The DRI for vitamin E {{is based}} on the {{alpha-tocopherol}} form because it is the most active form as originally tested. Results of two national surveys, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988-91) and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes of Individuals (1994 CSFII) indicated that the dietary intakes of most Americans do not provide the recommended amounts of vitamin E. However, a 2000 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on vitamin E states that intake estimates of vitamin E may be low because energy and fat intake is often underreported in national surveys and because the kind and amount of fat added during cooking is often not known. The IOM states that most North American adults get enough vitamin E from their normal diets to meet current recommendations. However, they do caution individuals who consume low fat diets because vegetable oils are such a good dietary source of vitamin E. [...] "Low-fat diets can substantially decrease vitamin E intakes if food choices are not carefully made to enhance alpha-tocopherol intakes". Vitamin E supplements are absorbed best when taken with meals.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> <b>amounts</b> (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total <b>daily</b> <b>amount</b> of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|R

The intervention consisted of 10 -minute PA breaks led by the teacher in the classroom. Higher overall rates of on-task behavior were observed during the intervention condition than during baseline. In addition, it appears that PA also positively impacted time-on-task throughout the full 45 -minute observation period. These findings will be valuable to schools when deciding whether or not to implement brief breaks for PA during the school day...|$|R
