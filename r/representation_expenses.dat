50|$|As mayor, Petrov cut his and {{the city}} councillors' wage to the minimum. Finding a city debt of 17.6 million, he managed to bring it down by 6.4 million, or 36%. His deputies work as volunteers, while the councillors' fees amount to a {{symbolic}} 1 HRK. Petrov abolished also the compensation {{to the members of}} supervisory boards and management councils, and <b>representation</b> <b>expenses</b> decreased by 10 times and travel costs by 8 times. He also terminated several expensive public contracts, and introduced transparency in public spending. His work to sanitize the city's budget got him to be declared the best mayor in the region. After having halved the city debt, he increased the salaries of the city administration, but they remained 30% lower than they were at the time he took office as mayor.|$|E

30|$|These {{findings}} can be nicely {{accounted for}} by distinguishing between representations of incidental details {{of a set of}} materials and event models that represent the meaningful and salient aspects of situations described by those materials (Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978; Radvansky & Zacks, 2014). Older adults may preferentially favor event model <b>representations</b> at the <b>expense</b> of incidental details. These considerations suggest that comprehension and memory for activity by older adults could be facilitated by supporting construction of an effective representation of events as they are experienced.|$|R
5|$|The early republican {{constitution}} {{was dominated by}} the patricians, who monopolised all control of the magistracies, the Senate, and the voting blocs of the assemblies.

The main historical sources for {{the origins of the}} Roman political system, Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, relied heavily on the Roman annalists, who supplemented what little written history existed with oral history.

The thesis is also focused on alternative mechanisms inside the company and consideration concerning the (non-) usage of the institute in practice. The first chapter defines the nature and objectives of the action by a member. Subsequently concrete types of occurrence are briefly defined and the institute is put into historic connection with the rules stated in Act No. 513 / 1991 Coll., the Commercial Code. The second chapter focuses on analysis of the main problematic areas of the institute. The thesis focuses on problems concerning active legitimation and its consequences when it is lost during the proceedings.

The rapid diffusion of the LBM stems from the reduced computational burden required. The handling of complex boundaries is a crucial capability that a numerical method solving the MSWE must exhibit. In this work we show that an approach employing a Finite Volume scheme to solve the Lattice Boltzmann equation (FV-LBE) provides the desired ability for boundary <b>representation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of a reasonable increase in complexity {{with respect to the}} LBM approach.

40|$|People tend {{to forget}} {{information}} that is related to memories they are actively trying to retrieve. On the basis of results from behavioral studies, such retrieval-induced forgetting is held to result from inhibitory control processes that are recruited to attenuate interference caused by competing memory traces. Employing electrophysiological measures of brain activity, the present study examined the neural correlates of these inhibitory processes as they operate. The results demonstrate that sustained prefrontal event-related potentials were 1) related {{to whether or not}} selective memory retrieval was required during reprocessing of previously studied words and 2) predictive of individual differences in the amount of forgetting observed in an ensuing recall test. The present findings give support to an inhibitory control account of retrieval-induced forgetting and are in accord with the view that prefrontal regions {{play an important role in}} the selection and maintenance of relevant memory <b>representations</b> at the <b>expense</b> of those currently irrelevant...|$|R
40|$|The mixing desk metaphor {{found in}} many Digital Audio Workstations (DAW) creates a quantitive visual display that is highly {{structured}} and segmented. While this is useful for transmitting large amounts of quantitive data it can inhibit the more intuitive and performative aspects inherent in music mixing. Furthermore, it can potentially disrupt the user’s activity flow; their attention is drawn to the <b>representation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of the auditory character of {{the sound and the}} immediacy of the mixing task is displaced by the complexity of the interface. This paper's focus is the cognitive and creative issues encountered using music production software and the influence they exert on the initial approach, task workflow and final output of the user. Equalisers have been chosen to exemplify this, due to their pivotal balance between aural and visual modalities. A Case study of the Pro Tools III equaliser has been used to understand the implication of current designs. Observations with MA Music Technology students and lecturers have been used to examine the practical implications of theory. Finally, the paper draws conclusions as to the effectiveness of current software equaliser designs and proposes modifications to design...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{two separate}} game theoretic models that {{fall under the}} general umbrella of network formation games. The first is a coalitional model of interaction in social networks {{that is based on}} the idea of social distance, in which players seek interactions with similar others. Our model captures some of the phenomena observed on such networks, such as homophily driven interactions and the formation of small worlds for groups of players. Using social distance games, we analyze the interactions between players on the network, study the properties of efficient and stable networks, relate them to the underlying graphical structure of the game, and give an approximation algorithm for finding optimal social welfare. We then show that efficient networks are not necessarily stable, and stable networks do not necessarily maximise welfare. We use the stability gap to investigate the welfare of stable coalition structures, and propose two new solution concepts with improved welfare guarantees. The second model is a compact formulation of matchings with externalities. Our formulation achieves tractability of the <b>representation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of full expressivity. We formulate a template of solution concept that applies to games where externalities are involved, and instantiate {{it in the context of}} optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic reasoning. Then we investigate the complexity of the representation in the context of many-to-many and one-to-one matchings, and provide both computational hardness results and polynomial time algorithms where applicable...|$|R
30|$|We {{present an}} action-specific model of human motion {{suitable}} for many applications, {{that has been}} successfully used for full body tracking [4, 5, 17]. In this paper, we explore and extend its capabilities for gait analysis and recognition tasks. Our action-specific model is trained with 3 D motion capture data for the walking action from the CMU Graphics Lab Motion capture database. In our work, human postures are represented {{by means of a}} full body 3 D model composed of 12 limbs. Limbs' orientations are represented within the kinematic tree using their direction cosines [18]. As a result, we avoid singularities and abrupt changes due to the representation. Moreover, near configurations of the body limbs account for near positions in our <b>representation</b> at the <b>expense</b> of extra parameters {{to be included in the}} model. Then, PCA is applied to the training data to perform dimensionality reduction over the highly correlated input data. As a result, we obtain a lower-dimensional representation of human postures which is more suitable to describe human motion, since we found that each dimension on the PCA space describes a natural mode of variation of human motion. Additionally, the main modes of variation of human gait are naturally represented by means of the principal components found. This leads to a coarse-to-fine representation of human motion which relates the precision of the model with its complexity in a natural way and makes it suitable for different kinds of applications which demand more or less complexity in the model.|$|R
40|$|Although less {{dramatic}} {{than the previous}} contest, the 2011 federal elections marked a significant turning point for Switzerland. The growth of the extremes, which had dominated Swiss politics over the last twenty years, {{has come to an}} end and two new parties have established themselves at the centre of the political spectrum. The right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC, hereafter SVP), which had grown relentlessly since the early 1990 s, lost ground for the first time while the Greens, the other rising star of Swiss politics, suffered a major defeat. Both parties lost support primarily to start-ups that had broken away from their own ranks and moved to a more centrist position. The traditional centrist parties – the Liberal-Radicals (FDP/PLR, hereafter FDP) and the Christian Democrats (CVP/PDC, hereafter CVP) – continued their decline, while the Socialists (SPS/PSS, hereafter SPS) managed to increase their tally of seats despite a slight loss of support. The SPS was the main winner in the elections for the upper house, where the new centrist parties also gained <b>representation</b> at the <b>expenses</b> of both the CVP and the FDP. The elections for the collegial executive saw all incumbents re-elected and the post left vacant by the socialist minister Calmy-Rey filled by a fellow socialist, thus denying a second seat to the SVP. The results paint a picture of reduced polarisation but higher fragmentation, marking a return to the more consensual style that characterised Swiss politics from the late 1950 s to the mid- 1990 s. This bodes well for the stability of the country's institutions, which had been shaken by the polarising ascent of the SVP, and is likely to lead to a high(er) degree of continuity in public policy making over the next four years...|$|R
