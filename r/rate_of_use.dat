40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study examined, {{across three}} racial/ethnic groups, how the {{inclusion}} of data on drug <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dropouts can alter estimates <b>of</b> adolescent drug <b>use</b> <b>rates.</b> METHODS: Self-report <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> lifetime prevalence and use in the previous 30 days were obtained from Mexican American, White non-Hispanic, and Native American student (n = 738) and dropouts (n = 774). Rates for the age cohort (students and dropouts) were estimated with a weighted correction formula. RESULTS: <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> reported by dropouts were 1. 2 to 6. 4 times higher than those reported by students. Corrected rates resulted in changes in relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> by different ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: When only in-school data are available, errors in estimating drug use among groups with high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> school dropout can be substantial. Correction of student-based data to include drug <b>use</b> <b>of</b> dropouts leads to important changes in estimated levels <b>of</b> drug <b>use</b> and alters estimates <b>of</b> the relative <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> for racial/ethnic minority groups with high dropout rates...|$|R

25|$|ECT {{soon became}} {{more popular than}} cardiazol {{convulsion}} therapy in mental hospitals in the UK. It was quickly identified as being especially useful {{in the treatment of}} affective psychosis. The therapeutic value of ECT in schizophrenia was recognised as limited, but some psychiatrists saw it as useful to control the behaviour of institutionalised patients who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Some psychiatrists thought that ECT should be restricted to the treatment of depression; others used it in the treatment {{of a wide variety of}} disorders, for example, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neurosis, and hysteria. It was also used on people who had suffered war trauma. By the mid 1950s there was a 20 fold difference in the rate of ECT use in mental hospitals in the UK, and a similar difference in its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in teaching hospitals. In the 1940s and 1950s ECT machines used sine-wave current and patients were given a shock lasting a fraction of a second.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a quantitative}} sociolinguistic study <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> quotative be like and discourse markers like {{and just in}} non-native speech. Specifically, are the patterns <b>of</b> <b>use</b> found in Danish speakers speaking English {{the same as those}} documented for native speech? Analysis of ten sociolinguistic interviews with 23 to 26 -year-old Danes conversing in English found that while the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> these features are lower than those of native speakers, the linguistic patterns remain the same. For example, for be like, there were high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> with internal dialogue and historical present contexts and for discourse markers like and just, there were high <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> before nouns and verbs and in present tense. These replicate results found in previous analyses of native speech, thus even in non-native speech, the conditioning constraints remain intact. A further attitudinal study revealed that despite widespread use by this group, the speakers associated these features with stereotypical ‘Valley Girls’, suggesting that attitudes towards these forms may be at odds with actual use...|$|R

2500|$|Going [...] "upstream", {{from the}} market {{environment}} to the technology, market signals act to inform the producers of the technology about variations in relative prices. However, {{the extent to which}} technology producers can shift from more expensive to cheaper inputs, or modify technology toward the use of cheaper complement goods is bound by technical constraints. Such constraints emerge because inputs are characterized by low substitutability due to the physical and chemical limits involved in the production process. Consequently, the upstream incentives given by market signals affect only the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of certain inputs as well as the rate of development of a trajectory but not the direction of technical change, which is bound by the technical constraints of production.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Substance {{use in the}} college-age {{population}} is an important public health and educational concern. This study compared <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> among college students and nonstudents, including high school dropouts, from a single data source representative of the nation. METHODS: <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> were estimated from the combined National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse from 1991 to 1993. Logistic regression models were {{used to test the}} effects of educational status and living arrangement. RESULTS: Educational status and living arrangement were found to be significant predictors <b>of</b> substance <b>use.</b> <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> illicit drug and cigarette use were highest among high school dropouts, while current and heavy alcohol use were highest among college students who did not live with their parents. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial variation in substance use patterns within the college-age population suggests that overall <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> for young adults should not be used to characterize specific subgroups of young adults. These data from a single source will thus help planners more clearly distinguish the service needs of the diverse subgroups within this population...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Study of the uptake of {{new medical}} {{technologies}} provides useful {{information on the}} transfer of published evidence into usual practice. We conducted an audit of selected hospitals in three countries (Canada, France, and Switzerland) to identify clinical predictors of low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin use and outpatient treatment, and to compare the pace of uptake of these new therapeutic approaches across hospitals. DESIGN: Historical review of medical records. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed the medical records of 3043 patients diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in five Canadian, two French, and two Swiss teaching hospitals from 1994 to 1998. Measures. We explored independent clinical variables associated with LMW heparin use and outpatient treatment, and determined crude and adjusted <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> LMW heparin <b>use</b> and outpatient treatment across hospitals. RESULTS: For the years studied, the overall <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> LMW heparin <b>use</b> and outpatient treatment in the study sample were 34. 1 and 15. 8 %, respectively, with higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in later years. Many comorbidities were negatively associated with outpatient treatment, and risk-adjusted <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> these new approaches varied significantly across hospitals. CONCLUSION: There has been a relatively rapid uptake of LMW heparins and outpatient treatment for DVT in their early years of availability, but the pace of uptake has varied considerably across hospitals and countries...|$|R
