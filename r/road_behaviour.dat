40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the safety related <b>behaviour</b> of <b>road</b> users aged 11 - 16. A self-completion questionnaire was designed to measure {{the frequency with which}} children from the target population carry out 43 different <b>road</b> using <b>behaviours</b> {{and a number of other}} variables including children's beliefs about the safety of their own <b>road</b> using <b>behaviour.</b> Two thousand four hundred and thirty three children from eleven secondary schools within England completed the questionnaire in lesson time at school. Factor analysis showed that scores on the 43 behaviour items were best represented by a three-factor solution. The three factors were named unsafe <b>road</b> crossing <b>behaviour,</b> dangerous playing in the road, and planned protective behaviour. Analysis of variance and stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that demographic variables and exposure variables had statistically significant effects on how often these behaviours were carried out. More interesting was the finding that respondents had realistic perceptions of their own <b>behaviour</b> as <b>road</b> users. The more respondents believed their <b>road</b> using <b>behaviour</b> to be unsafe and irresponsible, the more often they reported carrying out <b>road</b> using <b>behaviour</b> that was undesirable from a road safety point of view.

The RMA used the 1.5-litre engine, while the RMB got the Big Four.

'Torsionic' front independent suspension and steering design inspired by the Citroën Traction Avant provided precise handling; their flowing lines were particularly well-balanced, marrying pre-war 'coachbuilt' elegance to more modern features, such as headlamps faired into the front wings.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{determinants of}} regional differences in traffic accident mortality in Italy. Data and methods: Multiple linear regression models were conducted assessing the associations between regional differences in traffic mortality, case fatality and accident rates (dependent variables) with socio-demographic factors, and variables describing <b>road</b> <b>behaviour,</b> vehicles, infrastructure {{and medical care}} (independent variables). Data were derived from the National Institute of Statistics, the National Institute of Health and the Italian Automobile Club. In addition to analyses for the whole country of Italy, separate models were conducted for Northern and southern regions. Results: In Italy large regional differences in traffic mortality rates can be observed, ranging from 5. 5 to 20 per 100. 000 person-years. There is a North-South gradient with higher mortality rates in the Northern part of Italy. Strong predictors of regional differences in both traffic mortality and accident rates are the employment rate (directly associated) and alcohol use (directly associated). This is observed {{in the whole of}} Italy, and separately in Northern and southern regions. Conclusion: Our study has shown the need for regional policies to improve <b>road</b> <b>behaviour</b> to reduce traffic accident and mortality rates in identified high-risk areas...|$|E
40|$|Less {{motorised}} {{countries in}} Asia exhibit {{a variety of}} road safety problems. The <b>behaviour</b> of <b>road</b> users contributes significantly to these problems, together with road environment and vehicle factors. As well as addressing road environment issues, engineering measures provide a convenient way of modifying <b>road</b> user <b>behaviour,</b> and have been widely implemented in Asia for this purpose. However, implicit assumptions about <b>road</b> user <b>behaviour</b> which {{have their origin in}} motorised countries can lead to the implementation of engineering measures having impacts which run counter to expectation. This paper reviews some of these cases, and demonstrates that a fuller understanding of the factors determining <b>road</b> user <b>behaviour</b> in the countries concerned would probably have led to better outcomes. An approach for improving the road safety outcomes of engineering interventions is proposed, involving explicit identification of assumptions, research using qualitative and anthropological techniques, and development of local research expertise...|$|R

40|$|Drivers under 25 {{years are}} {{over-represented}} in global road accident statistics. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) {{has been used}} to identify individuals who are likely to engage in behaviours, such as speeding, which are associated with increased accident involvement. In an attempt to investigate adolescents‟ attitudes and behaviours from pre- to post-driver training, the studies presented incorporate past behaviour into the TPB. Three questionnaire-based studies were conducted in Scotland and New Zealand. The first study explored adolescent pre-drivers‟ <b>road</b> <b>behaviour,</b> driving attitudes and speeding intentions. Adolescents‟ with the greatest speeding intentions frequently engaged in high-risk <b>road</b> <b>behaviour</b> and had more accepting attitudes towards driving violations. The second study explored the development of attitudes and intentions from pre- to post-driver training. Drivers who frequently violated reported more accepting attitudes towards violations and engagement in frequent high-risk road behaviours as pre-drivers. The third study assessed the stability of pre-drivers‟ driving attitudes and speeding intentions. Adolescents‟ attitudes and intentions fluctuated significantly; however, males reported riskier driving attitudes and greater speeding intentions. This research suggests that the role of road safety education and pre-driver interventions on future driving behaviour has been under-estimated. Interventions that simultaneously reinforce safe road practices and motivate the reduction of dangerous practices will influence the future of adolescents as safe drivers...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a call for an {{integrated}} conceptual model to better understand the communication of health information to patients and consumers (Longo, 2005). Of particular interest to the current research project is the identification of factors that influence attention to health information in order to develop innovative methods for communicating such information. In practise, health promotion campaigns tend to exist under a one size fits all framework. That is, most public health campaigns highlight the negative effects of engaging in risky behaviours. An examination of this method with 303 community participants revealed attention to health risk information differed across two health threats. Participants were randomly assigned to receive information about heart health or <b>road</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Participants in the heart health condition remembered significantly more risk information than participants in the <b>road</b> <b>behaviours</b> condition (t (292) = - 4. 35, p=. 00). In interpreting these findings it is hypothesised that there is an unknown component inherent to some health threats that impacts on attention to risk information. These unknown components are perceived to be outside of personal control hence attention to information may be redundant. For example, risk on the road is also a function of other people’s behaviour which an individual cannot control. Research is now exploring this idea by examining perceptions of controllability across a number of health threats. It appears that health promotion campaigns should not operate on a one size fits all approach if increased attention to preventative information is the desired outcome. ...|$|R

In total 944 adolescents were surveyed in the North and South islands of New Zealand. Factor analysis of the scale produced three factors which had acceptable internal reliability and were very similar to those found in the original research. The three factors were ???unsafe crossing behaviour???, ???playing on the road??? and ???planned protective behaviour???. This research also found that males and those who were at least part Maori were more likely to put themselves at risk by playing on the road. Furthermore, those who identified themselves as being part Maori also engaged in unsafe <b>road</b> crossing <b>behaviour</b> more often than Caucasian and Asian adolescents. Interestingly, only the interaction effect between age and sex was significantly related to engagement in planned protective behaviour.
