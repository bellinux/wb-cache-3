To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of <b>rural</b> <b>depopulation</b> in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Philip's reign, {{a body of}} {{analysis}} of Spain's condition began to emerge through {{the work of the}} numerous arbitristas, or commentators, that dominated public discussions from around 1600 through to the 1630s. These different voices focused heavily on the political economy of Spain – the <b>rural</b> <b>depopulation,</b> the diverse and bureaucratic administrative methods, the social hierarchies and corruption, offering numerous, if often contradictory, solutions. Nonetheless, through most of Philip's reign there was no significant attempt at reform – Philip continued to rule in line with local laws and customs. Philip encouraged consolidation of noble estates, selling off large quantities of crown lands to favoured nobles and creditors. There were no attempts to create an equivalent to the French intendant position – the closest equivalent, the corregidor, lacked the strong links to the crown required to overcome local opposition. Only in Philip's final years did reform begin to gain momentum; a reform committee, or Junta de Reformación, was established in Lerma's final months in 1618. Under the incoming administration, including the reformist Baltasar de Zúñiga, this committee ground on, but would only deliver substantial, if ill-fated results, when rejuvenated under Philip IV's reign.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} a major European state aid program for broadband deployment applied to rural areas in the German State of Bavaria in the years 2010 and 2011. Using difference-in-differences estimation strategies, we find that aided municipalities have - depending on broadband quality - a between 16. 8 and 23. 2 percent higher broadband coverage than non-aided municipalities. This increase in broadband coverage - closing the digital divide - results in an increase of on average seven employed individuals living in the respective aid-receiving municipalities while leaving the number of employed or selfemployed individuals or wages unaffected. We therefore conclude that an increase in broadband coverage through state aid prevents <b>rural</b> areas from <b>depopulation,</b> but does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs...|$|R

40|$|Extract] As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2006) {{has made}} apparent, rural decline {{is a common}} feature across all OECD countries. Within the Australian context, not only is such decline common, it is also not a new phenomenon. As Gutman (2007, p. 384) points out, in the past 100 years {{agriculture}} has declined from generating 80 per cent of Gross Domestic Product to less than 5 per cent. Lockie (2000) observes that international economic pressures on Australian agriculture have been cyclically impacting on the industry since late in the nineteenth century. Alston and Kent (2004, p. xiii) observe that 'small town <b>rural</b> decline and <b>depopulation</b> have been a common factor of rural life {{at least since the}} 1970 s'. Rural decline has been particularly evidenced in a {{reduction in the number of}} people living in rural Australia, an ageing of the residual rural population, and a sustained decline in the number of jobs in agriculture, averaging 2. 3 per cent per annum (Bureau of Rural Sciences 2008) ...|$|R
50|$|Wolsey {{also used}} his courts to tackle {{national}} controversies, {{such as the}} pressing issue of enclosures. The countryside had been thrown into discord by the entrepreneurial actions of landlords enclosing areas of land and converting from arable farming to pastoral farming, requiring fewer workers. The Tudors valued stability, and this mass urban migration represented a serious crisis. Wolsey conducted national enquires in 1517, 1518 and 1527 into the presence of enclosures. In {{the course of his}} administration he used the court of Chancery to prosecute two hundred and sixty-four landowners, including peers, bishops, knights, religious heads, and Oxford colleges. Enclosures were seen as directly linked to <b>rural</b> unemployment and <b>depopulation,</b> vagrancy, food shortages and, accordingly, inflation. This pattern was repeated with many of Wolsey's other initiatives, particularly his quest to abolish enclosure. Despite spending significant time and effort in investigating the state of the countryside and prosecuting numerous offenders, Wolsey freely surrendered his policy during the parliament of 1523 to ensure that Parliament passed his proposed taxes for Henry's war in France. Enclosures remained a problem for many years.|$|R
40|$|The author {{analyzes}} depopulation in Croatia in {{the period}} 1953 — 1981, giving a regional presentation and the more important implications of the process. It was shown that depopulation has spread to 5. 476 settlements (82. 4 % of all the settlements, 44. 4 % n of the average of inhabitants and 79. 9 % of the area of Croatia). The number of inhabitants in the depopulated group of settlements decreased by 29. 4 % and in 1981 was 1, 566, 406. This means that only 34. 0 % {{of the total population}} lived in 82. 4 % of the settlements. Depopulation has spread to most of the settlements in all the macroregions, and the process is the most widespread and pronounced in Highland Croatia and the Northern Croatian Littoral. Population decrease characterises 88. 5 % of the <b>rural</b> settlements: <b>depopulation</b> is the ruling demographic trend in the rural settlements of all the communes. Pronounced exodus (50 % and more) exists in as many as 1, 140 settlements (17. 1 % of the total number), and there are most such settlements in Highland Croatia (35. 4 " (i {{of the total number of}} settlements). Settlements with pronounced depopulation are almost as a rule located in the outlying parts of communes. The conclusion is that depopulation is very strong in Croatia, both in spatially and in intensity. This corresponds to the fact that important accompanying processes of depopulation have also been found. There is a marked sexual unbalance in depopulated settlements is comparison to the general population, the age structure and educational level are more unfavourable. The external reflection of these complex demographic and socio-economic processes is the landscape of depopulation which shows signs that "hearths are dying out". Finally, the author concludes that depopulation in Croatia has all the essential features of a socially demaging process...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{sector of}} Ukrainian {{economics}} {{is in the}} period of transformations, which are accompanied by increase of negative tendencies in the social sphere: depopulation of significant territories, worsening of living conditions for rural population, increasing of mass poverty, growing unemployment, sharp income differentiation. High social losses against a background of development of large-scale commercial production, land concentration and capitalization of production are leading to increase of social tensions in society thus hampering country's exit from the crisis. Ukrainian economic science and practice of reforms hasn't been ready that social processes in the economics under reforms are complicated and inconsistent: some of them are contributing to economic increase, other vice versa are influencing in the opposite way. Currently the relevant task is development of the efficient social policy promoting structural and institutional rebuilding of economics, stimulating sustainable economic growth. In order to solve this task it's very important to bring economics out of shadow, which is based on humiliatingly low level of wages in Ukraine, prearranged by the inadequate shares of income distribution between the labor and the capital. Processes of land concentration, attraction of industrial capital and creation of large-scale integrated commercial structures in agricultural sector are strengthening shadowing of economics and increasing disproportions in such distribution. With the existence of the shadow economics nominal and real increase of salaries doesn't necessarily mean increase of standards of living for country's population. For instance, average monthly wage in Ukrainian agriculture grew 4, 5 times from 1999 to 2006, but the share of wages in Gross added value (GAV) dropped almost two times. In the industry wage increase 5, 3 times leaded to wage drop in by 14, 3 % GAV. And only in service and construction the respective ratio grew by 4, 3 % and 3 %. In the country with the transitional economics it's impossible to improve standards of living for population by simple wage increase without simultaneous actions aimed at bringing the economics out of the shadows. The biggest threat of low standards of living of Ukrainians is that there're falling numbers of rural population and large territories are being depopulated. Identification of main trends for development of modern society and social factors of economic growth should promote identification of main directions for social and economic policy of the state during establishment of new rural way of living in Ukraine.

40|$|After the {{establishment}} of the new legislative framework on planning and construction, territorial organization of the Republic of Serbia and regional development, as well as adoption of the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Serbia 2010 - 2020 (SPRS), the strategic spatial plans at regional level have been elaborated. Over the last few years, the total of 10 regional spatial plans (RSP) have been either adopted or in final stage of elaboration, five of them for peripheral rural regions of Serbia. The paper analyzes concepts and models used in planning the sustainable territorial development of peripheral, rural and mountain regions in Serbia. It refers to several key questions of sustainable territorial development of peripheral regions: accessibility, urban-rural development, rural settlement network and depopulation of peripheral mountain areas, tourism development, sustainable natural resources utilization and potentials for trans-border cooperation. One of the models discussed is for rural settlement network. Aging of <b>rural</b> population and <b>depopulation</b> of peripheral mountain regions hinders the preservation of micro rural centers, in particular the provision of public and commercial services. Emerging model is of mobile services, now developed dominantly for social and medical services, which can be expanded to almost all services, or combined with the revitalization of micro rural centers, namely those within urban centers' gravity zone, main transport corridors or tourism destinations. Potentially most attractive tourism assets are located at peripheral regions of Serbia. Spatial pattern of assets allows for dispersed development of tourist nodes, gateways and paths. The question is how much of dispersion or concentration in the spatial pattern of tourism infrastructure and supply is acceptable and sustainable. The benefits and constraints for implementing some of proposed models are discussed. Short critical overview on constrains of regional development and implementation of regional spatial plans related to undeveloped regional level of governance, as well as to weak vertical and horizontal coordination of other levels of governance has been indicated. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss the challenges and possibilities of regional spatial planning to contribute sustainable regional territorial development of peripheral and rural regions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{lengthening}} of {{the supply}} chain developed over the last decades – due to the multiplication of intermediaries - has produced effects from an environmental, economic, social and territorial point of view cannot pass unnoticed. As a matter of fact, the excessive amount of participants taking part in all the phases {{of the supply}} chain has created the basis for an increase of environmental impacts due to many factors: the implementation of farming methods, which are {{getting more and more}} intensive, put pressure on the environment, on the sustainability of the agricultural industrial production process and increase the number of kilometres the goods have to travel in order to be distributed. Moreover, the extension of the supply chain has produced a decrease of its share of value-added to the benefit of the farmers and, as a consequence, has excluded many small producers from the market and caused a negative impact on <b>rural</b> areas (unemployment, <b>depopulation</b> due to migration). From the customers’ point of view, the increase of intermediaries has created an informative asymmetry due to the impossibility to track their shipment as well as to a lowering of their quality standards, caused by an increasingly standardized production process. During the last years, the interest of policy-makers in short supply chain has grown. It appears to be a tool able to incentivize a sustainable agricultural productions and to provide environmental, economic and social benefits. In fact, the short supply chain other than reducing costs, which are cut down by decreasing the number of intermediaries that take the product from the producer to the consumer, creates a positive environmental externalities and, above all, promotes the local areas. This work highlights the central role taken on by the implementation of new forms of marketing in the short supply chain and its importance in influencing the concept of sustainable development in the agricultural supply chain. Moreover, this work aims to find evidence-based guidelines for policy-makers seeking to support the development of these new forms of marketing, whose potential lies in the customers’ attention to ethical and environmental issues and their need for natural and healthy food...|$|R
