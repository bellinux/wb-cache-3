The ewe lambs, which were of three breeding types, were secured from Southern Utah; they will be used in the subsequent breeding studies. The lambs were divided into six lots with uniform distribution of the lambs of different breeding into the various lots. The <b>roughages</b> compared were long alfalfa hay, ground Atlas stover, and Atlas silage in combination with prairie hay. Cottonseed meal was added to supply protein to all of the rations, and milo grain was also given in those three lots where a higher ratio of crude fiber to T. D. N. was desired. Originally, the experiments were planned for two lots of lambs to receive each of the three <b>roughages</b> or a combination of <b>roughages,</b> One of the two lots was fed a ration with a fiber-T.

25|$|Other animals, such as {{rabbits and}} rodents, {{practise}} coprophagia behaviours – eating specialised faeces {{in order to}} re-digest food, {{especially in the case}} of <b>roughage.</b> Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten.|$|E
25|$|Pygmy goats are precocial and polyestrous breeders; bearing one to {{four young}} every nine to 12 months after a five-month {{gestation}} period.

25|$|Beef is {{the culinary}} name for meat from cattle, {{particularly}} skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef {{is a source}} of high-quality protein and essential nutrients. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, <b>roughage</b> and a vitamin/mineral preblend.|$|E
25|$|The {{cottonseed}} {{which remains}} after the cotton is ginned {{is used to}} produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls {{can be added to}} dairy cattle rations for <b>roughage.</b> During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found {{in all parts of the}} cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.|$|E
25|$|In {{their native}} arid and {{semi-arid}} climates, donkeys {{spend more than}} half of each day foraging and feeding, often on poor quality scrub. The donkey has a tough digestive system in which <b>roughage</b> is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation, microbial action in the caecum and large intestine. While there is no marked structural difference between the gastro-intestinal tract of a donkey and that of a horse, the digestion of the donkey is more efficient. It needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight, approximately 1.5 percent of body weight per day in dry matter, compared to the 2–2.5 percent consumption rate possible for a horse. Donkeys are also less prone to colic. The reasons for this difference are not fully understood; the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse, or a longer gut retention time.|$|E
40|$|Through the 1960 s {{and early}} 1970 s, many cattle feeders {{formulated}} feedlot rations composed primarily of grains. Rations high in grain were relatively inexpensive and economical. For example, Scott and Broadbent [20] constructed a programming model in 1972 that utilized the California net energy system as developed by Lofgreen and Garett [16] and {{adopted by the}} National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to estimate economical rations. They concluded, 2 ̆ 2 In most feedlot operations, {{it appears that the}} maximum possible rate of gain w ill be most profitable under usual price relationships” [20, p. 24]. Although maximizing rate of gain is a biological objective, it was congruent with the economic objective of maximizing profits. Therefore, there were several reasons for little interest in investigating the trade-off or substitution rates between <b>roughages</b> and concentrates in the beef feeding ration. First, concentrates were relatively inexpensive. Second, addition of <b>roughages</b> to rations generally reduces rate of gain. A longer time on feed thus increases the nonfeed costs, such as labor, yardage fees, and carrying charges, and reduces the annual volume of a lot. Third, <b>roughages</b> generally are bulkier and more difficult to handle than concentrates. They may require more expensive equipment and large long-term capital investments. Fourth, many feedlots were designed and constructed to provide high-concentrate rations. Hence, little effort was exerted toward investigating the rate of substitution between <b>roughages</b> and concentrates...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the Metabolizable Energy (ME) values of some <b>roughages</b> which were {{calculated}} from regression equations using in vivo and in vitro parameters and to determine the most suitable regression equations using in vitro parameters. For this purpose, in vivo ME values and in vitro Crude Nutrients (CN), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL), enzyme soluble/insoluble organic matter (ELOS/EULOS) and 24 h Gas Production (GP) amounts of 40 <b>roughages</b> were used. In the study, in vitro ME values of <b>roughages</b> were calculated by regression equations where in vitro parameters were used and these results were compared with their in vivo ME values. According to the obtained results, in vitro ME values were estimated more better with equations where, NDF or especially ADF was used than with equations where, CN or ADL was used. Besides, the prediction was improved in regression equations which were constituted by the combination of crude nutrients and ELOS/EULOS or combination of crude nutrients and GP. However, it can be suggested that, using of ADF instead of Crude Fiber (CF) in equations would be more correct...|$|R
25|$|Gas colic, {{also known}} as tympanic colic, {{is the result of}} gas buildup within the horse's {{digestive}} tract due to excessive fermentation within the intestines or a decreased ability to move gas through it. It is usually the result of a change in diet, but can also occur due to low dietary <b>roughage</b> levels, parasites (22% of spasmodic colics are associated with tapeworms), and anthelminthic administration. This gas buildup causes distention and increases pressure in the intestines, causing pain. Additionally, it usually causes an increase in peristaltic waves, which can lead to painful spasms of the intestine, producing subsequent spasmodic colic. The clinical signs of these forms of colic are generally mild, transient, and respond well to spasmolytic medications, such as buscopan, and analgesics. Gas colics usually self-correct, but there is the risk of subsequent torsion (volvulus) or displacement of the bowel due to gas distention, which causes this affected piece of bowel to rise upward in the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Large colon impactions {{typically}} {{occur at}} the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon, two areas where the lumen of the intestine narrows. Large colon impactions are most frequently seen in horses that have recently had a sudden decrease in exercise, such as after a musculoskeletal injury. They are also associated {{in the practice of}} twice daily feeding of grain meals, which causes a short-lived but significant secretion of fluid into the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a 15% decrease in plasma volume (hypovolemia of the circulatory system) and the subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Aldosterone secretion activates absorption of fluid from the colon, decreasing the water content of the ingesta and increasing risk of impaction. Amitraz has also been associated with large colon impaction, due to alterations in motility and retention of intestinal contents, which causes further absorption of water and dehydration of ingesta. Other possible factors include poor dental care, course <b>roughage,</b> dehydration, and limited exercise.|$|E
25|$|Gastric impactions are {{relatively}} rare, and occur when food is not cleared {{at the appropriate}} rate. It is most commonly associated with ingestion of foods that swell after eating or feeds that are coarse (bedding or poor quality <b>roughage),</b> poor dental care, poor mastication, inadequate drinking, ingestion of a foreign object, and alterations in the normal function of the stomach. Persimmons, which form a sticky gel in the stomach, and haylage, have both been associated with it, as has wheat, barley, mesquite beans, and beet pulp. Horses usually show signs of mild colic that is chronic, unresponsive to analgesics, and may include signs such as dysphagia, ptyalism, bruxism, fever, and lethargy, although severe colic signs may occur. Signs of shock may be seen if gastric rupture has occurred. Usually, the impaction must be quite large before it presents symptoms, and may be diagnosed via gastroscopy or ultrasound, although rectal examinations are unhelpful. Persimmon impaction is treated with infusions of Coca-Cola. Other gastric impactions are often resolves with enteral fluids. Quick treatment generally produces a favorable prognosis.|$|E

The aims of this study were: (1) to determine production factors that would influence the sheep production, (2) to analyze sheep farming production efficiency. This study held in Cibunian Village, Pamijahan Sub District, Bogor Regency, West Java. The data was analyzed using Cobb-Douglas production function for regression analysis.

The assay was conducted in a complete randomized design with seven <b>roughages</b> and three replications. One mare with a cannula fitted in the caecum was used, fed diet consisting of coastcross hay (80 %) and concentrate (20 %) at 2. 0 % BW, four times a day. Nylon 6. 5 × 20 cm bags were used with 45 &# 956;/pore, containing 5. 2 g DM/bag, inserting 3 or 4 bags in the caecum at the times of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours incubation. The caecum in situ degradability parameters of nutrients were obtained by Ørskov model. The DM degradability parameters of all the <b>roughages</b> were significant. There was no fit to the model for pigeon pea for CP and NDF and desmodio.

Moreover, sugarcane has high sucrose content, and despite the importance of fiber digestibility for animal performance, the sugarcane breeding programs are focused on total production of sucrose, with little attempt to evaluate quality parameters for animal nutrition. Forage breeding demonstrates that small increases in dry matter (DM) digestibility result in significant improvement in animal performance (Casler 2001).|$|R
