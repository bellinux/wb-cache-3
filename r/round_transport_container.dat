The <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> is constructed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plumbing pipe, which is readily available and inexpensive (US$ 1 - 2, depending on size) and has wide flexibility of size due to the range of PVC pipe dimensions available. The PVC transporters are durable, water-resistant and may be easily decontaminated. They have been adapted for the transport of blood culture bottles from provincial hospitals in Laos, where, during a 2 -year period, 380 PVC tubes containing blood culture bottles were transported without any leakage or breakage. We have found the PVC transporter to be a useful and cost-efficient durable alternative that meets IATA Packing Instruction 650 biological <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> requirements...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a new {{automated}} {{container terminal}} (ACT) system which utilizes multistory frame bridges and rail-mounted trolleys to <b>transport</b> <b>containers</b> between the quay and the yard. Beside typical ACT systems use trucks or automated guided vehicles for <b>transporting</b> <b>containers</b> between quay cranes and yard cranes, {{the new design}} uses three types of handling machines, namely, ground trolleys (GTs), transfer platforms (TPs), and frame trolleys (FTs). These three types of handling machines collaborate with one another to <b>transport</b> <b>containers.</b> This study decomposes the system into several subsystems. Each subsystem has one TP and several FTs and GTs dedicated to this TP. Then, a Markov chain model is developed to analyze the throughput of TPs.

40|$|Operation {{of nuclear}} {{reactors}} {{leads to the}} production of spent nuclear fuel (SNF). There are two basic strategies of SNF management: ultimate disposal of SNF in geological formations and recycle or repeated utilisation of reprocessed SNF. In both options, there is an urgent necessity to study radiation properties of SNF. Information about SNF radiation properties is required at all stages of SNF management. In order to reach more effective utilisation of nuclear materials, new fuel cycles are under development based on uranium-plutonium, uranium-thorium and some other types of nuclear fuel. These promising types of nuclear fuel are characterised by quite different radiation properties at all the stages of nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) listed above. So, comparative analysis is required for radiation properties of different nuclear fuel types at different NFC stages. The results presented here were obtained from the numerical analysis of the radiation field around <b>transport</b> <b>containers</b> of different SNF types and in SNF storage. The calculations are carried out with the application of the computer code packages SCALE- 4. 3 and MCNP- 4 C. Comparison of the dose parameters obtained for different models of the <b>transport</b> <b>container</b> with experimental data allowed us to make certain conclusions about the errors of numerical results caused by the approximate geometrical description of the <b>transport</b> <b>container...</b>|$|R
