5|$|Like {{many large}} rorquals, the fin whale is a {{cosmopolitan}} species. It {{is found in}} all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both {{the north and south}} extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea although they can <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of such conditions. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear pores, {{which provide}} aqueous {{channels}} through the envelope, {{are composed of}} multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 (in yeast) to several hundred proteins (in vertebrates). The pores are 100nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9nm wide, due {{to the presence of}} regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.|$|E

25|$|The {{face of the}} {{countryside}} changes markedly as one moves from north to south. In the north and central coast, orchards and fields predominate; while in the central plains, pasturage. Overall, arable land is 17%–19%, with forest and woodland 4%, permanent crops 13%, irrigated lands at2.4%; about 20% is used for pasture. There are limited fresh water resources. In the south the environment grows increasingly arid, until the borderlands eventually <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sahara desert.

25|$|Tiwanaku {{expanded}} its <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Yungas and brought its culture {{and way of}} life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and the people of the Northern regions of Argentina and Chile. It was not exclusively a military or violent culture. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku used politics to create colonies, negotiate trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and establish state cults. Others were drawn to the Tiwanaku empire due to religious beliefs, as it continued to be an important religious center. On the northern end of the Titicaca basin, locals resisted the Tiwanaku expansion.|$|E

Filipescu was persuaded to do the same, helping with negotiations {{between the two sides}} in Dolj County and in Bucharest, where he also sponsored a reconciliation banquet. An anti-Filipescu wing of the Ionescu Conservatives, under Iulian Vrăbiescu survived and joined the PND, hampering negotiations over a merger between the latter and the PNR.|$|E

From that point on, until the 7th century, territorial control of the peninsula would be contested primarily by the Three Kingdoms of Korea.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of {{gastrulation}} is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingression of primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel. Primary mesenchyme cells, or PMCs, {{are located in the}} vegetal plate specified to become mesoderm. Prior to ingression, PMCs exhibit all the features of other epithelial cells that comprise the embryo. Cells of the epithelium are bound basally to a laminal matrix and apically to an extraembryonic matrix. The apical microvilli of these cells <b>reach</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hyaline layer, a component of the extraembryonic matrix. Neighboring epithelial cells are also connected to each other through apical junctions, protein complexes containing adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, linked to catenins.|$|E
