5|$|In {{addition}} to his main work—performing with Deep Purple and other bands during the 1970s and 1980s—he sang the role of Jesus in the original recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, performed in the charity supergroup Rock Aid Armenia, and engaged {{in a number of}} business investments and ventures, including a hotel, a motorcycle manufacturer, and music <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> at Kingsway Studios. More recently, he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in Deep Purple, and his work and affinity with Armenia, combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath, has led him to form the supergroup WhoCares with Iommi. His solo career outside of Deep Purple was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan's Inn box set in 2006.|$|E

25|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} European {{producers}} to fully exploit the possibilities of using multi-track <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> to create dramatic production effects and treatments that acted as musical and rhetorical elements in their own right, rather than mere gimmicks. He favoured sometimes harsh-sounding effects and contrasting audio spaces for each element in the mix. His best work stands in stark opposition to the smooth, 'evened-out' sound that predominated in most commercial pop and rock at that time.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Queen entered {{discussions with}} Trident Studios after being spotted at De La Lane Studios by John Anthony. After these discussions, Norman Sheffield offered the band a {{management}} deal under Neptune Productions, {{a subsidiary of}} Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use the facilities at Trident to record new material, whilst the management searched for a record label to sign Queen. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen {{were able to make}} use of the hi-tech <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> used by other musicians such as the Beatles and Elton John to produce new material.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, the ABC {{continued}} to recruit staff, including {{a greater proportion}} of women to replace men who had joined the armed forces. The organisation established reporting and <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> in a number of overseas locations, including the Middle East, Greece and around the Asia-Pacific region. An early challenge to its independence came in June, 1940 when wartime censorship was imposed, meaning that the Department of Information (headed by Sir Keith Murdoch) took control of the ABC's 7 p.m. nightly national news bulletin. This lasted until September, when control of the news was returned to the ABC after listeners expressed a preference for independent news presented by the Commission.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{the music}} and {{economics}} block was demolished. A new Performing Arts Centre and Modern Languages department was completed in September 2006. It includes a 300-seat auditorium for school concerts and productions, a musical recital hall, a drama/dance studio, <b>recording</b> <b>facilities,</b> a band room, a percussion room, {{and a number of}} classrooms where modern languages and music will be taught. The gala opening concert was in October 2006. Also in 2005, an extension to the school's dining hall which has been created as the new Junior School site. Coordinated with this development was the renovation of the 6th form common room to amalgamate the previously separated lower 6th and upper 6th quarters. The re-development allowed the site of the lower 6th form room to be converted to a library extension. The new common room included a tuck-shop, computer pods, and two miscellaneous annexes.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, {{immediately}} after the recording of Unconditionally Guaranteed, which markedly continued the trend towards a more commercial sound heard {{on some of the}} Clear Spot tracks, the Magic Band's original members departed. Disgruntled and past members worked together for a period, gigging at Blue Lake and putting together their own ideas and demos, with John French earmarked as the vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of Art Tripp III, Harkleroad and Boston, with the formation of Mallard, helped by finance and UK <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> from Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson. Some of French's compositions were used in the band's work, but the group's singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was eventually taken by John Thomas, who had shared a house with French in Eureka at the time. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Andy Di Martino produced both of these Virgin label albums.|$|E
25|$|The {{community}} {{radio station}} originally {{started out in}} 1995 when young residents staged the first Vale FM temporary licence broadcast (RSL) from Topcliffe House with funding from the HAT. A further broadcast took place in 1996, firmly establishing local support for a community broadcasting service in Castle Vale. This {{led to the creation}} of Castle Vale Community Radio (CVCR), also known as Vale FM. In 1998, the organisation's premises within Topcliffe House were completely fitted out with new facilities which included two broadcast studios, a training room, digital <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> and office space. Since 1997, the organisation has run fifteen radio skills training programmes for approximately 230 unemployed participants in partnership with East Birmingham College, part of City College Birmingham. In addition, a total of seventeen Restricted Service Licence (RSL) broadcasts have been staged, including five weekend broadcasts staged in partnership with other organisations. Further to this, a number of community - wide initiatives have been organised in conjunction with local organisations to facilitate the involvement of 350 young people in community radio activity.|$|E

500|$|The group taped eleven takes of [...] "Piggies" [...] before {{achieving}} the requisite performance.

With only 4-track <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> available in Studio 1, Lennon {{was present at the}} session but did not play on the basic track. Having attended London's Royal Academy of Music as a child, Thomas performed the harpsichord solo in an authentic classical style, according to Pollack, who highlights how [...] "the melody played by the last three fingers [...] alternates with a repeated note played by the thumb".|$|E

[...] They transferred their best efforts, including the opening of what became [...] "Echoes", to 16-track tape at smaller studios in London (namely AIR, and Morgan in West Hampstead) and resumed work with the advantage of more flexible recording equipment.

500|$|Box Car Racer was {{recorded}} over six weeks beginning in December 2001, primarily at Signature Sound in San Diego, California. Sessions commenced quickly, with producer Jerry Finn having sent one whole load of equipment to Signature {{ahead of his}} arrival. Barker and DeLonge worked out [...] "80 percent" [...] of the completed album in Barker's warehouse in Corona, California, two weeks prior to recording. When the musicians entered the studio, little was changed aside from certain lyrics, according to assistant engineer Sam Boukas. Barker completed his drum tracks in one day at two <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> in Los Angeles prior to the Signature sessions. DeLonge invited musician David Kennedy, whom he had met in the San Diego music circuit some years prior, to perform lead guitar parts on the album. Roger Joseph Manning Jr. plays keyboards on the record.|$|E
500|$|During the sessions, Emerick {{recorded}} McCartney's bass guitar amplifier via a loudspeaker, which Townsend had reconfigured {{to serve}} as a microphone, in order to give the bass more prominence than on previous Beatles releases. Although this particular technique was used only on the two songs selected for the May 1966 single, an enhanced bass sound was a feature of much of the album. Emerick also ensured a greater presence for Starr's bass drum, by inserting an item of clothing inside the structure, to dampen the sound, and then moving the microphone to just 3 inches from the drumhead and compressing the signal through a Fairchild limiter. MacDonald writes that, despite EMI Studios being technically inferior to many <b>recording</b> <b>facilities</b> in the United States, Starr's drumming on the album soon led to studios there [...] "being torn apart and put back together again", as engineers sought to replicate the innovative sounds achieved by the Beatles. The preference for close-miking instruments extended to the orchestral strings used on [...] "Eleanor Rigby", to achieve McCartney's request for a [...] "really biting" [...] sound, and the horns on [...] "Got to Get You into My Life". This was another break from convention, and the cause for alarm among the classically trained string players.|$|E
