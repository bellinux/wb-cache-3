50|$|The {{development}} of acetate, bakelite, and vinyl, {{and the production}} of radio broadcast transcriptions helped to solve this.Once these considerably more quiet compounds were developed, it was discovered that the rubber-idler-wheel driven turntables of the period {{had a great deal of}} low-frequency rumble - but only in the lateral plane. So, even though with all other factors being equal, the lateral plane of <b>recording</b> <b>on</b> <b>disc</b> had the higher fidelity, it was decided to record vertically to produce higher-fidelity recordings on these new `silent-surface' materials, for two reasons, the increase in fidelity and the incompatibility with home phonographs which, with their lateral-only playback systems would only produce silence from a vertically modulated disc.|$|E
