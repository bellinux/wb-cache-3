40|$|The ‘Tisovik’reserve, {{located in}} the Belarusian part of the Białowieża Forest, holds an {{isolated}} <b>relic</b> <b>stand</b> of silver fir, situated 120 km to the north-east of the main forest. In order to preserve this relic fir stand, a ancestral conservative tillage consisting of the Jd 92 trial (plot I) and the Jd 94 trial (plots II and III) was established between 1992 and 1994 in the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest on {{the territory of the}} Hajnówka Forest District. The growth and development of the progeny of 20 firs were characterized by means of long-term observations made in these trials. In 2000 (at the age of 18), the firs in the Jd 92 trial (plot I) reached an average height of 394. 86 cm with a mean diameter at breast height of 42. 42 mm and the average rate of survival amounted to 75 %. In the Jd 94 trial, the rate of fir survival on plot II was 70 % (at the age of 15) with an average height of 277. 08 cm and a diameter at breast height of 36. 62 mm, while on plot III only 50 trees with an average height of 198. 6 cm and a diameter at breast height of 24. 49 mm survived. The results of this study show that the fir progeny in the ‘Tisovik’ reserve is of high breeding value. Therefore, the silver fir seed stock of the ‘Tisovik’ reserve is suitable for the establishment of new plantations in the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest and the Mazury-Podlasie Region.

50|$|As regards Sebastian, the Depositio Martyrum {{remembers his}} death and his {{entombment}} in catacumbas on 20 January. Little is known about him: Saint Ambrose (end of the 5th century) tells that {{he was born in}} Milan and that suffered martyrdom in Rome during the persecution of Diocletian; the 5th-century Passio refers that he was a soldier from Narbonne, in Gaul, born of a family from Milan and died in Rome under Diocletian. His <b>relics</b> <b>stood</b> in the catacomb until the 9th century, then they were moved within the town walls and now are kept on the Appian Way again, in the Chapel of Saint Sebastian in the basilica above the cemetery.|$|R

40|$|On {{the bases}} of releves {{recognized}} to the Eastern sector of the Matese Mountain (South Apennines), we analyzed a synecological and syntaxonomical meaning of the dominated Acer opalus ssp. obtusatum, Tilia plathyphyllos, Ostrya carpinifolia e Acer cappadocicum subsp. lobelii forests. These broadleaved mixed woods, are belonging to the Tilio-Acerion Klika 1955 alliance (in the Fagetalia sylvaticae order, and Querco-Fagetea class). These fragmented coenoses, normally considered as <b>relics</b> <b>stands,</b> are located in specific morphological conditions (‘ravine woodlands’), like in the steep slopes and ravines, {{at the bottom of}} shady steep-sided valleys and on colluvial deep soils at the foot of slopes. We defined the new association Aro lucani-Aceretum lobelii, a typical Southern communities with high number of Endemic entities. The chorological analysis and a comparison with other Central and Southern Apennine similar forests, emphasize the Illirical floristic connotation and extraordinary biogeographical significance for the Molise region forests...|$|R
5000|$|The breadnut fruit disperses on {{the ground}} at {{different}} times throughout its range. It has a large seed covered by a thin, citrus-flavored, orange-colored skin favored by a number of forest creatures. More importantly, the large seed which is enveloped by the tasty skin is an edible ‘nut’ that can be boiled or dried and ground into a meal for porridge or flatbread. Breadnut is nutritious and has value as a food source, and may have formed a part of the diet of the pre-Columbian Maya of the lowlands region in Mesoamerica, although to what extent has been a matter of some debate among historians and archaeologists and no verified remains or illustrations of the fruit have been found at any Mayan archaeological sites.It was planted by the Maya civilization two thousand years ago and it has been claimed in several publications by Dennis E. Puleston to have been a staple food in the Maya diet,. [...] Puleston demonstrated a strong correlation between ancient Maya settlement patterns and the distribution of <b>relic</b> <b>stands</b> of ramon trees.|$|R
40|$|Populations of xerotolerant species (Achnatherum calamagrostis, Stipa crassiculmis subsp. picentina, are {{scattered}} along a wide altitudinal gradient on slopes at mid- and high elevation in Monti Picentini, a subcoastal mesozoic limestone ridge in Tyrrhenian Southern Italy. Their stands are widespread in grasslands of mostly secondary origin. At lower altitudes these grasslands replace former deciduous forest communities dominated by oaks or beech, while at higher altitudes {{they reach the}} summits, where they apparently merge into {{the remnants of the}} still partially grazed, zonal climatogenic, grasslands ranging above the local tree-line. Nevertheless primary stands of these grasslands are to be found around the many clusters of highly dynamic sites of the montane and sub-alpine levels, scattered around screes and rocky outcrops of the prevalently dolomitic morphology of the slopes. This virtual continuity of non arboreal communities across more than 1000 metres of the local topographical gradient, where azonal, <b>relic</b> <b>stands</b> of Pinus nigra s. l. are transitional between the grasslands and the surrounding zonal broadleaved forest vegetation, stresses patterns of the coenological changes between Festuco-Brometea and Elyno-Seslerietea along the catena, which suggest fragmentary persistence of a paleozonation...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} study {{tries to}} reveal the evolutionary history of polyploid complex Galium pusillum aiming on a rare czech endemic species G. sudeticum, an ideal model to study allopatric speciation {{in the context of}} Central European (post) glacial development. The species G. sudeticum grows in Krkonose Mts. and on serpentines in western Bohemia (Slavkovský les) more than 200 kilometers away. Our morphological and molecular data suggest a clearly different history of its two isolated areas. The populations in Krkonose Mts. are probable relics of mountainous species G. anisophyllon which was there on its northern border of occurence and hybridized with lowland species G. valdepilosum during postglacial vegetations shifts. This fact is well supported by intermediate position of Krkonose Mts. populations in both morphological and molecular AFLP analyses and by sharing the same chloroplast haplotype with geographically close lowland populations. On the other hand the serpentine lowland populations in western Bohemia are both morphologicaly and genetically indistinguishable from G. valdepilosum. Distinct genetic lineage of few populations belonging to G. valdepilosum (incl. one traditionaly referred as G. sudeticum) was found in western Bohemia and Bavaria, located on <b>relic</b> <b>stands</b> (calcareous and serpentine [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Spruce-fir {{forests in}} the Rocky Mountains consist mainly of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir. The {{breeding}} avifaunas in these forests show remarkable consistency in composition along a latitudinal gradient from Montana to Arizona and New Mexico, and with avian communities in the Hudsonian life zone in Washington, Oregon, and California. Woodpeckers, corvids, and seed-eating finches {{are the most common}} components. Only the Golden Eagle and a few other raptors are threatened or endangered. Few species winter in these high mountain forests. The distribution of many species is controlled primarily by the vegetation physiognomy, a variable {{under the control of the}} forest manager. Fire control and snag management will generally benefit the avifauna, whereas most forest harvesting practices adversely affect, to differing degrees the bird communities. It is suggested that the 2 ̆ 2 life-form 2 ̆ 2 approach to avian communities may be easily implemented in these forests. It is recommended that high elevation spruce-fir forests be minimally harvested and used as reservoirs for spruce-fir birds. Lower elevational stands should be managed for harvesting and bird diversity, with special attention given to <b>relic</b> <b>stands...</b>|$|R
6000|$|The great [...] "Egyptian Collection" [...] {{was well}} up in Broadway, and I got quite acquainted with Dr. Abbott, the proprietor--paid many visits there, and had long talks with him, in {{connection}} with my readings of many books and reports on Egypt--its antiquities, history, and how things and the scenes really look, and what the old <b>relics</b> <b>stand</b> for, as near as we can now get. (Dr. A. was an Englishman of say 54--had been settled in Cairo as physician for 25 years, and all that time was collecting these relics, and sparing no time or money seeking and getting them. By advice and {{for a change of}} base for himself, he brought the collection to America. But the whole enterprise was a fearful disappointment, in the pay and commercial part.) As said, I went to the Egyptian Museum many many times; sometimes had it all to myself--delved at the formidable catalogue--and on several occasions had the invaluable personal talk, correction, illustration and guidance of Dr. A. himself. He was very kind and helpful to me in those studies and examinations; once, by appointment, he appear'd in full and exact Turkish (Cairo) costume, which long usage there had made habitual to him.|$|R
