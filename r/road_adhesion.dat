Tyre runout and uneven load can cause magnet gap deformation in the motor, which will produce electromagnetic forces that further influence the vehicle rollover characteristics.

Next, the vehicle rollover characteristics both with and without electromagnetic force are analyzed under conditions of the Fixed Timing Fishhook steering and grade B road excitation.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{describes}} a longitudinal control strategy in time-varying <b>road</b> surface <b>adhesion</b> coefficient conditions, for a vehicle equipped with 4 in-wheel electric motors. The controller {{task is to}} ensure two main functions : braking (achieving an ABS-like function, i. e., no wheel skid), and traction control (TCS-like function, i. e., low wheel slip) using the electric motor torques as the unique actuators signal sources. The torque of electric motors is available almost instantaneously, unlike the torque generated by classic internal combustion engines. In addition, information about its values can be measured, starting from the current that passes through the motor, which means that advanced control techniques can be applied directly on the transmitted torque. In order to generate the appropriate anti-skid or anti-slip torque for each wheel, firstly an estimation of the instantaneous friction between the wheel and the road has to be made. Next, the maximum friction coefficient between the wheel and the road is computed {{with the help of}} an algorithm based on Dugoff tire model, without prior knowledge of the road conditions. Ultimately, the control strategy will compute a maximum torque that is allowed to be transmitted at the wheels in order to achieve TCS and ABS functions, along with a given reference speed to track. The only measures used in this strategy are the wheel acceleration, the instantaneous torque generated by the electric motors and the chassis acceleration...|$|R

40|$|Liquid cargo {{contained}} in a partly-filled tank is known to experience the sloshing movement when subjected to manoeuvre-induced disturbances. Large amplitude slosh can be induced within a partly-filled road tank vehicle under mild to severe directional manoeuvres, which could severely degrade the vehicle stability and directional control limits. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics slosh model is implemented for the partly-filled cleanbore and baffled tanks {{on the basis of}} the Navier-Stokes equations incorporating the VOF technique. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted to analyze the fluid slosh within a scale model tank with and without the baffles under continuous as well as single-cycle sinusoidal lateral and longitudinal acceleration excitations. The three-dimensional fluid slosh responses are further investigated for full scale baffled and unbaffled vehicle tanks using the validated fluid slosh model. The fluid slosh characteristics are analyzed under different fill volumes corresponding to a constant load and subjected to excitations representing steady-turning, straight-line braking, braking-in-turn and path change maneuvers. The fluid slosh analyses are also carried out to explore the anti-slosh effectiveness of baffles and to evaluate the effects of baffle design factors, such as equalizer and the orifice size. The influences of transient fluid slosh on the tank vehicle stability and responses are studied by incorporating the fluid slosh model to in-plane vehicle models. The two-dimensional roll-plane slosh models of partly-filled tanks of different cross-sections are integrated with the roll moment equilibrium of an articulated vehicle to derive the vehicle roll stability limits. The roll stability analyses are performed for circular and "Reuleaux triangular" tanks under the conditions of constant and variable cargo loads. The results attained are compared with the quasi-static solutions to demonstrate the role of transient slosh loads on the roll stability limits. The three-dimensional slosh model of a partly-filled tank is also integrated into a 7 -DOF pitch plane model of a tridem truck to analyze its straight-line braking characteristics in the presence of fluid slosh.

This option was only available for the French or LHD Export market and then only on the 3.0 V6 models. The functionality varied from car to car, but simply put the system affects steering control, at lower speeds less steering centering force aids parking and make city driving easier, but at higher speeds the system makes the steering heavier keeping you {{in a straight line}} on highways and suppressing the [...] "sneeze" [...] factor inherent to fast steering ratios. Another helpful function of DIRAVI is its ability to return the steering wheel to its central or neutral position when let go by the driver, even when the car is stationary. This is especially helpful when parking as the driver can be assured that his or her wheels will be in the correct position when the ignition is turned off; again this function also aids high speed, straight line driving on highways etc. Although an odd sensation to start with, most Citroën drivers become accustomed to DIRAVI in a very short time, only appreciating its unique abilities when they let go of the steering wheel in a car without DIRAVI, only to find nothing happens.

40|$|For a small {{electric}} vehicle (EV) with the rear two in-wheel motors, the hydraulic brake {{system and the}} mechanical brake system are installed at {{the front and rear}} tire respectively. The mechanical brake system is used at the rear tire because there is no enough space for the hydraulic brake system. In a braking condition, the in-wheel motor at the rear tire will generate the regenerative braking force and it can improve the braking performance of the vehicle. However, during braking on the low <b>adhesion</b> <b>road</b> surface, anti-lock brake system (ABS) is very crucial to prevent the tire from lock-up. To improve the safety and stability of the vehicle, the combination of anti-skid control system and direct yaw moment control system is proposed.

The control method of the regenerative brake timing control is same as ABS and it will turn on and off to prevent the tire from lock-up. On the other hand, the direct yaw moment control system is developed to increase the steer performance of the vehicle. The optimal control is used as the control strategy method to control the yaw moment.

40|$|Objective: The present paper {{identifies}} and {{assesses the}} effect of critical factors on the risk of motorcycle loss-of-control (LOC) crashes. Method: Data come from a French project on road crashes, which comprises all fatal road crashes and {{a random sample of}} 1 / 20 th of non-fatal crashes in France in 2011, based on police reports. A case-control study was carried out on a sample of 903 crashes for 444 LOC motorcycle riders (case) and 470 non-LOC and non-responsible motorcycle riders (control). The sample was weighted due to the randomization of non-fatal crashes. Missing values were imputed using multiple imputation. Results: Road alignment and surface conditions, human factors and motorcycle type played important roles in motorcycle LOC crashes. Riding in a curve was associated with a 3 -fold greater risk of losing control of motorcycle than riding in a straight line. Poor <b>road</b> <b>adhesion</b> significantly increased the risk of losing control; the risk increased more than 20 -fold when deteriorated <b>road</b> <b>adhesion</b> was encountered unexpectedly, due to loose gravel, ice, oil, bumps, road-marking, metal plates, etc. For motorcyclists, riding with a positive blood alcohol concentration (over or equal to the legal limit of 0. 5 g/l) was very dangerous, often resulting in losing control. The risk of LOC crash varied for different types of motorcycle: riders of roadsters and sports bikes {{were more likely to have}} a LOC crash than riders of basic or touring motorcycles. In addition, LOC risk increased with speed; a model using the square of the traveling speed showed better fit than one using speed itself. Conclusion: The LOC crash factors related to riders, vehicles and road infrastructure identified here were expected, but were rarely identified and taken simultaneously into account in previous studies.

The control scheme is a two-layer structure consisting of an upper yaw moment controller and a lower brake force distributor. The tractor and the trailer are, respectively, stabilized by two independent fuzzy logic based yaw moment controllers. The controllers for the tractor and the trailer are, respectively, designed to track the reference yaw rate of the tractor and the hitch angle between the tractor and the trailer while considering the variation of the hitch angular rate at the same time. The corrective yaw moments determined by the corresponding upper fuzzy yaw moment controllers are realized by active wheel braking. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated by simulations on a nonlinear vehicle model. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is robust and effective in stabilizing the severe instabilities such as jackknife and trailer oscillation in the chosen simulation scenarios.
