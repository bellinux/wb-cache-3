40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of internet}} in the automation field has brought new challenges in the <b>remote</b> control, <b>supervision</b> and management of industrial processes. Specifically, process data information has to be available anywhere/anytime on the internet. This brings together two main problems: process data abstraction and process data accessibility. In this paper, we present a specification for an environment aimed to virtually model industrial plants, for their <b>remote</b> control, <b>supervision</b> and management. In this environment, we model real industrial plants by means of communication objects called virtual industrial devices (VID). A VID is a software component, which may contain other VIDs and represents, with different degrees of abstraction, an entity of an industrial plant. These objects communicate and are accessible through a peer-to-peer industrial communication protocol that allows messaging interchange between virtual industrial devices (and graphic user interfaces) regardless the communication technology that supports the actual messaging...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Humanoid robotic {{manipulation}} in unstructured environments is a challenging problem. Limited perception, communications and environmental constraints present chal-lenges that prevent fully autonomous or purely teleoperated robots from reliably interacting with their environment. In {{order to achieve}} higher reliability in manipulation we present an approach involving <b>remote</b> human <b>supervision.</b> Strengths from both human operator and humanoid robot are leveraged through a user interface that allows the operator to perceive the remote environment through an aggregated worldmodel based on onboard sensing, while the robot can efficiently receive per-ceptual and semantic information from the operator. A template based manipulation approach has been successfully applied to the Atlas humanoid robot; we show real world footage of the results obtained in the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials 2013.

30|$|Two {{potential}} vulnerabilities of {{the simple}} ROCOV based DC grid protection proposed in [9] and possible challenges in selecting protection settings were illustrated: ① higher ROCOV settings can cause non-detection of high resistance faults far from the relay point as described in Section  3.1, ② a lower ROCOV settings can cause false tripping during the opening of breakers protecting adjacent lines as described in Section  3.2. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, it is proposed to augment the basic ROCOV based protection scheme with additional supervision by an under voltage element and by incorporating directional properties to the ROCOV relay through local and <b>remote</b> measurements. <b>Supervision</b> with under voltage elements helps avoiding false operation of ROCOV based detection due to noise in sensing and signal processing circuits [16].|$|R

50|$|The PRR's {{original}} 1915 electrification {{made use}} of four substations, at Arsenal Bridge, West Philadelphia, Bryn Mawr, and Paoli. The Arsenal Bridge substation stepped-up 13.2 kV, 25 Hz power supplied from PECO's Schuylkill power station on Christian Street to 44 kV for distribution. The remaining three substations reduced the 44 kV distribution voltage to 11 kV catenary voltage. The substations were operated from adjacent signal towers. They used typical period concrete buildings to house the transformers and switchgear while the line terminals were on the roof. From 1918 onward, outdoor stations were used and when the main line electrification began in 1928 the stations became large open air structures using lattice steel frameworks to mount the 132 kV terminations and switchgear. By 1935 new stations were connected to <b>remote</b> <b>supervision</b> systems allowing power directors to open and close switches and breakers from central offices {{without having to go}} through the tower operators.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Changing {{the current}} {{geographical}} maldistribution {{of the medical}} workforce is important for global health. Research regarding programs that train doctors for work with disadvantaged, rural populations is needed. This paper explores one approach of <b>remote</b> <b>supervision</b> of registrars in isolated rural practice. Researching how learning occurs without on-site supervision may also reveal other key elements of postgraduate education. Methods: Thematic analysis of in-depth interviews exploring 11 respondents’ experiences of learning via <b>remote</b> <b>supervision.</b> Results: <b>Remote</b> <b>supervision</b> created distinctive learning environments. Respondents’ attributes interacted with external supports to influence whether and how their learning was promoted or impeded. Registrars with clinical and/or life experience, who were insightful and motivated to direct their learning, turned the challenges of isolated practice into opportunities that accelerated their professional development. Discussion: <b>Remote</b> <b>supervision</b> was not necessarily problematic but instead provided rich learning for doctors training in and for the context where they were needed.

A variety of medical models of teleoncology exist to provide various medical oncology services.

40|$|Objectives: Telemedicine has revolutionised {{the ability}} to provide care to patients, relieve {{professional}} isolation and provide guidance and supervision to junior medical officers in rural areas. This study evaluated the Townsville teleoncology supervision model for the training of junior medical officers in rural areas of North Queensland, Australia. Specifically, the perspectives of junior and senior medical officers were explored to identify recommendations for future implementation. Design: A qualitative approach incorporating observation and semistructured interviews was used to collect data. Interviews were uploaded into NVivo 10 data management software. Template analysis enabled themes to be tested and developed through consensus between researchers. Setting: One tertiary level and four secondary level healthcare centres in rural and regional Queensland, Australia. Participants: 10 junior medical officers (Interns, Registrars) and 10 senior medical officers (Senior Medical Officers, Consultants) {{who participated in the}} Townsville teleoncology model of <b>remote</b> <b>supervision</b> via videoconference (TTMRS) were included in the study. Primary and Secondary outcome measures: Perspectives on the telemedicine experience, technology, engagement, professional support, satisfaction and limitations were examined. Perspectives on topics raised by participants were also examined as the interviews progressed. Results: Four major themes with several subthemes emerged from the data: learning environment, beginning the learning relationship, stimulus for learning and practicalities of <b>remote</b> <b>supervision</b> via videoconference. While some themes were consistent with the current literature, new themes like increased professional edge, recognising non-verbal cues and physical examination challenges were identified. Conclusions: <b>Remote</b> <b>supervision</b> via videoconference provides readily available guidance to trainees supporting their delivery of appropriate care to patients. However, resources required for upskilling, training in the use of supervision via videoconference, administration issues and nursing support, as well as physical barriers to examinations, must be addressed to enable more efficient implementation. ...|$|E

WasteWater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) {{are complex}} dynamic {{systems that are}} {{difficult}} to manage and that require long-term expertise and constant monitoring for efficient operation. In addition, in the case of vinasses treatment, producers are often small and medium entreprises (SMEs) that cannot afford the cost of a human expert available on a daily basis even though the environmental impact of a poor treatment of this wastewater is high. The TELEMAC European project aims at providing a set of tools to guarantee processes stability and efficiency, to decrease the functioning costs and to improve the use of derivative products.
