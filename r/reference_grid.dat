25|$|Analog scopes do not {{necessarily}} include a calibrated <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> for size measurement of waves, {{and they may not}} display waves in the traditional sense of a line segment sweeping from left to right. Instead, they could be used for signal analysis by feeding a reference signal into one axis and the signal to measure into the other axis. For an oscillating reference and measurement signal, this results in a complex looping pattern referred to as a Lissajous curve. The shape of the curve can be interpreted to identify properties of the measurement signal in relation to the reference signal, and is useful across a wide range of oscillation frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Spatial cues such as {{geometric}} boundaries or orienting landmarks {{are important}} examples of metric input. Place cells mainly rely on set distal cues rather than cues {{in the immediate}} proximal environment. Movement can also be an important spatial cue. The ability of place cells to incorporate new movement information is called path integration, {{and it is important}} for keeping track of self-location during movement. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the entorhinal cortex that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> of their external environment. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important contextual information. A change in color of a specific object can affect whether or not a place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, visuospatial sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.|$|E

500|$|In Chinese literature, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a map comes from the year 227 BCE, when the assassin Jing Ke was to present a map to Ying Zheng 嬴政, King of Qin (ruling later as Qin Shi Huang, r. 221–210 BCE) on behalf of Crown Prince Dan of Yan. Instead of presenting the map, {{he pulled out a}} dagger from his scroll, yet was unable to kill Ying Zheng. The Rites of Zhou (Zhouli), compiled during the Han and commented by Liu Xin in the 1st century CE, mentioned the use of maps for governmental provinces and districts, principalities, frontier boundaries, and locations of ores and minerals for mining facilities. The first Chinese gazetteer was written in 52 CE and included information on territorial divisions, the founding of cities, and local products and customs. Pei Xiu (224–271 CE) was the first to describe in detail the use of a graduated scale and geometrically plotted <b>reference</b> <b>grid.</b> However, historians Howard Nelson, Robert Temple, and Rafe de Crespigny argue that there is enough literary evidence that Zhang Heng's now lost work of 116 CE established the geometric <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> in Chinese cartography (including a line from the Book of Later Han: [...] " [...] cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it"). Although there is speculation fueled by the report in Sima's Records of the Grand Historian that a gigantic raised-relief map representing the Qin Empire is located within the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, it is known that small raised-relief maps were created during the Han dynasty, such as one made out of rice by the military officer Ma Yuan (14 BCE– 49 CE).|$|E
50|$|One way to {{construct}} the symbol is to delete the <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> entirely, and begin with a 14×14-pixel core centered on a 2×2 pixel white square. Then break it into 15×15 pixel blocks and insert the <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> between them.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{additional}} <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> {{rows and}} columns are inserted ±32 pixels from the center, making a 12-layer symbol 67×67 pixels. In this case, the 12th layer occupies rings ±31 and ±33 pixels from the center. The pattern continues indefinitely outward, with 15-pixel {{blocks of data}} separated by rows and columns of the <b>reference</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{manufacturing}} industries, {{these patterns}} {{are used for}} studying microscopic strain in materials: by deforming a grid {{with respect to a}} <b>reference</b> <b>grid</b> and measuring the moiré pattern, the stress levels and patterns can be deduced. This technique is attractive because the scale of the moiré pattern is much larger than the deflection that causes it, making measurement easier.|$|E
50|$|The keys shown grey in the figure, {{all being}} {{function}} keys, constitute {{the left and}} right function zones, while all other keys constitute the alphanumeric zone.

50|$|The 'Great Polish Map of Scotland', as it {{has been}} christened by the group {{planning}} to restore it, took six consecutive summers between 1974 and 1979 to construct, although the bulk of the work was accomplished by the late summer of 1976. In 1974, Trafas arrived in Scotland with his departmental colleague Roman Wolnik, surveyed the site and marked out the outline of the map to a scale of 1:10,000. The shapes of the mainland and islands were made with vertical shuttering and 300m, 600m and 900m contours laid in four-brick courses.
