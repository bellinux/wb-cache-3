40|$|Full-Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a {{cost-effective}} rehabilitation treatment for deteriorated pavements. However, when using asphalt emulsion based rehabilitation techniques {{one of the}} most challenging aspects of FDR is determining when traffic can be returned to the rehabilitated pavement surface. Since asphalt emulsion mixtures need ample time for curing, they cannot be sealed with a surface layer until the water has evaporated from the rehabilitated layer. It is often not possible to keep the road closed until all of the water has evaporated and the surface layer is placed, therefore, at some point the traffic needs to be returned to the rehabilitated surface. Determining when this point occurs, however, is still unclear. A laboratory raveling test run on Superpave Gyratory Compactor prepared samples simulates the raveling that can occur on the newly recycled pavement, and will be used in conjunction with inexpensive, simple tests {{that can be used in}} the field by agencies and contractors to determine if traffic can be released without causing damage to the rehabilitated pavement surface. Three mix designs were analyzed and used in conjunction to produce the emulsion and foam samples used in the testing. An optimum emulsion content was found and used to produce all of the samples. Based on a review of literature and an evaluation of practicality, four tests are recommended to be modeled for field use: British Pendulum Tester, Dynamic Friction Tester, a field-scale cohesiometer, and a <b>rebound</b> <b>tester.</b> The in-house testers were put through numerous tests on asphalt emulsion and asphalt foam samples. It was decided that of all of the testers, the one that showed the most potential was the Sweep Tester. Alterations to improve the devices were stated after all of the testing was completed...|$|E
40|$|Hardness" is an {{important}} yet diverse material physical property and is a key parameter in the mining industry in fields such as comminution, geotechnical and blast modelling. Several laboratory and field based measurement techniques exist to measure hardness (e. g. Point Load Testing, Vickers, Brinell, A∗b, BMWi, UCS), all are designed for specific applications. Current tests are generally destructive and require specific sample preparation procedures which results in high cost tests that are not conducted in adequate quantities to map hardness across an ore body. The EQUOtip <b>rebound</b> hardness <b>tester</b> is a device that has been developed for application in ore body hardness domaining within the AMIRA P 843 GeMIII Research Project. The rebound hardness test is non-destructive and suitable for application on half and whole diamond drill core. Data acquisition protocols and a data processing software application (EQProcess) {{have been developed to}} facilitate routine collection of comparative hardness information. This paper outlines the data acquisition and processing methodology and provides application examples of defining relative hardness domains in different geological deposit styles...|$|R
40|$|Polimerizatian is the {{critical}} stage to determine the quality of composites resin, this involves isolated monomer carbon double bonds being converted to an extended network of single bonds. Physical and mechanical properties of composites {{are influenced by the}} level of conversion attained during polymerization. An adequate light intensity and light curing time are important to obtain the degree of polymerization. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the difference of the hardness nanocomposites which activated by LED LCU based on the variation of curing times. This study is a true experimental research. The samples were made from nanocomposites material with cylinder form of 4 mm in depth, 6 mm in diameter. This samples divided into 3 groups of curing times. Group, I was cured for 20 's curing time as a control due to manufactory recommended; Group II was cured for 30 's, and Group III was cured for 40 's and the hardness (<b>Rebound</b> hardness <b>tester)</b> was determined using Rebound scale (RS) and converted by Mohs scale (MS). There was a very significant level of hardness rate from each group using ANOVA test. The result of the study concludes that there were the differences on the nanocomposites hardness level cured under different curing times 20, 30 and 40 sec. The longer of curing times, the higher level of hardness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A new {{approach}} to portable hardness testers has been developed and introduced. It {{makes it possible to}} inspect hardness by one and the same hardness tester applying both, the ultrasonic contact impedance method and <b>rebound</b> method. Hardness <b>tester</b> wide possibilities which allow to inspect hardness of metal and alloy products with all standardized scales (Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers and Shore) have been demonstrated. The possibility to improve the precision of portable hardness testers of this type by calibrating them for each of the above listed scales with hardness reference blocks only without any conversion tables has been shown. Experiments and real measurements conducted on cold rolls showed that change in hardness of a hardened layer in depth and surface stresses influence can be disclosed in the process of hardness measurement by portable combined hardness tester by two different methods...|$|R
40|$|The metal cobalt is {{essential}} in creating a sustainable society, as {{it is an important}} component in lithium- ion batteries and wind energy turbines. About half of the Earth’s land-based cobalt reserves {{can be found in the}} Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study focusses on characterising cobalt-bearing copper ore from a DRC based mining operation and linking characteristic ore properties to the comminution behaviour. Portable X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF) is used to determine the geochemistry, while QEMSCAN, CT scan and InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy are used to assess mineralogy on different length scales. In terms of geotechnical properties, the surface hardness of the ore is determined using a <b>rebound</b> hardness <b>tester.</b> The comminution behaviour is assessed by crushing selected ore samples below 3. 35 mm and by grinding the crushed samples for 21 minutes using a ball mill. The energy consumption required for different ore types is quantified using the crushing and sieving simulation package Bruno. The chemical characterisation of ore samples showed significant variation in cobalt content, as the cobalt grade measured in the samples using pXRF varied from 0 % to 33. 5 %. By applying QEMSCAN analysis to samples coming from different locations within the deposit, two different mineralogical zones have been identified: a weathered, and a sulphide zone, with large differences in modal mineralogy. In the weathered zone kolwezite and heterogenite are the principal cobalt bearing minerals, in the sulphide zone carrollite is the only mineral containing cobalt. The CT scan confirmed the unique mineralogy of certain samples, as the mineralogy of pure carrollite nodules found using QEMSCAN showed to continue in 3 D. Both QEMSCAN and CT scan were able to detect differences in mineral texture of the studied samples. In terms of geotechnical properties, differences between surface hardness of the samples were observed using the <b>rebound</b> hardness <b>tester.</b> An empirical formula has been derived to adjust the measured surface hardness of drill core samples with a mass below 300 grams. This formula aided in identifying the differences in surface hardness for the distinct mineral textures of the sulphide zone. Influence of mineralogy on the sur- face hardness has been observed, as areas containing only carrollite showed to have a lower surface hardness than areas with a mixture of Mg silicates, quartz and carrollite. Fourier Transformed IR (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to identify a range of gangue minerals within the samples. Carrollite could be identified if it was present in significant proportions and no other IR active minerals were present. FTIR spectroscopy also allowed to refine mineralogical data, as it was possible to differentiate between talc or serpentine and muscovite or illite in the studied samples, which was not possible using QEMSCAN. In total 8 minerals were identified using IR spectroscopy. The relative proportions of the modal mineralogy showed to be in agreement with the mineralogy found through QEMSCAN. The comminution experiments led to the identification of three different comminution classes. These three classes can again be linked to the identified mineral texture types. The surface hardness showed to be correlated to the p 80 of samples with the same mineral texture. After 21 minutes of milling, the samples with a higher surface hardness had a coarser p 80. Simulation showed that the crushing energy requirements differ up to a maximum of 27 % for different comminution classes. This research provides a foundation towards identification of geometallurgical domains in the sulphide section of the investigated cobalt-bearing copper deposit. This MSc thesis was carried out at Camborne School of Mines (University of Exeter) as part of the NERC funded Cobalt: Geology, Geomicrobiology and Geometallurgy (CoG 3) project. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{hardness}} of coal was estimated using a Shore Scleroscope <b>Rebound</b> Hardness (SSRH) <b>tester.</b> SSRH {{can be related}} to fracture toughness and strength, and was trialled as a quick field test to illustrate variability in these properties for coal seam gas reservoirs. Therefore, samples were selected to include different coal ranks and lithotypes from a suite of boreholes that intersect Permian coal seams within the Bowen Basin in Queensland, Australia. The tests were conducted unconfined on slabbed coal core and confined on epoxy encased coal blocks used for coal petrographic examination. The test results of the unconfined samples show that the hardness varies with lithotype. It increases with decreasing amount of bright bands, moreso than coal rank or thermal maturity. The test results of the confined samples show little variation with lithotype, but show a parabolic correlation of hardness with rank, similar to the behaviour found with Hardgrove Grindability tests. The resulting fractures of the SSRH test were analysed under the microscope to understand the fracture pattern, which can be scaled up to understand fracture propagation in natural systems and when induced in gas reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Charnockitic rock {{is one of}} the {{varieties}} of crystalline rocks that dot the face of the earth. Its reputation for aesthetics tends to impact a high economic value on it. This warrants more understanding of its petrographical, physical and mechanical properties. Its field and petrographic relationship in Akure area has been reported but the physico-mechanical characteristics have not enjoyed discuss and reportage. Its petro-physico-mechanical characteristics were therefore studied so as to improve on the knowledge and understanding of the rock type in general and that of Akure area in particular. The petrography of the photomicrographs of the thin sections were analysed with the aid of ImageJ. Instron Universal Tester was used to determine the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) while Schmidt Rebound Hammer and Roclab software were used for the estimations of the UCS for validity, reliability and reproducibility of results. The abrasion tester was used to determine the abrasion resistance (Ha) while the aggregate impact value (AIV) apparatus was used for the aggregate impact value. The results showed that mineralogically, the rock consisted of the following as major mineral: plagioclase, biotite, quartz, hypersthene, hornblende, muscovite and orthoclase with the following respectively as modal composition: 32 %, 16 %, 16 %, 16 %, 11 %, 4 % and 3 % while opaque minerals and zircon with 1 % each are accessories. A value of 2. 81 g/cc was determined as the density while the porosity, AIV and Ha were respectively 0. 03, 11 and 33. 40. The Young’s Modulus was evaluated to be 10. 40 KN/mm.
