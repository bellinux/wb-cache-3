The Y male sex-determining chromosome, as it is inherited only by males from their fathers, is almost identical along the patrilineal line. This leads to a less precise analysis than if autosomal chromosomes were testing, because of the <b>random</b> <b>matching</b> that occurs between pairs of chromosomes as zygotes are being made.|$|E

To estimate the vote for <b>random</b> <b>matches</b> we approximate the voting function by a discrete function and use the binomial distribution. The resulting probability distribution of votes for <b>random</b> <b>matches</b> is compared with experiments that {{have a set of}} artificially generated, randomly distributed points as input. We find that the theoretical model accurately predicts the votes for <b>random</b> <b>matches</b> for most of the object models that we used.

In a noise free situation this technique will find only the correct object model. In real life applications, however, spurious measurement features will occur and noise will compromise the (positional) accuracy [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} test for detecting answer copying on multiple-choice items is presented. The test {{is based on}} the exact null distribution of the number of <b>random</b> <b>matches</b> between two test takers under the assumption that the response process follows a known response model. The null distribution can easily be generalized to the family of distributions of the number of <b>random</b> <b>matches</b> under the alternative hypothesis of answer copying. It is shown how this information can be used to calculate such features as the maximum, minimum, and expected values of the power function of the test.

50|$|A Y-STR {{is a short}} {{tandem repeat}} (STR) on the Y-chromosome. Y-STRs are often used in forensics, paternity, and genealogical DNA testing.Y-STRs are taken {{specifically}} from the male Y chromosome. These Y-STRs provide a weaker analysis than autosomal STRs because the Y chromosome is only found in males, which are only passed down by the father, making the Y chromosome in any paternal line practically identical. This causes a significantly smaller amount of distinction between Y-STR samples. Autosomal STRs provide a much stronger analytical power because of the <b>random</b> <b>matching</b> that occurs between pairs of chromosomes during the zygote making process.|$|E
50|$|It is non-trivial to {{implement}} the random selection of r-regular graphs efficiently and in an unbiased way, since most graphs are not regular. The pairing model (also configuration model) is a method which takes nr points, and partitions them into n buckets with r points in each of them. Taking a <b>random</b> <b>matching</b> of the nr points, and then contracting the r points in each bucket into a single vertex, yields an r-regular graph or multigraph. If this object has no multiple edges or loops (i.e. it is a graph), then it is the required result. If not, a restart is required.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of bias arises because the apparent difference in outcome {{between these two}} groups of units may depend on characteristics that affected {{whether or not a}} unit received a given treatment instead of due to the effect of the treatment per se. In randomized experiments, the randomization enables unbiased estimation of treatment effects; for each covariate, randomization implies that treatment-groups will be balanced on average, by the law of large numbers. Unfortunately, for observational studies, the assignment of treatments to research subjects is typically not <b>random.</b> <b>Matching</b> attempts to mimic randomization by creating a sample of units that received the treatment that is comparable on all observed covariates to a sample of units that did not receive the treatment.|$|E
40|$|In cases {{involving}} scientific {{evidence in the}} form of a test result linking the accused to a crime (e. g., DNA match), expert testimony sometimes can also provide a suitably reliable estimate of the chance of a coincidental <b>match</b> (the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability). Considerable controversy, however, attends the question of whether to allow testimony reporting that probability and, if so, in what form it should be given. Additional and related controversy concerns the implications of proficiency test results for testimony about the chance of false positive lab error, especially when that figure greatly exceeds the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability. This paper reports a large scale empirical study, using members of an Illinois jury pool, designed to contribute to our understanding of the issues involved. Our results confirm earlier research suggesting that jurors, rather than being credulously overwhelmed by the science, tend to undervalue forensic match evidence. On the other hand, our results differ from most prior research in showing that variation in the way the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability is presented and explained can reduce the extent of the undervaluation, without at the same time inviting inferential fallacies that would exaggerate the probative value of the match. And contrary to predictions, our results also show that incorporating information about comparatively large lab error rates, when it has any discernible effect, actually increases the jurors 2 ̆ 7 assessed probability of guilt and willingness to convict...|$|R
40|$|When a Y-chromosomal and a (partial) {{autosomal}} DNA profile {{are obtained}} from one crime sample, and both profiles match the suspect's profiles, {{we would like}} to know the combined evidential value. To calculate the likelihood ratio of observing the autosomal and Y-chromosomal DNA profiles combined, we need to know the conditional <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability of the observed autosomal DNA profile, given the Y-chromosomal match. We examine this conditional probability in two ways: (1) with a database containing data of 2, 085 men and (2) using a simulation model. We conclude that if the Y-chromosomal DNA profiles match, we can still regard the autosomal DNA profile as independent from the Y-chromosomal DNA profile if the matching person is not a descendant of the father of the donor of the (crime) sample. The evidential value can, in that case, be computed by multiplying the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probabilities of the individual profiles. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|When {{evaluating}} {{the strength of}} DNA evidence for proving that two samples have a common source, one must consider two fac-tors. One factor is {{the probability of a}} coincidental match (some-times called the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability). A coincidental match occurs when two different people have the same DNA profile. The second factor is the probability of a false positive. A false positive (as we use that term here) occurs when a laboratory erroneously reports a DNA match between two samples that actually have dif-ferent profiles. A false positive might occur due to error in the col-lection or handling of samples, misinterpretation of test results, or incorrect reporting of test results (1 – 3). Either a coincidental match or a false positive could cause a laboratory to report a DNA match between samples from different people. Consequently, one must consider both the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability and the false positive probability {{in order to make a}} fair evaluation of DNA evidence...|$|R

Y-STR analysis was performed in the Sally Hemings controversy to determine if Thomas Jefferson had sired a son with one of his slaves.The analysis of the Y-chromosome yields weaker results than autosomal chromosome analysis. The Y male sex-determining chromosome, as it is inherited only by males from their fathers, is almost identical along the patrilineal line.

40|$|Bayes 2 ̆ 7 rule is {{not being}} used to guide jury decisionmaking in the vast {{majority}} of criminal cases involving evidence of DNA testing. Instead of telling juries the 2 ̆ 2 source probability 2 ̆ 2 -the probability that the individual whose DNA matches was the source of the forensic evidence found at the crime scene-experts only present pieces of the puzzle. They provide the probability that a randomly selected innocent person would have a match or the expected number of innocent matches in the database. In some cases, the <b>random</b> <b>match</b> probability will be so low (one in a quadrillion) that the resulting source probability is practically one hundred percent.

This Article shows that a correct application of Bayes 2 ̆ 7 rule should lead fact finders and litigants to focus on the size of two variables that influence the source probability: the probability that a nonsource in the DNA database would have an alibi, and the probability that the source of the DNA is included in the database.
