40|$|AbstractInnovation {{remains a}} complex {{phenomenon}} {{and the task}} of managing it at the Regional Innovation Systems (<b>RIS)</b> <b>architecture</b> level is discussed herein, namely involving joint initiatives, close to organizational realities and their competitive advantages, up and beyond the uncertainty that surrounds Governmental R&D Investment (GRI) effectiveness, either due to misuse or ineffective, application of resources. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) modelling {{was applied to the}} study of RIS structure, aiming to identify the ‘hidden’ mediating variables that may influence the overall effect of GRI on economic and employment growth. In general, Absorptive Capacity, is the most rapid and balanced development strategy for regions characterised by environments, which are adverse to change and innovation, and characterized by low industrialization and income levels...|$|E

A major challenge faced by {{information system is}} system reconfiguration, namely capability to quickly respond to changes of the system. Based on description {{of the concept of}} reconfigurable information systems, the idea of component was introduced into design and implementation of Reconfigurable Information System (<b>RIS).</b> Overall <b>architecture</b> and implementation method of reconfigurable information system based on component was analyzed in detail. Specific design of RIS based on component was provided combining with design and development of specific document transmitting system based on CORBA middleware platform...|$|R
40|$|Integration of RIS and PACS {{services}} into {{a single}} solution has become a widespread reality in daily radiological practice, allowing substantial acceleration of workflow with greater ease of work compared with older generation film-based radiological activity. In particular, the fast and spectacular recent evolution of digital radiology (with special reference to cross-sectional imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI) has been paralleled {{by the development of}} integrated RIS [...] PACS systems with advanced image processing tools (either two- and/or three-dimensional) that were an exclusive task of costly dedicated workstations until a few years ago. This new scenario is likely to further improve productivity in the radiology department with reduction of the time needed for image interpretation and reporting, as well as to cut costs for the purchase of dedicated standalone image processing workstations. In this paper, a general description of typical integrated <b>RIS</b> [...] PACS <b>architecture</b> with image processing capabilities will be provided, and the main available image processing tools will be illustrated...|$|R
