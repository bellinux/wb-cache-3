Accordingly, records relating to Hunthum's title were at best ignored by the British, and possibly destroyed in support of their competing claim made against the Dutch throne later.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a report}} by the Law Reform Commission, the system of feudal tenure as such, in so far as it had survived, was {{abolished}} by the Oireachtas in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act (no. 27 of 2009); fee tail was also abolished http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/. However, estates and interests in land, including incorporeal hereditaments, continue. Formerly registered or proven feudal titles with a solid <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> and the submerged feudal titles of surviving Irish or British peers are not affected, and continue to exist as personal rights, now held in gross. However, the obsolete or unregistered feudal titles, and those that lapsed into desuetude after 1662, when the Irish Parliament passed the Abolition of Tenures Act, no longer exist as incorporeal hereditaments, nor as personal rights, and cannot be revived.|$|E

This Note looks at the common <b>roots</b> <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> IX and the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that allowed boys’ participation in field hockey. It then examines Title IX as it applies to the MIAA field hockey policy and determines that the Massachusetts Policy does not, in and of itself, create a violation. This Note further suggests that even if the policy did violate Title IX, policy implications suggest that using Title IX to invalidate another provision designed to promote gender equality is unwise. Finally, this Note identifies a number of gender-neutral alternatives to deal with the legitimate problems posed by the participation of boys in what are traditionally girls’ sports...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, as the {{international}} community considered the status of Jerusalem to be unresolved, even after 1967, and did not deem {{any part of the}} city to be Israeli territory, including that part held since 1948, UNSC 242 did not settle territorial issues between Israel and Palestine left unresolved by the 1949 Armistice Agreements. Indeed, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht and others have argued that, because of the disorder in Palestine at the time, the territorial framework of the 1947 Partition Plan did not come into effect {{in such a way as}} to ipso jure grant Israel sovereignty over the territory allocated to the Jewish state under that plan. Stone agrees with Lauterpacht's analysis, and his view that sovereignty was acquired through other means:Lauterpacht has offered a cogent legal analysis leading to the conclusion that sovereignty over Jerusalem has already vested in Israel. His view is that when the partition proposals were immediately rejected and aborted by Arab armed aggression, those proposals could not, both because of their inherent nature and because of the terms in which they were framed, operate as an effective legal re-disposition of the sovereign title. They might (he thinks) have been transformed by agreement of the parties concerned into a consensual <b>root</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> but this never happened. And he points out that the idea that some kind of title remained in the United Nations is quite at odds, both with the absence of any evidence of vesting, and with complete United Nations silence on this aspect of the matter from 1950 to 1967?... In these circumstances, that writer is led to the view that there was, following the British withdrawal and the abortion of the partition proposals, a lapse or vacancy or vacuum of sovereignty. In this situation of sovereignty vacuum, he thinks, sovereignty could be forthwith acquired by any state that was in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means.|$|E

Is it a force for evil, even 'the <b>root</b> <b>of</b> all evil'?"—the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> a short British television series presented by Richard Dawkins. Ward states his view that the assertion that religion does more harm than good ignores [...] "the available evidence from history, from psychology and sociology, and from philosophy" [...] and suggests that proponents of this view [...] "refuse to investigate the question in a properly rigorous way, and substitute rhetoric for analysis". He suggests {{that it is impossible to}} give a satisfactory universal definition of religion, and that early opponents of religion such as Edward Taylor, James Frazer and Émile Durkheim were indulging in [...] "scholarly fantazising" [...] about forms of primitive religion which were refuted by more rigorous studies such as Theories of Primitive Religion by Evans-Pritchard. [...] "Unfortunately some writers have not yet realised this", such as Daniel Dennett in Breaking the Spell, who [...] "does not seem to realise that the spell was broken as long ago as 1884 when E.
