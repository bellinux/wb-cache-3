5000|$|Cyril John Freezer (19 February 1924 - 19 May 2009) was an English <b>railway</b> <b>modeller,</b> writer, and {{magazine}} editor. He edited <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> from 1950 to 1978, and Model Railways from 1978 until 1983. He also wrote many articles for Model Railroader. Freezer popularised the 'terminus to fiddle yard layout', {{is credited with}} inventing the [...] "rabbit warren layout", and published many books on model railway, {{many of which are}} considered classics in the field.|$|E
50|$|The rabbit warren was invented, or {{at least}} given its first UK prominence, by C. J. Freezer, {{long-term}} editor of <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> magazine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> is {{a monthly}} British {{magazine}} about Model Railways published by Peco. It {{has been in}} publication since 1949 and is still Britain's most popular model railway title.|$|E
50|$|Peco Publications and Publicity Ltd {{publishes the}} monthly {{magazines}} <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> and Continental Modeller, {{as well as}} a large range of booklets explaining wiring, scenics, baseboard construction, outdoor railways, and similar topics.|$|E
50|$|Minories is a 'deceptively simple' {{design for}} a model railway layout, {{designed}} by C. J. Freezer. The design {{was first published in}} <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> in 1957 and it became a regular of Peco's many collected plans books afterwards. It is notable as an influential design, more than as a single instance of the model. The design was an attempt to model an interesting urban passenger terminus in the minimum space, allowing much opportunity for operating trains, rather than scenic modelling. Freezer was the editor of <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> and Minories, with its developments, made regular appearances throughout the years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{model is}} powered by a small, 12 V [...] "HP motor" [...] of the same type as used in Scalextric slot cars. As a result, the {{locomotive}} has drawn complaints from <b>railway</b> <b>modellers</b> that the motor is too fast for the engine to be realistic, with poor low-speed response. As a result, it is usually regarded as a toy, rather than a model. It does not come with DCC capability, although can be converted.|$|R
50|$|A {{companion}} magazine {{from the}} same publisher (Atlantic), Modellers' BackTrack, ran from April/May 1991 to February/March 1995, alternating months with the, then bi-monthly, main title. Initially edited by David Jenkinson, then by him with Barry C. Lane and latterly by Lane alone, it aimed to provide prototype information relative to <b>railway</b> <b>modellers,</b> including scale drawings, and features on high-quality models and layouts. After vol.4, no.6 it was subsumed into the main title, which went monthly at that point.|$|R
50|$|Eisenbahn Kurier (German for Railway Courier), or EK, is {{a monthly}} {{magazine}} published in Freiburg, Germany, whose {{focus is on}} railway and model railway themes. Its target audience is <b>railway</b> <b>modellers</b> and model <b>railway</b> fans, as well as railway experts and employees. With a monthly print run of about 40,000 copies, EK {{is one of the}} biggest railway magazines in Germany. The magazine is produced by its own publisher, EK Verlag, which is registered in the Freiburg Trade Register. Its manager is Dierk Lawrenz, Handeloh.|$|R
50|$|David Jenkinson (6 August 1934 - 27 April 2004) was a <b>railway</b> <b>modeller</b> and historian, {{who had a}} {{particular}} interest in the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and {{was president of the}} LMS Society.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} rabbit warrens {{continued}} through the 1970s. The Far Tottering and Oysterperch, modelled on Rowland Emett's Far Tottering and Oyster Creek Railway featured in <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller,</b> as did a number of Santa-themed Christmas layouts.|$|E
5000|$|British TT is 3 mm scale; that is, 1:101.6. The [...] "Three Millimetre Society" [...] is a British-based {{society which}} caters for <b>railway</b> <b>modellers</b> of 3 mm scale. This society {{was formed in}} 1965, eight years after Tri-ang Railways, a British railway {{manufacturer}} introduced model locomotives and rolling stock, {{in what was then}} a new model railway scale in Britain, known as 'TT' or 'TT3' in 1960. The aims of the society are to encourage modellers working in this scale and it produces a quarterly magazine and assists with the production of locomotive and rolling stock kits, components and the supply of secondhand items and spares.|$|R
2500|$|In O scale, an exact-scale working {{miniature}} {{version of}} the [...] "Alliance" [...] coupler was manufactured from the 1980s by GAGO models in Australia. Since 2002 it has been marketed by the Waratah Model <b>Railway</b> Company. European <b>modellers</b> tend to use scale hook and chain couplings.|$|R
5000|$|During the Victorian era {{a number}} of factors led to large demand for cranes, {{particularly}} the number of major construction projects being undertaken and the large volumes of goods to lift in factories, railways and canals.Railways, docks, canals and construction sites used large numbers of small steam cranes, either mounted on quays or on railway wheels so they could be moved around site, usually four wheels but occasionally more for larger cranes. A number of local firms in Leeds produced quite similar designs with the jib and boiler counterbalanced around a tall column pivot. These very stable machines are often refared to as 'Leeds Type' cranes.Significant construction sites to use Booths cranes include the Tower Bridge, as this {{had a great deal of}} metal framework many cranes were required in its construction. The steam cranes used in the Tower Bridge construction have been included in scenes from the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film. One less successful project to employ Booths cranes was the Wembley Park Tower project. The Wembley Park Tower was meant to be London's rival to the Eiffel Tower in Paris but was however dogged by financial problems. In 1902 the Railway Magazine commented [...] "If the Wembley Tower Company could have raised the money as quickly as these cranes raised the girders, the growth of the tower would not have ceased so abruptly." [...] A less glamorous project was the Northern Outfall Sewer in London however company advertising of the time mentioned that their cranes could be seen at work here.Some larger rail mounted cranes were produced for the railways for use as breakdown cranes and in the Civil Engineering departments. A particularly well known examples of these being the ten 8 wheel cranes supplied to BR's Western Region in 1958/59 as these became well known to many <b>railway</b> <b>modellers</b> as a result of the kit that was available from Airfix, Booths helped Airfix produce this model by supplying various plans to the firm. Other railway civil engineering cranes include those used to build the Lower Zambezi BridgeFrom 1898 Booths were producing electrically powered cranes. Producing the motors in house the components were also put to use in other products. Booths produced battery locomotives for mines and industry under the 'Union' brandname. and battery trucks and tractors for factories.As well as complete cranes the company produced winches and hoists which found many uses in the factories of the timeFrom 1875 onwards Booths made large numbers of overhead cranes for use in factories. The Sultan of Morocco had a Booths crane and this was put to use lifting the stills used for the production of perfumes for the palace harem. In later years as the railways declined overhead cranes became the bulk of the business and sales of rail mounted cranes declined.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} in the <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> of February 1989 that Dapol had bought the former Trix/British Liliput range from Ernest Rosza. The Dapol 1989 catalogue also showed that the Model-Land building range had been bought.|$|E
50|$|Railways were an {{interest}} of Foxell from childhood {{when he became}} aware of the Metropolitan Line while cycling to and from school near Chorleywood Common in Hertfordshire. He got a summer job as a cleaner at Neasden LNER locomotive sheds where the other workers were mainly Italian prisoners of war. In later life he travelled thousands of miles on the Metropolitan Line and wrote many books about its history and workings as well as several local history works, most of which were self-published. A keen <b>railway</b> <b>modeller,</b> Foxell built his own replica of Rickmansworth station and an N gauge circuit which featured in <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> magazine in July 2013.|$|E
50|$|The Dapol {{brand name}} {{was first used}} in a <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> advert of September 1983. The first Dapol wagons (for OO) were {{announced}} to become available on the 20th November 1983. From 1 March 1984 ex Airfix railway kits became available.|$|E
50|$|On Awdry's model railway, Toby was {{represented}} by a Y6, an 0-4-0 locomotive similar to but smaller than the J70 and better suited to the 4-wheel motor bogie available to power the model. In 1961, Awdry wrote an article for <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> magazine {{on the construction of}} this locomotive.|$|E
5000|$|Born in east London, Freezer {{was educated}} at Barking Abbey School. Training as an {{engineer}} in a dockyard on the Isle of Dogs and working for Associated Press, he started {{as editor of the}} <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> magazine. The first edition he was responsible for was August - September 1950.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, Allan founded Trains Illustrated magazine, {{which became}} Modern Railways in 1965. Buses Illustrated was {{introduced}} in 1949 {{as well as the}} <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller.</b> In 1950, the company moved to larger premises on the Hampton Court Road. In 1957, the Locomotive Publishing Company was acquired and its collection of 25,000 glass negatives became part of the Ian Allan collection. In addition, its publication the Locomotive was incorporated into Trains Illustrated.|$|E
50|$|Such {{quarries}} {{were first}} modelled in the 1970s with Dave Rowe's Under Milk Wood diorama boxes. In 1995 <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> {{returned to its}} rabbits with Chwarel, a realistic, but warrened, Welsh slate quarry plan. In deference to better running, this used three flat , linked by inclines and a water balance lift. The scale now was O16.5 (7 mm scale on 16.5 mm track) on an 8 x 3 ft baseboard.|$|E
50|$|The {{train is}} formed of two {{modified}} former KiHa 47 diesel cars, renumbered KiRoShi 47 9176 (car 1) and KiRoShi 47 3505 (car 2), and {{is intended to}} replicate the design and ambiance of the luxury Brill coaches purchased by the Kyushu Railway in 1908, just before the company was nationalized.The rebuilding project was overseen by industrial designer Eiji Mitooka, and was based on scale models of the original coaches built by the <b>railway</b> <b>modeller</b> Nobutaro Hara.|$|E
5000|$|However 5.5mm scale {{remained}} in use and, following {{an article on}} the Gwynant Valley Railway by Malcolm Savage in <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller,</b> October 1984, the 5.5mm Association was formed. The tooling for the GEM kits was purchased by Malcolm Savage in 1996 and he has now reintroduced and upgraded the range. Worsley Works has also produced [...] "scratch aids" [...] for the scale. More recently, 3D printing techniques have expanded the range of available models even further, while in the USA there's a quietly flourishing 3' gauge modelling fraternity, using OO track and mechanisms. http://www.55n3.org/ ...|$|E
50|$|Later in {{the year}} the <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> carried a two-page profile of the new concern with the upbeat title An {{exciting}} new model empire. A lot of David Boyle's background was explored. Some of Dapol's ambitions were frustrated. That article said that the Austerity 2-8-0 and the LMS Beyer Garratt were both under development for 1985 but they never appeared from Dapol. However the L&YR Pug, the Austerity 0-6-0ST and the GWR Hawksworth County which were announced early in 1984 were all produced promptly, well reviewed and have had long model lives. At this time the operation was headquartered in Navigation Road, Northwich.|$|E
5000|$|Fiddle yards {{were first}} built by British modellers {{so that they}} could build small layouts and operate them in a {{realistic}} manner. The first well-known model railway to use them was 'Maybank', which was exhibited at the 1939 Model Railway Club exhibition in London. This was an urban passenger terminus that led directly into a fiddle yard, hidden beneath a locomotive depot above it. It had an influence on C. J. Freezer, who as editor of <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller,</b> would later go on to popularise them. In the 1950s he described the [...] "Fiddle Yard to Terminus" [...] layout, and used it for his influential 'Minories' design.|$|E
5000|$|From 1975 to 1981 Airfix also {{manufactured}} {{a line of}} ready-to-run {{model railway}} stock in OO gauge ( [...] scale). Based on British prototypes, they improved in detail and prototype accuracy compared to British outline model railway stock from other British ready-to-run manufacturers such as Hornby. The product range expanded fairly rapidly {{in the first few}} years. A model of a Great Western Railway (GWR) 0-4-2 autotank steam locomotive and GWR autocoach are amongst some of the many memorable and important product releases. Airfix also offered an analogue electronics-based multiple train control system (MTC) allowing independent control of multiple locomotives on the same track. Airfix produced a large number of plastic kits for both railway stock and scenic items. Some of these such as the footbridge and engine shed became instantly recognisable to almost every <b>railway</b> <b>modeller</b> in the UK.|$|E
50|$|There is {{currently}} minimal commercially available {{ready to run}} support for OO9, although a number of manufacturers have started to announce ranges of products, and small manufacturers have made limited runs of models from time to time. The modeller is therefore generally dependent on kit manufacturers, {{of which there are}} many, adapting models made for OO, or scratch building. Many OO9 modellers also use H0e equipment. In November 2012, Peco announced the launch, during 2013, of a range of ready to run 009 coaches and wagons, based on prototypes of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway. Although no locomotive models were announced, in the March 2013 edition of <b>Railway</b> <b>Modeller</b> Magazine, Danish manufacturer Heljan announced an 009 locomotive based on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway Manning Wardle 2-6-2Ts. In July 2014, Bachmann announced a range of ready to run 009 products, starting with a Baldwin Class 10-12-D locomotive and a number of wagons, primarily used by the British War Department during World War I.|$|E
