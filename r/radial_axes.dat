One group comprised 6 -month-old rats (early adulthood), and the other 12 -month-old rats (middle-adulthood). Areal density (number of neurons per unit area) of NADPH-d positive neurons along the three hippocampal axes (septo-temporal, transverse and <b>radial</b> <b>axes)</b> were subjected to quantitative analyses. There were significant variations in the density of NADPH-d-reactive neurons along the transverse and <b>radial</b> <b>axes</b> of the hippocampus, similar to what have been described previously. Comparison between 6 -month and 12 -month-old rats indicated a substantial reduction in the density of NADPH-d-reactive neurons in the fascia dentata (69 %) and Ammon's horn (54 %) of the latter group. This reduction was relatively uniform along the septotemporal and <b>radial</b> <b>axes,</b> but appeared to be more pronounced in the fascia dentata and in the proximal region of Ammon's horn. Our finding showed that the hippocampal NO system can undergo significant changes within adulthood.

40|$|The radial stator of three-pole radial-axial hybrid {{magnetic}} bearings (HMB) {{has three}} magnetic poles {{and the three}} magnetic poles are driven by a three-phase converter, so the three-pole radial-axial HMB has the advantages of compact structure, low cost, low power consumption and so on. However, as the sum of three-phase current is zero and the three radial magnetic poles are asymmetric, {{the relationship between the}} radial suspension force and the control current is nonlinear. In this paper, firstly a mathematical model of three-pole radial-axial HMB is built based on the equivalent magnetic circuit method. The radial force-current characteristics are then analyzed based on the non-linearized model. The calculation, finite element method (FEM) and experimental results show that the suspension force on the x-axis is a quadratic function of the control current, but the suspension force on the y-axis is linear with control current. Besides, the suspension forces on the two <b>radial</b> <b>axes</b> are coupled with each other. Then, in order to decrease the nonlinearity and coupling of radial force-current characteristics, the six-pole radial-axial HMB is proposed based on the above analyses. The radial force-current characteristics of the six-pole radial-axial HMB are also analyzed based on the non-linearitzed model and are validated by 3 -D FEM analysis.

40|$|The {{developing}} chick optic tectum is {{a widely}} used model of corticogenesis and angiogenesis. Cell behaviors involved in corticogenesis and angiogenesis share several regulatory mechanisms. In this way the 3 D organizations of both systems adapt to each other. The consensus about the temporally and spatially organized progression of the optic tectum corticogenesis contrasts with the discrepancies about the spatial organization of its vascular bed {{as a function of}} the time. In order to find out spatial and temporal correlations between corticogenesis and angiogenesis, several methodological approaches were applied to analyze the dynamic of angiogenesis in the developing chick optic tectum. The present paper shows that a typical sequence of developmental events characterizes the optic tectum angiogenesis. The first phase, formation of the primitive vascular bed, takes place during the early stages of the tectal corticogenesis along which the large efferent neurons appear and begin their early differentiation. The second phase, remodeling and elaboration of the definitive vascular bed, occurs during the increase in complexity associated to the elaboration of the local circuit networks. The present results show that, apart from the well-known influence of the dorsal-ventral and <b>radial</b> <b>axes</b> as reference systems for the spatial organization of optic tectum angiogenesis, the cephalic-caudal axis also exerts a significant asymmetric influence. The term cortico-angiogenesis to describe the entire process is justified by the fact that tight correlations are found between specific corticogenic and angiogenic events and they take place simultaneously at the same position along the cephalic-caudal and <b>radial</b> <b>axes...</b>|$|E

40|$|Ventral furrow {{formation}} in Drosophila {{is the first}} large-scale morphogenetic movement during {{the life of the}} embryo, and is driven by co-ordinated changes in the shape of individual epithelial cells within the cellular blastoderm. Although many of the genes involved have been identified, the details of the mechanical processes that convert local changes in gene expression into whole-scale changes in embryonic form remain to be fully understood. Biologists have identified two main cell deformation modes responsible for ventral furrow invagination: constriction of the apical ends of the cells (apical wedging) and deformation along their apical–basal <b>axes</b> (<b>radial</b> lengthening/shortening). In this work, we used a computer 2 D finite element model of ventral furrow formation to investigate the ability of different combinations of three plausible elementary active cell shape changes to bring about epithelial invagination: ectodermal apical–basal shortening, mesodermal apical–basal lengthening/shortening and mesodermal apical constriction. We undertook a systems analysis of the biomechanical system, which revealed many different combinations of active forces (invagination mechanisms) were able to generate a ventral furrow. Two important general features were revealed. First that combinations of shape changes are the most robust to environmental and mutational perturbation, in particular those combining ectodermal pushing and mesodermal wedging. Second, that ectodermal pushing plays a big part in all of the robust mechanisms (mesodermal forces alone do not close the furrow), and this provides evidence that it may be an important element in the mechanics of invagination in Drosophila.

Participants aimed at five targets, which were positioned along <b>radial</b> <b>axes</b> from a central target circle. The targets differed in width (2. 5, 5, 10, 20 or 40 mm), resulting in an index of difficulty (ID) that varied from 6. 9 to 2. 9 bits. Performance was indexed by the linear relationship between ID and Movement Time (MT). The findings showed that executed task performance was slower than imagined performance. Moreover, conformance to Fitts' Law during executed movement performance was obtained from a very young age. Most importantly, correlations between imagined and executed movements were low in the young participants but gradually increased across age.

40|$|International audience: The neocortex is {{the brain}} {{structure}} {{that has been}} subjected to a major size expansion, in its relative size, during mammalian evolution. It arises from the cortical primordium through coordinated growth of neural progenitor cells along both the tangential and <b>radial</b> <b>axes</b> and their patterning providing spatial coordinates. Functional neocortical areas are ultimately consolidated by environmental influences such as peripheral sensory inputs. Throughout neocortical evolution, cortical areas have become more sophisticated and numerous. This increase in number is possibly involved in the complexification of neocortical function in primates. Whereas extensive divergence of functional cortical fields is observed during evolution, the fundamental mechanisms supporting the allocation of cortical areas and their wiring are conserved, suggesting the presence of core genetic mechanisms operating in different species. We will discuss some of the basic molecular mechanisms including morphogen-dependent ones involved in the precise orchestration of neurogenesis in different cortical areas, elucidated from studies in rodents.

40|$|Wood is a {{biological}} growth medium. It is orthotropic with longitudinal, <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>axes.</b> Furthermore, standing trees adapt themselves to environmental growth conditions, and their material properties vary with age. These changes result in variations {{that are much}} more complex than anisotropy. Studying wood quality and intraspecific variability is useful for clonal selection and for the genetic improvement of plantations. In this study, two logs of Picea abies underwent transmission tomography. The mean diameter was 16 cm (26 -year-old tree) and the moisture content was 22 %. The effect {{of the presence of}} bark and artificial defects was investigated. The tomographic device was specifically built for tree imaging. The imaging process was automatic with 900 ultrasonic acquisitions in 40 minutes (emission at 55 kHz with 5 periods of square wave form). The main conclusions were: speed near the bark is higher than in the centre because of the existence of juvenile wood combined with the moisture content gradient (moisture content lower near the bark). Likewise, damping near the bark is lower than in the centre. A significant relationship was observed between slowness and attenuation (R²= 0. 50); when the speed increased, damping decreased. No clear effect of the presence of bark was shown on the tomographic images. The bark was thin (3 to 5 mm thick) compared to the wavelength (26 mm). The 10, 20 and 50 mm artificial holes were clearly visible on the tomographic images. However, quantitative tomography does not enable the precise location of defects. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The first one is exact solutions for elastic waves in cylindrically orthotropic elastic media, which are solved using Frobenius method. The second theoretical development is a set of two canonical problems for acoustic-orthotropic-acoustic media. Based on the two theoretical developments, scattering by three specially selected simple multilayer scatterers are analyzed via multiple-scattering approach. Solutions for the three scatterers are then used for solving a “general” multilayer scatterer through a recursive solution procedure. The word “general” means the scatterer can have an arbitrary number of layers and each layer can be either isotropic acoustic or orthotropic elastic. No approximations have been used in the process. The resulting analytically-exact solutions are implemented and verified. As an application example, acoustic scattering by a scatterer with a single orthotropic layer is presented. The effects on the scattering due to changing parameters of the orthotropic layer are studied. Acoustic scattering by a specially designed multilayer scatterer is also numerically simulated. Ratios of the sound speeds of the orthotropic layers along r and θ directions are defined to satisfy the requirement of the Cummer-Schurig cloaking design. The simulations demonstrate that both the formalism and the computational implementation of the scattering solutions are correct...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The dose profile of a prototype IS 125 I- 125 brachytherapy seed was measured using MD- 55 radiochromic film. Irradiated films were scanned by a document scanner and results were compared with results obtained when a densitometer was used. Images produced by a document scanner were converted to dose with several graphic related programs. Advantages of scanning the films with a document scanner versus with a densitometer include: no diffraction from the film holder used in densitometer scans, shorter scanning times and smaller experimental error. Experimental precision of 0. 35 % relative standard deviation was obtained using the document scanner, but only 9 % could be achieved with the densitometer. As expected, the measured dose profiles showed this new brachytherapy seed to be similar to the commercially available model 6711 seed because of similar source geometry. Exposures with the seed embedded in a paraffin medium produced different profiles from when the seed was embedded in Plexiglas because of the difference of properties in these media. Unequal thickness at the two ends of the seed contributed to anisotropy in the dose distribution. Anisotropy in Plexiglas was a factor of 2 more than in paraffin for both longitudinal <b>axes.</b> <b>Radial</b> dose fall-off in paraffin was similar in shape to MCNP calculations out to 1 cm. The use of a document scanner for measurement of radiochromic film was shown to be an acceptable and convenient method for low-energy I- 125 brachytherapy seed dosimetry. Further study is needed to evaluate the measurement of dose at extended distances from the seed, and to allow comparison to commercially available sources in accordance with AAPM TG 43...|$|R
