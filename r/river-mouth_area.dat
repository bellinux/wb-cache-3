40|$|A proper {{understanding}} of coastal development {{during periods of}} rapid sea-level rise {{is a prerequisite for}} the prediction of future coastal response to the expected acceleration in sea-level rise. However, the development of back-barrier basins, especially in river-mouth areas, during such periods is still not well understood. Here we show the response of back-barrier basins adjacent to the Rhine-Meuse <b>river-mouth</b> <b>area,</b> The Netherlands during the mid Holocene. A combination of high-resolution seismic data and cores was used to describe and explain late-Weichselian to early Holocene terrestrial and mid-Holocene back-barrier sequences. Along with dating and micropalaeontological analyses, these descriptions and explanations form the basis of a reconstruction of river-mouth and adjacent basin behaviour under conditions of rapid SLR. The nearby presence of the Rhine-Meuse estuary had a significant influence {{on the development of the}} adjacent back-barrier basin and especially its tidal channels. The back-barrier channels started to fill in between 8. 3 and 7. 4 ka BP due to decreasing rates of both sea-level rise and tidal-amplitude increase. During this time the Rhine relocated its mouth to the study area and the increased sediment delivery contributed to tidal-prism decrease and channel infill. Close to the Rhine-Meuse river mouth the back-barrier channels lay embedded in thick clayey, estuarine deposits and lateral migration of the tidal channels was limited. At greater distances, lateral migration rates increased as the thickness of cohesive back-barrier deposits decreases. The spatial pattern and stratigraphic setting of the northern channel fills suggests an episode of barrier overstepping between 7. 5 and 6. 6 ka BP. The mode and spatial limits of this overstepping are still not understood. © 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Most {{present day}} {{estuaries}} formed within incised fluvial valleys, created {{during the last}} glacial, that drowned during post-glacial sea-level rise. The sedimentary archive of the associated river-mouth areas contains important information on estuarine evolution under different rates of sea-level rise. This thesis presents {{a study on the}} development of the mouth of the Rhine-Meuse system in the Rotterdam area, western Netherlands, between 12000 - 6000 BP. During the study tens of thousands of core descriptions and cone penetration test results, as well as seismic data, pollen and diatom analyses, tens of OSL-dates and hundreds of radiocarbon dates were used. The objectives were to explain: 1) the early-mid Holocene sedimentary succession of the Rhine-Meuse river-mouth area; 2) the development of the <b>river-mouth</b> <b>area</b> in the early-mid Holocene in response to rapid sea-level rise (SLR) and 3) the interaction of the fluvial and coastal systems during the early-mid Holocene transgression. Between 10. 5 - 8 ka BP, the effects of sea-level rise started to influence the study area: groundwater rise resulted in the formation of extensive wetlands, fluvial flood basins became more frequently flooded, sediment-aggradation rates increased and finally the river valley changed into an estuary with adjacent tidal basins. Sea level reached rates of 1 m/ 100 yr before 8 ka BP with a period of 2 m/ 100 yr between 8. 5 - 8. 3 ka BP as a result of sea-level jumping. During the latter period sea level rose 4. 06 0. 5 m: 1. 95 0. 74 m background sea-level rise and 2. 11 0. 89 m sea-level jump. This jump is linked to the drainage of Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway in the Hudson Bay area and linked to the 8. 2 event. After 8 ka BP the rate of SLR slowed down to 0. 6 m/ 100 yr. North and south of the estuary, retrogradation of the coastline occurred at a faster rate than near the mouth at Hoek van Holland, leading to the formation of a promontory. In the upper estuary a bay-head delta was formed. Around 7. 3 ka BP the main branch of the Rhine connected to a tidal inlet 20 km north of the promontory that was strongly eroded. The eroded sediment was partly used to fill in the abandoned estuary, but also to fill in tidal basins north of the promontory. The closure of the several tidal inlets resulted in poor drainage conditions and the wetland area increased rapidly after 6. 5 ka BP and around 6 ka BP the coastline reached its most eastward position. The sedimentary succession was also described using sequence-stratigraphic concepts. The transition from lowstand to transgressive systems tract (TST) occurred when widespread basal-peat formation halted and gyttja accumulation and clastic deposition started. In large parts of the study area this occurred near-instantaneously during the sea-level jump. The highstand systems tract in the study area started after 6. 5 ka BP with widespread peat formation in the closing tidal basins. The relatively late start of the TST is most likely typical for river-mouth areas along wide, low-gradient continental shelves where base-level changes are dominant for a relatively short period...|$|E
40|$|In this project, three estuarine and river-mouth areas, namely Cua Ong Estuary, Cua Luc Estuary and Cam River-mouth {{that belong}} to the Quang Ninh- Hai Phong coastal region (Vietnam) were {{investigated}} for the status as well as history and origin of the heavy metal and arsenic contamination of sediments. In addition, the speciation and mobility of heavy metals and arsenic under changing environmental conditions (Eh and pH) in vertical profiles or upon simulated on-land disposal of dredged sediments in the Cam <b>River-mouth</b> <b>area</b> (Hai Phong Province) were also investigated. The project included many different works including the collection of surficial bed-sediment and core-sediment samples, the performance of ripening experiments, porewater collection, single (ammonium-EDTA) and sequential (BCR 3 -step) extractions, and pHstat-leaching tests as well as analyses of chemical composition of major and trace elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, P, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), anions (F-, Cl-, Br-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, SO 42 - and PO 43 -, etc.), grain-size, mineralogy, organic matter content (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and 137 Cs isotope dating. In Cua Ong and Cua Luc estuaries, heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) and As mainly display a natural origin (from the weathering and erosion processes of rocks). In contrast, in the Cam River-mouth, heavy metals and arsenic {{are considered to be}} minorly to moderately enriched as a result of anthropogenic activities in Hai Phong City and Northern Vietnam. Especially, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn in sediments increased rapidly by a factor of approximately 2 from 1954 to 1975 and then remained nearly unchanged from 1975 to 2008. In the Cam River-mouth, heavy metals (Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn) and As show overall decreasing trends of concentrations in porewater or sediment from top to bottom of a sediment core. Moreover, non-silicate fractions of these elements (exchangeable and carbonate-bound, Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound, and organic matter and sulphide-bound) also decrease from top to bottom {{as a result of their}} anthropogenic origin in surficial sediment layers and decreasing Eh and increasing pH values with depth. The pHstat-leaching tests on the original suboxic and oxidized sediments indicate that the pH-dependent leaching behavior of Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and As reflects a V-shaped pattern in which they are strongly leached at highly-acid pH (2) or highly-alkaline pH (11), and minimum leachabilities are obtained in the slightly acid to slightly alkaline pH-range (6  8). Under the effect of oxidation, for Mn, Pb and Zn a transfer from the exchangeable and carbonate-bound fraction to the Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound fraction, and for Cu a transfer from the organic matter and sulphide-bound fraction to the Fe and Mn hydr/oxide-bound fraction occurred. In accordance with these results, Mn, Pb, Zn and As are characterized by a slower and lower release in the pH range 2  11 while for Cu, the pattern is opposite at pHs 2  8. A ripening experiment that simulates the on-land disposal of dredged sediments suggests that the porewater concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic increase immediately after exposure to the atmosphere, but then decrease to levels below their initial concentrations in the porewater. This implies a short-term risk for groundwater pollution by leaching of heavy metals and arsenic in the beginning of the on-land disposal, however, the risk will be mitigated with time when the oxidation further proceeds.
