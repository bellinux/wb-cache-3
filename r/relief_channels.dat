50|$|The {{communities}} and government of Somalia have acted {{in ways that}} increase {{the destruction of the}} floods. In recent years, with population increases, more people are forced to live in the lower floodplain areas, and thus, are more susceptible to damage and loss of life by the flooding. In addition, flood <b>relief</b> <b>channels</b> that were managed by the government are now in disarray following the start of the Somali Civil War.

50|$|Harry Stevens {{took over}} {{the running of the}} navigations in 1930, at a time when {{industries}} were beginning to close, or transfer traffic to the roads, and when a major restructuring of the Wey valley was just starting, to improve flood relief. This involved building new weirs and <b>relief</b> <b>channels,</b> including the Broad Mead Cut, which ran between Cartbridge and Papercourt. By the 1940s the Godalming Navigation was virtually derelict, and trade declined when Newark Mill closed during the Second World War. When traffic from Coxes Mill ceased in the 1960s, the navigation was no longer viable, and Stevens gave it to the National Trust in 1964. Ownership passed to them in 1971, when Stevens' wife died. The Commissioners of the Godalming Navigation gave their rights to Guildford Corporation in 1968, who passed it on to the National Trust, and for the first time, both parts of the river were under common ownership. The last commercial barge ran in 1969, although there was some commercial traffic in the early 1980s from Tilbury to Coxes Mill.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{admitted}} collective disputes by arbitral institutes may not reflect the severity of collective labor conflicts in China’s transition for the reason that many conflicts occurred before or after arbitration proceedings. Moreover, arbitral mediation could not represent the nationwide capacity of mediation because there was a large number of labor disputes mediated by mediation committees within enterprises, people’s mediation committees inside village (neighborhood) committees, the judicial offices at the basic level, social security stations of villages, towns, and streets, and governmental courts at all levels. Subject to the availability of data published by officials, this study can only examine the effect of pre-court mediation, either arbitral or extra-arbitral, on the cases of collective disputes that were formally arbitrated. Even if the impact of these mediation mechanisms passed the test, it only showed that they inhibited collective labor disputes within arbitral and <b>relief</b> <b>channels,</b> but did not reflect that they effectively resolved collective labor disputes during China’s transition. However, as mentioned before, the principle of “mediation first” that was implemented throughout the channels of institutionalized relief aimed at preventing workers from taking collective actions while seeking (quasi-)judicial remedies at the same time. The rights protection actions of Chinese people did not take place in an either-or setting between judicial remedies and collective actions; they often had to resort to both collective actions and judicial help in order to catch the attention of governments (O’Brien & Li 2004).|$|E
30|$|The {{large-scale}} population {{migration is}} a product of rapid industrialization and urbanization. Immigrants are primarily seen as an economic means or source of labor. They exhibit semi-integration and semi-socialization characteristics (Wang 2006; Li 2011). Their activities center on work, and the asymmetry of their work and life creates a vulnerable defensible space. Many families have incomplete migration because of high costs for the whole family. This increases their susceptibility. On the one hand, city immigrants have limited social resources and are not familiar with and only superficially acculturated into the urban environment. Their chances of being infringed on are relatively high, and the effectiveness of <b>relief</b> <b>channels</b> are thereby discounted. On the other hand, working outside and the difficulties of starting a new life in the city shakes the will of some people. After rational calculation, some engage in illegal activities. Since they are only familiar with the social ecology and everyday life of the migrant population, in their crime pattern, their first choice is the rented living places of migrants. The risk of committing crime in this group is relatively low, inducing the formation of a parasitic criminal group. According to the observations of western scholars, the increase in the crime rate {{is the result of a}} lag in the judicial system and social control compared to the greater crime stimulus nurtured by rapid changes in the social structure, among which changes in living habits and human activities play an important role (Felson and Cohen 1980).|$|E
40|$|Deep-sea ridges-channel {{systems have}} been {{recognized}} in some places on the continental rise around Antarctica. They are object of interest because of their relation to the ice sheet dynamics and their generally continuous record of paleo-climatic changes. The Wilkes Land continental margin {{is one of the}} areas where these morphological features are well developed; it is also particularly important because of its location close to the Mertz Glacier, {{which is one of the}} few outlet glaciers of the Eastern Antarctic Ice Sheet. The Wilkes Land continental margin was investigated induring the Austral Summer 2000 by the joint Australian and Italian WEGA(WilkEs basin GlAcial history) Project, onboard the R/V Tangaroa. During this cruise, about 600 km of multichannel seismic reflection profiles, 3. 5 kHz acoustic profiles and 11 piston cores with trigger cores were acquired on the continental rise (Fig. 1). The Wilkes Land continental margin morphology is characterised by several submarine canyons cutting the slope while the lower rise, investigated by the WEGA Project, is characterised by a network of generally low <b>relief</b> <b>channels</b> separated by large sediment ridges. The detailed bathymetric map of the rise area shows three ridges named from west to east respectively “C”, “A” and “B”, bounded by the Jussie Canyon, the WEGA Channel and the Buffon Canyon (Fig. 1). This channel-ridge system has an approximately North-South elongation, perpendicular to the continental margin. The sediment ridges are ca. 150 km in length and more than 40 km of width and their relief is about 1000 meters in the proximal part, decreasing to ca. 300 meters offshore. They are asymmetrical, showing a long gentle eastern flank and a short steep western side, lying between 2500 and 3600 meters water depth in the upper and lower part respectively. The Jussie Canyon and the Buffon Canyon reach the shelf break, while the WEGA Channel seems to start lower, in the upper rise...|$|E

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the study of}} ancient fluvial patterns {{on the surface of}} Mars, including raised curvilinear features (RCFs) and negative <b>relief</b> <b>channels.</b> It requires the use of geological images provided by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to determine how water shaped the surface of Mars in the form of rivers, lakes and/or oceans approximately 3. 5 billion years ago, during the Noachian period. The role of the intern is to examine the images and record the corresponding measurements of ancient river systems in an Excel spreadsheet to assist in determining the Noachian water cycle on Mars. Resources used to make these measurements include the Arena software, hand-drawn sketch maps, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and the images provided by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Context Imager (CTX) returns black and white images at a resolution of six meters per pixel. The camera can take images with a width of 30 km and a length of 160 km. Seventeen images were observed in total. Images are analyzed and notes are taken concerning their terminal deposits, stream ordering and drainage pattern. The Arena software is utilized to make the images more visible by allowing control of contrast and magnification. Once the image is adjusted, measurements: length, average width, drainage basin area, sinuous ridge area are recorded, at a magnification of one, through using the line segment and polygon tools. After an image has been analyzed and measured, a sketch map is drawn in order to clearly identify the various segments, basins and terminal deposits the intern observed. Observations are used to further classify the fluvial patterns; their drainage pattern is defined as dendritic, parallel, trellis, rectangular, radial, centripetal, deranged or discordant. Once observational notes are completed, mathematical relations are used to determine drainage density, stream frequency, theoretic basin area and sinuosity index. These data will be added to a larger data set that will yield a comprehensive view of early Mars drainage systems. The data obtained from the work conducted will be used to characterize the nature and behavior of water on the surface of Mars. Thorough understanding of the Martian water cycle will serve as biologically significant information. Through working on this project, I acquired insight into the study of planet Mars, and skills in the Arena software as well as the organization of a vast amount of data...|$|E
30|$|Conceptually, {{existing}} studies {{emphasize the}} arbitrary {{role of the}} Chinese authoritarian state (Cai 2008). This work finds {{that the state has}} adopted mediation as a flexible channeling strategy that successfully the collective struggle of workers after controlling the factor of heavy-handed repression for maintaining social stability that dominated the committees of politics and law. Empirically, this conclusion does not agree that the government can effectively resolve workers’ collective struggles by enlarging the scope of mediation. For a long time, the repression to maintain stability that was led by committees of politics and law did not really play a role; therefore, in recent years, governments began to shift their methods of dealing with disputes from blocking to channeling. All levels of governments, from central to local, were keen to promote a variety of grand mediation mechanisms. However, many grassroots-level mediation organizations lacked sufficient professional legal ability to handle the increasingly complicated labor disputes, resulting in very rough and oversimplified grassroots-level mediation and leaving a large number of labor disputes mediated but not resolved. Moreover, this kind of mediation required excessive involvement of all levels of governmental departments in labor disputes. The arbitrary intervention by the state neutralized the equal and institutionalized mechanism of negotiation and consultation between employees and employers inside enterprises. Over time, the state was required to {{spend a great deal of}} administrative resources on absorbing a wider range of collective labor struggles. Moreover, the state’s stubborn preference of mediation over strict regulation (such as active labor inspections, arbitration awards, the administration of justice, and so on) will in the long run soften the binding power of labor laws and fuel unscrupulous violations by employers. Under the circumstances of irregular grassroots-level mediation, the absence of negotiation mechanisms between employers and employees, excessive political mobilization of administrative resources, and long-range suspension of coercive powers, the rights of workers were not truly protected. Mediation could only help obtain a temporary compromise, rather than play a fundamental role in channeling disputes, which in turn forced the state to mediate selectively according to the scale and intensity of collective disputes—focusing on large ones and ignoring small ones. As a result, although statistically the average scale of collective labor disputes decreased due to the resolution of large-scale collective disputes, in reality, the number of small-scale and individual disputes still remained high. The mass incidents caused by rights-defense activities also appeared to be endless. There have been some signs that Chinese workers have begun to seek solutions outside institutionalized <b>relief</b> <b>channels</b> and are turning to violent approaches. This article thus insists that, in the long run, only by enhancing the capacity to legally handle labor disputes, recognizing the collective rights of workers, and establishing a good mutual consultation mechanism between employers and employees can the state resolve labor disputes without mediation.|$|E
40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [LLNL] was tasked {{to compare}} the impact {{response}} of NFL helmet pad systems and U. S. Army pad systems compatible with an Advanced Combat Helmet [ACH] at impact velocities up to 20 ft/s. This was a one-year study funded by the U. S. Army and JIEDDO. The Army/JIEDDO point of contact is COL R. Todd Dombroski, DO, JIEDDO Surgeon. LLNL was chosen by committee to perform the research based on prior published computational studies of the mechanical response of helmets and skulls to blast. Our collaborators include the U. S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory [USAARL] (a DoD laboratory responsible for impact testing helmets), Team Wendy and Oregon Aero (current and former ACH pad manufacturers), Riddell and Xenith (NFL pad manufacturers), and d 3 o (general purpose sports pad manufacturer). The manufacturer-supplied pad systems that were studied are shown in the figure below. The first two are the Army systems, which are bilayer foam pads with both hard and soft foam and a water-resistant airtight wrapper (Team Wendy) or a water-resistant airtight coating (Oregon Aero). The next two are NFL pad systems. The Xenith system consists of a thin foam pad and a hollow air-filled cylinder that elastically buckles under load. The Riddell system is a bilayer foam pad that is encased in an inflatable airbag with <b>relief</b> <b>channels</b> to neighboring pads in the helmet. The inflatable airbag is for comfort and provides no enhancement to impact mitigation. The d 3 o system consists of a rate-sensitive homogeneous dense foam. LLNL performed experiments to characterize the material properties of the individual foam materials and {{the response of the}} complete pad systems, to obtain parameters needed for the simulations. LLNL also performed X-ray CT scans of an ACH helmet shell that were used to construct a geometrically accurate computational model of the helmet. Two complementary sets of simulations were performed. The first set of simulations reproduced the experimental helmet impact certification tests performed by USAARL, who provided data for comparison. The goal of this set of simulations was to demonstrate the overall validity of LLNL's computational analyses and methods and understand the general physics of helmet impacts. In these tests and the corresponding simulations, an inverted ACH containing pads and a head-form are dropped onto a hemispherical anvil, at 10 and 14. 14 ft/s impact velocities. The simulations predicted peak accelerations (the metric used by USAARL for comparing the performance of pad systems), rebound velocities, and impact durations consistent with the experimental data, thus demonstrating the validity and relevance of the simulation methods. Because the NFL pad systems are approximately double the thickness of the U. S. Army pads, they do not fit into the ACH. As a result, the NFL pads could not be simply placed into an ACH shell in either a simulation or an experiment without modifying their size and shape. Since impact mitigation depends critically on the available stopping distance and the area over which the stopping force is applied, {{it is important to consider}} identically shaped pads in order {{to compare the}}ir performance in a fair and meaningful manner. Consequently, the second set of simulations utilized a simplified simulation geometry consisting of a 5 kg cylindrical impactor (equal in mass to a head) striking equally sized pads from each manufacturer. The simulated bilayer foam pads had the same proportions of hard and soft foam as the actual pad systems, while the Xenith pads were simulated as a bilayer foam pad with material properties adjusted to give the same response as the actual Xenith pads. The effects of trapped air were included in the simulations of the Team Wendy and Oregon Aero pads. All simulations used material properties derived from the experiments conducted at LLNL. The acceleration history of the center of mass of the impactor was used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for each simulation, to assess the pad performance. The HIC is a well-established metric that combines both acceleration and duration of impact to assess the danger of injury, and is a more robust measure than peak acceleration. Our key findings are: (1) The performance of a pad depends on the range of impact velocities. At lower impact velocity, softer pads perform better. At higher impact velocity, harder pads perform better; (2) Thicker pads perform better at all velocities, but especially at high velocities; and (3) For comparable thicknesses, neither the NFL systems nor the Oregon Aero pads outperform the Team Wendy pads currently used in the ACH system in militarily-relevant impact scenarios (impact speeds less than 20 ft/s). The second finding suggests a commercial off-the-shelf solution for mitigating impact-related traumatic brain injury to soldiers...|$|E
