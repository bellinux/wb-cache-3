40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the rutting performance of <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> content oncement modified emulsified asphalt mixtures at heavy duty highways. For this purpose, emulsified asphaltspecimens with dense graded aggregate were prepared according to Marshall method for emulsified asphaltaggregatecold mixture design. The specimens were prepared in such a way that portland cement wassubstituted for mineral filler in an increased percent from 0 % to 6 %. In this way, three asphalt emulsionmixtures with different <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> contents of 4. 2 %, 5. 2 %, and 6. 2 % by the mass of dry aggregatewere produced. Static load asphalt creep tests were performed on the specimens. Based on the experimentalwork, it has been reached that dense graded cement modified emulsion mixtures are of great performance inrutting compared to hot mixtures with the same aggregate grading and bitumen content. Results showed thatcement acts as a secondary binder in emulsion mixture. Creep and permanent deformation resistance are allimproved by portland cement addition but the resistance to creep deformation of emulsion mixture wasdecreased by the increase of <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> content...|$|E
40|$|During the {{processing}} of limestone to produce commercial aggregates, {{a significant amount of}} waste limestone screenings is produced. This waste material cannot be used in highway construction because it does not meet current highway specifications. The purpose of this research was to determine if a waste limestone screenings/emulsion mix could be used to construct a base capable of supporting local traffic. A 1. 27 mile section of roadway in Linn County was selected for this research. The road was divided into seven sections.

40|$|While {{the state}} of Illinois has been {{recycling}} Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) material into hot-mix asphalt (HMA) since 1980, there continues to be questions regarding the correct approach to design HMA with RAP. The Illinois Department of Transportation's current method of RAP HMA design provides 100 % contribution for the <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> binder from the RAP based on solvent extractions. This means {{that the amount of}} virgin asphalt binder is reduced by the full amount of asphalt binder in the RAP for the percentage specified. This has recently been reported to be inaccurate and could result in an erroneous HMA job mix formula and may cause dry HMA. Hence, the HMA may become vulnerable to durability cracking and premature failure. The objective of this research project is to develop an understanding of the interaction between aged and virgin asphalt binders in RAP. Based on this understanding, this study wil...|$|E

30|$|Refineries with a FCC unit are {{considered}} a medium-upgraded facility because it converts a portion of straight run fuel oil to gasoline and diesel but still produces a significant volume of heavy fuel oil. A coker refinery upgrades most of the fuel oil to lighter products and thus makes the low-value fuel oil effectively “disappear.” Coking breaks down the heaviest fractions of crude oil into lighter, higher-value products and elemental carbon (coke) that is sold for steel production and anode manufacturing. Hydrocarbon compounds used in cokers would otherwise only be usable as <b>residual</b> fuel or <b>asphalt.</b>|$|R
40|$|Durability of an asphalt {{mixture is}} {{directly}} related to the optimum asphalt binder content, which guarantees coverage of the aggregate particles and suitable volumetric properties to ensure a good performance in service, producing an asphalt mixture that is less susceptible to aging and moisture damage. Previous research has shown that the polygon-of-voids tool, or polyvoids, is an analytical technique to determine the optimum asphalt binder content of asphalt mixtures with virgin aggregates based on the specification limits of voids, allowing a saving in time and material. However, current trends to develop new asphalt mixtures which incorporate reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) have created additional challenges given the nature of the design of a mixture containing aggregates with <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> that make the property measurement of the bulk specific gravity of the RAP aggregate difficult. This paper aims to demonstrate the application of the polygon-of-voids tool for the design of recycled hot-mix asphalt. The results show that the method of substitution, where the value of the actual specific gravity of the RAP aggregate is assumed as the bulk specific gravity of the RAP aggregate, gives the optimum asphalt contents closest to those determined by the traditional Marshall method for the design of asphalt mixtures...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} amount of waste limestone screenings is produced during aggregate production. This waste material cannot be used in highway construction {{because it does not}} meet current highway specifications. The purpose of this research was to determine if a waste limestone screenings/emulsion mix could be used to construct a base capable of supporting local traffic. A 1. 27 mile (2. 04 km) section of roadway in Linn County was selected for this research. The road was divided into seven sections. Six of the sections were used to test 4 in. (100 mm) and 6 in. (150 mm) compacted base thicknesses containing 2. 5 %, 3. 5 %, and 4. 5 % <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> contents. The seventh section was a control section containing untreated waste limestone screenings. This research on emulsion stabilized limestone screenings supports the following conclusions: (1) A low maintenance roadway can be produced using a seal coat surface on 6 in. (150 mm) of stabilized limestone screenings with 4. 5 % asphalt cement; (2) A 6 in. (150 mm) emulsion stabilized base with less than 3. 5 % asphalt cement does not produce a satisfactory low cost maintenance roadway; (3) A 4 in.

40|$|Executive Summary Cold Mix Asphalt (CMA) {{serves as}} a {{promising}} alternative {{for a wide range}} of paving applications from preventative maintenance and repair, to full-scale pavement construction. Compared to traditional Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), CMA provides a number of benefits that make it a promising alternative to conventional paving technologies, including reduction in heating energy and longer working time for transportation and placing. However, the reported higher air void content and higher moisture susceptibility of CMA relative to traditional HMA present legitimate concerns that has limited more widespread use of CMA to date. To mitigate the potential for moisture damage in CMA, it is necessary to include a simple and effective method for evaluating moisture susceptibility in the material selection phase of the mix design process. The most direct way to prevent moisture sensitivity is to require a minimum threshold of aggregate coating as part of CMA mix design in regards to both extent and quality of coating. This study refines a recently developed method to quantify aggregate coating extent in CMA using Digital Image Analysis Methods and applies the procedure to several aggregate-emulsion systems to isolate factors most directly affecting aggregate coating. After identifying the most significant factors, a regression analysis of the experimental results is used to develop quantitative models to predict coating of aggregates in CMA as a function of mix design parameters. Results show that not only Image Analysis Method {{serves as a}}n effective and reliable tool in identifying aggregate coating, but also that the regression models developed to predict coating are sensitive to emulsion type, aggregate gradation and <b>residual</b> <b>asphalt</b> content. Including evaluation of coating quality is a generally accepted practice in mix design for conventional HMA, WMA, and CMA. This study introduces the concept that it is necessary to assess quality of coating as a means to ensure adequate bonding between the asphalt and aggregate to truly assess potential for moisture damage. To evaluate quality of coating, a Modified Boiling Test procedure on cured CMA loose mixture that involves application of the Image Analysis Method to quantify the coating before and after boiling was developed. Results reveal that after curing is achieved as indicated by negligible moisture loss in the mixture, the bonding between emulsion residue and aggregate continues to increases with curing time. Modified Boiling Test results on fully cured CMA loose mixture indicate that CSS- 1 hl performs much better than CSS- 1 h and CSS- 2 emulsion, showing the best coating quality. The results were also verified by Binder Bond Strength (BBS) test on emulsion residues and asphalt emulsions. The relationship between coating quality and mixture performance was verified through comparison of boiling test results to mixture moisture damage as measured by the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR). Prior to conducting this comparison a CMA mix design method was proposed to ensure a uniform process for selection of design emulsion content and preparation of mixture samples. The proposed CMA mix design method determines the design emulsion content (DEC) based on volumetric analysis and mixture indirect tensile strength. The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) test based on this mix design shows consistency with Modified Boiling test result and correlation between TSR test and Modified Boiling test is also established...|$|E
