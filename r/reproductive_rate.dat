40|$|BACKGROUND: The native rodents of Australia are {{commonly}} {{divided into two}} groups based on the time of their colonization of the Sahulian continent, which encompasses Australia, New Guinea, and the adjacent islands. The first group, the "old endemics," is a diverse assemblage of 34 genera that are descended from a single colonization of the continent during the Pliocene. A second group, the "new endemics," is composed of several native Rattus species that are descended from a single colonization during the Pleistocene. Finally, a third group is composed of three non-native species of Rattus and Mus introduced into Australia by humans over the last 200 years. Previous studies have claimed that the three groups differ in their <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> and that this variation in rates is associated with the unique environmental conditions across Australia. We examined these hypotheses using phylogenetically controlled methods. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We examined the relationship between the <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> of the Australian rodents and the environmental variations across the continent, as well as the epoch of their colonization of the continent. Our results revealed no significant correlation with environmental variables but a significant association between colonization age and all the reproductive parameters examined. DISCUSSION: Based on a larger phylogeny of the subfamily Murinae, we showed that significant differences in <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> among colonization groups are shared with their closest relatives outside Sahul. Therefore, the lower <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> in the old endemics {{are more likely to be}} the result of phylogenetic history and conservation of traits than an adaptation to the Australian environment. In the new endemics, we found a trend of increasing <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> with diversification. We suggest that the differences in <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> of the old endemic rodents and the native Rattus represent alternative adaptive strategies that have allowed them to utilize similar ecological niches across Australia...|$|R
5|$|Because of its low <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> and {{historically}} documented declines {{in areas such}} as the Caribbean, the night shark has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the American Fisheries Society (AFS). A population assessment has indicated that this species is secure in the waters off the United States, but this may not be true elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|Common and gregarious, the hardnose shark is a {{predator}} of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. This species is viviparous, {{with the growing}} embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother. Females have a biennial reproductive cycle and bear litters {{of one or two}} pups after a twelve-month gestation period. The hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and, given its low <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate,</b> the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
40|$|Increased female <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> usually {{result in}} {{accelerated}} senescence. This correlation provides {{a link between}} the evolutionary conflict of the sexes and aging when ejaculate components elevate female <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> at the cost of future reproduction. It is not clear whether this female cost is manifest as shorter lifespan or an earlier onset or a steeper <b>rate</b> of <b>reproductive</b> senescence. It also is unclear whether beneficial ejaculates release females from reproductive trade-offs and, if so, which senescence parameters are affected. We examined these issues in the bedbug, Cimex lectularius, a long-lived insect that shows reduced female lifespan as well as female reproductive senescence at the male-determined mating frequency. We demonstrate experimentally that, independently of the mating frequency, females receiving more ejaculate show increased <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> and enter <b>reproductive</b> senescence later than females receiving less ejaculate. The <b>rate</b> of <b>reproductive</b> senescence did not differ between treatments, and <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> did not predict mortality. The ejaculate effects were consistent in inter- and intra-population crosses, suggesting they have not evolved recently and are not caused by inbreeding. Our results suggest that ejaculate components compensate for the costs of elevated female <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> in bedbugs by delaying the onset of reproductive senescence. Ejaculate components that are beneficial to polyandrous females could have arisen because male traits that protect the ejaculate have positive pleiotropic effects and/or because female counteradaptations to antagonistic male traits exceed the neutralization of those traits. That males influence female reproductive senescence has important consequences for trade-offs between reproduction and longevity and for studies of somatic senescence...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an unexplained {{decline in the}} alpine pika {{population}} occurred throughout the western Sayan Mountains. Although in 1977 Khlebnikov suggested {{it was due to}} an epidemic, it was difficult to ascertain if such a large territory had been affected all at once. By 1986 or 1987, a few localities that had high alpine pika population densities 16 to 17 years earlier became devoid of the species, due to its low <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> and the insular nature of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Normally wary of humans, blacktip sharks {{can become}} {{aggressive}} {{in the presence}} of food and have been responsible for a number of attacks on people.

5|$|The {{greatest}} threat to manta rays is overfishing. M. birostris is not evenly distributed over the oceans, but is concentrated in areas that provide the food resources it requires, while M. alfredi is even more localized. Their distributions are thus fragmented, with little evidence of intermingling of subpopulations. Because of their long lifespans and low <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate,</b> overfishing can severely reduce local populations with little likelihood that individuals from elsewhere will replace them.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate,</b> the {{dusky shark}} is very {{vulnerable}} to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming other sharks, marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E

40|$|To obtain current {{data on the}} North American {{river otter}} (Lontra canadensis) {{population}} in Idaho, licensed trappers were mandated to surrender river otter carcasses through provisions of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game’s mandatory harvest report. Throughout the 2002 - 2003 and 2003 - 2004 trapping seasons, 237 river otter carcasses were collected. Necropsies were performed to assess age and sex, general body condition, <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates,</b> and concentrations of environmental contaminants in the livers. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> were determined by counting corpora lutea and blastocysts in female river otters. Livers were dissected and concentrations of environmental contaminants were determined for the following toxins: mercury and other heavy metals, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). No negative relationships were found between environmental concentrations and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> or presence of sperm. The majority of otters had contaminant levels well within what is considered background levels. Data {{from the present study}} suggest the river otter population in Idaho is stable to increasing.

5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity.

Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied.

5|$|Harmless to humans, the hardnose shark {{is caught}} with {{gillnets}} and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries {{across much of}} its range.

Its low <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> may render it susceptible to overfishing, and given existing levels of exploitation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened. Off northern Australia, the hardnose shark makes up 13.6% of the gillnet catch and 4.0% of the longline catch.

Most known-age Kestrels nested in their first year of life, and there was no apparent short-term or long-term reproductive advantage to delayed breeding. The number of years that Kestrels nested in study area boxes ranged from 1 to 6 years, with most Kestrels nesting in only 1 year. <b>Reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> were higher for birds with at least 1 year of nesting experience than for birds nesting in boxes for the first time. After 2 years of nesting, <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> leveled off; there was no evidence for additional improvement or for senescence. Differences in reproductive output with experience/age were due to variation among and not within individuals. Individuals that nested in more than 1 year had similar <b>reproductive</b> <b>rates</b> in their first and second years.

5|$|Spending most of {{its time}} close to the sea floor, the sicklefin weasel shark is a {{specialist}} predator of cephalopods. Its reproductive mode is viviparous, in which the unborn young form a placental connection to their mother. Females probably give birth twice a year, with each litter consisting of two to four pups. The sicklefin weasel shark is widely caught by artisanal fisheries and used for meat, fins, and fishmeal; its low natural abundance and <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> mean that it cannot sustain much fishing pressure. Given that fishing activity is intense throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Galapagos shark as near threatened, as its low <b>reproductive</b> <b>rate</b> limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion.
