5|$|At {{the end of}} 1988, Surfer <b>Rosa</b> {{was named}} one of the year's best albums on English critics' year-end lists. Independent music {{magazines}} Melody Maker and Sounds named Surfer <b>Rosa</b> as their album of the year; NME and Record Mirror placed the album 10th and 14th, respectively. However, Surfer <b>Rosa</b> failed to appear on The Village Voices Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics. It also did not appear on any end-of-year list in the United States. A number of music magazines have since positioned Surfer <b>Rosa</b> as one of the quintessential alternative rock records of the 1980s. The album has appeared on several all-time best album lists, and is consistently placed {{as one of the best}} albums of the 1980s in any genre.|$|E

5|$|The Santa <b>Rosa</b> fossil site, where LACM 149371 was found, {{is in the}} Ucayali Region of Peru. The Santa <b>Rosa</b> fauna also {{contains}} fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents, a possible bat, and some notoungulates (a unique extinct group of South American ungulates). The age of this fauna is unclear, and estimates range from near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (~35mya) to the late Oligocene (~25mya). The Santa <b>Rosa</b> mammals may have lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{age of the}} Santa <b>Rosa</b> fauna remains highly uncertain, as the outcrop {{where the}} fossils were found cannot easily {{be placed in a}} known stratigraphical unit, and the fossils are so {{distinct}} from other known fossil faunas that biostratigraphy cannot provide a precise estimate. In a summary of the 2004 volume, Kenneth Campbell tentatively referred Santa <b>Rosa</b> to the Mustersan South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA), which he placed near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, around 35 million years ago. However, Mario Vucetich and colleagues suggested in 2010 that the Santa <b>Rosa</b> fauna may be substantially later—perhaps as young as the Deseadan SALMA (late Oligocene, around 25 million years ago). According to Campbell, the Santa <b>Rosa</b> mammals likely lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|Before joining Bernard in Paris, <b>Rosa</b> {{stays in}} a flat in London for several weeks. Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, <b>Rosa</b> sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not need her help. <b>Rosa</b> is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{species name}} of Musca <b>rosae</b> (Fabricius in Entomologia systematica emendata et aucta (1794)) was itself preoccupied by Musca <b>rosae</b> (De Geer 1776), which was itself a synonym of the hoverfly species Musca pyrastri Linnaeus, 1758 (now Scaeva pyrastri). The new name of Chamaepsila hennigi was {{proposed for the}} Carrot fly by Thompson & Pont in 1994. As the name <b>rosae</b> Fabricius was well known for this major crop pest, applications {{were made to the}} International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature for suppression of the name <b>rosae</b> of De Geer and the conservation of <b>rosae</b> of Fabricius. In 2006 they ruled under their plenary powers that <b>rosae</b> Fabricius, 1794 was not to be regarded as invalid by reason of being a junior primary homonym of Musca <b>rosae</b> De Geer, 1776.|$|R

40|$|The Diplolepis <b>rosae</b> gall {{community}} is analysed in Sicily (Italy), based on collections totalling 82 galls from 12 sites from which 1, 026 adult insects were obtained. The gall wasp exits in March-June from galls induced the previous year. On average 5. 6 D. <b>rosae</b> individuals per gall were obtained, corresponding to 44. 8 % {{of all the}} emerged insects. We obtained 4. 3 % of D. <b>rosae</b> males overall, the highest figure found till now for the cynipid overall in Europe, where male D. <b>rosae</b> are usually rarer, and the first record of them for the Mediterranean area. No inquilines were found, and, consequently, none of their specific parasitoids. However, Eurytoma <b>rosae,</b> generally considered as a specific parasitoid of the inquiline Periclistus brandtii, was obtained, together with the polyphagous Exeristes roborator. In all, seven parasitoid species came out from the galls: four of them, Orthopelma mediator, Torymus bedeguaris, Exeristes roborator, and Eupelmus urozonus, start to emerge together with D. <b>rosae,</b> while Glyphomerus stigma, Pteromalus bedeguaris, and E. <b>rosae,</b> have their maximum peaks later in the year. All the cited species, except for E. roborator, showed a second peak of emergence in September, when D. <b>rosae</b> is absent. Parasitization ranged from 12. 5 to 100 %, reaching more than 70 % in 66. 6 % of the samples, but it was rather low (30. 5 %) when males were present, {{even though there was}} no overall correlation between parasitization and D. <b>rosae</b> sex ratio. Statistical analysis showed however that all the parasitoid species (except for males of T. bedeguaris and P. bedeguaris) are longer (which we take to signify larger) than D. <b>rosae</b> males, and neither the size nor the sex ratio of parasitoids differed statistically depending on the presence of male D. <b>rosae.</b> It would be interesting to compare parasitization percentages in other studies where good numbers of males of D. <b>rosae</b> were recorded...|$|R

40|$|Hyphodermella is a genus of corticioid {{white rot}} fungi from the Phanerochaetaceae. Molecular data (partial SSU, LSU and {{complete}} ITS nrDNA) confirm the mitosporic state of Hyphodermella <b>rosae</b> as the causal agent of dry fruit rot of plum (Prunus domestica) and peach (Prunus persica) from Mazandaran, Iran. The asexual state of H. <b>rosae</b> {{is characterized by}} the presence of unicellular, spherical mitospores, which are terminal or intercalary in position. Both basidia and mitospores were observed in the matured cultures of H. <b>rosae,</b> although we did not observe any basidiospores. The phylogeny of Phanerochaetaceae confirms Hyphodermella as a monophyletic lineage within the family and sister group to Phanerochaete with considerable bootstrap support. Both the isolates of mitosporic H. <b>rosae</b> nest within a clade, which includes its sexual counterpart. Hence, we conclude that the lifecycle of H. <b>rosae</b> includes at least two reproductive states, i. e. sexual and asexual. Mitosporic H. <b>rosae</b> is capable of infecting plants and produce similar disease symptoms as its sexual state. [URL] and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute (FABI...|$|R

2500|$|The gall-wasp Periclistus brandtii causes no gall itself, but {{deposits}} its {{eggs in the}} bedeguar tissues {{on which}} the larvae feed. In turn, these larvae may be parasitised by a chalcid wasp, Eurytoma <b>rosae,</b> which works its way from one inquiline's cell to the next. The parasitoid ichneumon Orthopelma mediator lays its eggs directly into larvae of D. <b>rosae,</b> killing them. The chalcid wasps Eurytoma <b>rosae</b> and Glyphomerus stigma can attack both the larvae of D. <b>rosae</b> and of the inquiline [...] P. brandtii. These parasitoids may in turn be attacked by hyperparasitoids such as the chalcids Caenacis inflexa and Pteromalus bedeguaris. [...] The mossy and sticky filaments of the gall are clearly ineffective in preventing the entry of inquilines, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids.|$|R
