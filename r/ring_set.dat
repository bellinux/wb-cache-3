5|$|Victorious Boxers {{is set in}} Tokyo, Japan. The story unfolds via cut scenes set {{in either}} the Kamogawa Boxing Gym, the fictional boxing gym of the main characters, or the waiting rooms of the boxing arenas. The {{gameplay}} takes place in boxing arenas, {{some of which are}} based on locations in Japan and include Korakuen Hall, Ryogoku Sports Arena, and the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium. Other locations include the mountainous area around Niigata, and an outdoor boxing <b>ring</b> <b>set</b> in post-World War II Tokyo, Japan.|$|E
25|$|On December 13/14, 2011 Elizabeth Taylor's {{complete}} jewellery {{collection was}} auctioned by Christie's. Several ruby-set pieces {{were included in}} the sale, notably a <b>ring</b> <b>set</b> with an 8.24 ct gem that broke the 'price-per-carat' record for rubies ($512,925 per carat, i.e. over $4.2 million in total), and a necklace that sold for over $3.7 million.|$|E

50|$|The {{cryptanalyst}} {{now knew}} the plugboard, the rotor order, and the absolute {{setting of the}} rotors for the doubled key, {{but he did not}} know the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> He also knew what the message key setting should be, but that setting was useless without knowing the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> could be anything, and that meant the Poles did know how to position the rotors for the message body. All the work up to this point had focussed on exploiting the doubled key. To determine the <b>ring</b> <b>setting,</b> the attention now shifted to the actual message.|$|R
50|$|The model above {{ignored the}} right rotor's <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> (22) and ground setting (12), {{both of which}} were known because Rejewski had the daily keys. The <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> has the effect of counterrotating the drum by 21; the ground setting {{advances}} it by 11. Consequently, the rotor rotation is -10, which is also 16.|$|R
25|$|Generally, popes of {{the past}} wore episcopal rings {{in keeping with the}} fashions of the time. Pope Pius XII, for example, often wore a heavily ornate <b>ring</b> <b>set</b> with a stone. Pope Pius IX most often wore a cameo of himself, made entirely of tiny diamonds, whilst Pope Pius X wore a simple, smaller stone-set ring. In keeping with the modern spirit {{suggested}} by Pope John XXIII and actually practiced in his later years by Pope Paul VI, Pope Francis wears a simple gold-plate silver ring only for papal ceremonies, preferring his small, silver ring from his days as a cardinal.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, the New York Custom House {{collected}} {{more revenue}} from imports {{than any other}} port in the United States. By 1872, two congressional investigations and one by the Treasury Office under Secretary George S. Boutwell looked into allegations of a corruption <b>ring</b> <b>set</b> up at the New York Custom House under two Grant collector appointments, Moses H. Grinnell and Thomas Murphy. [...] Both Grinnell and Murphy allowed private merchants to store goods not claimed on the docks in private warehouses for exorbitant fees. [...] Grant's secretaries Horace Porter and Orville E. Babcock and Grant's friend George K. Leet, owner of a private warehouse, allegedly shared in these profits. [...] Secretary Boutwell advocated a reform to keep imports on company dock areas rather than being stored at designated warehouses in New York. [...] Grant's third collector appointment, Chester A. Arthur, implemented Boutwell's reform. [...] On May 25, 1870, Boutwell had implemented reforms that reduced public cartage and government costs, stopped officer gratuities, and decreased port smuggling, but on July 2, 1872, U.S. Senator Carl Schurz insinuated in a speech that no reforms had been undertaken and that the old abuses at the custom house continued. [...] The New York Times claimed that Schurz's speech was [...] "carefully prepared" [...] and [...] "more or less disfigured and discolored by error." [...] The second thorough congressional investigation concluded that abuses either did not exist, had been corrected, or {{were in the process}} of being corrected.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1930, {{shortly after}} his {{indictment}} on bribery charges, Crawford was baptized and admitted into the membership of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church. [...] The pastor at St. Paul’s was Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb, the noted minister portrayed by John Malkovich in the 2008 film Changeling. [...] On {{the day of his}} baptism, Crawford [...] placed a <b>ring</b> <b>set</b> with two large diamonds, and valued at $3,500, in the collection plate at Briegleb’s church. [...] Accompanying the ring was a note from Crawford asking Briegleb to sell the ring and use the proceeds to help build a parish house.|$|E

Lloyd joined World Championship Wrestling (then the NWA) for their 1989 Great American Bash tour, in which his debut match was a loss to Butch Reed in Albany, Georgia. He recalled in a March 2001 interview with WCW Magazine, [...] "To be in the same ring with a man that big who could move like that was intimidating." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within these {{circular}} rings {{is a small}} {{terrestrial globe}} J, fixed on an axis K, which extends {{from the north and}} south poles of the globe at n and s, to those of the celestial sphere at N and S. On this axis is fixed the flat celestial meridian L L, which may be set directly over the meridian of any place on the globe, so as to keep over the same meridian upon it. This flat meridian is graduated {{the same way as the}} brass meridian of the common globe, and its use is much the same. To this globe is fitted the movable horizon M, so as to turn upon the two strong wires proceeding from its east and west points to the globe, and entering the globe at the opposite [...] points off its equator, which is a movable brass <b>ring</b> <b>set</b> into the globe in a groove all around its equator. The globe may be turned by hand within this ring, so as to place any given meridian upon it, directly under the celestial meridian L. The horizon is divided into 360 degrees all around its outermost edge, within which are the points of the compass, for showing the amplitude of the sun and the moon, both in degrees and points. The celestial meridian L passes through two notches in the north and south points of the horizon, as in a common globe: both here, if the globe be turned round, the horizon and meridian turn with it. At the south pole of the sphere is a circle of 25 hours, fixed to the rings, and on the axis is an index which goes round that circle, if the globe be turned round its axis.|$|E
2500|$|The Mask vs. Hair {{match between}} L.A. Park and El Mesías, {{which had been}} billed as the top match of the event, took place next, with L.A. Park being {{accompanied}} to the ring by his son El Hijo de L.A. Park and the wheelchair-bound Pierroth, neither of whom were working for AAA. Just like in their previous bout at December's Guerra de Titanes, both wrestlers were bloodied and L.A. Park's mask was torn to pieces during the brawl around the arena. With the match in his control following a Skull Bomb and a topé suicida, Park pulled out a table from under the <b>ring,</b> <b>set</b> it up inside the ring and climbed {{on top of it}} for his signature dance, but was then surprised by a diving spear through the table from El Mesías, which was however only good for a two count. El Mesías followed up with a double knee backbreaker and a Mesías Splash for another two count, before locking Park in a sharpshooter. Eventually, Park managed to reach the ropes, but El Mesías pulled him back {{to the center of the}} ring and re-applied the hold. Park feigned submission by lightly tapping El Mesías on the back, which led to him releasing the hold as he believed he had won the match. El Mesías climbed to the top rope to celebrate his [...] "win" [...] and when referee Piero tried to explain that Park had not in fact submitted, El Mesías swung his leg back and accidentally kicked him in the head. Park took advantage of the distraction, hit El Mesías with brass knuckles, made the pin and scored a three count to win the match. After the match, El Mesías had his hair shaved off with L.A. Park mocking Marisela Peña Roldan, who was seated in the front row. At this point the event had lasted over three and a half hours, which led to many in attendance leaving the arena after the match, not sticking around for the main event of the evening.|$|E
