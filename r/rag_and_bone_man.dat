50|$|Donkey {{stones were}} first used in textile mills to clean greasy steps, {{and give them}} a {{non-slip}} finish. However the stones also became popular with housewives who would use them to give doorsteps a decorative finish. Quite often the stones would be given out in exchange for old clothes or scrap metal, by rag totters, or <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men</b> as they were sometimes called.|$|R
50|$|Steptoe and Son is a 1972 British comedy drama {{film and}} a {{spin-off}} {{from the popular}} British television comedy series {{of the same name}} about two father <b>and</b> son <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men.</b> It starred Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett as the eponymous characters, Albert and Harold Steptoe respectively. It also features Carolyn Seymour. A sequel Steptoe and Son Ride Again was released the following year.|$|R
50|$|After their {{association}} with Hancock had ended, they wrote a series of Comedy Playhouse (1961-62), ten one-off half-hour plays for the BBC. One play in the series, The Offer, was well received, and from this emerged Steptoe and Son (1962-74), about two <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men,</b> father <b>and</b> son, who live together in a squalid house in West London. This {{was the basis for}} the American series Sanford and Son and the Swedish series Albert & Herbert.|$|R
5000|$|And Also the Trees' 10th album, (Listen For) The <b>Rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>Man,</b> {{was issued}} in November 2007.

50|$|The karung guni, Zabbaleen, the <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man,</b> waste picker, junk man or bin hoker are {{terms for}} people who make their living by sorting and trading trash. A similar process known as {{gleaning}} was practised in rural areas and some ancient agricultural societies, where the residue from farmers' fields was collected.|$|E
5000|$|Steven Burrows {{grew up in}} {{the county}} of Worcestershire. In 1983 he joined the band And Also The Trees and stayed until 2007. He didn't {{participate}} in their 2007 album (Listen For) The <b>Rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>Man</b> [...] and their new acoustic album When The Rains Come and didn't take part in their live shows in 2007 and 2008.|$|E

50|$|Although it was solely {{a job for}} {{the lowest}} of the working classes, rag-picking was {{considered}} an honest occupation, more {{on the level of}} street sweeper than of a beggar. In Paris, for instance, rag-pickers were regulated by law: their operations were restricted to certain times of night, and they were required to return any unusually valuable items to the owner or to the authorities. When Eugène Poubelle introduced the garbage can in 1884, he was criticized in the French newspapers for meddling with the rag-pickers' livelihoods. Modern sanitation and recycling programs ultimately caused the profession to decline, though it did not disappear entirely; <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men</b> are not uncommon in England today.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{documentation}} exists of <b>rag</b> pickers <b>and</b> {{scrap metal}} collectors supplying goods to paper mills and foundries {{as early as}} the 17th century, modern waste picking did not flourish in the US and Europe until the 19th century. [...] Just as in the developing world, the combination of industrialization and urbanization led to three trends which favored the blossoming of the informal waste collecting industry: increased generation of urban waste, increased demand for raw materials from industry, and increased numbers of urban dwellers in need of livelihoods. In that era, waste pickers were known as wharf rats, tinkers, <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men,</b> mudlarks, <b>and</b> ragpickers. By the mid-20th century waste picking decreased, as waste management industries were formalized, and welfare states decreased the poor’s reliance on informal recycling.|$|R
50|$|Sidney Bates {{was born}} in Camberwell, London on 14 June 1921 to Frederick, a <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man,</b> and Gladys May Bates. At the {{outbreak}} of war, Bates {{was working as a}} carpenter's labourer. He joined the British Army and served in 1st Battalion of the Royal Norfolk Regiment in 1940 after it returned from being stationed in Delhi, British India.|$|E
50|$|Woodward {{was born}} in Brent Knoll in Somerset, England and {{was the son of}} a General dealer (<b>Rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man).</b> He was educated to {{elementary}} level in England and initially worked with his father but later became a produce agent and farmer in East Brent. Woodward migrated to Australia in 1922 and was a farm produce agent and company director. He sat in parliament as a member of the Labor Party but joined the Liberal Party after leaving office.|$|E
50|$|A common {{trend in}} sitcoms {{is to place}} the double act in a {{situation}} where they are forced together through uncontrollable circumstance. In another Galton and Simpson production, Steptoe and Son, a son, with great ambition, was forced to live with his elderly, manipulative father as a <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man.</b> The comedy derives from the way the characters interact in their tempestuous relationship. The series also has more heart-rending moments as the son despairs at his inability to escape his needy, selfish, grasping father.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, the Whitehawk area consisted mainly of pig farms, smallholdings and allotments. This would all change between 1920 and 1931 when Brighton Corporation, in common with local government authorities all over the country, began a program of slum clearances. Whitehawk was one of the areas used for new homes to house the residents. The homes were designed to have [...] "all modern conveniences" [...] including electricity, gas and running water. They also had gardens. This was a huge contrast to the small, back to back terraces in the town centre, which they replaced. Some people found it very difficult to adjust. This was partly because many of those moved earned their living as <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men,</b> conducting their business by horse and cart. This was hard to do from so far out of town.|$|R
5000|$|Food. In many {{developing}} countries, food is rarely thrown away {{unless it is}} rotten as food is scarce in comparison to developed nations. In countries like the United States, where 40 to 50 percent of food is wasted, the trash contains a lot more food to gather. In many countries, charities collect excess food from supermarkets and restaurants and distribute it to impoverished neighbourhoods. Trash pickers, Karung guni, Zabaleen, <b>and</b> <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men</b> in these countries may concentrate on looking for usable items or scrap materials to sell rather than food items. In the United States, Canada, and Europe, some bakeries, grocery stores, or restaurants will routinely donate food according to a Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, but more often, because of health laws or company policy, {{they are required to}} discard food items by the expiration date, because of overstock, being overly ripened, spoiled, cosmetically imperfect, or blemished.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of Karung guni {{is common in}} Singapore. Its practitioners are a modern form of <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men</b> that visit residences door-to-door. They can either walk along corridors (if that particular HDB estate has a covered carpark) or for certain HDB estates where the carpark is right under the HDB blocks, walk through the carpark downstairs honking a horn. However, around landed properties, they may drive around in a lorry with a horn attached to it, instead of going door-to-door. They make visits in carts, collecting old newspapers and other unwanted items. These will be resold at specialized markets and eventually recycled or reused. [...] "Karung guni" [...] is a Malay phrase for gunny sack, which {{was used in the}} past to hold the newspapers. The karung guni men would haul the heavy sacks on their backs as they walked their rounds to do the collection. Today, most of them use a hand truck instead.|$|R
50|$|Early in the 1860s, Holmes {{married and}} the couple moved to Burnley. There, he was a leading founder member of the Burnley Weavers' Association. In 1871, he was elected as its president, serving until his death. He focused his {{activities}} on promoting collective bargaining for wages; he opposed the eight-hour day and supported child labour as he believed these contributed to the weavers' comparative advantage over workers elsewhere. Despite his moderation, he was blacklisted by employers and instead took work as a <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man</b> to support his family, alongside his union role. In 1878, he led the union in part of a major but unsuccessful county-wide strike. This led, in 1884, {{to the creation of}} the Northern Counties Amalgamated Association of Weavers, with Holmes as president.|$|E
50|$|Money For Nothing is a BBC TV series {{hosted by}} Sarah Moore, Jay Blades and EJ Osborne The {{premise of the}} show is to take other peoples' rubbish which the {{presenter}} 'rescues' from council refuse collection sites {{and with the help of}} a designer turns these items into desirable items which are then sold. Any profit made is then returned to the individual(s) who disposed of the item originally.Now in its third series the show voice over is provided by comedian and writer Authur Smith.Money For Nothing Celebrity Series is due to air in September 2017.Series 4 is currently in production.Regular designers include, Norman Wilkinson, Rupert Blanchard, Emma Walker, Forge Creative, Sarah Peterson, Neil Wragg, Ray Clarke, Daniel Health, Mark 'Horse' Philips, Bex Simon, The <b>Rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>Man,</b> Guy Trench.|$|E
50|$|As {{sanitation}} engineering {{came to be}} practised {{beginning in}} the mid-19th century and human waste was conveyed from the home in pipes, the gong farmer {{was replaced by the}} municipal trash collector as there remained growing amounts of household refuse, including fly ash from coal, which was burnt for home heating. In Paris, the <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man</b> worked {{side by side with the}} municipal bin man, though reluctantly: in 1884, Eugène Poubelle introduced the first integrated kerbside collection and recycling system, requiring residents to separate their waste into perishable items, paper and cloth, and crockery and shells. He also established rules for how private collectors and city workers should cooperate and he developed standard dimensions for refuse containers: his name in France is now synonymous with the garbage can. Under Poubelle, food waste and other organics collected in Paris were transported to nearby Saint Ouen where they were composted. This continued well into the 20th century when plastics began to contaminate the waste stream.|$|E
5000|$|Nicanor {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the Marta Sahagún episode, as a [...] "ropavejero" [...] (a <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bones</b> <b>man),</b> a low-class Mexican clothes [...] "expert." [...] His first appearance was so popular that he became a recurring character. Apparently, Nicanor {{spends most of his}} time in the studio as a handyman, for he is randomly introduced in every episode. He once hosted a section of his own named [...] "Cartas a Marito" [...] (Letters to Marito), in which fans would send letters mail to express their opinion on the show and its characters. He suffered a mysterious accident just before the beginning of a show which left him in a coma. He later reappeared again, but his section was canceled. He speaks with a common Mexico City accent. Like Don Polo (whose bombed jokes simply did not appeal to the producer of the show), he hosted the show while Mario and Bob were on vacation. He has managed to interview a couple of guests when Mario and Bob are not around, like Saddam Hussein. On that same episode we got to meet his aunt, the psychic Madame Wendolyn (her real name is Anastasia). Another relative that has also appeared on the show is Cyber-Carlos, Nicanor's cousin. He is supposed to be the electronic voice that reads out loud the news from Reforma.|$|R
40|$|Emaús Bilbao Cooperative Company is {{a social}} economy and {{solidarity}} organization for socio-labour insertion. It {{is dedicated to the}} comprehensive management of solid urban waste. It has its headquarters in Bilbao and carries out its work in Vizcaya. From 1970, the year in which Emaús established itself in Vizcaya, to the present day, the organization has experienced an evolution which has led it to change its management direction. Gone are the days when they were only known as “the <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>men</b> of Emaus” with all the connotations that were associated with that name. At present we find a company which has adopted new management formulas without losing the characteristics of its social and solidarity project. This has enabled it {{to face up to the}} prevailing conditions in today economic climate. In this way it has been able to guarantee its survival. The comprehensive management of solid urban waste is made up of four diverse parts: The location of the urban solid waste through the receiving of telephone calls, its collection and selection, and the final elimination of those things that can not be incorporated again into the consumer chain. Through this case, the problems that arise for the organization with reference to the management of Human Resources are analysed. These are related above all to the motivational and decision making aspects due to the diverse characteristics as much in their own workers as in the organization. social action, municipal solid waste Management; company staff motivation, internal communication...|$|R

5000|$|The show, and the actors' careers, are milked dry. Corbett {{is unable}} to obtain work {{that is not a}} {{variation}} on his cockney <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man</b> persona. At the start, Corbett as Richard II had spoken the words [...] "I wasted time and now doth time waste me," [...] and at the end he says them to himself as he awaits his cue in a live recording of Steptoe and Son. Finally Corbett is depicted as unable to find any work except pantomime or a stage version of Steptoe in Australia. This, however, was untrue, as Corbett appeared in several films in the late 1970s. The script also implies that Corbett was reluctant {{to take part in the}} tour, when it was in fact his suggestion. The idea was put to him by a theatre producer. Having then contacted Wilfrid Brambell to see if he was available, it was Corbett who put the idea forward to writers Galton and Simpson, not the other way round.|$|E
5000|$|The {{brothers}} pool {{their resources}} and {{travel to the}} depot, where they are told that trams are indeed for sale but have to be collected and cannot be delivered to Sussex. The only candidate is an old horse-drawn tram, for which they manage to secure a horse called Homer from a retired <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man.</b> Unfortunately, the depot has no destination boards for Sussex, {{but they do have}} one for Canterbury [...] - [...] for which the brothers set off via the Old Kent Road, accompanied by Homer's companion, a dog called Tiger. They gain fare-paying passengers at Harbledown and begin a regular if slow service between there and Canterbury, and also acquire a conductor called Hattie, but rival companies eventually force them to move on {{due to the lack of}} a PSV operator's license. They travel back to Worthing and gain the support of the wealthy resident of Goring Hall, who, inspired by their determination, funds the purchase and transport of an electric tram from Acton; this is renovated and put into service in Worthing town centre.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the 20th {{century the}} amount of waste {{generated}} by a household was relatively small. Household wastes were often simply thrown out the window, buried in the garden or deposited in outhouses (see more at urban archaeology). When human concentrations became more dense, waste collectors, called nightmen or gong farmers were hired to collect the night soil from pail closets, performing their duties only at night (hence the name). Meanwhile, disposing of refuse became a problem wherever cities grew. Often refuse was placed in unusable areas just outside the city, such as wetlands and tidal zones. One example is London, which from Roman times disposed of its refuse outside the London Wall beside the River Thames. Another example is 1830s Manhattan, where thousands of hogs were permitted to roam the streets and eat garbage. A small industry developed as [...] "swill children" [...] collected kitchen refuse to sell for pig feed and the <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man</b> traded goods for bones (used for glue) and rags (essential for paper manufacture prior to the invention of wood pulping). Later, in the late nineteenth century, trash was fed to swine in industrial.|$|E

50|$|Another {{connected}} {{story is}} the Northern German folktale of The Three Gifts. One day three wealthy students find a poor weaver and give him one hundred dollars. The weaver hid the money in some rags; however, his wife sells them to a <b>rag</b> <b>and</b> <b>bone</b> <b>man.</b> The students return to find the weaver poorer than before, and give him another hundred dollars, this time they tell him to be more careful; so the weaver hides it in a dust-tub; however, his wife sells the dust-tub, losing the money a second time. When the students returned a third time they angrily give him a piece of lead stating that they would more foolish than he if they gave him money a third time.One day a fisherman came to the weaver's home, asking if he could use the lead as a weight for his net, promising the weaver the first big fish he catches. The weaver agrees and the fisherman brings him his fish. When gutting the fish the weaver finds a large shining stone and sells it for one thousand dollars making him a wealthy man.There is a near exact cognate of the German tale in an Arabian tale, though {{the man is a}} ropemaker not a weaver.|$|E
