40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Rings is one of six disciplines in Men's Artistic Gymnastics. Judging criteria stipulate that a routine must incorporate two swinging elements completed in a motionless handstand. Performing backward and forward longswings in a routine fulfils this requirement. During both types of longswing, gymnasts typically use large angle changes at their hip and shoulder joints and move their arms laterally. Previous studies have ignored these three-dimensional arm movements, possibly neglecting a crucial aspect of technique. Using a computer simulation model this study investigated the contributions of hip and shoulder elevation angle changes and lateral arm movements {{to the performance of}} backward and forward longswings. A three-dimensional video and cable tension analysis of several backward and forward longswings performed by two elite gymnasts was conducted. The data provided accurate three-dimensional descriptions of backward and forward longswing techniques and the forces experienced by the gymnasts. In addition, data describing deformations of the rings frame and the extension of the gymnast were determined. A simulation model representing the three-dimensional movements of the <b>rings</b> <b>cables</b> and arms of a gymnast was developed. The model represented {{the right side of the}} gymnast and rings apparatus and comprised five segments: <b>rings</b> <b>cable,</b> arm, torso with head, thigh, and shank with foot. Damped linear springs represented the elasticity of the apparatus and gymnast. The model was evaluated against actual backward and forward longswing performances of two elite gymnasts. Actual joint angle time histories describing the gymnasts' techniques, together with subject specific inertia parameters, were used for this procedure. The RMS differences between values estimated by the model and actual values for the orientation of the gymnast and <b>rings</b> <b>cable,</b> the cable tension and the body extension were 4. 3 °, 2. 1 °, 161 N and 0. 1 m respectively. The evaluated model was used to determine the contributions of each aspect of technique to the performance of longswings. Hip and shoulder elevation angle changes are important in producing the required rotation of the gymnast in both types of longswing. Without these components of technique the gymnast generated up to 113 ° less rotation. Lateral arm movements performed during backward longswings resulted in 40...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Human Movement Science [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] elite gymnasts perform the straight arm backward longswing on rings during their competition routines in order to satisfy specific judging requirements. Measured peak combined cable tension during a backward longswing is typically in excess of 9 bodyweights and forces of this magnitude have been associated with an increased risk of injury to gymnasts' shoulders. This study investigated the contribution of longswing technique and the elasticity of the gymnast and rings apparatus to minimising loading at the shoulders. A three-dimensional video and cable tension analysis was conducted on a backward longswing performed by an elite gymnast. This analysis provided information regarding the motion of the <b>rings</b> <b>cables,</b> the gymnast's technique and the elasticity of the rings apparatus. A three-dimensional five-segment computer simulation model of a gymnast swinging on rings was developed. The inertial characteristics for the model were determined from anthropometric measurements of the gymnast and measurements taken directly from the rings apparatus. The simulation model was evaluated by comparing the backward longswing from the data collection with a simulation of the same performance. The root mean squared (rms) differences between the actual performance of the longswing and the simulation for cable tension, orientations of the gymnast and <b>rings</b> <b>cables</b> and the wrist to ankle length of the gymnast were 297 N, 3. 3 °, 1. 1 ° and 0. 06 m, respectively. During the simulated longswing the peak combined force at the shoulders was 8. 5 bodyweights. Modifications to the evaluated simulation of the longswing were used to determine the effect of the gymnast's technique, his elasticity and that of the rings apparatus on peak shoulder force. Altering the gymnast's technique, by fixing the gymnast in a straight body configuration throughout the swing, increased the peak shoulder force by 2. 56 bodyweights. Removing only the lateral arm movements, which form part of the gymnast's technique, also resulted in an increased peak shoulder force (0. 73 bodyweights). Removing only the elasticity of the apparatus or gymnast from the evaluated simulation resulted in smaller increases in peak shoulder force (0. 62 bodyweights and 0. 53 bodyweights). Although the elasticity of the gymnast and apparatus contribute to minimising peak shoulder force, this study shows that the contribution of a gymnast's technique is considerably greater...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial, Journal of Biomechanics [© Elsevier]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] elite gymnasts perform the straight arm backward longswing on rings in competition. Since points are deducted if gymnasts possess motion on completion of the movement, the ability to successfully perform the longswing to a stationary final handstand is of great importance. Sprigings et al. (1998) found that for a longswing initiated from a still handstand the optimum performance of an inelastic planar simulation model resulted in a residual swing of more than 3 ° in the final handstand. For the present study, a three-dimensional simulation model of a gymnast swinging on rings, incorporating lateral arm movements used by gymnasts and mandatory apparatus elasticity, was used to investigate the possibility of performing a backward longswing initiated and completed in handstands with minimal swing. Root mean square differences between the actual and simulated performances for the orientations of the gymnast and <b>rings</b> <b>cables,</b> the combined cable tension and the extension of the gymnast were 3. 2 °, 1. 0 °, 270 N and 0. 05 m respectively. The optimised simulated performance initiated from a handstand with 2. 1 ° of swing and using realistic changes to the gymnast's technique resulted in 0. 6 ° of residual swing in the final handstand. The sensitivity of the backward longswing to perturbations in the technique used for the optimised performance was determined. For a final handstand with minimal residual swing (2 °) the changes in body configuration must be timed to within 15 m s while a delay of 30 m s will result in considerable residual swing (7 °) ...|$|R

2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground <b>ring)</b> conductor, <b>cable</b> radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|R
50|$|Diamond {{wire cutting}} (DWC) {{is the process}} of using wire of various diameters and lengths, {{impregnated}} with diamond dust of various sizes to cut through materials. Because of the hardness of diamonds, this cutting technique can cut through almost any material that is softer than the diamond abrasive. DWC is also practical and less expensive than some other cutting techniques, for example, thin diamond wire cost around 10-20 cents per foot ($0.7/m) in 2005 for 140 to 500 micrometer diameter wire, to manufacture and sells around $1.25 a foot ($4.10/m) or more, compared to solid diamond impregnated blade cutters costing thousands of dollars. Thus a 1,000 foot (300 m) spool of diamond wire costs around $200 to manufacture and sells for around $1,250. Selling cost may vary because of wire grade and demand. Other diamond wire cutting can use shaped diamond <b>rings</b> threaded through <b>cables.</b> These larger cables are used to cut concrete and other large projects.|$|R

The first structure is an array, or hanging chain of aluminum beads which would serve as a convenient communicator if, {{under the influence of the}} Earth's gravity gradient, it assumes a local vertical orientation as it circles the Earth. Two passive schemes have been proposed for damping the rigid modes: twist the wire at the ends to provide non-zero moment of inertia about the vertical, thereby inducing relative motion of the two tips during rigid pitch or roll, and thus exercising a damper; and introduce weak lossy springs between the end sections and the main section; thereby providing linear coupling between the springs and all the in-plane (pitch) modes. The second structure is a complete <b>ring</b> of satellites <b>cabled</b> together at synchronous altitude. By a slight increase in altitude, the cable is in tension.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundFission yeast {{possesses}} three unconventional myosins: Myo 1 p (a class I myosin {{that function}}s at endocytic actin patches) and Myo 51 p and Myo 52 p (class V myosins that function at contractile <b>rings</b> and actin <b>cables,</b> respectively). Here {{we used a}} combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to investigate how changes in the actin track influence the motor activity and spatial regulation of these myosins. ResultsWe optimized the isolation of Myo 1 p, Myo 51 p, and Myo 52 p. All three myosins exhibited robust motor activity in ATPase and actin filament gliding assays. However, decoration of actin with tropomyosin differentially regulates the activity of these motors. Tropomyosin inhibits Myo 1 p by blocking its ability to form productive associations with actin filaments, whereas tropomyosin increases the actin affinity and ATPase activity of Myo 51 p and Myo 52 p. The actin filament crosslinking protein fimbrin rescues Myo 1 p motor activity by displacing tropomyosin from actin filaments. Consistent with our in vitro findings, fimbrin and tropomyosin have opposing effects on Myo 1 p function at actin patches. Defects in tropomyosin function led to shorter Myo 1 p patch lifetimes, whereas loss of fimbrin extended Myo 1 p lifetimes. Furthermore, defects in tropomyosin function decreased the efficiency of Myo 52 p-directed motility along actin cables in the cell. ConclusionTropomyosin promotes myosin-V motility along actin cables. Accumulation of fimbrin at actin patches relieves Myo 1 p from tropomyosin-mediated inhibition, ensuring maximal myosin-I motor activity at these sites. Thus, spatial regulation of myosin motor function is in part controlled by specific changes {{in the composition of}} the actin track...|$|R
