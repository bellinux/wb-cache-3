They go to lord Rama for justice. With {{the help of the}} sages, Rama proves the superiority of ragi over rice. Ragi becomes blessed by absorbing the qualities of Raghava, another epithet of Rama. It is interpreted as poverty and humility being upheld by the poet above material wealth. Even today ragi is food of the poor which has high nutrition value compared to rice. Ragi is a good source of nutrition for people with diabetes for its low sugar content and nutrition value.|$|E

50|$|His {{writings}} were {{unique in}} style. In Ramadhanyacharitre, an allegory on {{the conflict between}} the socially strong and weak castes and classes, presented as an argument between two foodgrains, rice and ragi, is a most creative literary piece with a powerful social message, In the work, rice represents the socially powerful and <b>ragi</b> (<b>millet)</b> represents the working people. The two grains come before Rama to argue their case and establish their superiority. In the end Rama sends both of them to prison for six months. At the end of the period, rice has turned rotten while the hardy ragi survives, earning Rama's blessings. This shows the intelligence of Kanaka Daasa in trying to reform the society. He was blunt in criticizing those who opposed the good practices. In one of his compositions he says,"Eternal hell is for those who criticize noble men, for those who condemn teachings of jagadguru...".|$|E

5000|$|Millets {{are major}} food sources in arid and {{semiarid}} {{regions of the}} world, and feature in the traditional cuisine of many others.

5000|$|Arkalgud {{is located}} at [...] It has an average {{elevation}} of 916 metres (3005 feet).It lies partly in semi-malnad and partly in maidan tract. It is bound in the north by Hassan taluk, in south by Hunsur taluk of Mysore district, in the east by Holenarasipura taluk and west by Kodagu. The total geographical area of the Taluk is 675 km2. It occupies sixth place in the District in terms of geographical area. The soil is red sandy derived from granites, gneiss and schists. The soil is red to brownish in colour, shallow to fairly deep shallow, loamy to sandy loamy in texture intermixed with fairly large amounts of coarse gravel and pebbles. They are well drained but poor in bases and water holding capacity. It is favourable for growing crops like paddy, sugarcane, coconut, potato, vegetables and plantation crops under irrigated conditions. It is suitable for growing <b>ragi,</b> <b>millets,</b> pulses, groundnut, potato and maize under rain-fed conditions. The river Kaveri enters at Kodavinahosahalli, a village {{in the south of}} Arkalgud and flows only through a small portion of about 24 km and enters Mysore district. An Anicut called Krishnarajakatte has been constructed across the river in the Taluk from which two channels viz. Kattepura channel and Ramanathapura channel take off for a length of about 24 km and 30 km respectively. The Kattepura channel runs along the south bank, past Rudrapatna; and the Ramanathapura Channel along the north bank past Konnanur and Ramanathapura to Basavapatna. The river Hemavati divides Arakalgud and Hassan taluks. The river enters in Honnathapura in the western side and flows towards to east and enters Holenarasipura taluk. The taluk receives rainfall from south-west monsoon. It {{is located at}} around 3085 ft above sea level. This taluk enjoys dry and cold climate during the year as {{the central part of the}} Taluk borders the Malenadu region and south-eastern portions form the southern maidan region. One can find some low hilly regions in the taluk as well as high altitude region such as Hippi-betta (3486 ft. or 1063 meters) in the western portion of the taluk.|$|R
40|$|Most millets are {{classified}} with maize, sorghum and Coix (Job's tears) {{in the grass}} sub-family Panicoideae, but two species, tef and <b>ragi</b> (finger <b>millet)</b> are placed in a separate sub-family, the Chloridoideae. In all species the major storage proteins are alcohol-soluble prolamins, but their properties vary. For example, although the kafirins of sorghum {{are closely related to}} the zeins of maize, they differ in their solubility properties, being more efficiently extracted with 60 % (v/v) tertiary butanol, a less polar solvent than propan- 2 -ol. Maize prolamins {{are classified}} into four groups, termed alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-zeins. Of these, the alpha-zeins are the major fraction but have low nutritional quality, with low contents of cysteine and methionine and no lysine or tryptophan. In contrast, the beta-zeins and delta-zeins contain about 11 mol % and over 20 mol % methionine, respectively. Alpha-type prolamins appear to be the major components in sorghum, Coix and all millet species which have been analysed in detail (pearl millet, foxtail millet, kodo <b>millet,</b> tef, <b>ragi),</b> with the exception of fonio (Digitaria exilis). Sorghum and Coix also contain homologues of the beta-and gamma-zeins of maize and sorghum homologues of delta-zein. Less well-characterized methionine-rich components have also been reported in foxtail millet and fonio, forming the major prolamin group in the latter species...|$|R

As this mixture boils and reaches the brim of the vessel, ragi flour is added which forms a mound on top of boiling water. The flour is allowed to cook in this fashion on medium high flame. Later {{with the help of a}} wooden stick (ಮುದ್ದೆ ಕೋಲು: mudde kolu / ಹಿಟ್ಟಿನ ದೊಣ್ಣೆ: [...] hiTTin doNNe), the flour is beaten to a smooth dough like consistency with no lumps.

Mudde, by itself, does not have a strong taste. Ragi Mudde is traditionally eaten with saaru (predominantly vegetarian, but sometimes also made from meat), but can also be eaten with yogurt or butter milk. The saaru is often flavoured by mixing a dash of spicy, freshly ground green-chilli paste (ಖಾರ [...] "Khaara"), in one's plate - according to taste. [...] "Ragi Mudde-Bassaru" [...] is a popular combination among the farming communities in Karnataka. Bassaru is made from the decanted water, which remains after (an assortment of) pulses are steamed (usually along with a couple of pods of garlic). This water takes up the earthy flavour of the pulses to nicely complement the earthy flavour of the 'Mudde' itself. Browned onions, red chillies, and some garlic are browned, and then ground into a paste along with grated coconut. This is added to the water, and the mixture is finally seasoned with Chaunk. The steamed pulses themselves are often used to prepare a dry side salad known as 'palya' (ಪಲ್ಯ).|$|R
