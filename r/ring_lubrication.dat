40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{investigation of}} the influence of the friction force calculation method on the results of simulations run {{with the use of the}} model of gas flow from the combustion chamber to the crankcase and piston rings motion in the grooves. The first series of simulations was run using the gas flow and ring motion model in which the friction force was calculated from the empirical equation.

In that case the friction force was derived from the hydrodynamic model of <b>ring</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Comparison of the results obtained in the first and second series of simulations indicated that despite the fact that the friction forces calculated with these two methods differed considerably, the method of friction force calculation had insignificant effect. This refers to the quantities determined in the simulations which are most important from practical point of view – i. e. displacements of the rings in the grooves, pressure courses in inter-ring regions and blowby rate.

40|$|The piston ring-pack {{exhibits}} a complex dynamic behaviour, {{which includes the}} dynamics of the rings and related gas flow and oil flows, twisting of the piston rings and its influence on ring-liner and ring-groove lubrication and contact, and unsteady oil supply to upper piston rings and its effects on ring-liner lubrication. These dynamic phenomena {{play a crucial role in}} the piston assembly response such as blowby, friction, wear and oil consumption and it is of both theoretical and practical interest to understand and model them. In fact, a significant share of the total power loss in a modern automotive engine is due to the ring pack/cylinder wall friction. On this basis, the lubrication of the piston ring has been an important research matter for many years, because it is generally accepted that the interaction at the ring-cylinder wall interface provides substantial effects on friction, wear, oil consumption and power loss in internal combustion engines.

40|$|Piston ring packs {{are used}} in {{internal}} combustion engines to seal both the high pressure gas in the combustion chamber and the lubricant oil in the crank case. The interaction between the piston ring pack and the cylinder bore contributes substantially to the total friction power loss for IC engines. The aim of this thesis work is to advance {{the understanding of the}} ring liner lubrication through numerical modeling. A twin-land oil control <b>ring</b> <b>lubrication</b> model and a top two-ring lubrication model are developed based on a deterministic approach. The models take into consideration the effect of both the liner finish micro geometry and the ring face macro profile. The liner finish effect is evaluated on a 3 D deterministically measured liner finish patch, with fully-flooded oil supply condition to the oil control rings and starved oil supply condition to the top two rings. Correlations based on deterministic calculations and proper scaling are developed to connect the average hydrodynamic pressure and friction to the critical geometrical parameters and operating parameters so that cycle evaluation of the <b>ring</b> <b>lubrication</b> can be performed in an efficient manner. The models can be used for ring pack friction prediction, and ring pack/liner design optimization based on the trade-off of friction power loss and oil consumption. To provide further insights to the effect of liner finish, a wear model is then developed to simulate the liner surface geometry evolution during the break-in/wear process. The model is based on the idea of simulated repetitive grinding on the plateau part of the liner finish using a random grinder. The model successfully captures the statistic topological features of the worn liner roughness. Combining the piston ring pack model and the liner finish wear model, one can potentially predict the long term ring pack friction loss. Finally the thesis covers the experimental validation of the twin-land oil control ring model using floating liner engine friction measurements. The modeled ring friction is compared with the experimental measurement under different ring designs and liner finishes. The result shows that the model in general successfully predicts the friction force of the twin-land oil control ring/liner pair. by Haijie Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hydraulic motor {{depends on the}} lubrication performance of the piston ring. If the film is too thin then wear occurs quickly, if it is too thick then oil is lost into the cylinder and efficiency is reduced. In this paper a technique for oil film measurement based on ultrasonic reflection is investigated. This {{has the potential to}} be used non-invasively on real components. An ultrasonic pulse will reflect from a thin film interposed between two solids. The proportion of the pulse that is reflected depends on the stiffness of the intermediate layer. If the acoustic properties of the film material are known, then the stiffness can readily be used to determine the film thickness. This principle has been employed for the piston <b>ring</b> <b>lubrication</b> case. A piston/cylinder test bench has been used to evaluate the ultrasonic method. A focusing piezo-electric transducer is mounted outside the cylinder and ultrasonic pulses reflected back from the inner bore. The variation of these pulses as the piston ring passes underneath is investigated and used to determine oil film thickness. Films in the range 0. 7 to 1. 3 Î¼m were measured; the thickness did not depend strongly on either ring speed or sealed pressure. Several practical aspects were investigated such as, attenuation in the cylinder material, response time, and transducer resolution. Whilst this study demonstrated that film thickness measurement is feasible, there are a number of practical considerations that require further work, principally the focusing and coupling of the ultrasonic transducer and the response time...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is concerned with developing {{a greater understanding of}} piston <b>ring</b> <b>lubrication</b> and consists of both experimental and theoretical components. It begins with a review of piston ring and ring pack lubrication studies, describing how the understanding of the operation of piston rings has progressed since the late 19 th Century. A well-established method of analysing the hydrodynamic lubrication of a single piston ring, utilizing coordinate data to describe the ring face profile, is then presented. Calculation of mixed/boundary friction, when the lubricant film thickness falls below a pre-determined level, is included. The predictions of this program are then compared to results obtained by other workers to validate its operation. This analysis is then developed to investigate the influence of the circumferential variation in piston ring face profile on the lateral motion of the piston ring centre. The complex relationship between variation in ring face profile, angular ring gap position and bore shape is then examined. These features are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the calculation of ring centre locus, oil transport and lubricant film thicknesses. The model is then applied to predict the influence of the distorted bore shape of a cylinder from an experimental engine apparatus. Following this, the development, testing, calibration and performance of a capacitance based measurement system capable of recording piston ring face profiles on a single pass, is described. This system was used with twenty-one transducers, of novel design, to allow the axial and circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness to be monitored on an engine liner. This liner was fitted in an engine apparatus which had the additional facility of being able to measure the instantaneous friction between the piston assembly and cylinder liner using a "floating liner" technique. Experimental measurements of instantaneous friction force and the circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness are then compared to theoretical predictions for a range of operating conditions. The comparisons reveal a reasonable level of agreement between measurements with consistent overall trends. The effect of varying bore distortion is also examined theoretically. It is shown that an increase in the severity of bore distortion does not necessarily result in an increase in net oil transport...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to characterise piston <b>ring</b> <b>lubrication</b> in reciprocating test rigs and engines in terms of film thickness {{as a function of}} oil properties, reciprocating speed and load. A purpose-built test rig, which consists of a moving liner and a fixed piston ring, is used to measure the oil film thickness employing the capacitance and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) techniques. The intensity of the fluorescent light measured as voltage is interpreted as film thickness through calibration. Ring profile fitting is being used as the standard calibration method, but also a dynamic technique has been proposed whereby a groove of known depth on a piston ring specimen is used to provide in-situ dynamic calibration, circumventing the uncertainties of oil film temperature and properties variation during the cycle. A micrometer based static calibration method is compared directly to the dynamic one. The power output of the fibres should be taken into account as well as background noise and resident voltage on the fluorescence detector. Extensive oil parametric studies have been conducted and oil film thickness, LIF, friction and oil film pressure measurements are presented and compared for different speed, load, temperature, lubricant type and piston-ring geometry. The goal of enhancing the repeatability of the parametric study was achieved through the different positioning of the capacitance transducer and through the increased rigidity of the simulation rig. Useful results were drawn and the effect of properties such as viscosity, viscosity index, HTHS, piston - ring curvature and ring "effective width" on film thickness, film pressure and friction could be determined. Viscosity remains an important factor. Oil flow visualisation using a CCD camera allowed observation of cavitation throughout the stroke through a glass liner. At mid-stroke the presence of string cavities was evident, whereas near the dead centres the initiation of cavitation was observed in the form of fern-shaped cavities at the diverging wedge of the piston ring specimen at all times. The cavities take the shape of ferns, grown ferns, fissures, strings and bubbles. The existence of the cavities, previously identified indirectly with the LIF technique, was further supported by measurements using a new aluminium liner which incorporates a miniature pressure transducer used for the first time for oil film pressure measurements and an optical fibre. The oil film pressure measurements provided further support to the interpretation of cavitation at different parts of the stroke. The transition between different cavitating conditions (from P vapour to P atm) previously identified in the minimum oil film thickness measurement signal was further supported by the addition of the glass liner and the pressure transducer. Eventually, an insight was obtained into the onset and development of cavitation in the piston assembly via the simulation test rig, which will encourage further efforts in modelling cavitation under a much wider range of operating conditions than those examined here. Engine testing under motoring conditions was conducted in a modified single cylinder engine with parts of the liner cut and fitted with quartz windows for visualisation experiments. Comparable cavity forms to the test rig were identified and an approach towards their formation is presented. It became clear that the numerous factors affecting the lubrication between the piston-rings and cylinder liner in the engine are giving a different picture compared to the single-ring test rig where the structures are more uniform and the transition fi-om one cavitation type to another is much clearer. The unavailability of the oil film pressure measurements for the engine, though, does not support as strongly the findings from imaging. The top compression ring operates under starved lubrication conditions. Oil droplets were captured by the camera emerging from the ring side clearances that contribute to oil transport. Higher magnification imaging gave further evidence and was compared with previous engine research on oil transport. The engine study was limited by the unclear images obtained from the CCD camera and the window size which on one hand has the required size for the fixture firing tests and on another is quite small to provide adequate information about the residence time of the cavities that were identified. Another limiting factor of the study regarding the simulation test rig is that it can only provide data for the case of atmospheric conditions. Imperial Users onll...|$|E

30|$|The {{types of}} surface textures {{influenced}} the friction coefficient behaviors markedly {{as shown in}} Table  3. The variation of the friction coefficient between cylinder liner and piston ring of the {{two different types of}} surface texture processed by CNCPM were compared and analyzed. At the load of 200  N, the friction coefficient in the micro V-groove surface was smaller than that in the micro-concave surface. The possible reasons were that when the micro V-groove were ran at a low load, the existence of the grooves made the cylinder liner surface store amount of lubrication oil, which was much more than that in the micro-concave surface. The lubrication oil slowed down the wear of CLPR friction pair. And thus the friction coefficient was relatively low at the load of 200  N. When the applied load increased to 400  N, the friction coefficient in the micro V-groove surface was larger than that in the micro-concave surface. This is because that when the load increased, the wear surfaces of friction pairs were forced into close contact. Due {{to the fact that the}} length of the groove was larger than the thickness of piston ring and the diameter of micro-concave was smaller than the thickness of piston <b>ring,</b> the <b>lubrication</b> oil in the micro V-groove was more readily to be squeezed out than the micro-concave. Hence, the friction coefficient of micro V-groove was larger than that of micro-concave at the load of 400  N. When the applied load grew to 600  N, the lubrication environment of CLPT became harshest. A large number and different kinds of wear particles generated. For the micro V-groove cylinder liner, some wear particles were whirled away by the lubrication oil. In addition, the micro V-groove could retain more and larger size of wear particles than the micro-concave. Consequently, the friction coefficient of micro V-groove was lower than that of micro-concave at the load of 600  N.|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are widely utilized in modem automobiles. Around 10 % {{of the total}} fuel energy is dissipated to heat due to mechanical friction, among which 20 % {{is caused by the}} contact between the cylinder liner and the piston rings. The wear of cylinder liner not only leads to surface damage, but also results in the change of liner lubrication conditions. Therefore, a large number of tests are performed by researchers to investigate the liner wear process and its impact on engine lubrication. This work {{is the first step toward}} developing a wear model to predict the evolution of liner roughness and <b>ring</b> pack <b>lubrication</b> during break-in period. A physics-based liner wear model is built in this work, with focus on two mechanisms: surface plastic flattening and fatigue wear. Both mechanisms are simulated through a set of governing equations and are coupled together to complete the algorithm of the liner wear model. Simulations of break-in wear are performed to different liner surfaces finishes, with different external normal pressures. Simulation results indicate that the liner wear rate depends on the size and shape of liner surface asperities, which may provide guidance for surface manufacturing. The results also show consistence with the Archard's wear law, describing the proportional correlation between normal pressure and steady state wear rate. This wear model is then used to study the influence of liner wear on engine lubrication. Through the friction for entire engine cycles, simulated results are compared with experimental friction measurements. The comparison shows that the calculated friction evolution during break-in has the same trend and comparable magnitude as the measurements, indicating the efficiency of the wear model.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the piston ring-pack is directly associated with the friction, oil consumption, wear, and blow-by in internal combustion engines. Because of non-axisymmetric characteristics of the power cylinder system, the {{performance of}} a ring varies along its circumference. Investigating these variations is of great interest for developing advanced ring-packs, but is out of the capabilities of the existing two-dimensional models. In this work, three separate but closely related numerical models were developed to study the {{performance of the}} piston ring-pack. The model for static analysis was developed to facilitate the design of piston rings. In this model, a finite beam element model is adopted with incorporation of a physics-based sub-model describing the interaction between the ring and the bore as well as the ring and the groove. A step-by-step approach is adopted to calculate the ring/bore and ring/groove conformability if the free shape of the ring is given. A method {{that can be used to}} determine the free shape as to achieve a specific tension distribution is also developed. Model results revealed the complex ring/bore and ring/groove interaction. A three-dimensional model for ring dynamics and blow-by gas flow was developed to address non-axisymmetric characteristics of the power cylinder system. In this model, the rings are discretized into straight beam elements. 3 -D finite element analysis is employed to address the structural response of each ring to external loads. Physics-based sub-models are developed to simulate each ring's interactions with the piston groove and the liner. The gas flows driven by the pressure difference along both the axial and circumferential directions are modeled as well. (cont.) This model predicts the inter-ring gas pressure and 3 -D displacements of the three rings at various circumferential locations. Model results show significant variations of the dynamic behavior along ring circumference. In the ring-pack lubrication model, an improved flow continuity algorithm is implemented in the ring/liner hydrodynamic lubrication, and proves to be very practicable. By coupling the ring/liner lubrication with the in-plane structural response of the <b>ring,</b> the <b>lubrication</b> along the entire ring circumference can be calculated. Model results show significant variations of lubrication along the circumference due to the non-axisymmetric characteristics of the power cylinder system. Bore distortion was found to have profound effects on oil transport along the liner. Particularly, it stimulates the occurrence of oil up-scraping by the top ring during compression stroke. Because the oil evaporation on the liner affects the liner oil film thickness, a sub-model for liner evaporation with consideration of multi-species oil is incorporated with the lubrication model. With consideration of oil transport along the liner, the prediction of evaporation is more precise. The combination of these models is a complete package for piston ring-pack analysis. It is computationally robust and efficient, and thus has appreciable practical value. by Liang Liu. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2005.

Applying a plasma polymeric coating on elastomers the friction can be reduced. Four elastomer types (acrylic rubber, fluoric rubber and two different nitrile butadiene rubbers) were investigated each with and without plasma polymeric coating. The experiments were performed on coated and uncoated flat elastomer plates and the friction reduction was measured using a Uni-Kurzfassungversal Material Tester (UMT 3) system with oscillating Pin-on-plate contact geometry. The face of a cylindric wheel bearing with 6 mm in diameter was used as counterpart. The contact geometry was chosen due to the differentiability of lubricants in oscillating tests {{as well as the}} 104 times bigger contact area compared with the sealing lip of a radial shaft sealing. The tribological tests were done under ambient conditions with a velocity of 200 mm/s and a stroke length of 11 mm. The used normal force of 10. 6 N represents an initial contact pressure of 0. 5 MPa. The tests were performed using different small amounts of fully formulated gear oil down to avoiding lubricants to demonstrate the effect of lubrication deficiency. The coated elastomers showed a reduced friction compared to the uncoated ones. Ifa coating was applied to the elastomers the measurements without any lubrication showed the lowest friction. Friction coefficients down to 0. 17 were achieved. Compared to 0. 48 for the dry measurement with uncoated substrate, a friction reduction of 65 % was reached. This demonstrates emergency running properties for plasmapolymeric coated components. For the lubricated measurements differences between the different lubrications appeared. The plasmapolymeric coating and therewith the friction reduction is available at low costs using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique (PECVD). With PECVD it is easily possible to apply coatings on complex 3 D-geometrieslike sealing rings. The process was already scaled up for radial shaft sealings to enable series production...|$|R
40|$|Piston ring {{friction}} losses account for approximately 20 % {{of the total}} mechanical losses in modern internal combustion engines. A reduction in piston ring friction would therefore result in higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions. The goal {{of this study was}} to develop low-friction piston ring designs to improve engine efficiency, without adversely affecting oil consumption, blowby, wear, or cost. These are desirable objectives for today's engine manufacturers as they strive to improve engine performance while trying to meet increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Using an existing piston <b>ring</b> friction and <b>lubrication</b> model, the main contributors to friction in modern internal combustion engines were identified as the top ring around top dead center of the compression/expansion strokes and the oil control ring throughout the engine cycle. Model predictions indicated that the top ring friction could be reduced by implementing a skewed barrel profile design or an upward piston groove tilt design, and oil control ring friction could be reduced by decreasing ring tension. An increase in groove wear was predicted to occur with the upward piston groove tilt design, which could be eliminated by the introduction of a positive static twist on the top ring. An increase in oil consumption was predicted to occur with the low-tension oil control ring design, which could be mitigated either by the introduction of a negative static twist on the second ring, or by the implementation of the skewed barrel top ring design. Model predictions indicated that by combining the low-friction designs, a reduction in piston ring pack friction of 30 - 35 % could be achieved, without an increase in blowby, wear, or oil consumption. (cont.) Experimental results conducted on a full-scale natural gas power generation engine supported the model predictions for the low-tension oil control ring design. The predicted reduction in piston ring friction would translate to a 0. 5 - 1 % increase in brake thermal efficiency, which would result in a significant improvement in fuel economy and a substantial reduction in emissions over the life of the engine. by Grant Smedley.

40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the Department of Energy, the NASA Lewis Research Center manages a Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine Technology (HDET) research program. The overall program objectives are {{to reduce fuel consumption}} through increased engine efficiency, reduce engine exhaust emissions, and provide options for the use of alternative fuels. The program is administered with a balance of research contracts, university research grants, and focused in-house research. The Cummins Engine Company participates in the HDET program under a cost-sharing research contract. Cummins is researching and developing in-cylinder component technologies for heavy-duty diesel engines. An objective of the Cummins research is to develop technologies for a low-emissions, 55 -percent thermal efficiency (LE- 55) engine. The best current-production engines in this class achieve about 46 -percent thermal efficiency. Federal emissions regulations are driving this technology. Regulations for heavy duty diesel engines were tightened in 1994, more demanding emissions regulations are scheduled for 1998, and another step is planned for 2002. The LE- 55 engine emissions goal is set at half of the 1998 regulation level and is consistent with plans for 2002 emissions regulations. LE- 55 engine design requirements to meet the efficiency target dictate a need to operate at higher peak cylinder pressures. A key technology being developed and evaluated under the Cummins Engine Company LE- 55 engine concept is the spherical joint piston and connecting rod. Unlike conventional piston and connecting rod arrangements which are joined by a pin forming a hinged joint, the spherical joint piston and connecting rod use a ball-and-socket joint. The ball-and-socket arrangement enables the piston to have an axisymmetric design allowing rotation within the cylinder. The potential benefits of piston symmetry and rotation are reduced scuffing, improved piston <b>ring</b> sealing, improved <b>lubrication,</b> mechanical and thermal load symmetry, reduced bearing stresses, reduced running clearances, and reduced oil consumption. The spherical joint piston is a monolithic, squeeze-cast, fiber-reinforced aluminum piston. The connecting rod has a ball end that seats on a spherical saddle within the piston and is retained by a pair of aluminum bronze holder rings. The holder rings are secured by a threaded ring that mates with the piston. As part of the ongoing research and development activity, the Cummins Engine Company successfully completed a 100 -hr test of the spherical joint piston and connecting rod at LE- 55 peak steady-state engine conditions. In addition, a 100 -hr transient cycle test that varied engine conditions between LE- 55 no-load and LE- 55 full-load was successfully completed...|$|R
