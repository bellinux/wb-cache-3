The central bank 2 ̆ 019 s plan under discretionary optimization is entirely forward-looking and exhibits multiple equilibrium solutions if transactions frictions are not negligibly small.

These equilibria are associated with lower welfare losses than a forward-looking solution implemented by interest <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The welfare gain from a history dependent implementation is found to rise with the strength of transactions frictions and the degree of price flexibility.

2500|$|From {{this the}} basic {{ventricular}} [...] "on demand" [...] pacing mode is VVI or with automatic <b>rate</b> <b>adjustment</b> for exercise VVIR – this mode is suitable when no synchronization with the atrial beat is required, as in atrial fibrillation. The equivalent atrial pacing mode is AAI or AAIR {{which is the}} mode of choice when atrioventricular conduction is intact but the natural pacemaker the sinoatrial node is unreliable – sinus node disease (SND) or sick sinus syndrome. Where the problem is atrioventricular block (AVB) the pacemaker is required to detect (sense) the atrial beat and after a normal delay (0.1–0.2 seconds) trigger a ventricular beat, unless it has already happened – this is VDD mode and can be achieved with a single pacing lead with electrodes in the right atrium (to sense) and ventricle (to sense and pace). These modes AAIR and VDD are unusual in the US but widely used in Latin America and Europe. The DDDR mode is most commonly used as it covers all the options though the pacemakers require separate atrial and ventricular leads and are more complex, requiring careful programming of their functions for optimal results.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of banks {{with regard to}} the pricing of commercial short term loans over the period from 1975 until 1997. Due to the inclusion of interest rate quotes by banks located in east Germany in 1991 we distinguished between the subperiods from 1975 – 1989 and 1991 – 1997. In the context of the price setting for credit lines we focus on the commonly held belief of asymmetric interest <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments.</b> In order to raise the markup on credit lines banks adjust rates on credit lines slower when refinance rates are decreasing. Estimating error correction models a longterm relation between the rate for interbank money and for credit lines is established. In order to test for asymmetric interest <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments</b> non-symmetric error correction models as well as error correction models with asymmetric short-term dynamics are estimated. The hypothesis of asymmetric interest <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments</b> is confirmed largely by the estimation results of the latter specification while in the former specification no asymmetry is found.

Falling interest have more intense influence than rising interest. Stock index and interest rate increase simultaneously two days after the interest rate adjustment; But in the long run, interest <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments</b> will help the stability of the SSE index and can effectively prevent the emergence of the stock market bubble. Therefore, in the further development of the stock market, reasonable use of interest rate as a tool can stabilize the stock market.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the exchange rate, {{and more specifically}} with technical criteria for exchange <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments</b> in an international monetary system. Because of the interdependence, however, reference is also made to the domestic adjustment process {{and the availability of}} international liquidity. The author assesses the suitability, chiefly from an operational point of view, of clearly defined indicators to serve as guidelines for exchange <b>rate</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The main contention is that indicators serving such a purpose can technically be constructed, but that there are limitations as to their reliability. For this reason, and for the inevitable infringement of national sovereignty which is involved, the role of discretion and judgement, both at the national and international level, is bound to remain important.   JEL: E 42, F 33 </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} part of a {{prospective}} study of all children entering new planned long-term foster placements in Northern Ireland within a seven month period. This {{part of the study}} charted the competencies and behaviour of the children (N= 19) over time in the home and school environments. This paper aims to specifically examine three questions. First, the extent, if any, of cross-informant agreement in ratings between foster mothers, foster fathers and teachers. Secondly, the stability of <b>rated</b> <b>adjustment</b> over time. Finally, the relationship, if any, between <b>rated</b> <b>adjustment</b> early in placement and placement outcome by the two-year point. Foster mothers and foster fathers completed the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist in relation to the foster children, and teachers completed the companion Teacher's Report Form in relation to both the foster children and their classroom peers. All the adult informants completed the tests at four months and again at one year into placement. Findings from this small intensive study indicate strong agreement between foster mothers and foster fathers but not between foster carers and teachers. Stability of <b>rated</b> <b>adjustment</b> over time was found with all informants. There was some evidence that foster carers' ratings of the children's externalizing behaviour at four months predicted placement outcome at two years. Limitations of the small sample size are considered. Suggestions for further research are made...|$|R
