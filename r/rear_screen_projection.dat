Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projection</b> to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography. A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the extreme close-up shots such as Kane's lips when he says [...] "Rosebud" [...] and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.|$|E
50|$|The first screwball comedy {{filmed in}} color, Nothing Sacred also {{represents}} the first {{use in a}} color film of process effects, montage and <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projection.</b> Backgrounds for the rear projection were filmed {{on the streets of}} New York. Paramount Pictures and other studios refined this technique in their subsequent color features.|$|E
5000|$|Season eight was {{the first}} year that used a rear screen with an LCD {{projector}} projecting the puddle for the Stargate wormhole effect. Before that time, this was too expensive and not bright enough. The outside of the Puddle Jumper space ship in [...] "Moebius" [...] also used a <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projection,</b> for which a dune at a real location was filmed and then projected on a screen behind the Puddle Jumper windows. This allowed to move the camera around and not be locked off. The on-set Puddle Jumper is only about 2/3 the size of that of the actual space ship. For dramatic effect, the episode [...] "Zero Hour" [...] had longer scenes filmed in green. [...] "Gemini" [...] had scenes filmed in infrared.|$|E

50|$|Ostoja {{designed}} and built sets for the production of"J.S", by Archibald MacLeish, for the second Adelaide Festival of Arts. He exhibited vitreous enamel works in Melbournes Argus Gallery. Max Harris, in The Bulletin of 20 October 1962, praised Ostojas sets for My Cousin from Fiji in Union Theatre, Adelaide, and his technique of <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projections</b> as later adopted throughout Australia.|$|R
25|$|The {{scene where}} Kong fights the snake-like reptile in his lair was likely the most {{significant}} special effects achievement of the film, due {{to the way in}} which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projections</b> of Driscoll and Ann.|$|R
5000|$|With a new cast {{in place}} Sage and company {{commenced}} shooting on {{the remainder of}} Psychotropica from July 2008 until July 2009. Post production work, including editing, scoring and visual effects were done simultaneously. The film was shot on Mini-DV Cassettes, using a Panasonic DVx 100-a Camera. As the film is an homage to the [...] "classic" [...] works of Dario Argento, Ken Russell, John Waters (and many others) Sage purposefully gave the film a retro look; using vivid [...] "psychedelic" [...] color schemes alternating with black white, [...] "kung-fu" [...] snap zooms, star filters, soft focus and faux <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projection</b> (among many other techniques.) Also in order for Psychotropica to appear {{as if it were}} a [...] "Eurotrash" [...] film from the 1970s Sage added film grain and scratches in post production, to make it seem almost as if the film had been shot on Super-8 or VHS. (These techniques and the nature of the film as a whole have caused critics to compare the film to Pink Floyd's The Wall and the early works of David Lynch) ...|$|E

5000|$|During the 1980s Sherman {{began to}} use colour film, to exhibit very large prints, and to {{concentrate}} more on lighting and facial expression. It was with her series <b>Rear</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Projections,</b> 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine. Close-cropped and close up, they portray young women in various roles, from a sultry seductress to a frightened, vulnerable victim who might have just been raped. She poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine. Due to the artist's proximity to the camera and to the larger-than-life scale she assumes in the prints, her corporeal presence is emphasized. About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: [...] "Some of them I'd hope would seem very psychological. While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying.” ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{film was}} in many ways vastly {{different}} from Rossellini's previous neorealism films, in that it was mostly shot in a studio and used <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projections</b> for the Berlin scenes. Many critics who had previously championed Rossellini condemned the film for being melodramatic and disappointingly unrealistic. Rossellini stated that he wanted to [...] "tell a story of a child, of an innocent creature which a distorted 'utopian' education induced to commit murder in the belief that he was performing a heroic gesture. But a feeble light of morality is not yet extinguished in him; driven by those small gleams of conscious, confused, he commits suicide." [...] Jean Georges Auriol called it hasty and superficial. Andre Bazin called it [...] "not a movie but a sketch, a rough draft of a work Rossellini hasn't given us." [...] However, L'Écran français called it revolutionary, and Charlie Chaplin said it was [...] "the most beautiful Italian film" [...] he had ever seen. Rossellini said that [...] "I don't think it's possible to say more bad things about a film than were said about Germany Year Zero." ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 69) This one-hour documentary {{script for}} television with accompanying materials, examines the corrections {{component of the}} American. criminal justice system. The script {{is designed to help}} fill an "information gap" that exists between the public and corrections. Besides offering a broad picture of the correctional establishment's superstructure, the script provides some insights into the forces that shaped it. A brief historical overview of criminological theory is included along with an inquiry into some of the chronic problem areas of corrections such as the overcrowding of institutions and the large caseloads of probation and parole officers. The script utilizes a variety of film techniques and formats, including graphics, staged live action, historical documentary film footage, still photographs, <b>rear</b> <b>screen</b> <b>projections,</b> filmed interviews and Cinema Verite coverage of psychodrama scenes. Perhaps the major theme which emerges in the script is the need for more public awareness of the correctional establishment. Towards affirming that need, it is pointed out that there is a growing discrepancy between those correctional services the public expects and those it is willing to pay for. This discrepancy is credited with contributing heavily towards making the job of correctional professionals increasingly difficult. The script concludes with a warning that the present crisis in corrections, whether the public knows about it or not, is probably getting worse. It is suggested that unless the crisis is remedied quickly, by some constructive actions, we are all likely to be affected in one way or another...|$|R

25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a <b>rear</b> <b>projection</b> <b>screen,</b> but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|R
