40|$|Producción CientíficaOne of the {{consequences}} of global warming is the early <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> which promotes a sugar content increase. Fermentation of their must leads to wines with an alcoholic degree higher than desired. The scope {{of this study is to}} select a nanofiltration (NF) technique to reduce the alcohol content of wines approximately 2 degrees by controlling the sugar content of grape must before its fermentation. For this purpose the performance of single-stage and two-stage NF processes using a spiral wound membrane unit were compared for white must (Spanish Verdejo) while for red must (Spanish Garnacha) a two-stage procedure was tested. During the singlestage NF intermittent backflush due to the osmotic pressure effect was tested. Results showed that backflushing had an undesirable effect because it increased the flux decay by disturbing the cake stabilization on the membrane. The corresponding wines obtained by adequate mixing of permeated and retained or control musts showed a 1 to 2 degrees alcohol reduction. Sensory evaluation and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that there were no significant differences between the control and the filtered wines.

Differences could be also detected between grapes of the same variety and cultivar harvested in two successive vintages (2012 and 2013). Moreover, the <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> could be monitored from veraison to maturity due to the changes in their phenolic and sugar content. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS- 1) analysis, excellent correlations have been found between the responses provided by the array of biosensors and classical parameters directly related to phenols (total polyphenol index, TPI) and sugar concentration (degree Brix) measured by chemical methods with correlation coefficients close to 1 and errors close to 0. It is also worthy to notice the good correlations found with parameters associated with the pH and acidity that can be explained by taking into account the influence of the pH in the oxidation potentials of the phenols and in the enzymatic activity.

The accumulation of mRNAs encoding wall-modifying enzymes was examined by northern hybridization analysis. Transcripts for #-galactosidase, pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, pectate lyase (EC 4. 2. 2. 2) and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (EC 2. 4. 1. 207) were present during ripening, although polygalacturonase activity had not been detected in berry extracts. Cellulases could not be detected in ripening berries, either at the enzyme or mRNA levels. The increase in #-galactosidase activity and mRNA is consistent with the observed decrease in type-I arabinogalactan content of the walls during ripening, and the detection of polygalacturonase and pectate lyase mRNAs might explain the increased solubility of galacturonan in walls <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> <b>grapes.</b> Thus, the modification of cell wall polysaccharides during softening <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> berries is a complex process involving subtle changes to different components of the wall, and in many cases only small amounts of enzyme activity are required to effect these changes.

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> <b>grapes</b> collected at different stages of maturation between the "veraison" and harvest periods from mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) analysis. Methods and results: Grape berries of Cabernet Franc collected in two locations of the Loire Valley region (Touraine and Anjou), from 28 vine plots and during two vintages (2005 and 2006) were analysed. With principal component analysis (PCA) of spectral data of grape musts, different levels of ripening were described during the three to four weeks before harvest. A separation according to origin (Touraine or Anjou) was also observed and confirmed by the results of partial least squares (PLS) discriminant analysis (88 % of correct classification). Similar evolutions and geographical discriminations were obtained for specific physicochemical parameters. By PLS regression, good predictions of titratable acidity and sugar concentration from berry spectral data were obtained, with root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0. 53 g/L for titratable acidity (expressed in H(2) SO(4)) and 8 g/L for sugar concentration. Moreover, when the data from only one of the regions were considered, the predictions of titratable acidity and sugar concentration were improved and those of real acidity (pH) and maturity index were then satisfactory. The RMSEP values for samples from Touraine and Anjou were reduced, respectively,to 0. 05 and 0. 02. units for pH, 0. 4 and 0. 12 g/L for titratable acidity (expressed in H(2) SO(4)), 6. 6 and 3. 2 g/L for sugar concentration, and 5 and 2. 2 units for maturity index. Conclusion: Spectroscopic and classic chemical analyses of grape berries yielded highly similar results. The evolution of berries from "veraison" to harvest can be characterized according to both time course and region. The samples showed similar PCA results for chemical and IR spectra parameters. PLS regression between chemical and spectral data showed that Fourier transform IR is a good method to predict acidity and sugar concentration throughout ripening. And the results for these parameters, as well as for pH, maturity index and anthocyanin concentration, are improved if the regressions are calculated from sample sets restricted to a single growing region. Consequently, a calibration model is required for each grape geographical origin. Significance and impact of the study: The potential of MIRS was demonstrated for the quantification of the main indicators of maturity during berry ripening. Furthermore, these spectra can be used to estimate grape maturity in particular in reference to a spectral database established over several years of study. The association infrared spectroscopy, chemometric methods and database will help to monitor ripening and to determine the optimum harvest date...|$|E
40|$|During <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> (Vitis labruscana L. cv Concord) berries, {{abundance}} of several proteins increased, coordinately with hexoses, {{to the extent}} that these became the predominant proteins in the ovary. These proteins have been identified by N-terminal amino acid-sequence analysis and/or function to be a thaumatin-like protein (grape osmotin), a lipid-transfer protein, and a basic and an acidic chitinase. The basic chitinase and grape osmotin exhibited activities against the principal grape fungal pathogens Guignardia bidwellii and Botrytis cinerea based on in vitro growth assays. The growth-inhibiting activity of the antifungal proteins was substantial at levels comparable to those that accumulate in the ripening fruit, and these activities were enhanced by as much as 70 % in the presence of 1 m glucose, a physiological hexose concentration in berries. The simultaneous accumulation of the antifungal proteins and sugars during berry ripening was correlated with the characteristic development of pathogen resistance that occurs in fruits during ripening.

40|$|The {{function}} of ASR (ABA [abscisic acid]-, stress-, and ripening-induced) proteins remains unknown. A grape ASR, VvMSA, was isolated {{by means of}} a yeast one-hybrid approach using as a target the proximal promoter <b>of</b> a <b>grape</b> putative monosaccharide transporter (VvHT 1). This promoter contains two sugar boxes, and its activity is induced by sucrose and glucose. VvMSA and VvHT 1 share similar patterns of expression during the <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> <b>grape.</b> Both genes are inducible by sucrose in grape berry cell culture, and sugar induction of VvMSA is enhanced strongly by ABA. These data suggest that VvMSA is involved in a common transduction pathway of sugar and ABA signaling. Gel-shift assays demonstrate a specific binding of VvMSA to the 160 -bp fragment of the VvHT 1 promoter and more precisely to two sugar-responsive elements present in this target. The positive regulation of VvHT 1 promoter activity by VvMSA also is shown in planta by coexpression experiments. The nuclear localization of the yellow fluorescent protein–VvMSA fusion protein and the functionality of the VvMSA nuclear localization signal are demonstrated.

Glucose (56 mm), sucrose (Suc; 58 mm), and the non-transported Suc isomer palatinose doubled the -glucuronidase activity conferred by the VvHT 1 promoter, whereas fructose did not affect it. These effects were the strongest with the 2. 4 -kb promoter, which contains all putative sugar-responsive elements (activating and repressing), {{but they were also}} significant with the 0. 3 -kb promoter, which contains only activating sugar boxes.

The phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway is one of the components involved in these changes. In this study, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of VvMYB 5 a, a cDNA isolated from a grape L. cv Cabernet Sauvignon berry library. VvMYB 5 a encodes a protein belonging to a small subfamily of R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factors. Expression studies in grapevine indicate that the VvMYB 5 a gene is mainly expressed during the early steps of berry development in skin, flesh, and seeds. Overexpression of VvMYB 5 a in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) affects the expression of structural genes controlling the synthesis of phenylpropanoid and impacts on the metabolism of anthocyanins, flavonols, tannins, and lignins. Overexpressing VvMYB 5 a induces a strong accumulation of several phenolic compounds, including keracyanin (cyanidin- 3 -rhamnoglucoside) and quercetin- 3 -rhamnoglucoside, which are the main anthocyanin and flavonol compounds in tobacco.

However, previous work had shown that ethylene is capable of affecting the physiological processes during maturation <b>of</b> <b>grape</b> berries.

The results showed that only 73 of 14 562 genes of microarray slides were significantly modulated by a 24 -h ethylene treatment (4 ml l 21), performed 8 weeks after flowering. The study then focused on accumulation of several mRNAs affected by ethylene {{in relation to the}} berry size. Indeed, we observed that ethylene application at ve´ raison led to a berry diameter increase. This increase is mainly because of sap intake and cell wall modifications, enabling cell elongation. This was related to changes in the expression pattern of many genes, classified in two groups: (1) ‘water exchange’ genes: various aquaporins (AQUA) and (2) ‘cell wall structure’ genes: polygalacturonases, xyloglucan endotransglucosylases (XTH), pectin methyl esterases, cellulose synthases and expansins. The expression patterns were followed either along berry development or in three berry tissues (peel, pulp and seeds). Ethylene stimulates the accumulation of most gene transcripts in 1 h, and in several parts of the berry, this stimulation may last for 24 h in some cases.

The break of buds begins from beginning of April, the blossom period from the end of June according to the observation held in Chokhataruri district, Dablatsikhe-Sakvavisti zone. The <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grape</b> occurs at the end of August (26-28) or the beginning of September, while the full ripening - from 20 - 25 October. Flower-fall takes place from mid November to the first half of December.|$|R
50|$|Kabinett (literal meaning: cabinet), or {{sometimes}} Kabinettwein (literal meaning: a wine {{set aside in}} a cabinet), is a German language wine term for a wine which is made from fully <b>ripened</b> <b>grapes</b> <b>of</b> the main harvest, typically picked in September, and are usually made in a light style. In the German wine classification system, Kabinett is {{the lowest level of}} Prädikatswein, lower in ripeness than Spätlese.|$|R
25|$|In viticulture, {{ripeness}} is {{the completion}} <b>of</b> the <b>ripening</b> process <b>of</b> wine <b>grapes</b> {{on the vine}} which signals the beginning of harvest. What exactly constitutes ripeness will vary depending on what style of wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, dessert wine, etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist personally believe constitutes ripeness. Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components <b>of</b> the <b>grape</b> which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of ripeness may be considered the most crucial decision in winemaking.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ripening</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grape</b> berry {{immediately}} precedes harvesting {{and is the}} key phase which {{determines the}} composition of wine and table grapes. Although {{it is apparent that}} changes in gene expression levels play a role in initiating ripening, it is unknown to what extent gene expression levels differ between cultivars during ripening. We have undertaken a comparison of a selection <b>of</b> wine <b>grape</b> cultivars using a 9200 feature cDNA microarray to gauge the extent to which transcript levels differ between wine grape cultivars in the berry skin during ripening. Clones for microarray slide fabrication were sourced from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA derived from randomly sampled berries. The berries were collected at weekly intervals over four weeks of berry development including véraison. The microarray slides were hybridised with Cy 3 and Cy 5 labelled cDNA derived from the skin <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> berries <b>of</b> the cultivars Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Shiraz, Chardonnay, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon. Only a small proportion of the genes within the berry skin showed a three-fold or greater difference in expression level after <b>ripening</b> commenced. Most <b>of</b> the differences appear to arise from environmental signals rather than genome differences...|$|R
25|$|Carignan is a late budding {{and late}} {{ripening}} variety {{that is often}} one <b>of</b> the last <b>grapes</b> to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting during the growing season. The late <b>ripening</b> nature <b>of</b> the <b>grape</b> means that it rarely achieves full ripeness unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California.|$|R
