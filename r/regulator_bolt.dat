Simple spot welds were used throughout the fabrication and full use of early powder-metal parts that were used for the rear sight system and magazine latch.|$|R

He was succeeded as Rail <b>Regulator</b> by Chris <b>Bolt</b> (December 1998 - July 1999) and then by Tom Winsor (July 1999 - July 2004).|$|R
