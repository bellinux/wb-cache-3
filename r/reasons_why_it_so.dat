50|$|Bert Gambini, a radio {{programmer}} in Buffalo, summarizes, “In evaluating CTI, I'm {{going to}} borrow the wisdom of Witold Rybczynski, the architectural historian. He felt {{there was no such}} thing as a timeless building. Certain structures were admired because they are specifically of their time. I think this too is the case with CTI jazz. This music screams of its era and that's the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it's</b> <b>so</b> enjoyable. <b>It's</b> that temporal stamp that I interpret as an asset, not as a liability. Instead of Creed Taylor, think Glenn Miller for a moment. If you want to aurally represent an era like the early 1940s Swing era, is there any better representation than 'In the Mood' or 'String of Pearls'? The same thing applies to Creed Taylor's CTI's brand of Jazz from 1970 to 1980".|$|R

Water makes a pole of {{difficult}} application, {{except in a}} few cases (494.), because of its small conducting power, its miscibility with most of the substances acted upon, and its general relation to them in respect to chemical affinity. It consists of elements, which in their electrical and chemical relations are directly and powerfully opposed, yet combining to produce a body more neutral in its character than any other. So that there are but few substances which do not come into relation, by chemical affinity, with water or one of its elements; and therefore either the water or its elements are transferred and assist in transferring the infinite variety of bodies which, in association with it, can be placed {{in the course of the}} electric current. Hence the <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> rarely happens that the evolved substances rest at the first surface of the water, and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> therefore does not exhibit the ordinary action of a pole.|$|R
