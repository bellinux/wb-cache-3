The copolymers had different block lengths (hence different melt structures) and different block architectures (diblock EB and triblock EBE and BEB). For crystallization from disordered and lamellar melts, half-times for crystallization from rheometry were much shorter, and Avrami exponents were higher, than those from calorimetry. For more-highly structured melts (gyroid, hexagonal and cubic spheres), the half-times were comparable but the Avrami exponents from rheometry were still high compared to DSC. The differences between the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> from calorimetry and rheometry are an artifact of the rheological measurements, at low crystallite volume fractions the rheology is directly proportional {{to the degree of}} crystallinity but at high crystalline volume fractions the proportionality is lost due to the changing connectivity of the crystals.
