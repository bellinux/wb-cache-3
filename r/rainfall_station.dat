The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of difference in the number of rainfall stations on the value of model parameters as well as the accuracy of discharge calculation using the storage function method on Kali Madiun Basin. Basically, the concept used in the storage function method is a water balance, which is analyzed using the mathematical model. The data used in this research are the 10 days hourly rainfall during the flood, and the catchment characteristics constant as the model parameters. Using the trial procedure, the catchments characteristics constant as the input for each of the numbers of <b>rainfall</b> <b>station</b> (2; 3; 4; 5; 6; and 7 stations) will provide the 10 days hourly discharge, then the result will be calibrated to the observed data. Based on the calibration result, the smallest deviation of each <b>rainfall</b> <b>station</b> will be selected in order to identify the model parameter and to provide deviation of the observed data. The investigated deviation is the different value between the calculated and the observed runoff, includes volume deviation as well as the 10 days hourly discharge deviation, which are located at the control node of AWLR Sekayu and AWLR A.

This paper serves 2 objectives: i) to establish a spatial representative <b>rainfall</b> <b>stations</b> from the entire existing network {{in the study area}} (i. e., rainfall-data optimization); and ii) to use of multivariate geostatistical algorithm for incorporating relatively cheaper hydrological data into the spatial prediction of rainfall. The technique was illustrated using annual and monthly rainfall observations measured at 326 <b>rainfall</b> <b>stations</b> covering Yom river basin and its vicinity in Thailand. Optimal rain gauge network was designed based on the station redundancy and the homogeneity of the rainfall distribution.
