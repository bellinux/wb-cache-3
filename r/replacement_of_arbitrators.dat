40|$|This {{discussion}} paper elaborates on five serious flaws with proposals for investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) in proposed Europe-United States and Europe-Canada trade deals {{known by the}} acronyms TTIP and CETA. The issues elaborated in the paper are: the unjustified <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> judges with <b>arbitrators,</b> the lack <b>of</b> institutional safeguards of independence and fairness in ISDS, the privileging of foreign investors over other actors, the risk to European standards of regulation, {{and the fact that}} TTIP (and to a lesser extent CETA) would expand the scope of ISDS massively. The paper is written from a European perspective, considering that most European countries and the European Union have not agreed to ISDS in any past treaty with the U. S. or Canada and thus would assume much-expanded risks and constraints associated with ISDS due to TTIP or CETA...|$|R

50|$|Any {{party to}} the dispute can start the process <b>of</b> {{appointing}} <b>arbitrator</b> and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment <b>of</b> an <b>arbitrator.</b> There are only two grounds upon which a party can challenge the appointment <b>of</b> an <b>arbitrator</b> - reasonable doubt in the impartiality <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> and the lack of proper qualification <b>of</b> the <b>arbitrator</b> as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.|$|R

50|$|Before an {{arbitrator}} {{joins the}} BAC, the organization requires its arbitrators {{to pass a}} professional training course. All arbitral candidates for the BAC Panel <b>of</b> <b>Arbitrators</b> must successfully complete a training course administered by the BAC and the Law School of Tsinghua University, {{as well as an}} examination. The training process for arbitrators differs depending on the type <b>of</b> cases the <b>arbitrator</b> will be handling (i.e. purchase, construction, finance, engineering, leases). The Panel <b>of</b> <b>Arbitrators</b> includes <b>arbitrators</b> <b>of</b> Chinese and non-Chinese nationality, including American, Australian, Belgian, British, Canadian, Colombian, French, German, Italian, Korean, Singaporean, Swedish, and Swiss arbitrators. The BAC also permits parties in international arbitrations— including parties from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan— to select arbitrators from outside the Panel. These selections must include the arbitrator's résumé and contact information.|$|R

However, if a richer model is employed whereby players and owners judge arbitration outcomes relative to some notion of the player's worth, a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> may be judged biased in their decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|The Function <b>of</b> an <b>Arbitrator</b> in International Arbitration (abstract) Jan Ondruš With {{increasing}} {{importance of}} the international arbitration as a resolution mechanism for disputes arising from international commerce, the role <b>of</b> international <b>arbitrators</b> becomes also more important. The trials to find uniform theoretic explanation of all {{issues related to the}} function <b>of</b> <b>arbitrator</b> are however unsuccessful, due to theoretical differences between different legal cultures. The author of this thesis tries to analyze these different approaches and focus more on the function <b>of</b> <b>arbitrator</b> in international arbitration, where on one side there is a clash between the above mentioned different approaches, {{but on the other hand}} the established system facilitates mutual recognition of arbitral awards from a state with different legal regulation of arbitration. The author focuses primarily on the explanation of the term international arbitration as mechanism of dispute resolution. Secondly, the author analyzed requirements, the mostly often imposed on potential arbitrators by state law, by arbitral institutions and by parties and also different mechanisms of establishing the function <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators.</b> After this analysis the author elaborates on the relationship, established between the parties and the arbitrator in the [...] ...|$|R
