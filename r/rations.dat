5|$|American {{emergency}} <b>rations</b> in World War I {{consisted of}} a quarter ounce (7 grams) packet of double-strength instant coffee, packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty-four men. Instant coffee was also used in reserve <b>rations</b> and trench <b>rations.</b> During World War II, the U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time {{on an equal footing}} with the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged in the interwar period, most notably Nescafé, as well as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with <b>rations</b> {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned the crops {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food <b>rations</b> had to be cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was a good one and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military <b>rations</b> were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their <b>rations</b> and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple <b>rations</b> but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in gutters and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rationing</b> {{healthcare}} is {{a difficult}} task, which includes preventing patients from accessing potentially beneficial treatments. Proponents of implicit <b>rationing</b> argue that politicians cannot resist pressure from strong patient groups for treatments and conclude that physicians should <b>ration</b> without informing patients or the public. The authors subdivide this specific programme of implicit <b>rationing,</b> or “hidden rationing”, into local hidden <b>rationing,</b> unsophisticated global hidden <b>rationing</b> and sophisticated global hidden <b>rationing.</b> They evaluate the appropriateness of these methods of <b>rationing</b> {{from the perspectives of}} individual and political autonomy and conclude that local hidden <b>rationing</b> and unsophisticated global hidden <b>rationing</b> clearly violate patients' individual autonomy, that is, their right to participate in medical decision‐making. While sophisticated global hidden <b>rationing</b> avoids this charge, the authors point out that it nonetheless violates the political autonomy of patients, that is, their right to engage in public affairs as citizens. A defence of any of the forms of hidden <b>rationing</b> is therefore considered to be incompatible with a defence of autonomy...|$|R
5|$|That night Halverson, his copilot, and his {{engineer}} pooled their candy <b>rations</b> for {{the next}} day's drop. The accumulated candy was heavy, {{so in order to}} ensure the children were not hurt by the falling candy, Halvorsen made three parachutes out of handkerchiefs and tied them to the <b>rations.</b> In the morning when Halverson and his crew made regular supply drops, they also dropped three boxes of candy attached to handkerchiefs. They made these drops once a week for three weeks. Each week, the group of children waiting at the Tempelhof airport fence grew significantly.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The <b>rations</b> provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional <b>rations</b> and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{specific}} test of Boucher, Carter et al. (2008) framework on risk <b>rationing.</b> The data were collected through a survey of 730 farm households in Shaanxi province conducted in November 2010. We compare factor associated with risk <b>rationed,</b> quantity <b>rationed</b> and price <b>rationed</b> farmers. Seemingly unrelated regressions are performed using risk <b>rationing,</b> quantity <b>rationing</b> and price <b>rationing</b> measure as the dependent variable and measures of demography, wealth, income, year of farming and risk aversion as independent variables. We apply seemingly unrelated regression, cluster analysis and cross tabulation in the study. According to a seemingly unrelated regression, we find existing risk <b>rationing</b> is due to risk-based behavior by borrowers. A cross tabulation results support the proposition by Boucher, Carter et al showing the financial wealthy is risk <b>rationed</b> and relatively land-poor is risk <b>rationed.</b> This paper is believed to be among the first empirical validation of the risk <b>rationing</b> theory.

40|$|<b>Rationing</b> occurs if {{the demand}} for a certain good exceeds its supply. In such {{situations}} a <b>rationing</b> method has to be specified {{in order to determine}} the allocation of the scarce good to the agents. Moulin (1999) introduced the notion of probabilistic <b>rationing</b> methods for the discrete framework. In this paper we establish a link between classical and probabilistic <b>rationing</b> methods. In particular, we assign to any given classical <b>rationing</b> method a probabilistic <b>rationing</b> method with minimal variance among those probabilistic <b>rationing</b> methods, which result in the same expected distributions as the given classical <b>rationing</b> method...|$|R

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters. As commandos {{were expected to be}} fighting troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian <b>rations,</b> {{while the rest of the}} armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of <b>rations.</b>|$|E
5|$|The entire {{force of}} about 1000 men set out northward towards Prophetstown. The force {{consisted}} of about 250 army regulars from the 4th US Infantry Regiment, 100 Kentucky volunteers, and near 600 Indiana militia, including two companies of the Indiana Rangers. The army reached {{the site of}} modern Terre Haute, Indiana, on October 3, where they camped and built Fort Harrison while waiting for supplies to be delivered. A scouting party of Yellow Jackets was ambushed by Native Americans on October 10, resulting in several casualties. The Americans stopped foraging, and supplies quickly began to run low. By October 19, officers cut the <b>rations,</b> and the men survived on low <b>rations</b> until October 28, when fresh supplies arrived via the Wabash River from Vincennes. With the army resupplied, Harrison resumed his advance to Prophetstown on October 29.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, the <b>rationing</b> system {{remained}} {{in place for}} many {{years after the end}} of the War. In some respects it was more strict after the war than during it—two major foodstuffs that were never <b>rationed</b> during the war, bread and potatoes, went on <b>ration</b> after it (bread from 1946 to 1948, and potatoes for a time from 1947). Tea was still on <b>ration</b> until 1952. In 1953 <b>rationing</b> of sugar and eggs ended, and in 1954, all <b>rationing</b> finally ended when cheese and meats came off <b>ration.</b> Sugar was again <b>rationed</b> in 1974 after Caribbean producers began selling to the more lucrative United States market.|$|R

David Leonhardt also wrote in the New York Times in June 2009 that <b>rationing</b> is a part of economic reality: [...] "The choice isn’t between <b>rationing</b> and not <b>rationing.</b> It’s between <b>rationing</b> well and <b>rationing</b> badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to healthcare than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it’s hard to argue that we are now <b>rationing</b> very rationally." ...|$|R

5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables.

However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing <b>rations</b> to reduce costs.|$|E
50|$|Wartime <b>rationing</b> continued, and was {{extended}} to bread. In the war the government banned ice cream and <b>rationed</b> sweets, such as chocolates and confections; sweets were <b>rationed</b> until 1954. Most people grumbled, but for the poorest, <b>rationing</b> was beneficial, because their <b>rationed</b> diet was of greater nutritional value than their pre-war diet.
