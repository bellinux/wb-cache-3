5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport {{a baby to}} Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration stated {{that they were not}} opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> was introduced.|$|E

5000|$|Amtrak {{plans to}} operate {{one or two}} {{additional}} <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> between Portland and Boston (six or seven <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> daily). In 2009, the rail authority applied for federal stimulus money to increase train speeds—enough to cut 10 to 12 minutes off travel time—and {{increase the number of}} daily <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> from five to seven.

5|$|Seven trails with round-trip {{times of}} {{half an hour}} (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon. Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours <b>round</b> <b>trip)</b> and Kolob Arch (8 hours <b>round</b> <b>trip),</b> are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City. Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer. However, hiking beyond Big Springs {{requires}} a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking. A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek. The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield <b>round</b> <b>trip,</b> {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 the New Haven planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route to compete with the NYC, but this never materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E
