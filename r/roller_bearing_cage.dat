Lack of {{kinematics}} {{models and}} imperfection {{of the known}} dynamics models of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> of railway rolling stock axle-boxes do not allow designing the optimal structure of <b>bearing</b> <b>cages,</b> providing the required service life and reliability of bearing units of wheel sets for cars and locomotives. The studies of kinematics and dynamics of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> of axle boxes for cars and locomotives and modeling of their parts interaction to create the analytical method of <b>bearing</b> <b>cages</b> calculation are necessary. Methodology. This purpose has been achieved due to the modeling of kinematics of the ideal (without gaps) and real (taking account the gaps, manufacturing and installation errors) bearings, substantiation of the transfer mechanism of motion from the <b>rollers</b> to <b>bearing</b> <b>cage,</b> modeling the dynamics of rolling, research of interaction forces of the <b>rollers</b> with <b>bearing</b> <b>cage.</b> Findings. It is established that the kinematics of ideal bearing {{is determined by the}} contact deformations of the rollers and rings, when the kinematics of real bearing depends mainly on the side gaps in the windows of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage.</b> On the basis of studies of the real bearing kinematics the dynamics models of the <b>rollers</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> interaction were constructed. The conducted studies of kinematics and dynamics of rolling bearings have changed our view of them as of the planetary mechanism, explained the reason of <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> loading, and confirmed the possibility of destruction during operation. Originality. It was first proposed a mechanism for motion transfer from the <b>rollers</b> to the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> consisting in that the side gap in the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> window is reduced gradually multiple of the number of rollers of radial loading area according to the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> motion. The models of <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> dynamics, which allow calculating the interaction forces of parts for all modes of operation, were improved. Practical value. Use of the offered models of kinematics and dynamics of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> will develop analytical calculation method of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> for the choice of its optimal design according to criterion of maximum service life and reliability of the bearing unit of wheel sets of the railway rolling stock...|$|R

30|$|Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and {{polyimide}} (PI) are {{two kinds}} of engineering polymer materials widely used as <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cages</b> and rings under extreme environment because of their noise reduction and corrosion resistance properties. The Si 3 N 4 ceramic is the most common ball bearing material. Many current engineering applications of ball bearings require aqueous lubrication. Therefore, this study presents the aqueous lubrication of tribopairs formed by PEEK and PI material sliding against Si 3 N 4 ceramic. Experimental results show that two tribopairs exhibited the similar tribological properties under the dry condition. Water as a lubricant for the PI–Si 3 N 4 tribopair pairs effectively reduces both friction coefficients by 35.5 % and wear rates by 32 %. The water absorption of PI induces better tribological properties by changing the tribopair surface properties. In addition, the dimples appearing on the PI tribopair surface under water generate additional hydrodynamic lubrication and further improve the friction properties of surface. The PEEK–Si 3 N 4 tribopair shows similar friction coefficients under two kinds of environments. The wear rates under water are approximately more than two times of that under dry sliding. However, water inhibits the appearance of the crush phenomenon and enhances the carrying capacity of the tribopair. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra demonstrate no chemical corrosion. The 3 D profiler and SEM morphologies illustrate that the transfer film would be formed from the surface of PEEK under water but hindered under dry friction. Overall, the PI–Si 3 N 4 tribopair exhibits better properties than PEEK under water and is promising for future applications in the bearing industry.|$|R

However, in a contra-rotating bearing the inner race rotates {{in one direction and}} the outer race rotates in the opposite direction. The advantages of the contra-rotating bearing over the conventional one are increased efficiency and reduced torque loads. The disadvantages are possibly increased weight and complication. A contra-rotating bearing test apparatus was designed and manufactured for a 115 mm bore <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> The <b>cage</b> (separator), located between the raceways, maintains uniform separation between the rollers. Slip occurs when the rollers slide in addition to rolling between the raceways. This causes wear and sometimes premature failure of the bearing. Radial preloading simulates loading that the bearing might be subjected to while supporting a shaft. The purpose of this apparatus was to determine the effect that radial preloading has on cage slip.

40|$|Unstable {{movement}} in <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> like <b>cage</b> or <b>roller</b> slip {{can lead to}} damages or eventually even to an early break of the bearing. To prevent slip, inadequate operating states should be avoided. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the dynamic behavior of the bearing. Unfortunately, there is only a limited range of measurement methods for the dynamic of bearing components. Two possible approaches are using solely a high-speed camera or the combination of an optomechanical image derotator and a high-speed camera. This work focuses on a proposal which is suitable for both. Initially, the influence of the rotational velocity in the images is eliminated. In the next step the measurement data is reduced to a region of interest which displays a particular rolling-element. A rolling element is equipped with a linear marker which, in the next stage, is segmented by a thresholding method to multiple regions. The region representing the marker is extracted from the background and the position is calculated by a Principle Component Analysis. Depending on the shift of the angular position and the lag time between two images, the rotational velocity of the rolling element is calculated. Thus, it is possible to determine whether the rolling element is operating under ideal conditions. In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} this approach enables a simple and flexible non-invasive method to depict the occurrence of roller slip in <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> © 2017 SPIE...|$|R
50|$|Most rolling-element <b>bearings</b> feature <b>cages.</b> The cages reduce friction, wear, and bind by {{preventing}} the elements from rubbing against each other. <b>Caged</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> were invented by John Harrison in the mid-18th century {{as part of}} his work on chronometers.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} components of a tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> is the <b>cage.</b> The main function of the cage during operation is to maintain roller spacing. Although being one of the more complicated parts of a tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> historically, very little specific engineering has been done to provide a design basis for the cage. This dissertation analyzed specifically the <b>cages</b> from tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> as used in the railway industry. ^ Metallurgical testing of cages with cracks has revealed that the failure mode of the cages was fatigue fracture which initiated at the small-end cage pocket. Factors which contributed to the fatigue failure were determined. Analysis included vibration and finite element analysis (FEA). Cages analyzed included 6 1 / 2 x 12 and 7 x 12 steel cages and 6 1 / 2 x 12 plastic cages. ^ The natural frequencies of the cage were determined and then compared to the exciting frequencies of the bearings. Vibrations, internal and external to the bearing, were considered. The magnitude and frequencies of these excitation vibrations were input into the finite element modeling software, Algor, to find response of the cage. It was found that the stresses generated in the small end cage pocket of larger 7 x 12 steel cages were as much as twice that of the 61 / 2 x 12 steel cages. The stress generated at the pocket of the 6 1 / 2 x 12 plastic cage was smaller than the 6 1 / 2 x 12 steel cage. ...|$|R

Moorthy and Raja [33] calculated the thermogenesis value of the local heat sources, they also took into consideration the change in the diametral clearance after the assembly and during operation that was attributed to the thermal expansion of the bearing parts, which influenced the gyroscopic and spinning moments contributing to the heat generation.

50|$|Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> use conical <b>rollers</b> {{that run}} on conical races. Most <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> only take radial or axial loads, but tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> support both radial and axial loads, and {{generally}} can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the <b>roller</b> in the <b>bearing</b> adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> that which results from the motion of the <b>rollers</b> in the <b>bearing</b> under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the cylindrical <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are infinitely long.

40|$|A fault {{diagnosis}} approach for <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> based on improved intrinsic timescale decomposition de-noising and kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate Yu Yang 1, 2, Haiyang Pan 1, 2, Li Ma 1, 2 and Junsheng Cheng 1, 2 The measured vibration signal of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> has noise signals, which will largely influence {{the accuracy of}} <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> {{fault diagnosis}}. This paper puts forward a vibration signal de-noising method based upon improved intrinsic timescale decomposition (ITD); fuzzy entropy is then extracted as the fault feature of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing.</b> Essentially the fault diagnosis of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{is a process of}} pattern recognition. Targeting the limitation of existing pattern recog-nition methods, a new pattern recognition method – variable predictive model-based class discriminate (VPMCD) – is introduced into <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault identification. In the original VPMCD classifier, however, only the regression model could be used to predict, which will reduce the prediction’s accuracy when the relation between features is complicated. Aimed at this defect, a kriging-variable predictive model-based class discriminate (KVPMCD) pattern recognition method is presented in this paper. The kriging model is composed of a regression model and a correlation model, of which the correlation model is a local deviation that is created {{on the basis of a}} global model, to make up for the shortcomings of the simple regression model in the original VPMCD. Therefore, a fault diagnosis approach for <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> based on improved ITD de-nosing and KVPMCD is proposed in this paper.

To improve the ability of <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis under multi-rotating situation, this paper proposes a novel <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault characteristic: the Amplitude Modulation (AM) based correntropy extracted from the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which are decomposed by Fast Ensemble Empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD) and employ Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) to implement intelligent fault identification. Firstly, the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> vibration acceleration signal is decomposed by FEEMD to extract IMFs. Secondly, IMF correntropy matrix (IMFCM) as the fault feature matrix is calculated from the AM-correntropy model of the primary vibration signal and IMFs. Furthermore, depending on LSSVM, the fault identification results of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> are obtained. Through the bearing identification experiments in stationary rotating conditions, it was verified that IMFCM generates more stable and higher diagnosis accuracy than conventional fault features such as energy moment, fuzzy entropy, and spectral kurtosis. Additionally, it proves that IMFCM has more diagnosis robustness than conventional fault features under cross-mixed <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> operating conditions. The diagnosis accuracy was more than 84 % for the cross-mixed operating condition, which is much higher than the traditional features. In conclusion, it was proven that FEEMD-IMFCM-LSSVM is a reliable technology for <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis under the constant or multi-positioned operating conditions, and as such, it possesses potential prospects for a broad application of uses...|$|R
