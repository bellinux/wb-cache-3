Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his honeypot server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|However, a newer study {{compared}} incidence {{rates of}} skull lesions in Triceratops and Centrosaurus {{and showed that}} these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as Centrosaurus was {{more closely related to}} Styracosaurus and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for Styracosaurus.

The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E

5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was {{twice as high as}} that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These <b>researchers</b> <b>also</b> noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The <b>researchers</b> <b>also</b> supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These <b>researchers</b> <b>also</b> noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the <b>researchers</b> <b>also</b> speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E

5|$|From these models, <b>researchers</b> <b>also</b> {{predict that}} bee populations will start declining most {{significantly}} in the southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. <b>Researchers</b> <b>also</b> hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick death for the prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The <b>researchers</b> <b>also</b> hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E

Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
