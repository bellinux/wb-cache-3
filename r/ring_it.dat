5|$|Plumes from Enceladus, {{which are}} similar in {{composition}} to comets, {{have been shown to}} be the source of the material in Saturn's E ring. The E ring is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe <b>ring).</b> <b>It</b> is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.|$|E
5|$|The {{optical depth}} of the Thebe gossamer ring is about 3, which is three times lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the dust is the same—about 107–109kg. However the {{particle}} size distribution of the dust is somewhat shallower than in the Amalthea <b>ring.</b> <b>It</b> follows a power law with q< 2. In the Thebe extension the parameter q may be even smaller.|$|E
5|$|From 1878, Fauré and {{his friend}} and ex-pupil André Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walküre at Cologne Opera; the {{complete}} Ring cycle in Munich and London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal. They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth, written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from The <b>Ring.</b> <b>It</b> consists of five short sections in which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms. The manuscript (in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris) is in Messager's hand.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of Stropharia caerulea {{feature a}} greenish-blue cap sparsely covered in white flecks of veil at the margin, and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. Gills on the cap {{underside}} have an adnate or sinuate {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient <b>ring.</b> <b>It</b> is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on the cap, and darker gills with white edges.|$|E
5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ <b>ring,</b> <b>it</b> {{consists of two}} components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 1.9–2.7km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42km, which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 0.16–0.25. The broad component is about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 2×10−2. It was resolved in Voyager 2 images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated {{the presence of a}} considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad component. The broad component is much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant azimuthal variations in the normal optical depth and width. The narrow component even vanishes in some places.|$|E
5|$|During the Ashes tour, Johnston roomed with Doug Ring {{who was a}} {{teammate}} in the Richmond and Victorian cricket teams. As Ring was a leg-spin bowler, he and Johnston were in direct competition for {{a place in the}} eleven. Australia had traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. When Johnston was omitted in favour of <b>Ring,</b> <b>it</b> appeared he would not be in Bradman's Test plans. Bradman changed his mind {{on the morning of the}} First Test in Trent Bridge when rain was forecast. Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket. He showed his credentials by bowling a total of 84 overs to help Australia to grind out a victory. England batted first and with strike bowler Ray Lindwall breaking down on the first day, Johnston removed Bill Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior in one over to leave England at 4/46. He returned later in the innings to take 5/36 from 25 overs as England were bowled out for 165. After scoring an unbeaten 17 in a last-wicket partnership of 33, Johnston bowled 59 overs in the second innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 1–0 lead.|$|E
