Weapon-wound {{matching}} in Forensic anthropology attempts to estimate weapon class {{from the wound}} characteristics but few studies have investigated quantitative methods for performing this analysis on the microscopic scale. In this study five cadaveric pig torsos, prepared to mimic human anatomy, were stabbed in the upright position with 12 different knives. Knife dynamics were recorded using a Casio high-speed camera (420 fps). Samples were chemically defleshed exposing the regions on the ribs where the knives have made contact, thus marking the bone, so micro-CT can be performed.

40|$|Differentiation of the axial {{skeleton}} into distinct regions, {{once thought to}} be characteristic of the Tetrapoda, also occurs in the actinopterygian Danio rerio. In these taxa, the boundary between the cervical-thoracic regions correlates with Hoxc 6 expression and morphological features such as position of the pectoral fin and associated nerves, and the absence of ribs. In the lungfish Neoceratodus, a member of the extant sister taxon to the Tetrapoda, the first vertebral element to chondrify is situated well posterior to the skull, developing from somites 6 and 7 (6 / 7) and associated with an enlarged cranial rib and nerves innervating the pectoral fin. Two vertebral elements develop later and more anteriorly, associated with somites 4 / 5 and 5 / 6. These three elements become incorporated into the occipital region of the skull during Neoceratodus ontogeny, until the cranial rib itself articulates {{to the rear of the}} skull. These features of early development indicate a regionalization of the Neoceratodus vertebral column: the cranial <b>rib</b> <b>marks</b> the boundary between the cervical and thoracic regions, the two more anterior vertebrae lacking ribs represent the cervical region, while somites 1 - 4 (cranial half), lacking any vertebral development, represent the occipital region. However, the cervical region of the vertebral column is effectively lost during ontogeny of Neoceratodus. A recognizable cervical region in the tetrapod vertebral column, as in zebrafish, suggests that cervical vertebrae are not incorporated into the skull but maintained as distinct elements of the column, representing an important shift in relative developmental timing and the influence of heterochrony in this region during the fish-tetrapod transition. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|True {{persistence}} of rock discontinuities (areas with insignificant tensile strength) {{is an important}} factor controlling the engineering behaviour of fractured rock masses, but is extremely difficult to quantify using current geological survey methodologies, even where there is good rock exposure. Trace length as measured in the field or using remote measurement devices is actually only broadly indicative of persistence for rock engineering practice and numerical modelling. Visible traces of discontinuities are treated as if they were open fractures within rock mass classifications, despite many such traces being non-persistent and actually retaining considerable strength. The common assumption of 100 % persistence, based on trace length, is generally extremely conservative in terms of strength and stiffness, but not always so and may lead to a wrong prediction of failure mechanism or of excavatability. Assuming full persistence would give hopelessly incorrect predictions of hydraulic conductivity. A new technique termed forensic excavation of rock masses is introduced, as a procedure for directly investigating discontinuity persistence. This technique involves non-explosive excavation of rock masses by injecting an expansive chemical splitter along incipient discontinuities. On expansion, the splitter causes the incipient traces to open as true joints. Experiments are described in which near-planar rock discontinuities, through siltstone and sandstone, were opened up by injecting the splitter into holes drilled along the lines of visible traces of the discontinuities in the laboratory and in the field. Once exposed the surfaces were examined to investigate the pre-existing persistence characteristics of the incipient discontinuities. One conclusion from this study is that visible trace length of a discontinuity can be a poor indicator of true persistence (defined for a fracture area with negligible tensile strength). An observation from this series of experiments was that freshly failed surfaces through pre-existing rock bridges were relatively rough compared to sections of pre-existing weaker areas of geologically developed (though still incipient) discontinuities. Fractographic features such as hackle and <b>rib</b> <b>marks</b> were typical of the freshly broken rock bridges, whereas opened-up areas of incipient discontinuity were smoother. Schmidt hammer rebound values were generally higher for the rock bridge areas, probably reflecting their lower degree of chemical and physical weathering...|$|R
40|$|Glass {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} evidence submitted to forensic laboratories for analysis. It is frequently encountered at crime scenes, particularly those involving motor vehicle accidents or burglaries. This study emphasized on the examination of the fracture patterns performed on different types of glass panes after broken by different type of impact objects, analysis of fracture features to determine direction of force and identifying of refractive index of glass as further analysis. Three types of glass panes (float, tempered and laminated) and four levels of breaking devices (hammer, bat, golf ball and stone either by throwing or using catapult) were used in the experiment. The results show that almost the whole float glass panes were shatters into sharp glass pieces after broken by all type of breaking devices. Then, tempered glass pane was broken with the whole glass panes shatters into small pieces of blunt granules when only hammer exerted on the glass, meanwhile, for other breaking devices were caused a scratch marks on glass surface. For laminated glass when broken by bat, throwing a stone and using catapult, almost the whole of glass panes were remains intact on its interlayer film and got some splinters from point of impact were flying out. Meanwhile, fracture patterns on laminated glass pane when broken by hammer produced a cone or crater after striking. However, impact objects used to break those types of glass panes are not really reliable to be distinguished. This is because the fracture patterns on glass panes obviously differ by its types of glass only. When a pane of glass is broken by an impact, majority of the broken fragments will fall in the direction of the force, which is on the side of the glass panes opposite direction of the application of force. A determination of the direction of force in breaking a glass pane can be determined by the direction of the <b>rib</b> <b>marks.</b> As the impact occurs, concentric fractures form around the impact and interconnect with radial cracks to form triangular pieces. The edge of each triangular piece has visible stress lines that describe the direction of the blow.

60|$|With {{the advent}} of bronze, {{everything}} was different; and the difference showed itself with extraordinary rapidity. One may compare the revolution effected by bronze in the early world, indeed, with the revolution effected by railways in our own time; only the neolithic world had been so very simple a one that the change was perhaps even more marvellous in its suddenness and its comprehensiveness. Metal itself implied metal-working; and metal-working brought about, not only the arts of smelting and casting, but also endless incidental arts of design and decoration. The bronze hatchets, for example, to take our typical implement, begin by being mere copies of the stone originals; but, as time goes on, they acquire rapidly innumerable improvements. First, metal is economized in the upper part which fits into the handle, while the lower or cutting edge is widened out sideways, so as to form an elegant and gracefully curved outline for the whole implement. Next come the flanged axes, with projecting ledges on either side; and then the palstaves with loops and <b>ribs,</b> each <b>marking</b> some new improvement {{in the character of}} the weapon, which the inventor would no doubt have patented but for the unfortunate fact that patents were as yet wholly unknown to Bronze Age humanity. Later still come the socketed hatchets of many patterns, with endless ingenious little devices for securing some small advantage to the special manufacturer. I can fancy the Bronze Age smith showing them off with pride to his interested customers: 'These are our own patterns--the newest thing out in bronze axes; observe the advantage you gain from the ribs and pellets, and the peculiar character which the octagonal socket gives to the hafting!' Indeed, in this single department of bronze celts alone, Mr. Evans in his great monumental work figures over a hundred and eighty distinct specimens (out of thousands known), each one presenting some well-marked advance in type upon its predecessor.

The intercostal spaces are twice as wide as the <b>ribs.</b> They are <b>marked</b> by a series of moderately strong pits at the periphery, and about twenty-six well incised, equal and subequally spaced spiral striations,which pass up on the side of the ribs but do not cross their summits. The periphery of the body whorl is angulated. The base of the shell is short, and well rounded. It is marked by the very feeble continuations of the axial ribs and about twelve equally strong, slender, wavy, spiral striations. The aperture is defective, rhomboidal ? ...|$|R
5000|$|The shell has an elongate-conic shape. The {{anterior}} half of whorls is chestnut brown, {{the rest}} flesh colored. The {{length of the}} shell measures 7.2 mm. The two whorlsof the protoconch form a depressed helicoid spire, whose axis is {{at right angles to}} that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is one-fifth immersed. The ten whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, slightly contracted at the suture, and appressed at the summit. They are marked by acute vertical axial ribs, of which 16 occur upon the first to seventh, 20 upon the eighth, and 26 upon the penultimate turn. The intercostal spaces are about two and one-half times as wide as the <b>ribs.</b> They are <b>marked</b> by fine lines of growth and seven strongly incised spiral grooves, and numerous exceedingly fine, spiral striations. The sutures are slightly contracted. The periphery of the body whorl is slightly angulated. It is marked by a narrow plain band. The base of the shell is short, and well rounded. It is marked by fifteen well incised and numerous very fine spiral lines. The aperture is rhomboidal. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is slender and slightly curved.|$|R
