2500|$|For {{the final}} {{dramatic}} scene involving Harcourt's demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, {{while the second}} stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, [...] "While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic {{within the limits of}} the alien anatomy Winston's crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous 'blob-of-blood' look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We {{wanted to be able to}} see Harcourt's bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it." [...] For the visual appearance he added, [...] "Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy." [...] For Harcourt's facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew [...] "dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt." [...] In the end, Mahan remarked, [...] "We figured that going from something like the alien queen in Aliens to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was <b>really</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work." ...|$|E
