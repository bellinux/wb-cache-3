5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades. Prices on the exchange began to crash, owing {{to the lack of}} funds to finance purchases. At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him {{that he would have to}} close the exchange early. Morgan was emphatic that an early close of the exchange would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though as}} many as {{fourteen}} claimants put forward their claims to the title, the real contest was between John Balliol and Robert de Brus. The Scottish magnates made a request to Edward to conduct the proceedings and administer the outcome, but not to arbitrate in the dispute. The actual decision would be made by 104 auditors - 40 appointed by Balliol, 40 by Bruce and the remaining 24 selected by Edward I from {{senior members of the}} Scottish political community. At Birgham, with the prospect of a personal union between the two realms, the question of suzerainty had not been of great importance to Edward. Now he insisted that, if he were to settle the contest, he had to be fully recognised as Scotland's feudal overlord. The Scots were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a concession, and replied that since the country had no king, no one had the authority to make this decision. This problem was circumvented when the competitors agreed that the realm would be handed over to Edward until a rightful heir had been found. After a lengthy hearing, a decision was made in favour of John Balliol on 17November 1292.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} a grand {{tradition}} of statistical analysis in the last decades of the 19 th century, quantitative methods spread more slowly among German historians than among their French or British colleagues {{who were interested in}} the structural approach of the Annales or in family demography. This essay describes the organizational efforts of Quantum in Germany and of the quantitative methods committee of the Conference Group for German History in the United States. Moreover, it contrasts the results of a German and American survey of the use of these methods, noting considerable differences between the two contexts in subject matter and interpretation. The article aimed at convincing <b>reluctant</b> scholars <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of quantification and to progress to more sophisticated statistical analyses wherever interpretative questions demand it. The piece is therefore a document of the initial enthusiasm for the potential of a new research method. " (author's abstract...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the season}} opener game of the Springfield Neutrinos peewee {{football}} team, an excessive amount of special effects smoke fills the field causing the entire team to crash into each other and even though {{no one seems to}} be hurt, the parents freak out that they've suffered concussions and the football season is suspended. At a town meeting, no one is happy with alternatives like baseball or basketball, and when Kirk Van Houten tries to pitch the idea of coaching a junior lacrosse team nobody wants to hear it. Marge feels bad that everyone including Luanne treats Kirk like garbage and orders a <b>reluctant</b> Homer <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the crowd shut up and listen to Kirk. The pitch, which includes a description of lacrosse as a cross between [...] "hockey and soccer" [...] and a display of great ability by Milhouse himself, leads everyone to ignore the very high rate of concussions in lacrosse and create a new kids league for it.|$|R

He has had a long-running dispute with Afrikaaner Jan Hooft over ownership of a hill and refuses to accept a legal ruling that the land, in fact, belongs to Hooft. He also keeps a close rein on his grown-up daughter Kirsty (Corri) and is <b>reluctant</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a life for herself. She is in love with the local doctor Willem Bloem, who left Holland for Canada for reasons he will not disclose. He does not return her affections.|$|R

5000|$|Val Guest {{had first}} met Frankie Howerd {{backstage}} in his dressing {{room at the}} London Palladium where Howerd was topping the bill in a long running variety show. Guest says that Howerd was <b>reluctant</b> at first <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film - [...] "Films? Oho, that's a dangerous game. Get your name up there outside a cinema and if they don't go in it's all your fault! Thank you but no thank you!" [...] Howerd finally agreed, but made three demands. Firstly, Guest had to write a comedy-thriller, so that if the comedy part didn't work, the thriller part might. Second, {{he did not want}} his name first above the title. And finally, he wanted his favourite comedy actress Margaret Rutherford to be in it. Shooting took five weeks, with a budget of £45,000.|$|R

He secretly sought the opinion of Su Ze's superior Zhang Ji, the Inspector of Yong Province, on this issue. In his reply to Cao Pi, Zhang Ji listed out Su Ze's various achievements – rebuilding a war-torn Jincheng Commandery, gaining the support of the Di and Qiang tribes, quelling Qu Yan's revolt, etc. – and advised Cao Pi to award Su Ze a marquis title to honour him for his loyalty and contributions.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, Nature {{launched}} {{an experiment in}} parallel open peer review: some articles that had been submitted to the regular anonymous process were also available online for open, identified public comment. The results were less than encouraging – only 5% of authors {{agreed to participate in}} the experiment, and only 54% of those articles received comments. The editors have suggested that researchers may have been too busy to take part and were <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their names public. The knowledge that articles were simultaneously being subjected to anonymous peer review may also have affected the uptake.|$|E
5000|$|Next up {{for release}} {{was a movie}} that Power had to fight hard <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> the film noir Nightmare Alley (1947). Darryl F. Zanuck was <b>reluctant</b> for Power <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the movie because his {{handsome}} appearance and charming manner had been marketable assets for the studio for years. Zanuck feared that the dark role might damage Power's image. Zanuck eventually agreed, giving Power A-list production values for what normally would be a B film. The movie was directed by Edmund Goulding, and though it died at the box office, {{it was one of}} Power's favorite roles for which he received some of the best reviews of his career. However, Zanuck was horrified that his [...] "darling boy" [...] would be seen in such a film with a downward spiral. So, he did not publicize it and removed it from release after only a few weeks insisting that it was a flop. The film was released on DVD in 2005 after years of legal battles.|$|R

25|$|After {{nearly a}} year of negotiations, Garbo agreed to renew her {{contract}} with MGM on the condition she would star in Queen Christina and her salary would be increased to $300,000 per film. The film's screenplay had been written by Viertel, and although MGM had been <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the movie, they relented at Garbo's insistence. For her leading man, MGM suggested Charles Boyer or Laurence Olivier, but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover, John Gilbert. The studio balked {{at the idea of}} casting Gilbert, fearing his declining popularity would hurt the film's profits, but Garbo prevailed.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the concessions, the railway network was quickly reduced to one quarter of its capacity, with long {{distance}} lines disappearing almost completely. At the same time, as more locomotives and rolling stock were needed, the private companies became increasingly <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the investment required to increase capacity and thus service quality and passenger numbers declined. Railway privatisation resulted in the loss of some 70,000 jobs in the railway sector over the years, whilst by 1998 some 793 railway stations had been closed. In addition, companies operating other transport means (such as bus transport) who had vested interests seeking the demise of the railway, purchased lines for far less than their real value.|$|E

500|$|At first, Singh kept a low profile; in 1911 she was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{speeches in}} public or at Women's Social and Political Union meetings. She refused to chair meetings, telling her WSPU colleagues she was [...] "quite useless for {{that sort of}} thing" [...] and would only say [...] "five words if nobody else would support the {{forthcoming}} resolution". However, Singh later chaired and addressed a number of meetings. Hirabai, an Indian student in England, noted in 1911 that she displayed a small yellow-and-green badge with her motto: [...] "Votes for women".|$|E

500|$|The {{committee}} lobbied the New Zealand {{government to}} make representations to Buckingham Palace regarding the posthumous grant of the VC to Manahi. [...] The Queen's father, King George VI, had ruled in 1949 that no further awards from the Second World War ought to be made. [...] The New Zealand government was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a formal approach and it took until 1997 for Prime Minister, Jenny Shipley to formally broach the subject with Buckingham Palace. [...] The feedback indicated the elapsed time since the events of Takrouna {{was likely to be}} a barrier to awarding Manahi a VC.|$|E

500|$|Cortana {{has been}} turned into an action figure twice to promote Halo. The first was {{released}} as a seven-inch (178mm) [...] miniature as part of the [...] series of action figures. The character is also featured in the first series of Halo 3 action figures, distributed by McFarlane Toys. [...] In an interview, McLees noted that the first action figure was supposed to convey an older appearance than was depicted in the games. This was accomplished by making the figure look a little buxom, despite McLees' direct request to reduce the mass of the figure. She explains that the sculptor appeared <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the change and that time constraints ultimately left the design intact.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Larkin made audio {{recordings}} (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of [...] groups of poems {{for a number of}} audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ("I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and the whine of Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out"), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} {{length of}} A Feast for Crows eventually surpassed A Storm of Swords. Martin was <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the necessary deep cuts {{to get the}} book down to publishable length, as that would have compromised the story he had in mind. Printing the book in [...] "microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass" [...] was also not an option for him. On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into A Feast for Crows, Parts One and Two. Being already late with the book, Martin had not even started writing all characters' stories and also objected to ending the first book without any resolution for its many viewpoint characters as in previous books.|$|E
