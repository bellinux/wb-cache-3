This high orbit causes users should concern to the propagation media i. e Atmosfir, especially the troposphere and ionosphere, in their measurement. Indeed, the propagation delay influence the accuracy of position of the GPS result. Recently, the inversion method {{of the use of}} GPS becomes the useful one. This inversion method is also introduced to determine the delay factor in troposphere. By obtaining the delay factor which consists of dry and wet delay, we may extract a wet condition in the troposphere when the GPS observation is carried out. Actually, there is measurement method called <b>radiosonde</b> <b>measurement</b> which measures the troposphere profile. However, the dense distribution of radiosonde site is too cost. This becomes the reason why GPS is introduced to densify the troposphere monitoring sites. We applied this method to the Bandung urban area. The location of GPS observations are LAPAN, BMG Lembang, VSI Tangkubanprahu. The last two sites were used as initial points to determine the wet delay above the LAPAN.

Here we present results of deriving PWV using Australian ground-based GPS reference stations network and investigate potential of ground-based GPS/GNSS technique for studying PWV trends for climate research. Space-based instruments provide even wider (potentially global) coverage than regional ground-based networks. One emerging satellite remote sensing technique for obtaining atmospheric temperature and moisture records is GPS RO which provides all-weather capability, long-term measurement stability, high vertical resolution and high-accuracy measurements in the middle to upper troposphere, stratosphere and ionosphere. High accuracy of the GPS RO methodology is of particular importance for reliable estimates of the atmospheric characteristics over regions where conventional meteorological upper air observations from radiosondes are sparse or not available.

40|$|<b>Radiosonde</b> <b>measurement</b> errors {{occur for}} various reasons: calibration, {{mishandling}} of sensors, poor software, radiation, etc. It {{is important that}} these errors be found and corrected, or at the least, corrections determined that might be sensibly applied. Radiation errors apparently are the most serious since the lack of radiative equilibrium between the thermistor and its surrounding environment can not be corrected for just a single thermistor without serious intervention. However, errors may be determined using the Accurate Temperature Measuring (ATM) radiosonde. The ATM radiosonde development was initiated in the mid- 1980 's using three thermistors; five thermistors are presently incorporated in the ATM radiosonde. Test flights at different locations indicated that the radiative effect on the thermistor varies because of the different environment of each location and, can be corrected. When comparisons between different thermistors (radiosondes) are required the ATM is a valuable tool. Investigation of relative humidity measurements is an ongoing issue because of large discrepancies in observed data. The first chilled mirror (SNOW WHITE) radiosonde was flown from Wallops Flight Facility in 1997. Tests and analyses show the chilled mirror radiosonde present very acceptable data up to the altitude of the tropopause and in some measurements, to 100 hPA.

One relevant issue for radiowave propagation modeling in this particular region is the different structures of precipitation which {{play an important role}} in estimating rain fade. To this aim, an investigation of the rain characteristics of 0 °C isotherm height in Malaysia derived from the precipitation radar on-board the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) satellite has been carried out. In fact, TRMM satellite precipitation radar appears as one of the powerful source of instrument in meteorology and telecommunication in estimating height of rainfall in tropical/{{equatorial region}}. In this work, one year of TRMM radar data have been analyzed from the stratiform rain event which there usually exists a well defined melting layer (or bright band).

Comparisons show that the freezing heights typically occurred at the height higher than 4. 5 km as recommended by ITU-R Recommendation P. 839.

40|$|The {{meteorological}} sensor calibration facility {{is designed to}} test and assess <b>radiosonde</b> <b>measurement</b> quality through actual flights in the atmosphere. United States radiosonde temperature measurements are deficient in that they require correction for errors introduced by long- and short-wave radiation. The effect of not applying corrections results in a large bias between day time and night time measurements. This day/night bias has serious implications for users of radiosonde data, of which NASA is one. The derivation of corrections for the U. S. radiosonde is quite important. Determination of corrections depends on solving the heat transfer equation of the thermistor using laboratory measurements of the emissivity and absorptivity of the thermistor coating. The U. S. radiosonde observations from the World Meteorological Organization International Radiosonde Intercomparison were used as the data base to test whether the day/night height bias can be removed. Twenty-five noon time and 26 night time observations were used. Corrected temperatures were used to calculate new geopotentials. Day/night bias in the geopotentials decreased significantly when corrections were introduced. Some testing of thermal lag attendant with the standard carbon hygristor took place.

Cloud liquid water content, 0 °C isotherm height and cloud attenuation have also been obtained from <b>radiosonde</b> <b>measurement</b> using the so-called Salonen model at Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). The results show a strong seasonal variation of cloud cover and cloud liquid water content on the two monsoon seasons. The Liquid Water Content (LWC) obtained from radiosonde and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) is higher during the Northeast Monsoon season, which corresponds to the period of higher percentage cloud cover and high rainfall accumulation. The International Telecommunication Union—Region (ITU-R) model underestimates the cumulative distribution of LWC values at the present station. The relationship of the cloud attenuation, derived from the profiles of liquid water density and temperature within the cloud, shows an underestimate by the data obtained from the ITU-R model. The cloud attenuation at Kuala Lumpur is somewhat underestimated by the ITU-R model up to about 1. 2 dB at Ka (30 GHz) and 3. 4 dB at V (50 GHz) bands.

Through positive feedback water vapour takes an important part in anthropogenically induced changes in climate resulting from increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Hence, determining its spatial and temporal vari-ability is a challenging task. The development of a complete and accurate global water vapour data set is critical to an adequate understanding of the Earth’s climate system. This data is essential for studies concerning the energy and water cycle including poleward energy transports, radiation budget studies, general circulation model verification and global change research.

IR and VIS techniques offer measurements with a sufficient spatial resolution but they only work in the absence of significant cloud cover. Over the oceans additional informations are determined by microwave instruments. Here clouds are translucent. The SEVIRI instrument on METEOSAT- 8 enables the retrieval of total precipitable water (TPW) with a high spatial and temporal resolution for clear-sky scenes only. A water vapour climatology based on clear–sky measurements will lead to an underestimation in TPW when the cloudy-skies contain more water vapour than clear-skies.

It involved two Raman lidars, four <b>radiosonde</b> <b>measurement</b> systems, five GPS stations, a stellar spectrometer, and several ground-based capacitive and dew-point sensors. Observations were collected over 17 nights during which 26 balloons were released which carried a total of 79 radiosondes. Most of the balloons carried 3 or 4 different sonde types simultaneously (Vaisala RS 92, MODEM M 2 K 2 -DC and M 10, and Meteolabor Snow-White). The comparison of IWV measurements from the four radiosonde types to GPS reveals biases of - 11 % to + 7 %. Comparison of water vapour profiles from the radiosondes to the IGN scanning Raman lidar profiles reveals mostly dry and wet biases in the radiosondes data in dry layers in the middle and upper troposphere. Several Raman lidar calibration methods are evaluated which adjust the lidar measurements either on ground-based capacitive or dew-point sensors measurements, on radiosonde data or on GPS PWV data. Another method adjusts the lidar calibration constant as an extra parameter during GPS processing. All these methods show a good degree of consistency and yield a repeatability of 2 to 5 % during the first 3 -week period of the experiment. A drift in the calibration constant is observed throughout the full time of the experiment which is partly explained by a temperature-dependent bias in the lidar measurements induced by the progressive cooling of the atmosphere.

The forecast information led to the successful detection of mountain induced polar stratospheric clouds on 9 Jan. 1997. For this event mesoscale forecasts, hindcast runs including grid nesting and comparisons with lidar observations and <b>radiosonde</b> <b>measurements</b> are presented. (orig.)

40|$|The {{temperature}} and the derived winds {{obtained from the}} LIMS Map Archival Tape data {{for the period of}} October 25, 1978, to May 28, 1979, were compared with corresponding data from the Berin (Tempelhof) radiosonde station at several representative levels in the stratosphere, to assess the quality of the LIMS satellite data for use in dynamics and transport studies. It was found, {{on the basis of this}} single-station time series comparison, that the synoptically mapped LIMS {{temperature and}} wind analyses are of a sufficiently high quality for investigating large-scale dynamics in the stratosphere in conjunction with high-resolution <b>radiosonde</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R
