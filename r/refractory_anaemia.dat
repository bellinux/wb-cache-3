40|$|Aims: To study disease {{characteristics}} of adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in South Australia and to analyse their outcome and survival. Methods: One hundred and eight adult patients with confirmed MDS from marrow biopsies in the 76 -month period before April 2006 were retrospectively included in an MDS database. Results: The median age at diagnosis of this cohort was 70 years, with skewing of <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess blasts and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia {{in the younger}} patients. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 42 % of patients. Median survival was 48 months, and secondary transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia was seen in 27 %. Survival, according to the World Health Organization subtypes in ascending order, was <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess blasts, <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia,</b> <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with ringed sideroblast, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and del(5 q). The International Prognostic Scoring System score stratified MDS patients into different risk groups and effectively discriminated significantly different survivals, ranging from a median 4 months for high-risk patients to 72 months for low-risk patients.

MDS types were homogenous in both groups: <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> (RA) 47. 7 - 48. 8 %, <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with ringed sideroblasts (RAS) 20. 5 - 25. 6 %, <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts (RAEB) (blasts 200 mU/l predicted for a non-response.

40|$|We {{report on}} our {{experience}} relating to 62 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) aged less than 50 years, seen at our Institution and conservatively treated from July 1983 to December 2000. Patients demographics and clinical features at diagnosis were analysed for their prognostic value on survival and on risk of transformation to acute leukaemia. The median age at diagnosis was 43 years (range 21 - 50). According to FAB criteria there were 30 patients with <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> (RA), 3 with <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with ringed sideroblasts (BARS), 18 with <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts (RAEB), 6 with <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) and 5 with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Fifty patients had evaluable cytogenetic analysis: {{the most frequent}} karyotypic change was trisomy of chromosome 8 (10 %), followed by monosomy 7 (6 %); partial chromosome deletions and translocations were also common abnormalities, occurring on the whole in 16 % of patients. At a median follow-up of 15 months 19 patients (31 %) progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). From univariate analysis we identified some features, which appeared to be predictive of outcome and risk of transformation to AML. Age above 40 years (p = 0. 002) and high risk according to IPSS score (p = 0. 002) {{were found to be}} predictive for a shorter survival; FAB grouping (p = 0. 0001), percentage > 5 % of blasts in the bone marrow (p = 0. 001) and high risk by IPSS score (p = 0. 0003) were found to be predictive for a higher risk of transformation to AML.

40|$|We {{report a}} young Omani male who {{developed}} severe and persistent anaemia after a kidney transplantation while being on immunosuppression therapy, standard practice to prevent {{rejection of the}} transplanted kidney. His bone marrow aspirate showed the classic morphological changes of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), induced by parvovirus B 19 infection which {{is the presence of}} giant proerythroblasts with viral inclusions. The virus was also demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction in the blood along with IgM antibodies to parvovirus B 19. He responded dramatically to high dose immunoglobulin with a normalisation of his haemoglobin level in two weeks and remained normal until seven months later. Parvovirus B 19 induced PRCA can be cured. This aetiology must be kept in mind especially when a chronic <b>anaemia,</b> <b>refractory</b> to treatment, is accompanied by a reticulocytopenia.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is the {{investigation}} of choice to identify mucosal lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract, but it is poorly tolerated by patients. A simple non-invasive technique to image the upper gastrointestinal tract, which could be made widely available, would be beneficial to patients. Capsule endoscopy is well tolerated by patients but the stomach has proved difficult to visualise accurately with capsule technology due to its’ capacious nature and mucosal folds, which can obscure pathology. MiroCam Navi (Intromedic Ltd, Seoul, Korea) is a capsule endoscope containing {{a small amount of}} magnetic material which has been made available with a handheld magnet which might allow a degree of control. This body of work aims to address whether this new technology could be a feasible alternative to conventional flexible endoscopy of the stomach. METHODS: Four studies were conducted to test this research question. The first explores the feasibility of magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy of the stomach and operator learning curve in an ex vivo porcine model. This was followed by a randomised, blinded trial comparing magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy to conventional flexible endoscopy in ex vivo porcine stomach models. Subsequently a prospective, single centre randomised controlled trial in humans examined whether magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy could enhance conventional small bowel capsule endoscopy by reducing gastric transit time. Finally a blinded comparison of diagnostic yield of magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy compared to oesophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed in patients with recurrent or <b>refractory</b> iron deficiency <b>anaemia.</b> RESULTS: In the first study all stomach tags were identified in 87. 2...|$|R
40|$|Oral Presentation - APBMT: Transplant Issues Specific for Asia-Pacific Region (Session B) Handbook v. 1 : Final Programme and Oral AbstractsFor {{children}} with no suitable HLA-matched donors or cord blood but requiring haematopoietic stem cells transplant, {{the use of}} haploidentical donor {{is one of the}} possible options to consider. There are 3 approaches for hapHSCT, including: 1) non-manipulated bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC); 2) positive ex-vivo selected CD 34 stem cells from BM or PBSC; & 3) BM or PBSC with negative ex-vivo depleted T & B cells. The non-manipulated BM & PBSC hapHSCT mainly used in-vivo ATG as T cells depletion. The engraftment rate has been reported to be satisfactory but it is associated with significant high acute and chronic GVHD rate (40 to 60 %). The positive CD 34 selected donor’s graft is associated with much less GVHD but delayed engraftment and high infectious risk due to prolonged immune reconstitution is a concern. The ex-vivo depleted CD 3 T cells and CD 19 B cells or ex-vivo depleted CD 3 T cells with in-vivo CD 20 B cells depletion approach has been used by several centres in recent years for {{children with}} refractory haematological illnesses. Due to the high stem cells dose from the haploid PBSC and selected depletion of T & B cells only, rapid engraftment; low GVHD rate and rapid immune reconstitution has been reported. We therefore adopted this CD 3 /CD 19 ex-vivo depleted hapHSCT for our patients who failed after conventional HSCT. So far 5 children (4 with relapsed leukaemia & one with <b>refractory</b> aplastic <b>anaemia)</b> received CD 3 /CD 19 depleted PBSC grafts from their parents in our unit. All patients engrafted and their neutrophil engraftment occurred within 14 days (range 11 - 14 days) and platelet engraftment occurred within 28 days (ranged 15 - 28 days). None developed Gr II-IV GVHD. Except one patient developed adenovirus associated haemorrhagic cystitis, none suffered from severe infection. However, all of these high risk patients relapsed subsequently and most relapse/rejection occurred within 6 months after the transplant. The relapse free survival of such 2 nd transplant is lower than the expected 30 - 40 % reported by Handgretinger R, et al. As comparison, we did not use KIR mismatch status as selection criteria and we also did not monitor the graft status weekly after transplant so no prophylactic DLI had been added back in our cohort. This may imply the importance of graft status monitoring especially during the early transplant period with this approach. Future effort should be directed at more specific T cells depletion so GVL effect can be retained. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Significant increases of myeloperoxidase content in granulocytes occurred during treatment (P = 0. 003). Phagocytosis and killing of Staph. aureus by granulocytes was markedly enhanced during treatment. Microbicidal capacity normalized in four out of six patients during GM-CSF therapy. However, chemotaxis in response to zymosan-activated serum (ZAS) and f-Met-Leu-Phe (f-MLP), was further impaired {{on the last day}} of treatment, which was associated with a marked increase in the expression of the granulocyte adhesion receptors CD 11 a (P = 0. 01), CD 11 b (P = 0. 002), CD 11 c (P = 0. 00015) and CD 18 (P = 0. 0014). GM-CSF therapy did not cause significant changes in hexose monophosphate (HMP) -shunt activity, chemiluminescence, nor superoxide production. The present results show that in vivo administration of GM-CSF is able to repair at least in part the neutrophil anomalies in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which might be useful in modulating host response to infections. However, increased adherence and impaired chemotaxis may explain some toxicities observed during treatment with GM-CSF. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Iron plays {{important}} functional {{roles in}} mammalian cells, including oxygen transport and redox reactions. The liver expressed peptide hepcidin plays {{a central role}} in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Hepcidin levels are inversely correlated with iron levels in the body, and are regulated by a number of iron-related genes. Hemojuvelin is a liver-expressed protein, mutations in which lead to severe iron-overload early in life (known as juvenile haemochromatosis). Complications of iron accumulation in the liver, pancreas, heart and pituitary gland can lead to diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis and hypogonadism. Hemojuvelin is known to be a positive regulator of hepcidin. Matriptase- 2 is a serine protease expressed in the liver. Patients with mutations in matriptase- 2 manifest iron <b>refractory</b> iron deficiency <b>anaemia,</b> indicating that matriptase- 2 is a hepcidin suppressor. The mechanism of suppression of hepcidin expression by matriptase- 2 is therefore a new area of interest in iron metabolism. The overall aims of this thesis were to define the relationship between hemojuvelin and matriptase- 2 and examine their role in regulating hepcidin and therefore iron levels in the body. In order to further understand how hemojuvelin regulates hepcidin, disease-causing mutations in hemojuvelin were replicated in a liver cell line model to examine the dysregulation in hepcidin modulation upon mutation as compared to wild-type. It was hypothesised that mutations in hemojuvelin would lead to changes in the secretion and trafficking of hemojuvelin in addition to dysregulation of hepcidin. An antibody to hemojuvelin was produced in order to detect hemojuvelin in lieu of adequate commercial antibodies. In order to elucidate the relationship between the liver expressed proteins hemojuvelin and matriptase- 2, an in vitro model was used to determine changes in mRNA and protein of each respective gene when co-expressed. It was hypothesised that hemojuvelin may be a substrate for matriptase- 2 in the regulation of the key iron regulator, hepcidin. This thesis (Chapter 3) examines the effect of two juvenile haemochromatosis disease-causing mutations of hemojuvelin (G 320 V and R 326 X) on the secretion of hemojuvelin and response of hepcidin to induction with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 9 in a human liver cell line (Huh 7). The functional regulation of hepcidin in a HepG 2 liver cell line in response to exposure to secreted mutant hemojuvelin was also investigated. It was observed that mutations in hemojuvelin have significant effects including dysregulation of hepcidin, leading to altered iron homeostasis. Rabbit and sheep anti-hemojuvelin antibodies were generated and characterised in their detection of hemojuvelin levels in cell lysate and human liver (Chapter 4). The antibodies were generated in host animals via injection of a tagged recombinant human hemojuvelin peptide, located within the first half of the protein. The immunological reaction was monitored by Western blot analysis and subsequent test bleeds indicated low antibody titre. A total of eight injections over seven months produced an antibody that was of high concentration and purity. However, specificity was too low to be of further use and the antibody was therefore not used for subsequent experiments. The final Chapter (5) investigates the proposal that hemojuvelin is processed by matriptase- 2 in the regulation of hepcidin. It was observed that Huh 7 cells co-expressing hemojuvelin and matriptase- 2 had a significant down-regulation of hepcidin when stimulated with BMP 9 but not BMP 2. At the same time, the hetero-dimeric membrane-bound form of hemojuvelin was observed to be reduced alongside the release of the serine protease domain of matriptase- 2, indicating activity of this protease. This is a major finding of this thesis and one that was confirmed within months of discovery by the publication of similar findings. Additionally, it was observed that soluble hemojuvelin, known to bind BMP 2, did so in cell culture significantly, thus inhibiting the induction of hepcidin in this system. While BMP 9 is not known to bind hemojuvelin, it served as an alternative model to BMP 2 in this system as it was found that hemojuvelin significantly enhanced BMP 9 induced mRNA expression of hepcidin. Overall this thesis examines the relationship between hemojuvelin, matriptase- 2 and hepcidin. The study of the molecular and cellular consequences of juvenile haemochromatosis causing mutations in hemojuvelin has provided further elucidation of the significant role of hemojuvelin in regulating hepcidin in healthy and disease states. The production of anti-hemojuvelin antibodies has provided an insight into the complexity and difficulty of producing antibodies against this protein. Finally, the finding that hemojuvelin acts as a substrate for matriptase- 2 is a significant finding of this thesis, providing important new insights into the iron-regulatory pathway. The discovery has been confirmed by a similar in vitro study and is compatible with recent findings in an in vivo system comprising of hemojuvelin and matriptase- 2 double mutant mice. The significant role played by matriptase- 2 in regulating hepcidin through hemojuvelin is only just beginning to be fully understood and further clarification has broad implications for the understanding of iron homeostasis and the potential for development of new treatments for both iron deficiency and overload...|$|R

The aetiology is unknown in most cases (idiopathic haemochromatosis), but the condition can occur in ohronic <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia,</b> where the deposition of iron is due to multiple blood transfusions and coincident oral and intravenous iron therapy (exogenous or transfusion haemoohromatosis...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong Chinese {{patients}} with myelodysplastic syndromes were screened {{for the presence}} of N-ras mutation by using the polymerase chain reaction/dot blot hybridization technique. Three of 20 (15 %) cases studied were found to harbour mutant N-ras in the bone marrow mononuclear cell population. One case of <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts and with excess of blasts in transformation had substitution of arginine for glutamine at codon 61. A second case of <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts had substitution of serine for glycine at codon 12. In this patient, mutant N-ras was detected in a follow up sample taken two months later although there was no change in the blast percentage compared with the presentation sample. Our study showed that N-ras mutation is an infrequent finding in Hong Kong Chinese myelodysplastic syndrome patients. An N-ras mutation is not necessarily accompanied by an alteration in the haematological picture. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{acquired}} haemophilia A presenting {{with extensive}} spontaneous bruising and anaemia is reported. The anaemia {{was due to}} myelodysplastic syndrome (FAB: <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with ringed sideroblasts). A factor-VIII:C-specific inhibitor was also found. Prednisone and pyridoxine were given,and the inhibitor became undetectable after 4 weeks of therapy, but the abnormal ringed sideroblasts still persisted on repeated bone marrow biopsy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{haematological}} {{features of}} 118 cases of primary myelodysplastic syndromes (PMDS) were reviewed {{to see how}} these could be related and classified according to the recent FAB proposals. A majority of the cases were elderly who presented with a macrocytic or normocytic anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Cases of acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anaemia (AISA) usually had normal leucocyte and platelet counts, erythroid hyperplasia, marked dyserythropoiesis and more than 20 % ringed sideroblasts. Cases of <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts (RAEB) had frequent neutropenia and thrombopenia usually with prominent dysgranulopoiesis and dysthrombopoiesis. <b>Refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> or refractory cytopenia appeared morphologically to be a heterogeneous group. Leukaemic transformation did not occur {{in any of these}} 16 cases of AISA whereas six of the 34 cases of RAEB transformed into acute leukaemia. It appears that the cases of PMDS present with well defined haematological features which permit recognition of different groups; these latter groups appear to be morphologically and prognostically distinct...|$|E

40|$|A multicenter phase II {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to investigate the}} efficacy, toxicity and tolerability of an oral regimen of 9 -cis retinoic acid (9 CRA) as a differentiation-inducing agent stimulating both retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor (RXR). Thirty patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were enrolled into the study. The MDS subtypes were distributed as follows: 14 <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> (RA), four <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), and 12 <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess blasts (RAEB). The age ranged from 40 to 81 years (median 70). None of these had previously received treatment for MDS other than supportive therapy. 9 CRA (Alitretinoin capsules, kindly provided by Allergan-Ligand Retinoid Therapeutics) was given daily at 60 mg/m 2 p. o. for 1 week, followed by an intra-patient escalation to 100 mg/m 2 during the second week, up {{to a maximum of}} 140 mg/m 2. The planned treatment duration was 48 weeks. Twenty-five were available for assessment. One patient (4 %) with RA achieved complete hematological remission. Four (16 %), two with RA, two with RAEB, had minor responses resulting in decreased transfusion requirements or increased neutrophils. Thus, the overall response rate was 20 % in evaluable patients with MDS and 17 % in the study group on an intention-to-treat basis. The most frequent side-effects included headache (77 %), dry skin (57 %), arthralgias (30 %), and rash (23 %). In conclusion, although modest responses were noted in this study, the treatment tolerability was suboptimal. It is conceivable that a lower dosage schedule may be efficacious and better tolerated so enabling prolonged exposure which may be required to induce a differentiation effect...|$|E

40|$|We have {{compared}} the phenotypic and functional characteristics of dendritic cells (DC) generated in vitro from the peripheral blood mononuclear fraction of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (four <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia,</b> four <b>refractory</b> <b>anaemia</b> with excess of blasts) with DCs generated {{in a similar}} way from eight healthy donors. After 10 d of culture in the presence of GM-CSF and IL- 4, reduced numbers and percentages of DCs were obtained in MDS subjects. MDS DCs exhibited significantly lower expression of CD 1 a, CD 54, CD 80 and MHC class II molecules. Their ability to stimulate T lymphocytes in an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction was reduced in comparison to normal subjects. Furthermore, MDS DCs also showed a reduced receptor-mediated endocytosis as demonstrated by FITC-dextran uptake. Simultaneous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated that MDS DCs have the same cytogenetic abnormality of the malignant clone. Taken together these findings indicate that, in MDS, DCs are part of the malignant clone and exhibit a deficient antigen uptake and presentation...|$|E
