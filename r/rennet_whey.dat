40|$|An immunochromatographic lateral-flow test {{dipstick}} {{test was}} developed for the fast detection of bovine <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> in liquid milk and milk powder.

The dipstick performance was evaluated in a collaborative trial using skim milk powder and raw, pasteurized and UHT milk. The suitability of the dipstick was demonstrated in comparison with gel permeation-high performance liquid chromotography and a colorimetric method, by analysing 60 raw milk samples collected from farms in Brazil. The dipstick results correlated well with the HPLC results and were more reliable than those obtained with the colorimetric method. The dipstick test correctly identified all raw milk samples with a <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> content above 4 %...|$|E
40|$|Biacore biosensors (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) {{have proven}} to be robust {{analytical}} tools for the automated immunochemical detection of different adulterants and contaminants in milk and milk powder. However, the significant cost of the instruments is a disincentive for their wide application in food control laboratories. Therefore, a low-cost alternative optical biosensor (Spreeta¿, Texas Instruments, Attleboro, MA) was built into an affordable liquid handling system. Using this prototype biosensor, an inhibition immunoassay for bovine ¿-casein was evaluated for the detection of cow's milk in ewe's and goat's milk and for the detection of bovine <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> powder in milk powder. Comparable sensitivities were obtained for both adulterants in the Spreeta-based prototype biosensor and a Biacore 3000 instrument. The limit of detection for cow's milk was 0. 17 % (v/v) and bovine <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> powder could be detected in milk powder above 1 % (w/w).

50|$|The milk {{is first}} heated and curdled by the {{addition}} of <b>rennet.</b> The <b>whey</b> is removed from the curds, which are then packed into cylindrical molds called arnios, salted and left to cure and harden. After the initial curing period of around two weeks, the Cabrales is then aged a further two to five months in natural caves in the limestone mountains of the area. The cheeses are placed on wooden shelves known as talameras, where they are periodically turned and cleaned. Relative humidity in these caves is typically 90% and the temperature is a cool 7 - 13 C, conditions favoring the development of penicillium molds that produce blue-green veins throughout the cheese.|$|R
5000|$|Mizithra is {{made from}} raw, whole ewe's or goat's milk in the {{simplest}} way possible: milk is brought to a slow boil {{for a few minutes}} and then curdled by adding <b>rennet</b> or <b>whey</b> from a previous batch (see below) or else some acidic substance such as lemon juice, vinegar or even a fresh broken fig tree sprig. As soon as curds have formed they are poured into a cheesecloth bag and hung to drain. The whey dripping out of the bag can be used to curdle the next batch of mizithra. After a few days mizithra forms a sweet, moist, soft mass molded in the shape of the hanging bag with a rounded bottom and a conical, wrinkly top. At this stage it is called [...] "sweet" [...] or [...] "fresh mizithra" [...] and may be eaten or, often, baked in pies.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{microporous}} membranes with functional groups covalently attached {{were used}} to selectively separate beta-lactoglobulin, BSA, and alpha-lactalbumin from <b>rennet</b> <b>whey.</b> The selectivity and membrane performance of strong (quaternary ammonium) and weak (diethylamine) ion-exchange membranes were studied using breakthrough curves, measurement of binding capacity, and protein composition of the elution fraction to determine the binding behavior of each membrane. When the weak and strong anion exchange membranes were saturated with whey, they were both selective primarily for beta-lactoglobulin with less than 1 % of the eluate consisting of alpha-lactalbumin or BSA. The binding capacity of a pure alpha-lactoglobulin solution was in excess of 1. 5 mg/cm(2) of membrane. This binding capacity was reduced to approximately 1. 2 mg/cm(2) when using a <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> solution (pH 6. 4). This reduction in protein binding capacity {{can be explained by}} both the competitive effects of other whey proteins and the effect of ions present in whey. Using binary solution breakthrough curves and <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> breakthrough curves, it was shown that alpha-lactalbumin and BSA were displaced from the strong and weak anion exchange membranes by beta-lactoglobulin. Finally, the effect of ionic strength on the binding capacity of individual proteins for each membrane was determined by comparing model protein solutions in milk permeate (pH 6. 4) and a 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6. 4). Binding capacities of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin, and BSA in milk permeate were reduced by as much as 50 %. This reduction in capacity coupled with the low binding capacity of current ion exchange membranes are 2 serious considerations for selectively separating complex and concentrated protein solutions...|$|E
40|$|Milk serum {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown by other workers to be partially protected from heat denaturation {{by the presence of}} milk solids (8, 15, 16) and whole caseinate (14). This study revealed that some serum proteins (B-lactoglobulin), as shown by the Harland-Ashworth test (14, 17), were more readily denatured in skimmilk than in <b>rennet</b> <b>whey.</b> A comparison of the heat denaturation rate of serum proteins in whey as opposed to those in whey containing 2. 5 percent isoelectric casein was also studied. A striking protection of serum proteins seemed apparent in the presence of isoelectric casein. However, it was learned that isoelectric casein interferes with results of the Harland-Ashworth test, and by taking this interference into account, that isoelectric casein has no affect on the heat denaturation rate of serum proteins. Some proteins are more sensitive to heat in the presence of miceller casein than in the presence of isoelectric casein or no casein at all. The addition of sulfhydryl-group blocking agents (P-chloromercuribenzoic acid and N-ethylmaleimide) inhibited serum protein denaturization in both skimmilk and <b>rennet</b> <b>whey.</b> Reactions of sulfhydryl groups following their liberation by heat resulted in much of the physical instability measured by the Harland-Ashworth test. The complex between B-lactoglobulin and K-casein, if it had any affect at all, was not one of the significant sulfhydryl-group reactions involved in the heat denaturation of the serum proteins...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonication and thermo-sonication {{belong to}} alternative, non-thermal food {{processing}} methods. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the influence of different ultrasound power inputs (240 W, 320 W, 400 W) without and in combination with heat pre-treatment on microbial inactivation and sensory properties of <b>rennet</b> cheese <b>whey</b> in comparison with conventional pasteurization batch processes. Ultrasonication treatments had no impact on reduction of any group of studied microorganisms. Microbial inactivation caused by thermo-sonication treatments with pre-heating to 35 °C or 45 °C increased with nominal power input and/or exposure times and was probably due to the heat improved ultrasonic cavitation. Thermo-sonication treatments at nominal power input (400 W) and preheating to 55 °C were the most effective resulting in greater microbial reduction compared to that observed by simulating pasteurization processes, but occurred probably due to developed heat solely. Sensory properties after ultrasonication and thermo-sonication were considerably improved in comparison with that after simulated pasteurization processes. Mouth feel of whey samples was considerably better, there was no occurrence of sediment and colour remained unchanged in almost all samples...|$|R

The BRW content was determined in a neutralised trichloroacetic acid sample extract by binding of the dissolved caseinomacropeptide to an enzyme-labelled anti-bovine-¿-casein monoclonal antibody. Calibration curves were constructed by analysing SMP standards with different known concentrations of BRW (0 ¿ 5. 8 % (w/w)). The assay has a limit of detection of 0. 1 % (w/w) BRW powder in SMP and has high repeatability and reliability. The ELISA reached the sensitivity required for screening to conform with European Union (EU) legislation. It is easy to use, has a short assay time and is of low cost. The successful applicability of this new screening assay was demonstrated in comparison with chromatographic methods imposed by the EU, where 60 industrial samples taken by the Dutch General Inspection Service were analysed...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Enhancing {{industrial}} sustainability by converting whey into alternative high value-added {{products is}} a scientific trend in food science and technology. However, without other ingredients, <b>rennet,</b> or sour, <b>whey</b> has an unappetizing flavor. This sensory challenge {{can be overcome}} by blending it with citrus flavor from orange juice. This study assessed a micro-filtered beverage from whey and orange juice without enzymatic treatment. Four formulations (27 : 10, 8. 6 : 10, 2. 4 : 10 and 1 : 10 v/v whey:juice ratio) were processed through a 1. 4 μm microfiltration system with four different transmembrane pressures (1, 2, 3, and 4. 15 bar) and then stored at 5 °C for 28 days. The micro-filtered beverage was analyzed for physicochemical, sensorial and microbial changes. It was possible overcome the technological challenges of orange juice microfiltration without enzymatic treatment with high transmembrane pressures. The whey:orange juice ratio was also decisive for permeation. A clear beverage with lower viscosity, turbidity, and protein levels was obtained, without altering mineral concentrations thus showing that the product has good capacity for hydration. The beverage presented good microbiological quality and remained stable for 28 days at 5 °C. Sensory evaluation data indicate that the beverage can be directed to young people and women, regardless of their physical activity. The combination of whey and orange juice can be explored industrially as a micro-filtered beverage, with satisfactory results of physicochemical, microbiological and sensory acceptance...|$|R

Treatments to control and minimize variability of milk or whey were evaluated to optimize stability in starter culture performance. Raw milk samples were tested for somatic cell counts, activity tests (modified Horrall- Elliker), acid degree values, and total plate counts. Activity (modified Horraii-EIIiker) and inhibitory tests were also performed on pasteurized, pasteurized-vacuumized and high heat milk treatments. <b>Rennet</b> <b>whey</b> (heated and unheated) was collected from raw and pasteurized-vacuumized milk and tested for lactic culture performance by monitoring growth under pH control for 16 h and measuring milli-equivalents of neutralizer (NaOH) added. Lactic culture performance and stability in raw milk was poor in all seasons. Culture performance in high heat milk was poor, but demonstrated good repeatability. Pasteurized milk supported good lactic culture performance and stability. Pasteurized-vacuumized milk provided excellent lactic culture performance and stability throughout the year. Culture performance during December through March demonstrated the greatest variation. The cultures performed more uniformly during April through August. September was a transition month.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} the populations of ABT culture microorganisms in orange and orangewhey drinks after fermentation and during 28 -day storage. The evaluation involved fermented fruit drinks without whey or with added acid or sweet (<b>rennet)</b> <b>whey.</b> The Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacteria counts were initially 3. 5 × 10 5 – 8. 3 × 10 5 CFU cm − 3 and 2. 4 × 10 6 – 5. 9 × 10 6 CFU cm − 3, respectively, and did not increase during fermentation.

40|$|Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibition}} {{is one of}} {{the mechanisms}} by which reduction in blood pressure is exerted. Whey proteins are a rich source of ACE inhibitory peptides and have shown a blood pressure reduction effect i. e. antihypertensive activity. The aim of this work was to develop a simplified process using a combination of adsorption and microfiltration steps for the production of hydrolysates from whey with high ACE inhibitory activity and potency; the latter was measured as the IC 50, which is the peptide concentration required to reduce ACE activity by half. This process integrates the selective separation of β-lactoglobulin and casein derived peptides (CDP) from <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> and their hydrolysis, which results in partially pure, less complex hydrolysates with high bioactive potency. Hydrolysis was carried out with protease N ‘Amano’ in a thermostatically controlled membrane reactor operated in a batch mode. By applying the integrative approach it was possible to produce from the same feedstock two different hydrolysates that exhibited high ACE inhibition. One hydrolysate was mainly composed of casein-derived peptides with IC 50 = 285 μg/mL. In this hydrolysate we identified the well known potent ACE-I and anti-hypertensive tri-peptide Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and another novel octa-peptide Gln-Asp-Lys-Thr-Glu-Ile-Pro-Thr (QDKTEIPT). The second hydrolysate was mainly composed of β-lactoglobulin derived peptides with IC 50 = 128 µg/mL. This hydrolysate contained a tetra-peptide (Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu) IIAE as one of the two major peptides. A further advantage to this process is that enzyme activity was substantially increased as enzyme product inhibition was reduced...|$|E

Incorporation of the prepared LPS into alginate films between 0. 08 and 0. 69 mg/cm 2 (516 - 4325 U/cm 2) caused the immobilization {{of most of}} the enzyme and gave films with LPS activity between 0. 05 and 2. 8 U/cm 2, determined in the presence of 8 μM H 2 O 2. Between 2 and 24 μM H 2 O 2 concentrations, a two-fold increase in H 2 O 2 concentration caused 1. 5 - 2. 5 -fold increase in LPS activity of films incorporated with 0. 24 - 0. 28 mg/cm 2 (1200 U/cm 2) LPS. The Q 10 and Ea of immobilized enzyme activity between 4 and 16 °C were 1. 69 and 34. 6 kJ/mol, respectively. However, in the 16 - 30 °C range, the temperature change had almost no effect on LPS activity of films. The optimal activity of immobilized LPS was observed at pH 6. 0, but the enzyme maintained 30 - 85 % of its activity between pH 3. 0 and 7. 0. The immobilized LPS also had a high stability between pH 4. 0 and 6. 0.

40|$|International audienceNumerous {{opportunities}} for the separation and fractionation of milk and whey components are presented {{as a result of}} continuing developments in filtration membranes modules and processes. The preparation of sufficient quantities of selected protein groups for functionality studies and food application tests requires considerable amounts of starting material, particularly in the case of whey-based constituents. Adequate amounts of membrane filtration surface area are, therefore, needed in order to expedite processing time, limit conditions for microbial growth and increase productivity from a product development point of view. With this objective in mind, a series of large pilot plant membrane separation systems based on microfiltration, ultrafiltration and electrodialysis were recently installed and commissioned. Rapid ultrafiltration of whey for the generation of high protein concentrates under a wide variety of conditions, including 'cold' filtration, is facilitated by a MemtechTM spiral wound membrane plant with a maximum surface area of 144 m^ 2 that is accommodated within 3 modules mounted in parallel. Designed to operate on a continuous feed-and-bleed principle, product is heated while pumping via a plate-heater to the plant's balance tank in order to raise temperature to the desired operating condition. Magnetic flow meters mounted on the feed, permeate and diafiltration water lines enable the volume concentration ratio to be controlled throughout a run.

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} buffalo and cows' milk and factors affecting the rheological and microstructural properties of Mozzarella type curd made from buffalo and cows' milk were investigated. Although {{there have been}} many studies on the rheological and microstructural properties of rennet curd made from cows' milk. There is no detailed information available in the scientific literature on Mozzarella type curd made from buffalo milk, and the effect of factors such as pH, acidification, gelation temperature and freezing thereon. Cheese and yoghurt are made from buffalo and cows' on a commercial scale without considering differences in their chemical composition, physical, mechanical and microstructural properties. Buffalo milk contains 40 - 60 % more fat, protein and calcium than cows' milk. Due to the higher total solids content of buffalo milk, it would be expected to have greater curd strength (G'), curd yield, curd moisture and fat retention than cows' milk. Mozzarella curd had a better texture and overall quality made from buffalo milk than cows' milk. The factors affecting the overall quality of Mozzarella type curd made from cows' milk were more pronounced than those made from buffalo milk. In frozen buffalo milk, pH, ionic calcium and dynamic moduli (G', G") of resulting curds were reduced when compared to unfrozen milk. This may be due to precipitation of calcium phosphate during freezing. Hence, the concentration of ionic calcium would decrease giving a final reduction in pH. For both species, the effects of acidification on the physicochemical and rheological properties were qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. Buffalo milk displayed a curd structure and rheology different from that of cows' milk, and the casein-bound calcium, as well as the contents of fat, protein and calcium, was also higher. Due to these higher amounts of casein-bound calcium, the overall curd strength of buffalo milk (as indicated by the dynamic moduli) was higher, at similar pH values, than those of equivalent gels produced from cows' milk. The degree of solubilization of calcium in buffalo milk during acidification was quite different from that observed in cows' milk with a lower proportion of the calcium being solubilized in the former. The effects of gelation temperature were found to be more pronounced in cows' curd than buffalo curd. The maximum curd strength i (G') was obtained at a gelation temperature of 34 °C in both types of milk. The maximum yield stress was obtained at the gelation temperatures of 34 °C and 28 °C in buffalo and cows' curd, respectively. The cryo-SEM and CLSM micrographs showed that minimum porosity was observed at the gelation temperature of 34 °C in both types of milk. Buffalo curd showed minimum porosity at similar gelation temperature when compared to cows' curd. The curd yield 50 % was higher in buffalo milk as compared to cows' milk. This was due to differences in chemical composition of both milks. The fat (50 %) and protein (30 %) were higher in buffalo milk than cows' milk. The minimum losses of fat and protein in <b>rennet</b> <b>whey</b> occurred at a gelation temperature of 34 °C in both milk samples. The different cutting times had a small effect on the yield and overall quality of curds made from both milk types. The curd rheology and microstructure of cows' curd was found to be different, even at equivalent protein/total solids to buffalo milk using ultrafiltration. This may have been due differences in fat globule or casein micelles size or different proportions of casein fractions. The curd yield on both dry & wet basis, curd moisture and curd fat retention were found to be higher in UF cows' milk than for buffalo and cows' milk.
