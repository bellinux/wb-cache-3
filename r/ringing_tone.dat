5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, <b>ringing</b> <b>tone</b> evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally coincides {{with the death of}} a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{city was}} unable {{to raise money to}} build the museum, and the stones were damaged in five fires. The first came soon after the crates were set down in Golden Gate Park. Morgan said that [...] "piles of burning boxes were pulled over and down by the Fire Department, many hurled over a hundred and fifty feet." [...] Hearst died in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957; neither of them saw {{anything}} built with the stones. Two fires in 1959 appeared to be arson, and many of the fire-heated stones were weakened or cracked from sudden cooling by water. In 1960, Steilberg was hired to inspect the stones once again; he used a ball-peen hammer to lightly strike each stone and listen for a solid <b>ringing</b> <b>tone,</b> or a dull thud which indicated cracking. He found that a little more than half the stones were sound.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to 2005, most <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> {{were based}} on {{polyphonic}} or even cruder monophonic tones because that was what most cell phone handsets could play. [...] However, with snippets of existing songs and compositions generating more than $2 billion in annual worldwide revenues in 2005 as <b>ring</b> <b>tones,</b> cell phone handset manufacturers began producing handsets capable of replaying {{the upper and lower}} notes from a song's melody without tinny-sounding bleats. [...] In early 2005, retailer Best Buy turned music Shayman had written for one of its commercials into a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> and offered it on the Best Buy website. [...] From this, Shayman {{was one of the first}} to recognize the business potential in composing original <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> material exclusively for cell phones and collaborated in 2005 with music producer Eddie O'Loughlin, and singer/songwriter Dee Robert in the new mobile music art form to produce original <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> for Jamba!.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Custom <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> for {{cellular}} phones have become extremely popular {{over the past}} several years, allowing users to customize their mobile computing experience, expressing their personality or enjoying their favorite tune. In the <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> selection process, a user generally searches or browses for a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> by title in one of several <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> databases and then purchases his selection. Research into query-by-humming systems may eventually enable users to select a song by singing a segment of it. This project, Sing-a-Ring, extends the user <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> experience by allowing users to create their own <b>ring</b> <b>tones</b> by singing. Unlike current options to record a sound file and set that as a <b>ring</b> <b>tone</b> directly, this application uses an autocorrelation algorithm to convert the recorded sample to a MIDI file and then provides customization options, such as instrument and tempo selectors. This application is implemented on the Java ™ 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J 2 ME), and has been tested on a Motorola RAZR V 3 i phone. For the current implementation, due to format conversion issues, recordings must be created on a computer and then transferred to the phone. Nevertheless, the current application is a proof of concept with great potential, especially if access to AMR decoding libraries and the digital signal processing chip is available...|$|R

50|$|This {{illusion}} {{can also}} {{occur in the}} auditory and tactile domain.
