5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen {{their position in the}} inevitable battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's <b>riposte.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their <b>riposte</b> {{against the}} central column. Herff—who {{had been prepared}} to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Lakshmi Narayan temples complex, {{devoted to}} the Vaishnavite sect, {{includes}} the main Lakshmi Narayan temple, built in the 10th century by Raja Sahil Verman. It has been built to suit the local climatic conditions with wooden chatries and has a shikara, and a sanctum sanctorum (Garbhagriha), with an antarala and a mantapa. A metallic image of Garuda, the vahana (mount) of Vishnu is installed on the dwajastamba pillar at the main gate of the temple. In 1678, Raja Chhatra Singh adorned the temple roof with gold plated pinnacles, as a <b>riposte</b> to Auranagzeb, who had ordered demolition of this temple.|$|E

5|$|The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division resumed Operation Martlet at 0650, {{although}} much of its artillery support from VIII Corps was diverted to the main operation. The Germans were able to slow the British advance and then launched an armoured <b>riposte.</b> This initially gained ground but was stalled when British armour moved up and the two sides duelled in the confined terrain. Informed during the afternoon that a big British offensive was under way further east, SS-Standartenführer Kurt Meyer of 12th SS Panzer called off the counter-attack and ordered his tank companies {{to return to their}} positions south of Rauray. During {{the rest of the day}} the 49th Division was able to make progress, eventually halting just north of Rauray.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failure}} and defeat of Operation Pigfat and Operation Raindance in early 1969, the communists had overrun the Plain of Jars the {{following}} year to within ten kilometers of the guerrillas' Long Chieng main base in Military Region 2. As a <b>riposte,</b> Hmong General Vang Pao had launched another spoiling offensive against the pressing communists with Kou Kiet.

25|$|Also, {{an obvious}} <b>riposte</b> {{is that we}} can {{aggregate}} capital simply by using the first set of prices and ignoring the second, as with many inflation corrections. This does not work, however, because the variation of the rate of profit is theorized as happening at a specific point in time in purely mathematical terms rather than as part of an historical process. The point is that if neoclassical conceptions do not work at a specific time (statics), they cannot handle the more complicated issues of dynamics. This critique of the neoclassical conception is more of a matter of pointing out its major technical flaws in the theory than of presenting an alternative.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{broke the}} magazine's longstanding taboo against {{treating}} photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon {{to be its}} first staff photographer. She also approved controversial covers from {{a new crop of}} artists, including Edward Sorel's October 1992 cover that had people buzzing about the meaning of a punk rock passenger sprawled in the backseat of an elegant horse-drawn carriage: was it Brown's self-mocking <b>riposte</b> to fears she would downgrade the magazine? A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
25|$|By this time, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 27,000 to 30,000 Franco-Italian {{troops in the}} bridgehead. Assembling the available troops, Eugène planned to hurl MacDonald's corps, elements of Durutte's division, and Sahuc's division at the Piavisella line. Off to the right, the viceroy ordered Grenier to pin the left wing of IX Armeekorps at San Michele and Cimadolmo with Pully's and Guérin's cavalry and Abbé's infantry. The French attack got rolling in the late afternoon. Abbé's advance was counterattacked by squadrons of the Archduke Josef Hussar Regiment, the last unbroken Austrian horsemen on the field. Pully and Guérin quickly repulsed the gallant Austrian <b>riposte</b> and Kalnássy evacuated San Michele and Cimadolmo before Grenier's pressure. Kalnássy fell back to Tezze where he sturdily held his ground until evening, suffering 1,200 casualties during the battle.|$|E

25|$|In October 1649, he {{published}} Eikonoklastes, an explicit defence of the regicide, {{in response to}} the Eikon Basilike, a phenomenal best-seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian martyr. Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled Charles II and his party published the defence of monarchy Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo, written by leading humanist Claudius Salmasius. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the Council of State. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a <b>riposte.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{for an early}} date is what some scholars have suggested is an interplay between the Gospel of John and the logia of Thomas. Parallels between the two {{have been taken to}} suggest that Thomas' logia preceded John's work, and that the latter was making a point-by-point <b>riposte</b> to Thomas, either in real or mock conflict. This seeming dialectic has been pointed out by several New Testament scholars, notably Gregory J. Riley, April DeConick, and Elaine Pagels. Though differing in approach, they argue that several verses in the Gospel of John are best understood as responses to a Thomasine community and its beliefs. Pagels, for example, says that John's gospel makes two references to the inability of the world to recognize the divine light. In contrast, several of Thomas' sayings refer to the light born 'within'.|$|E

25|$|Nasser's {{response}} was the nationalization of the Suez Canal. On 26 July, {{in a speech}} in Alexandria, Nasser gave a <b>riposte</b> to Dulles. During his speech he deliberately pronounced the name of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the canal, a code-word for Egyptian forces to seize control of the canal and implement its nationalization. He announced that the Nationalization Law had been published, that all assets of the Suez Canal Company had been frozen, and that stockholders would be paid the price of their shares according to the day's closing price on the Paris Stock Exchange. That same day, Egypt closed the canal to Israeli shipping. Egypt also closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, and blockaded the Gulf of Aqaba, in contravention of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Many argued that this was also a violation of the 1949 Armistice Agreements.|$|E
25|$|Milburn had a {{reputation}} as an all-or-nothing batsman, sparkling centuries alternating with indifferent scores, but by 1966 he had forced himself back into the Test reckoning. Selected for the First Test against the West Indies, he had the most ignominious start for an opener, run out for a first-innings duck. He redeemed himself with 94 in the second innings as England went down to a heavy defeat. An aggressive century (126 not out) helped England to draw the Second Test, and despite standing up courageously to the formidable Caribbean pace attack in the following matches, he was dropped for the final Test, supposedly because his bulk hindered his mobility in the field. Milburn's <b>riposte</b> was typical of the man, an innings of 203 for Northamptonshire against Essex. His swashbuckling season earned him a nomination as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year in the 1967 edition.|$|E
25|$|The USSR did {{establish}} COMECON as a <b>riposte</b> to the Marshall Plan {{to deliver}} aid for Eastern Bloc countries, {{but this was}} complicated by the Soviet efforts to manage their own recovery from the war. The members of Comecon looked to the Soviet Union for oil; in turn, they provided machinery, equipment, agricultural goods, industrial goods, and consumer goods to the Soviet Union. Economic recovery in the East was much slower than in the West, resulting {{in the formation of}} the shortage economies and a gap in wealth between East and West. Finland, which USSR forbade to join the Marshall Plan and which was required to give large reparations to the USSR, saw its economy recover to pre-war levels in 1947. France, which received billions of dollars through the Marshall Plan, similarly saw its average income per person return to almost pre-war level by 1949. By mid-1948 industrial production in Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia had recovered to a level somewhat above pre-war level.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Weston Loomis Pound (30 October 1885– 1 November 1972) was an {{expatriate}} American {{poet and}} critic, {{as well as}} a major figure in the early modernist movement.

The article suggests <b>ripostes</b> to these critiques, <b>ripostes</b> which would invest Everyone with an ontological and a moral existence that is anthropologically persuasive and accord with the ethnographic record.
