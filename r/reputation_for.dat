5|$|The role of cavalry in {{the late}} army {{does not appear to}} have been greatly {{enhanced}} as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2ndcentury and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. However, the cavalry of the Late Roman army was endowed with greater numbers of specialised units, such as extra-heavy shock cavalry (cataphractii and clibanarii) and mounted archers. During the later 4thcentury, the cavalry acquired a <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional <b>reputation</b> <b>for</b> excellence.|$|E

5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work.

40|$|In many organizations, {{employees}} {{move from}} one set of work relationships to another when they change project teams, join interdepartmental task forces, or change jobs through the internal labor market. In such dynamic environments, personal reputations can facilitate or harm an employee 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to build trust among new colleagues. Despite the importance of personal reputations in many workplaces, research has not established a full characterization of the construct. In particular, prior work {{has focused on the}} favorability of the employee 2 ̆ 7 s reputation (i. e., how positive or negative it is) and has paid little attention to other important dimensions, such as scale (how widespread the reputation is) and consensus (how well agreed upon the reputation is). In this dissertation, I argue for a multidimensional perspective of personal reputations that incorporates scale and consensus. Empirically, I examine the relationship between reputation favorability and scale, and the relationship between reputation favorability and consensus. That is, I consider whether positive or negative reputations are more widespread and whether positive or negative reputations are more agreed upon. I examine these relationships <b>for</b> <b>reputations</b> of ability (including <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> communication skills, analytical skills and creativity) and reputations of integrity (including <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> honesty and fairness). I measure employees 2 ̆ 7 reputation favorability, scale and consensus in a study of law firm employees. Regarding scale, I find that, overall, employees with positive ability reputations are better known (have higher scale) than employees with negative ability reputations, and that employees with negative integrity reputations are better known than employees with positive integrity reputations. Regarding consensus, I find that employees with <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> good communication skills have higher consensus reputations than those with <b>reputations</b> <b>for</b> poor communication skills. I also find that employees with dishonest reputations have higher consensus reputations than employees with honest reputations. These results indicate that the reputation dimensions of favorability, scale and consensus will relate to each other in different ways for ability and integrity reputations. ...|$|R
