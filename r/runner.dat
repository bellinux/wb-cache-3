5|$|Several basic {{offensive}} tactics {{come into}} play with a <b>runner</b> on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter: the <b>runner</b> takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating {{a gap in the}} infield for the batter to poke the ball through. The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the <b>runner</b> to advance into scoring position even {{at the expense of the}} batter being thrown out at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, particularly one who is a fast <b>runner,</b> may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) A sacrifice bunt employed with a <b>runner</b> on third base, aimed at bringing that <b>runner</b> home, is known as a squeeze play. With a <b>runner</b> on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the <b>runner</b> to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly. The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch.|$|E
5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} <b>runner</b> who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because the <b>runner</b> is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the <b>runner</b> immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|The tag out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} <b>runner</b> who is touched by a fielder {{with the ball}} or a glove holding the ball, while the <b>runner</b> is not touching a base.|$|E

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a <b>runner</b> subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to credit the batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the <b>runner</b> recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the <b>runner</b> was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E

5|$|Blade <b>Runner</b> {{continues}} to reflect modern trends and concerns, {{and an increasing}} number of critics consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. Blade <b>Runner</b> is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade <b>Runner</b> has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to mention that participation in master ultra-marathoners increased {{and they were able}} to improve their performance although it is known that more master <b>runners</b> become injured than younger <b>runners</b> and more master <b>runners</b> suffered multiple injuries than younger <b>runners</b> (McKean et al. 2006) which might limit their performance. The prevalence of soft-tissue-type injuries to the calf, Achilles tendon, and hamstrings was greater in master <b>runners</b> than in younger <b>runners</b> whereas younger <b>runners</b> suffered more knee and leg injuries than masters <b>runners</b> (McKean et al. 2006). Although running more times per week increased the risk of injury for both younger and master <b>runners</b> (McKean et al. 2006) and overuse injuries of the lower limbs became more common in master <b>runners</b> (Fields 2011), master <b>runners</b> were able to improve performance across years. This was most probably due to differences in training (e.g. training intensities) between younger and master <b>runners</b> (McKean et al. 2006). Master <b>runners</b> may have increased running volume and running intensity. Indeed, a training distance[*]<[*] 40 km a week was predictive for future calf injuries and regular interval training was predictive for future knee injuries (Van Middelkoop et al. 2008).|$|R

5|$|In {{between the}} time Scott {{released}} Alien in 1979 {{and returned to the}} franchise with Prometheus in 2012, he directed another notable science fiction film concerning artificial intelligence, Blade <b>Runner,</b> in 1982. Contrary to the white-blooded androids of Alien that emulate emotions and recognize a disconnect with humanity, Blade <b>Runner</b> features the replicants- enhanced biorobotic humanoids that may only be identified by their lacking emotions. In order to maintain control, the replicants' human creators install false memories that detail entire lives that give them a sense of identity. Blade <b>Runner,</b> a largely influential film, has prompted a slew of philosophical questions concerning artificial intelligence and whether or not an android could truly be considered alive. The film specifically questions whether thoughts, a sense of identity, emotions and consciousness in general, may be something genuine when applied to artificial intelligence. Due to David identifying himself as a living entity - similar to the replicants - film critics in 2012 would come not to only question if Prometheus was a direct prequel to Alien, but if the film had a relation to Blade <b>Runner.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding <b>runner</b> is forced out or if an unforced preceding <b>runner</b> is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast <b>runner,</b> the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced <b>runner</b> from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

40|$|Targeted {{strength}} and conditioning (S&C) programmes can potentially improve performance and reduce injury risk factors in competitive <b>runners.</b> However, S&C practices of distance <b>runners</b> are unknown. This study aimed to explore S&C practices of competitive middle- and long-distance <b>runners</b> and examined whether reported frequency of injuries were influenced by training behaviours. 1883 distance <b>runners</b> (≥ 15 years old) completed an online survey. All <b>runners</b> who raced competitively were included in data analysis (n= 667). Distance <b>runners</b> mainly engaged with S&C activities to lower risk of injury (63. 1 %), and improve performance (53. 8 %). The most common activities utilized were stretching (86. 2 %) and core stability exercises (70. 2 %). Resistance training (RT) and plyometric training (PT) were used by 62. 5 % and 35. 1 % of <b>runners</b> respectively. Junior (under- 20) <b>runners</b> include PT, running drills and circuit training more so than masters <b>runners.</b> Significantly more international standard <b>runner’s</b> engaged in RT, PT and fundamental movement skills training compared to competitive club <b>runners.</b> Middle-distance (800 m- 3000 m) specialists {{were more likely to}} include RT, PT, running drills, circuit training and barefoot exercises in their programme than longer-distance <b>runners.</b> Injury frequency was associated with typical weekly running volume and run frequency.

5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts {{to put out a}}n unforced preceding <b>runner</b> who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to put out a forced preceding <b>runner,</b> and when any fielder attempts and fails to put out an unforced preceding <b>runner</b> who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required to determine whether the batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to put out a preceding <b>runner,</b> that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E

30|$|A third {{important}} {{finding was}} that women and men from Kenya and Ethiopia were the youngest in both half-marathons and marathons. Their mean age is considerably lower as has been reported for elite and recreational marathoners. The age of elite marathoners is at around 29 – 30  years when the nationality was not considered (Hunter et al. 2011). In female and male marathoners competing between 1979 and 2014 in the ‘Stockholm Marathon’, {{the age of the}} fastest marathon performance was even higher with 34.3  ±  2.6  years (Lehto 2015). In a study investigating <b>runners</b> competing in Swiss half-marathons and marathons from 2000 to 2010 and considering the top five African and Non-African <b>runners,</b> {{the mean age of the}} male <b>runners</b> was significantly higher for Non-African <b>runners</b> than for African <b>runners</b> in both half-marathons (Non-African <b>runners</b> 31.1  ±  6.4  years, African <b>runners</b> 26.2  ±  4.9  years) and marathons (Non-African <b>runners</b> 33.0  ±  4.8  years, African <b>runners</b> 28.6  ±  3.8  years). In marathons, the top five female Non-African <b>runners</b> (31.6  ±  4.8  years) were ~ 4  years older than the top five female African <b>runners</b> (27.8  ±  5.3  years) (Aschmann et al. 2013). The difference in age between East Africans and Europeans found in the present study was not in agreement with a previous comparison between African and non-African <b>runners</b> of marathons and half-marathons (Cribari et al. 2013) indicating that the younger age was a specific characteristic of East Africans and should not be generalized to all African <b>runners.</b>|$|R
