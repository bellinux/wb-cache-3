We carried out a dose–response meta-analysis to quantitatively examine the association of circulating 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D) concentration with prostate cancer. Methods: Only prospective studies examining the associations of circulating 25 [OH]D concentration with prostate cancer were eligible for the meta-analysis. A random-effect meta-analysis was done first, to calculate the summary relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the higher concentration with the lower concentration of 25 [OH]D. A dose–response meta-analysis using random-effects model was then carried out to evaluate the nonlinearity and calculate the summary <b>RR</b> <b>caused</b> per 10  ng/mL increment. Results: Nineteen prospective cohort or nested case–control studies were included. Higher 25 [OH]D concentration was significantly correlated with elevated risk of prostate cancer (RR = 1. 15, 95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 24). No nonlinear relationship was found between 25 [OH]D concentration and risk of prostate cancer (P= 0. 654). Dose–response meta-analysis showed that the summary <b>RR</b> <b>caused</b> per 10  ng/mL increment in circulating 25 [OH]D concentration was 1. 04 (95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 06). Subgroup analysis also found a modest dose–response relationship. Funnel plot and Egger’s test did not detect publication bias. Conclusion: The findings suggest that highest 25 [OH]D concentration is correlated with elevated risk of prostate cancer and a modest dose–response effect exists in this association; however, more studies are needed.

The study population consisted of 31 [*] 302 stripping/removal workers in the Great Britain Asbestos Survey, followed up to December 2005. Relative risks (<b>RR)</b> for <b>causes</b> of death with elevated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and sufficient deaths were obtained from Poisson regression.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} a significant association between marital status and mortality risks. However, most of these studies have compared married and unmarried people without differentiating among single, divorced and widowed status. Moreover, gender differences in mortality rates associated with marital status have not been sufficiently clarified. With significant increases in the percentages of divorced and widowed people and a corresponding drop in the marriage rate in Japan {{during the past two}} or three decades, it can be expected that these changes will {{have a significant impact on}} mortality rates. Methods This investigation used a prospective study of a total of 94, 062 Japanese men and women aged 40 – 79 who completed self-administered questionnaires at baseline and during a followed-up of 9. 9 -years. Results Compared with married men, never-married men showed higher risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease [relative risk (RR) = 3. 05, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 03 – 4. 60], respiratory disease (RR = 2. 43, 95 %CI 1. 27 – 4. 63), external <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> = 2. 18, 95 %CI 1. 05 – 4. 54) and all <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> = 1. 91, 95 %CI 1. 51 – 2. 42) after adjustment for potentially confounding variables. For never-married women, there was a smaller but significantly higher risk of mortality from all <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> = 1. 46, 95 %CI 1. 15 – 1. 84). Divorced and widowed men showed moderately higher risks of mortality from cardiovascular disease, external causes and all causes compared with married men, but such a trend was not observed in women. Conclusion Single status was associated with a higher risk of mortality than was married status for both men and women. Divorce and widowhood were associated with elevated risk for men, but not for women. These findings suggest single, divorce and widowhood status constitute potentially adverse health effects. </p...|$|R

Materials and methods: Three hundred and six patients (188 female, 118 male; mean age, 14. 7 years; standard deviation, 5. 6; range, 8. 4 – 47. 2 years) were included in the study. In total, 406 impacted maxillary canines were studied, from 206 patients with unilateral impaction and from 100 patients with bilateral impaction. Initial 2 D panoramic radiography was available, and 3 D CBCT imaging was obtained upon clinical indication. The generated radiographic variables and specific features investigated were collected on 2 D panoramic imaging and were correlated to the presence/absence of RR detected on CBCT. A validation sample consisting of 55 canines from 45 patients with maxillary canine impactions was collected to validate the outcome of the present study. Results: The incidence of RR of the adjacent teeth was 33. 8 %. A prediction model using panoramic images for the possible presence of RR was established [area under the curve (AUC) = 0. 74, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 69 – 0. 79] and validated by applying leave-one-out cross-validation (AUC = 0. 71, 95 % CI: 0. 66 – 0. 77). For the subgroup of presence of severe RR the discriminative ability increased to 0. 80. In this prediction model, patient gender, canine apex, vertical canine crown position, and canine magnification were the strongest predictors for RR. Conclusions: The final prediction model for RR based on available panoramic radiographs could be a helpful tool in justifying the need of additional CBCT examination. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although much {{evidence}} suggests that calcium (Ca 2 +) usually triggers synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release, the role of Ca 2 + in vesicle endocytosis and {{in the delivery of}} fusion-competent vesicles (i. e. mobilisation and/or priming) in nerve terminals remains unclear. To address this issue, we have studied synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured rat neurones under conditions where neurotransmitter release is triggered independently of Ca 2 + using the secretagogue Ruthenium Red (RR). Using a prolonged stimulation protocol, we find that <b>RR</b> <b>causes</b> a rapid increase in neurotransmitter release followed by a gradually decrementing response. In contrast, when release is triggered by moderate membrane depolarisation caused by saline containing 18 mm K+, release is sustained. These observations suggest that when release is triggered independently of a rise in Ca 2 +, endocytosis or vesicle mobilisation/priming are perturbed. Using FM 2 - 10, a fluorescent indicator of synaptic vesicle cycling, we find that neurotransmitter release triggered by RR is accompanied by both uptake and release of this dye, thereby suggesting that vesicle endocytosis is not blocked. To evaluate whether synaptic vesicle mobilisation/priming is perturbed {{in the absence of a}} rise in Ca 2 +, we compared the kinetics of FM 2 - 10 loss during prolonged stimulation. While 18 mm K+ induced gradual and continuous dye loss, RR only induced substantial dye loss during the first minute of stimulation. In the presence of low concentrations of the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin, release <b>caused</b> by <b>RR</b> was prolonged. Taken together, these results provide evidence suggesting that, although a rise in intraterminal Ca 2 + is not required for endocytosis, it is essential for the continuous delivery of fusion-competent vesicles and to maintain neurotransmitter release during prolonged stimulation...|$|R

Propofol has been reformulated in different non-lipid presentations to {{reduce the incidence of}} adverse effects, but those changes can modify its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In the present study, we investigate the pharmacology and toxicology of lipid propofol (CLP) and the non-lipid nanoemulsion (NLP). MethodsConventional lipid formulation of propofol and NLP were infused in the jugular veins of rats and blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) were measured. Both formulations (1 %) were infused (40 μL. min- 1) over 1 hour. Hypnotic and anesthetic doses as well as recoveries were determined. The pain induced by the CLP and NLP vehicles was compared by counting the number of abdominal contortions (“writhing test”) after the intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection in mice. Acetic acid (0. 6 %) was used as positive control. ResultsHypnotic and anesthetic doses of 1 % CLP (6. 0 ± 1. 3 and 17. 8 ± 2. 6 mg. kg- 1, respectively) and 1 % NLP (5. 4 ± 1. 0 and 16. 0 ± 1. 4 mg. kg- 1, respectively) were not significantly different. Recovery from hypnosis and anesthesia was faster with NLP than with CLP. Changes in HR, BP, and <b>RR</b> <b>caused</b> by NLP were not significantly different from those caused by CLP. Acetic acid and the vehicle of CLP caused 46. 0 ± 2. 0 and 12. 5 ± 0. 6 abdominal contortions 20 min after i. p. injection, respectively. The absence of abdominal contractions was observed with the vehicle of NLP. Abdominal inflammatory response was not observed after the i. p. injection of both propofol vehicles.

For detection three treatments were applied to six lots of Pinus taeda seeds, bein four repetitions of 25 seeds: blotter test, paper card and selective medium. The transmission was evaluated in seeds from six lots of Pinus taeda during 60 days counting the percentage of emerged plantlet (EP), non-germinated seeds (NGS) and from NGS seeds with Fusarium spp. A descriptive scale of grades was developed to evaluate the severity of RR in Pinus taeda seedlings. The severity and the incidence of the illness were evaluated at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the inoculation from Pinus taeda seedlings of six months of age. The pathogenicity, severity and incidence of twelve isolated Fusarium subglutinans obtained in the detection test. To test for pathogenicity and aggressiveness 13 treatments with 15 replications were applied. The most sensitive detection method to detect Fusarium spp. on Pinus taeda seeds was the selective medium; transmission was not observed of Fusarium spp. from seeds to the seedlings; the descriptive scale allowed evaluating the progression of RR symptoms; nine isolated of Fusarium spp. were found to be pathogenic to Pinus taeda seedlings, reproducing typical symptoms of RR, being isolated L 3 R 2, the most aggressive and that exhibited higher AUDPC...|$|R
40|$|The oral {{part of the}} pontine reticular {{formation}} (PnO) contributes to the regulation of sleep, anesthesia and pain. The role of PnO γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) in modulating these states remains incompletely understood. The present study used time to loss and time to resumption of righting response (Lo RR and Ro RR) as surrogate measures of loss and resumption of consciousness. This study tested three hypotheses: (i) pharmacologically manipulating GABA levels in rat PnO alters Lo RR, Ro RR and nociception; (ii) propofol decreases GABA levels in the PnO; and (iii) inhibiting GABA synthesis in the PnO blocks hyperalgesia caused by sleep deprivation. Administering a GABA synthesis inhibitor [3 ‐mercaptopropionic acid (3 ‐ MPA) ] or a GABA uptake inhibitor [nipecotic acid (NPA) ] into rat PnO significantly altered Lo <b>RR</b> <b>caused</b> by propofol. 3 ‐ MPA significantly decreased Lo RR for propofol (− 18 %). NPA significantly increased Lo RR during administration of propofol (36 %). Neither 3 ‐ MPA nor NPA altered Ro RR following cessation of propofol or isoflurane delivery. The finding that Lo RR was decreased by 3 ‐ MPA and increased by NPA is consistent with measures showing that extracellular GABA levels in the PnO were decreased (41 %) by propofol. Thermal nociception was significantly decreased by 3 ‐ MPA and increased by NPA, and 3 ‐ MPA blocked the hyperalgesia caused by sleep deprivation. The results demonstrate that GABA levels in the PnO regulate the time for loss of consciousness caused by propofol, extend the concept that anesthetic induction and emergence are not inverse processes, and suggest that GABA ergic transmission in the PnO mediates hyperalgesia caused by sleep loss. The intravenous anesthetic propofol significantly decreases extracellular GABA levels in rat PnO. Pharmacologically increasing or decreasing extracellular GABA levels increases or decreases, respectively, the time to loss of consciousness caused by propofol. GABAergic transmission in the PnO does not modulate the resumption of consciousness after isoflurane‐ and propofol‐anesthesia. Administration of a GABA synthesis inhibitor into the PnO blocks the hyperalgesia caused by sleep deprivation...|$|R

For example, (S),(S) -ethambutol is the drug against tuberculosis, while the mirror image (<b>R),(R)</b> -ethambutol <b>causes</b> blindness. Thus, {{it is essential to}} administer only (S),(S) -ethambutol to the patient and not a mixture of the enantiomers. There are several ways to obtain enantiomers purely, the most common being racemic (as a mixture) synthesis followed by separation of the enantiomers. The traditional separation methods have their limitations and {{there is a need for}} new technology. In this thesis, research on enantioselective liquid-liquid extraction, a promising technology for separation of enantiomers, is discussed. Hereto, the racemate is dissolved in a suitable solvent and contacted with a second, immiscible liquid with therein the host or extractant. This host selectively binds one of the enantiomers. After separation of the liquids, both are enriched in one of the enantiomers. A centrifugal contactor separator (CCS) was used for the process. The results show that the compact CCS equipment is very suitable for continuous operation of the enantioselective extractions. The main strength of using continuous CCS equipment is that for initial screening and kilogram scale production the same equipment can be applied. ...|$|R

For veterinary care events (morbidity) GSDs were most over-represented for immunological disease, with a relative risk (RR) of 2. 7, compared with the risk in all other breeds combined. The most common disease category (morbidity) in GSDs was skin disorders with an incidence rate of 346. 8 cases per 10, 000 dog years at risk. The highest <b>RR</b> for <b>cause</b> of death in GSDs compared with all other breeds was for skin conditions (RR= 7. 8). Locomotor disorders were {{the most common cause of}} death in GSDs. The GSD is predisposed to immune-related disorders, such as allergies, circumanal fistulae and exocrine pancreatic atrophy, with significantly increased risk compared with all other breeds...|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised {{about the safety of}} the {{electromagnetic}} (microwave) emissions of radars, as well as about the ionizing radiation that is emitted on short distances (< 2 m) by devices in the radars producing the microwaves. We retrospectively compared the cause specific mortality of 4, 417 Belgian professional male military personnel who served in anti-aircraft radar units in Germany between 1963 and 1994 to the cause specific mortality of 2, 932 Belgian military personnel who served {{at the same time in}} the same place in battalions not equipped with radars. Mean follow-up was 26 years in the 2 groups. Age-adjusted rate ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals were derived from a Poisson regression model. Four hundred twenty-four deaths in the battalions groups and 271 deaths in the control battalions occurred (RR = 1. 04 (0. 96 - 1. 14)). For specific <b>causes</b> of deaths, <b>RRs</b> were 1. 22 (1. 03 - 1. 47) for neoplasms and 3. 51 (1. 19 - 10. 3) for symptoms, signs and ill defined conditions. <b>RRs</b> for other <b>causes</b> of death were not significantly different from 1. 00. Among deaths from neoplasms, RR for hemolymphatic cancer was 7. 22 (1. 09 - 47. 9). <b>RRs</b> for other <b>causes</b> of cancer deaths were not significantly different from 1. 00. The results for specific tumor types were all based on very small numbers. The RR for cancer increased with decreasing age and suggested that the RR for cancer increased with the duration of stay in radar battalions. In conclusion, exposure of professional military personnel to anti-aircraft radars that existed in Western Europe from the 1960 s until the 1990 s may have resulted in an increase in the incidence of hemolymphatic cancers. It remains to be established whether this increase is due to microwaves generated by radars or ionizing radiation produced by electronic devices producing the microwaves.

40|$|Percolation {{theory is}} an {{approach}} to study vulnerability of a system. We develop analytical framework and analyze percolation properties of a network composed of interdependent networks (NetONet). Typically, percolation of a single network shows that the damage in the network due to a failure is a continuous function of the fraction of failed nodes. In sharp contrast, in NetONet, due to the cascading failures, the percolation transition may be discontinuous and even a single node failure may lead to abrupt collapse of the system. We demonstrate our general framework for a NetONet composed of n classic Erdős-Rényi (ER) networks, where each network depends on the same number m of other networks, i. e., a random regular network of interdependent ER networks. In contrast to a treelike NetONet in which {{the size of the}} largest connected cluster (mutual component) depends on n, the loops in the <b>RR</b> NetONet <b>cause</b> the largest connected cluster to depend only on m. We also analyzed the extremely vulnerable feedback condition of coupling. In the case of ER networks, the NetONet only exhibits two phases, a second order phase transition and collapse, and there is no first phase transition regime unlike the no feedback condition. In the case of NetONet composed of RR networks, there exists a first order phase transition when q is large and second order phase transition when q is small. Our results can help in designing robust interdependent systems. Comment: 31 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} {{relation}} between changes in body weight and subsequent mortality. DESIGN: Prospective follow-up study. SETTING: Population study. SUBJECTS: 6441 men aged 40 - 59 y at baseline participating in the European cohorts of the Seven Countries Study. The men were divided into groups depending on their weight pattern ascertained from three weight measurements with intervals of 5 years. They were also divided in quartiles according {{to the degree of}} weight variability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause and cause-specific mortality during 15 years following the last weight measurement. Deaths occurring during the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded. RESULTS: Significantly elevated hazard ratios (RR) for death from all <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> = 1. 3; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 2 - 1. 5), all cardiovascular diseases (RR = 1. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 5) and other <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> = 1. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 2. 2) were found for men with a decreasing weight compared with men with a constant weight. A fluctuating weight was associated with an increased risk of all <b>cause</b> mortality (<b>RR</b> = 1. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 4), coronary heart disease (RR = 1. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 1. 9) and myocardial infarction (RR = 1. 5; 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 2. 2). The group of men with an increasing body weight also had elevated hazard ratios for dying from coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, but these were only significant when the total 15 -year follow-up was analyzed. The risks of dying from all-causes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other causes were increased in the upper quartile versus the lower quartile of weight variability. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of the present study}} show that a decreasing and a fluctuating body weight are associated with increased mortality. An average increase of 7 kg body weight was associated with an elevated risk of dying from coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. Lowest mortality in these middle-aged men was found in those who maintained a constant body weight...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{estimate}} {{the risk of death}} and recurrent myocardial infarction {{associated with the use of}} calcium antagonists after myocardial infarction in a population-based cohort study. Background. Calcium antagonists are commonly prescribed after myocardial infarction, but their long-term effects are not well established. Methods. Patients 25 to 69 years old with a suspected myocardial infarction were identified and followed up through a community-based register of myocardial infarction and cardiac death (part of the World Health Organization Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease [MONICA] Project in Newcastle, Australia). Data were collected by review of medical records, in-hospital interview and review of death certificates. Results. From 1989 to 1993, 3, 982 patients with a nonfatal suspected myocardial infarction were enrolled in the study. At hospital discharge, 1, 001 patients were treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, 923 with calcium antagonists, 711 with both beta-blockers and calcium antagonists and 1, 346 with neither drug. Compared with patients given beta-blockers, patients given calcium antagonists were more likely to suffer myocardial infarction or cardiac death (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 to 1. 9), cardiac death (RR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 2. 7) and death from all <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 2. 6). Compared with patients given neither beta-blockers nor calcium antagonists, patients given calcium antagonists were not at increased risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death (RR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 3), cardiac death (RR 0. 9, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 2) or death from all <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 7 to 1. 3). No excess in risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death was observed among patients taking verapamil (RR 0. 9, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 6), diltiazem (RR 1. 1, 95 % CI 0. 8 to 1. 4) or nifedipine (RR 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 7 to 2. 2) compared with patients taking neither calcium antagonists nor beta-blockers. Conclusions. These results are consistent with randomized trial data showing benefit from beta-blockers after myocardial infarction and no effect on the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and death with the use of calcium antagonists. Comparisons between beta-blockers and calcium antagonists favor beta-blockers because of the beneficial effects of beta-blockers and not because of adverse effects of calcium antagonists...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lowering of LDL {{cholesterol}} {{with standard}} statin regimens {{reduces the risk}} of occlusive vascular events {{in a wide range of}} individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with statin therapy. METHODS: We undertook meta-analyses of individual participant data from randomised trials involving at least 1000 participants and at least 2 years' treatment duration of more versus less intensive statin regimens (five trials; 39   612 individuals; median follow-up 5 · 1 years) and of statin versus control (21 trials; 129   526 individuals; median follow-up 4 · 8 years). For each type of trial, we calculated not only the average risk reduction, but also the average risk reduction per 1 · 0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction at 1 year after randomisation. FINDINGS: In the trials of more versus less intensive statin therapy, the weighted mean further reduction in LDL cholesterol at 1 year was 0 · 51 mmol/L. Compared with less intensive regimens, more intensive regimens produced a highly significant 15 % (95 % CI 11 - 18; p< 0 · 0001) further reduction in major vascular events, consisting of separately significant reductions in coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction of 13 % (95 % CI 7 - 19; p< 0 · 0001), in coronary revascularisation of 19 % (95 % CI 15 - 24; p< 0 · 0001), and in ischaemic stroke of 16 % (95 % CI 5 - 26; p= 0 · 005). Per 1 · 0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, these further reductions in risk were similar to the proportional reductions in the trials of statin versus control. When both types of trial were combined, similar proportional reductions in major vascular events per 1 · 0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction were found in all types of patient studied (rate ratio [RR] 0 · 78, 95 % CI 0 · 76 - 0 · 80; p< 0 · 0001), including those with LDL cholesterol lower than 2 mmol/L on the less intensive or control regimen. Across all 26 trials, all-cause mortality was reduced by 10 % per 1 · 0 mmol/L LDL reduction (RR 0 · 90, 95 % CI 0 · 87 - 0 · 93; p< 0 · 0001), largely reflecting significant reductions in deaths due to coronary heart disease (RR 0 · 80, 99 % CI 0 · 74 - 0 · 87; p< 0 · 0001) and other cardiac <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> 0 · 89, 99 % CI 0 · 81 - 0 · 98; p= 0 · 002), with no significant effect on deaths due to stroke (RR 0 · 96, 95 % CI 0 · 84 - 1 · 09; p= 0 · 5) or other vascular <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> 0 · 98, 99 % CI 0 · 81 - 1 · 18; p= 0 · 8). No significant effects were observed on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular <b>causes</b> (<b>RR</b> 0 · 97, 95 % CI 0 · 92 - 1 · 03; p= 0 · 3) or on cancer incidence (RR 1 · 00, 95 % CI 0 · 96 - 1 · 04; p= 0 · 9), even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations. INTERPRETATION: Further reductions in LDL cholesterol safely produce definite further reductions in the incidence of heart attack, of revascularisation, and of ischaemic stroke, with each 1 · 0 mmol/L reduction reducing the annual rate of these major vascular events by just over a fifth. There was no evidence of any threshold within the cholesterol range studied, suggesting that reduction of LDL cholesterol by 2 - 3 mmol/L would reduce risk by about 40 - 50 %.

50|$|Hubble's {{skepticism}} about the universe being too small, dense, and young {{turned out to be}} based on an observational error. Later investigations appeared to show that Hubble had confused distant H II regions for Cepheid variables and the Cepheid variables themselves had been inappropriately lumped together with low-luminosity <b>RR</b> Lyrae stars <b>causing</b> calibration errors that led to a value of the Hubble Constant of approximately 500 km/s/Mpc instead of the true value of approximately 70 km/s/Mpc. The higher value meant that an expanding universe would have an age of 2 billion years (younger than the Age of the Earth) and extrapolating the observed number density of galaxies to a rapidly expanding universe implied a mass density that was too high by a similar factor, enough to force the universe into a peculiar closed geometry which also implied an impending Big Crunch that would occur on a similar time-scale. After fixing these errors in the 1950s, the new lower values for the Hubble Constant accorded with the expectations of an older universe and the density parameter was found to be fairly close to a geometrically flat universe.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Examining the {{association}} between socioeconomic disadvantage and heat-related emergency department (ED) visits during heatwave periods in Brisbane, 2000 – 2008. Methods: Data from 10 public EDs were analysed using a generalised additive model for disease categories, age groups and gender. Results: Cumulative relative risks (<b>RR)</b> for non-external <b>causes</b> other than cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were 1. 11 and 1. 05 in most and least disadvantaged areas, respectively. The pattern persisted on lags 0 – 2. Elevated risks were observed for all age groups above 15 years in all areas. However, with RRs of 1. 19 – 1. 28, the 65 – 74 years age group in more disadvantaged areas stood out, compared with RR= 1. 08 in less disadvantaged areas. This pattern was observed on lag 0 but did not persist. The RRs for male presentations were 1. 10 and 1. 04 in most and less disadvantaged areas; for females, RR was 1. 04 in less disadvantaged areas. This pattern persisted across lags 0 – 2. Conclusions: Heat-related ED visits increased during heatwaves. However, due to overlapping confidence intervals, variations across socioeconomic areas should be interpreted cautiously.

40|$|Background: Folic acid {{is widely}} used to lower {{homocysteine}} concentrations and prevent adverse cardiovascular outcomes. However, the effect of folic acid on cardiovascular events is not clear at the present time. We carried out a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of folic acid supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes. Methodology and Principal Findings: We systematically searched Medline, EmBase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of articles, and proceedings of major meetings for relevant literature. We included randomized placebo-controlled trials that reported {{on the effects of}} folic acid on cardiovascular events compared to placebo. Of 1594 identified studies, we included 16 trials reporting data on 44841 patients. These studies reported 8238 major cardiovascular events, 2001 strokes, 2917 myocardial infarctions, and 6314 deaths. Folic acid supplementation as compared to placebo had no effect on major cardiovascular events (RR, 0. 98; 95 % CI, 0. 93 – 1. 04), stroke (RR, 0. 89; 95 % CI, 0. 78 – 1. 01), myocardial infarction (RR, 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 93 – 1. 07), or deaths from any <b>cause</b> (<b>RR,</b> 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 96 – 1. 05).

40|$|Background: It is {{not known}} whether chronic or past {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection contributes to the high mortality rate in hemodialysis patients. Methods: This prospective study of 1077 adult hemodialysis patients without hepatitis B virus infection used Poisson regression analysis to estimate crude and sex- and age-adjusted rates (per 1000 patient-years) of all-cause, cardiovascular, infectious disease-related and liver disease-related mortality in patients negative for HCV antibody (group A), patients positive for HCV antibody and negative for anti-HCV core antigen (group B), and patients positive for anti-HCV core antigen (group C). The relative risks (<b>RRs)</b> for each <b>cause</b> of death in group B vs group C as compared with those in group A were also estimated by Poisson regression analysis after multivariate adjustment.

40|$|VNNs (vanins) are pantetheinases that {{hydrolyse}} pantetheine to {{pantothenic acid}} and cysteamine. Studies with Vnn 1 -knockout mice have indicated a role of VNN- 1 in inflammation and stress responses. VNN- 1 is highly expressed in liver and is under transcriptional control of PPAR (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor) -alpha and nutritional status, suggesting {{a role in}} energy metabolism. Recently, the specific substrates and inhibitors of VNNs were obtained as tools to study VNN biology and to investigate whether VNNs are potential drug targets. Oral administration of RR 6, a pantothenone with nanomolar anti-VNN potency, completely inhibited plasma VNN activity in rats and showed favourable pharmacokinetics. Prolonged <b>RR</b> 6 administration <b>caused</b> alterations of hepatic and plasma lipid concentrations upon fasting. VNN inhibitors were found to protect pantothenamides (pantetheine analogues with antibiotic activity) against breakdown by plasma VNN, thereby preserving their antibiotic activity.
