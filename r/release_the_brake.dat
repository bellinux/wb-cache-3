25|$|On 14 September 2011, {{a report}} in the {{newspaper}} Moskovsky Komsomolets, quoting a source in the aviation industry, claimed that the parking brake of the aircraft was on during the take-off, which significantly slowed it down and prevented it from accelerating properly. According to this theory, the captain had turned over control to the co-pilot before take-off, as he was not feeling well. As it is the captain's duty to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> the co-pilot may not have been aware that it had not been done, or had forgotten to do so. Another newspaper, Lifenews.ru, reported that investigators were investigating the pilots' professional history, and that the pilots did not have sufficient experience on the Yak-42.|$|E
25|$|The {{company had}} a strict policy {{that they would}} not {{purchase}} any horses that were broke. The company wanted their horses trained exclusively for staging, a process that generally took three months, even then they were never truly broken and had to be expertly handled. A hostler would lead the teams out to the stages only once the baggage had been secured and the passengers and driver were safely seated. Once harnessed to the stage, the reins were given to the driver and he could <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> The stage horses often leaped and reared {{at the start of a}} trip, but settled into a smooth trot once they were underway. The whip rarely had to be used to encourage them, as they knew the next station meant a good feed and a warm stable.|$|E
25|$|A rescue {{train was}} {{attempting}} to connect to the stalled train when the driver was told to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> even though coupling had not been successful. It was then that the empty train began to roll backwards at a speed of ten metres per second and into the other train, which was carrying passengers. Therefore, {{it was believed that}} the incident was caused by negligence due to insufficient training of operation staff. This accident caused damage to both trainsets, with heavily damaged areas limited to the two cars that collided. From the extent of the damage, investigators estimated the collision speed to be around 60km/h. However, one train, which was rebuilt from the repair of the minor-damaged cars, was already fitted for operation at the end of 2006 and the remaining one was still under heavy repair until mid of 2007; it was released into service in October, 2007. The cost resulting from the accident might be a much higher figure than BMCL quoted, and it was expected to be at least 400 million baht, which was totally insured by a local insurance company.|$|E

25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> by operating <b>the</b> locomotive <b>brake</b> valve, <b>the</b> train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its <b>brake</b> cylinder. When <b>the</b> engine operator <b>releases</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> <b>the</b> locomotive <b>brake</b> valve portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge the contents of <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder to <b>the</b> atmosphere, <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> and recharging <b>the</b> reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|Release valves are {{provided}} {{on the brake}} cylinders; when operated, usually by manually pulling a cord near the cylinder, air is admitted to {{the upper part of}} the brake cylinder on that vehicle. This is necessary to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> on a vehicle that has been uncoupled from a train and now requires to be moved without having a brake connection to another locomotive, for example if it is to be shunted.|$|E
50|$|The Cornering Challenge is a {{challenge}} where contestants must drive towards a wall of foam blocks at high speed before braking hard, releasing the brake, and then {{turning away from the}} wall. The lesson in this challenge is to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> so as to not lose steering input to the car when it is needed. In some years, a large wet tarp may also be laid out on {{the ground in front of}} the wall, to simulate icy or slippery conditions.|$|E
50|$|Valve and Pump SystemsThe {{main parts}} which {{are part of}} the {{pressure}} modulation system are solenoid inlet and outlet valves, a pump, motor and accumulators/reservoirs. The number of the valves differs from model to model due to additional functionalities and the number of brake channels. Based on the input of the ECU, coils operate the in- and outlet valves. During pressure <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> fluid is stored in accumulators. In this open system approach the fluid is then brought back in the brake circuit via a pump operated by a motor which is felt through pulsation on the brake lever.|$|E
50|$|Press reports at {{the time}} stated that a six-year boy had got into the cab of the {{locomotive}} and accidentally <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{cases where}} City Safety has stopped the vehicle, it will then <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> after about 2 seconds {{and the driver}} must apply <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> to keep <b>the</b> vehicle at a standstill.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recorded}} {{that a young}} man called Frank Elrington was on one occasion on the piston carriage, which was not attached to <b>the</b> train. On <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> <b>the</b> light vehicle shot off at high speed, covering the distance in 75 seconds, averaging 65 mph.|$|R

5000|$|... for {{the same}} reason, on a very long train, a {{considerable}} volume of air has {{to be admitted to}} the train pipe to make a full brake application, and a considerable volume has to be exhausted to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> (if for example a signal at danger is suddenly lowered and the driver requires to resume speed); while the air is traveling along the train pipe, the brake pistons {{at the head of the}} train have responded to the brake application or release, but those at the tail will respond much later, leading to undesirable longitudinal forces in the train. In extreme cases this has led to breaking couplings and causing the train to divide.|$|E
50|$|The {{company had}} a strict policy {{that they would}} not {{purchase}} any horses that were broke. The company wanted their horses trained exclusively for staging, a process that generally took three months, even then they were never truly broken and had to be expertly handled.

50|$|American and {{continental}} European practice {{had long}} favoured compressed air <b>brake</b> systems, <b>the</b> leading pattern being a proprietary Westinghouse system. This {{has a number}} of advantages, including smaller brake cylinders (because higher air pressure could be used) and a somewhat more responsive <b>braking</b> effort. However, <b>the</b> system requires an air pump. On steam engines this was usually a reciprocating steam pump, which was quite bulky. Its distinctive shape and the characteristic puffing sound when <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is <b>released</b> (as <b>the</b> train pipe has to be recharged with air) make steam locomotives fitted with <b>the</b> Westinghouse <b>brake</b> unmistakable. Another disadvantage of <b>the</b> earlier air <b>brake</b> systems (although later overcome) was {{that it was impossible to}} make a partial <b>release.</b> <b>The</b> vacuum <b>brake</b> can very simply be partially released by restoring some (but not all) of the vacuum, without having to fully <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>The</b> original air <b>brake</b> systems, on <b>the</b> other hand, did not allow this, the only way of partially <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> being to fully release it, then re-apply it to the desired setting.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{customers}} have reported safety problems with the antilock brakes: after an emergency braking event, and once <b>the</b> driver has <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pedal, <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> remain in full force for some amount of time, increasing the risk of rear collisions.|$|R
50|$|Braking systems include, {{other than}} <b>the</b> regenerative/rheostat <b>braking,</b> disc-type brakes {{activated}} by compressed air to completely immobilize the locomotive when stationary. If this condition lasts for a prolonged time air may run out thereby <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{in which case}} <b>the</b> spring <b>brake</b> is activated.|$|R
50|$|Slack action {{creates a}} danger of {{accident}} as {{the length of a}} train increases. This is particularly the case when a train stops in a siding and is more or less compressed. Then the driver will <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> while standing, while the locomotive direct brake applied and the train will stretch backwards and will possibly foul the switch/points behind the train. There have been very serious incidents with this effect. Slack action also can lead to severe longitudinal forces in a train that can result in a divided train. While accidents from slack action do occur in the operation of passenger trains, they are not of sufficient severity to cause serious injury or damage, regardless of train length. The draft gear of modern couplers is designed to reduce slack action over older technology, such as link and pin connections.|$|E
50|$|Challenger Challenge: Icy Corner - After {{a lesson}} on {{collision}} avoidance, the icy corner must be tackled at 50 km/h. Contestants have three attempts at the corner before failing. Sly releases the brake too late, and hits the wall in all three attempts. After this, Andrew voices his opinion that Sly's driving is showing no signs of improvement, {{and that he should}} seriously consider giving up driving permanently; a point which Andrew would continue to make {{until the end of the}} season. Tab goes over-speed (at 60 km/h) during all three of her runs, and hits the wall each time. Afiya brakes too soon and takes up the tarp in her first attempt, and hits the wall in her other two attempts. Shirley also pulls up the tarp too soon in her second attempt, and in all three attempts she does not <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and hit the wall. As for Aaron, he passes on his first try.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> chain <b>brake</b> {{was soon}} {{superseded}} by air operated or vacuum operated brakes. These brakes used hoses connecting all the wagons of a train, so the driver could apply or <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> {{with a single}} valve in the locomotive.|$|R
60|$|The man and {{the woman}} shifted their hands accordingly, tightly {{gripping}} the sides of the car, and Jerry slowly and carefully <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake.</b> <b>The</b> drum began to revolve as the endless cable passed round it, and the car slid slowly out into the chasm, its trolley wheels rolling on the stationary cable overhead, to which it was suspended.|$|R

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 11 May 1887, an express train crashed into the rear of a {{passenger}} train between Prahran and Windsor stations. Four {{people were killed and}} over 100 severely injured. The locomotive of the passenger train stopped to await a semaphore signal that indicated the line ahead was clear. When the signal was given, the driver found he could not <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> on the locomotive due to a ruptured steam pipe. An express train from Melbourne was scheduled 10 minutes behind the passenger train, and due to a curve in the track and high embankments {{had no way of knowing}} the train ahead was stranded. Cooper (1924) reported that the noise of the impact could be heard throughout Prahran, and that in a short time over 10,000 people were gathered at the site. The driver of the Brighton express was Frederick William Maskell, who only weeks earlier, had received from the Commissioners a special reward of £5 for conspicuous and alert and intelligence in adverting an accident due to signal failure. Others killed were his fireman James Houston McNab and William Runting aged 21 and Annie Foster aged 45 of Colac.|$|E
50|$|Worried, Layne goes to bed. His wife is {{concerned}} at his distanced behavior, and she urges {{him to tell}} her what's wrong. Layne tells his wife of his childhood, and the local ice-cream man named Buster (William Forsythe). He was a decent soul who drove an ice-cream truck and wore a clown suit. He was a friend to the kids. The neighborhood bully, Virgil Constance (Samuel Patrick Chu) began taunting him, pulling off his clown nose to reveal a burnt stub - Buster had no real nose. Layne ends the story there, stating that one day, Buster simply died. He gets a phone call and arrives {{at the scene of}} Toot's death - his clothes in a pile of something gooey. Layne's wife demands to know what part of the story he omitted. Distressed, Layne tells her that Virgil planned a prank on Buster that one of them would <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> on his truck and make it roll down the hill. Virgil forced Layne to pull the brake, and the truck began rolling straight towards Buster. Too busy picking up fallen coins to notice, Buster was run over by the truck and killed.|$|E
50|$|Camaro Challenge: Icy Corner: The {{objective}} of this challenge is to approach a simulated icy corner at 50 km/h, brake sharply to slow the car down, and gradually <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> to negotiate the corner without skidding. Each driver has five runs. Before his first run, Kevin reveals to Andrew that he uses a walkie-talkie in his car to get directions from Lenny, and despite acknowledging it {{as a factor in}} the accident he suffered in the previous year, he still defends it as being a good idea, much to Andrew's exasperation. Kevin subsequently has to be guided throughout the challenge, as Lenny calls out his speed and tells him when to brake on every run, but Kevin fails each time due to driving too fast and/or braking too late, along with not looking where he wants to go. Bizarrely, Dale remembers that she passed the challenge in Canada's Worst Driver 6, but completely forgets that Philippe taught her a lesson on how to complete the challenge minutes beforehand, much to Andrew's concern. She fails her first two runs due to braking too late, and on the third run she successfully completes the challenge, but the experts refuse to acknowledge this as a pass since Danny guided her during every step of the run. Michael passes with ease on his first go, correctly remembering to look where he wants to go. In each of his runs, Shelby locks up the brakes and fails to look where he wants to go; on top of that he goes too slowly in his final run, failing all five. Sly drives far too fast (at 70 km/h) in his first three runs and fails each time. Prior to his fourth run Andrew and Fred decide to tell him about this, but he still drives slightly too fast on his remaining two runs, failing them both.|$|E
50|$|On 4 April of {{the same}} year, the pilots of an Air Ukraine Antonov An-26 (registered UR-26049) tried to take off from Palana Airport without having <b>released</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>The</b> {{aircraft}} thus {{was not able to}} get airborne, and overshot the runway, being damaged beyond economical repair. The nine persons that had been on the chartered flight to Ust-Pakhachi Airport survived the accident.|$|R
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{higher than that of}} the reservoir, the triple valve connects the train line to the reservoir feed, causing the air pressure in the reservoir to increase. The triple valve also causes <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder to be exhausted to <b>the</b> atmosphere, <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> normal <b>braking</b> {{system of}} freight trains {{is based on}} {{depression}} of a single brake pipe and its slow propagation {{towards the end of}} the train, successively putting all distributors into service when they detect the pressure drop. For that reason, the last wagons are still busy running while the first wagons are trying to stop, creating longitudinal compression forces that increase the risk of derailment. The time taken to brake a freight train is therefore quite long compared to a passenger train. At the same time as <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes,</b> it is necessary to refill <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pipe, until nominal pressure for each wagon to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> is reached. <b>The</b> time to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> is also quite extended. An improved braking system is therefore vital from a freight operator and infrastructure manager point of view, though a more drastic remedy would be to abolish this braking system and change to a high performance system that includes electro‐pneumatic brakes, regenerative brakes and disc <b>brakes</b> [24, 33]. <b>The</b> operation of a higher speed freight train would imply the ability to exploit train paths of passenger train quality, in terms of acceleration, braking and line speed, and minimising the impact on following trains.|$|R
50|$|Mustang Challenge: The Icy Corner: In what is {{considered}} one of the most critical challenges taught on the show, the drivers are given a lesson in how to correctly navigate around an icy corner, and then have to get the Mustang through a simulated icy corner. Each driver will have five attempts. Tyler is up first, and surprises Andrew by revealing that he disabled the anti-lock braking system on his car at home (despite the increased chance of an accident) because he didn't like the jerky feeling on the brakes, causing Tim to point out that this proves Tyler has a habit of braking too harshly. Tyler subsequently fails his first two runs by forgetting to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> his third and fourth by over-steering, and his final run by speeding. Daniella badly over-steers on all five runs, and also releases the brake too late on most of her attempts, causing her to fail. Lou's scheduled five attempts aren't shown, but they all end in failure (implied to be the result of taking the corner too tight), causing Andrew to allow her an extra run in which he walks her through each of the steps required, after which she succeeds. Mike, in stark contrast to the episode's first challenge, drives far too fast on his first run and is left with no time to carry out the manoeuvre. He fails his next three attempts by staring at the wall and under-steering, and his final attempt by pumping the brakes. Krystal fails her first two runs by speeding and pumping the brakes, and then the next two by steering erratically. Determined to see at least one person pass, Andrew gets in the car with Krystal, and while her final run is the best of the day, it still narrowly ends in failure when she momentarily steers in the wrong direction near the end of the corner, sending her into the wall. This leaves Andrew frustrated that everyone failed the challenge, and even more so that Krystal was so near, yet so far from passing.|$|E
30|$|Perplexing is {{the fact}} that PD- 1 and CTLA- 4 {{checkpoint}} inhibitors, even when helped by cancer vaccines, are not effective against all cancer types, nor do they work in every patient with the same cancer. Perhaps other immune cell types are negatively affecting cancer immunotherapy? The explanation we put forward to explain this dilemma is that in some cancers we have the machinery (the car) on a downhill slope, so if we <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> (immune checkpoint inhibitors) the car can move. In contrast, when we are on an uphill slope or on a plain field, releasing the brake simply does not move the car. For such scenarios, we have to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> and push the accelerator.|$|E
30|$|Taken {{together}} these results clearly indicated that self-immune tolerance is maintained and regulated by multiple mechanisms, including similarity with self-antigens, regulatory immune cells, a suppressive versus activating cytokine balance and immune checkpoints. Thus, if {{this process is}} to be effectively manipulated in order to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake,</b> we have to stimulate APCs with an antigen significantly different from “self” to recruit effector cells, balance cytokines to obtain a pro-inflammatory milieu, and finally, inhibit immune checkpoints to avoid tolerance.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Westinghouse Air <b>Brake</b> has <b>the</b> additional {{enhancement of}} a triple valve, and local reservoirs on each wagon that enable <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> {{to be applied}} fully with only a slight reduction in air pressure, reducing {{the time that it}} takes to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> as not all pressure is voided to the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|The Westinghouse {{system uses}} air {{pressure}} to charge air reservoirs (tanks) on each car. Full air pressure signals each car to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> A reduction {{or loss of}} air pressure signals each car to apply its <b>brakes,</b> using <b>the</b> compressed air in its reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|When a skid developed, {{the wheel}} would stop, {{stopping}} the drum along with it. The flywheel, {{driven by the}} one-way clutch, continued to spin. If the relative angle between the drum and flywheel reached 60 degrees, the drum would be driven forward to press on a valve. This released brake fluid into a reservoir, lowering hydraulic pressure, and <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>brakes.</b> As soon as the drum started spinning again and reached the (slowing) speed of the flywheel, <b>the</b> valve was <b>released</b> and <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> re-applied. <b>The</b> system could cycle about ten times a second, and could hold <b>the</b> <b>brakes</b> off for up to four seconds in total before the reservoir filled.|$|R
