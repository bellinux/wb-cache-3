40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question as}} to whether a federal court has the authority to compel a pharmaceutical company to disgorge profits obtained from an alleged violation of the FDCA, specifically the failure of a pharmaceutical company to comply with current good manufacturing practices (GMPs). Section II of this article summarizes the article to which we are responding. In all fairness, it did not purport to be a full-blown defense, and we expect the agency 2 ̆ 7 s comprehensive defense of disgorgement would be considerably more detailed. Section III turns to the Sixth Circuit case on which FDA rests its argument for disgorgement, and explains why the case does not support disgorgement for distribution of drugs manufactured in a facility that is not fully GMP- compliant. Section IV returns to 2 ̆ 2 first principles 2 ̆ 2 and demonstrates that neither the text nor the legislative history of the FDCA supports a statutory disgorgement remedy. Section V explains that, while a court may fashion equitable remedies to effect the purposes of a <b>remedial</b> <b>statute,</b> courts have in fact been cautious about ordering any nonstatutory remedy in cases arising under the FDCA, in part because the statute already contains an elaborate remedial scheme. It further explains that the limited jurisprudence permitting equitable disgorgement in lawsuits brought under remedial statutes cannot logically be applied to GMP violations. We conclude that FDA has, without congressional approval or judicial review, forced several companies to agree to a remedy that Congress never intended and that a court would not order...|$|E
40|$|Congress {{enacted the}} Employee Retiree Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to protect {{employees}} 2 ̆ 7 retirement and welfare benefits. Nevertheless, the Act {{has been interpreted}} by the U. S Supreme Court {{over the years to}} be in essence an Employers 2 ̆ 7 Security Act, with employers using ERISA to shield themselves against employee benefit-related claims. The flaw in the current ERISA scheme lies at the intersection of ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s preemption and remedial provisions. Courts broadly interpret the preemption provisions of ERISA to invalidate employee benefits-related state laws and then force employees to depend on an inadequate, 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive and reticulated 2 ̆ 2 remedial scheme. This “intersectionality” problem leads to a state of affairs that is contrary to ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s purpose of protecting the interests of participants and beneficiaries by 2 ̆ 2 providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts. 2 ̆ 2 To cure what currently ails ERISA, this article proposes three alternative reforms - one judicial and two legislative. The judicial approach would call for the Court to adopt a remedialist approach, which would be in line both with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s intent to incorporate most of the common law of trusts into ERISA, and also consistent with a modern interpretation of a <b>remedial</b> <b>statute.</b> Additionally, Congress should re-examine and reject the far-fetched analogy between ERISA, enacted in 1974, and the 2 ̆ 2 days of the divided bench 2 ̆ 2 analysis and provide an express and expansive definition for 2 ̆ 2 appropriate equitable relief 2 ̆ 2 under proposed Section 3 (43). Finally, Congress should pass an ERISA Civil Rights Act under proposed Section 502 (a) (11), which, like the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in the Title VII context, would permit capped, compensatory and punitive damage awards in appropriate cases...|$|E
40|$|Section 1983 {{no longer}} {{serves as a}} <b>remedial</b> <b>statute</b> for the people {{most in need of}} its protection. Those who have {{suffered}} a violation of their civil rights at the hands of state authorities, but who cannot afford a lawyer because they have only modest damages or seek only equitable remedies, are foreclosed from relief because lawyers shun their cases. Today civil rights plaintiffs are treated the same as ordinary tort plaintiffs by the private bar: without high damages, civil rights plaintiffs are denied access to the courts because no one will represent them. Congress understood that civil rights laws are only as good as their enforcement. When Congress passed the Civil Rights Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s Fees Awards Act of 1976, it wanted to ensure that meritorious claims would be heard and that all illegal conduct would be deterred. The enforcement mechanism that Congress chose-fee-shifting-guaranteed access to the courts even when damages were modest or the form of relief was equitable. So-called 2 ̆ 2 private attorneys general 2 ̆ 2 would accept all meritorious claims, knowing that if they won they would be paid by the liable defendants at reasonable market rates pursuant to the fee-shifting provisions of the law. In 1986, however, in Evans v. Jeff D., the U. S. Supreme Court allowed defendants to condition settlement of civil rights cases on the waiver or reduction of plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 attorney 2 ̆ 7 s fees. Two decades later, it is evident that Evans destroyed the enforcement mechanism of the Civil Rights Act. Today civil rights plaintiffs who have only modest damages or who seek equitable relief are without a remedy. Although fee waivers (and their effects) were the subject of much debate after Evans was decided, in recent years the issue has dropped off the radar screen. It is time for Congress to amend the Fees Act in order to resurrect section 1983 as the robust remedial law Congress meant it to be...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the practice of}} “regulation by amicus”: that is, an agency’s attempt to mold statutory interpretation and establish policy by filing “friend of the court” briefs in private litigation. Since the United States Supreme Court recognized agency amicus interpretations {{as a source of}} controlling law entitled to deference in Auer v. Robbins, agencies have used amicus curiae briefs—in strategic and at times aggressive ways—to advance the political agenda of the President in the courts. Using the lens of the U. S. Department of Labor’s amicus activity in wage and hour cases, this Article explores the tension between the extraordinary power and efficiency of agency amicus policy making on the one hand, with the harms this less transparent approach may inflict on fundamental democratic values such as public participation and separation of powers. The Article first puts the issue in empirical context by examining the nature and impact of the DOL’s amicus filings in 324 Fair Labor Standards Act cases from the Roosevelt through Obama administrations. To evaluate the normative implications of amicus policy making, the piece then juxtaposes the especially active amicus strategies employed by the Bush administration—which manipulated deference principles to weaken worker protection laws—and the Obama administration—which increased amicus filings to revive enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This Article proposes an analytical framework for judicial review of agency amicus arguments that remains faithful to separation of powers—especially to the legislative public policy established in <b>remedial</b> <b>statutes</b> like the FLSA...|$|R
40|$|Hate {{speech in}} South Africa creates {{a tension between}} the right to freedom of {{expression}} and the rights to human dignity and equality. The challenge is to achieve a balance between these competing rights {{in the context of}} the divisive past and the transformative constitutional ideal, in which reconciliation and respect for group difference are promoted. Freedom of expression, an individual right, must be construed in light of its underlying values, but regard must also be given to communitarian interests. The constitutional standard draws the initial line. The advocacy of hatred on four grounds and which constitutes incitement to cause harm is not constitutionally protected speech. Such speech undermines nation building, causes acrimony, and is not tolerated in the egalitarian society envisaged by the Constitution. The thesis formulates a principled legislative hate speech framework for South Africa at both human rights and criminal levels within the parameters of the constitutional mandate, as guided by the standard for hate speech restrictions in international law, and the Canadian regulatory model. An essential premise is that regulation requires a multi-faceted balancing enquiry. A holistic approach is proposed where factors such as respect for the dignity of the victims, autonomy for speakers, listeners and the wider community; the causal link between hate speech and hatred in a community; and the desire to achieve a diverse and harmonious society; amongst others, are considered. Failure to regulate hate speech constructively endorses hatemongers and promotes damaging speech at the expense of vulnerable groups. Regulation ensures that law sets the normative benchmark, affirms the protection of vulnerable groups within the social fabric and upholds social cohesion, inclusiveness and the equal citizenship of all individuals in society. The thesis contains a proposal for the enactment of legislation creating a self-standing hate speech crime for the advocacy of extreme hatred, shaped in accordance with international requirements and comparative foreign law, and structured in light of the distinction between hate crime and hate speech. The existing legal framework is unable to provide consistent and fitting redress for the severe harm caused by such speech, namely the fostering of an environment in which the stigmatisation of groups is promoted, their exclusion from society justified and intervention is needed to remedy the escalated levels of hatred and violence between different groups in society. PEPUDA, a <b>remedial</b> <b>statute</b> aimed at promoting transformation and substantive equality, is valuable, but its speech prohibitions are broad and imprecise. Consequently, their effectiveness is compromised and their constitutionality questioned. The thesis proposes recommendations for amendments to sections 7 (a), 10 (1) and 12 of PEPUDA. The aim is to ensure compliance with the international standard and to foster the optimal regulation of hate speech and other forms of damaging speech, including derogatory racial epithets, which undermine human dignity and equality and threaten national unity. It is intended for the two systems to complement one another and to create a legal framework aimed at addressing hate speech constructively and in context, promoting tolerance, respect for difference, reconciliation and transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this Article {{is to provide}} a {{description}} of the legislative process and, based upon this description, some observations about the interpretation of statutes. This undertaking is motivated by my recognition, after six years of serving as Counsel to the New York State Senate Democrats and ten years of teaching law, of how dissimilar actual legislative process is from the judicial renderings of it. This dissimilarity is of particular concern since courts are constitutionally charged with effectuating legislative intent and offer their frequent descriptions of the legislative process in purporting to fulfill this obligation. Moreover, such descriptions often constitute a law student 2 ̆ 7 s entire education on legislative process. These descriptions include both implicit and explicit references to the legislative process. The implicit references are statements of interpretative principles which presume for their legitimacy some consistency between their direction and the general manner in which a legislative body operates. Random examples of these are expressions such as 2 ̆ 2 <b>remedial</b> <b>statutes</b> are to be read broadly, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 expressio unius est exclusion alterius, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 all parts of a statute are to be construed together. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The explicit references are notations of actual legislative communication which presume for their legitimacy some reliable relationship between these communications and legislative intent about a particular statute. Examples of these are references to reports, debates, amendments, and postenactment statements...|$|R
40|$|After Burlington Northern 2 ̆ 6 Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} what constitutes an “adverse action” under the Title VII anti-retaliation statute, the scope of employer liability was substantially broadened. The Supreme Court’s decision reinforced the broad intent behind the anti-retaliation statute and acknowledged the <b>statute’s</b> <b>remedial</b> purpose. The Fifth Circuit, however, has been reluctant to expand employer liability as evidenced through its interpretation of the “adverse action” prong relating to coworker harassment. More specifically, the Fifth Circuit’s “In Furtherance” standard, which is used to judge whether an employer is liable for coworker harassment in retaliation for an employee opposing unlawful employment activities, conflicts with the underlying purpose of the anti-retaliation statute. No other circuit has such a stringent requirement and, unfortunately, the Fifth Circuit’s unique interpretation prevents many plaintiffs from obtaining justifiable relief. The Fifth Circuit applied this standard in Hernandez v. Yellow Transportation, Inc., which illustrated the frustrations surrounding the denial of John Ketterer’s retaliation claim. By reviewing other circuit courts’ analysis, legislative intent, Supreme Court precedent, and public policy, this Note explains how the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation of the anti-retaliation provision is misguided and proposes a simple solution to this intricate problem...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a recent trend among {{the federal courts}} to deny housing discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act {{in cases where the}} plaintiff was an occupant of the housing at the time the discrimination occurred. Put another way, the courts have begun to read the FHA as protecting only the right to obtain housing, not the right to occupy that housing free of discrimination. The trend began with a 2004 Seventh Circuit opinion authored by Judge Richard Posner in the case of Halprin v. The Prairie Single Family Homes. Halprin dismissed most of the claims of a Jewish couple who alleged that the President of their Homeowner 2 ̆ 7 s Association discriminated against them in a variety of ways. The sole reason for the dismissal was that the couple already owned their home and, according to Judge Posner, the FHA is concerned only with access to housing. Nearly a dozen federal courts have since followed suit. This article argues that Halprin was wrongly decided, and critiques the reasoning Judge Posner used to reach his conclusion. Next, the article proposes a better method of determining how the Act should apply: specifically, that language in the FHA which limits the application of particular provisions to the sale or rental of housing is intended to refer to the relationship between the parties, and not to a particular point in time. This interpretation has the advantage of reaching not only landlords who discriminate against tenants, but also defendants such as Homeowner 2 ̆ 7 s Associations and municipalities, which are capable of discriminating against individuals who have purchased their homes. Halprin 2 ̆ 7 s analysis will have potentially disastrous consequences for fair housing law, and it represents a departure from the manner in which <b>remedial</b> civil rights <b>statutes</b> have heretofore been interpreted. The Article concludes by situating Halprin within the broader debate between neoconservatives and Critical Race scholars about the proper aims of civil rights law in this post civil rights era...|$|R
