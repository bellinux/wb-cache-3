5000|$|<b>Road</b> <b>tractors,</b> <b>tractor</b> <b>units</b> or {{traction}} heads, {{familiar as}} {{the front end of}} an articulated lorry / semi-trailer truck. They are heavy-duty vehicles with large engines and several axles.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, a fully {{functioning}} OO-scale model RoadRailer was {{manufactured by}} British toymaker Lines Brothers {{as part of}} their 'Minic Motorways' range. This allowed the trailer to be remotely coupled and uncoupled from a railway bogey and/or a <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> <b>unit.</b> Today, Bowser makes an HO model of the current RoadRailer in kit form and the couplermate to connect the locomotive to the trailers. Weaver Models made the trailers and couplermate in O scale. DeLuxe Innovations makes an N scale ready to run model of the RoadRailer trailer and CouplerMate as well.|$|R
50|$|As in {{a regular}} <b>road</b> vehicle, the <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> is steered through the front wheels by a {{steering}} wheel operated by a human driver, and powered by its rear single or double axle. The following carriages are then steered through the drawbar couplings between the carriages. Simple trains with few carriages or short in overall length may feature single- or double-axle carriages with just front-axle steering only. Larger or longer trains feature four-wheel steering by way of mechanical linkages. Four-wheel steering ensures that longer trains need less side clearance while turning, as the carriages are able to maintain the same path, describing a constant radius of arc. This adds to the impression of the vehicle being on rails. The drawbar connections of more complex trains may feature a shock absorber {{to mitigate the effect}} of acceleration or braking.|$|R
5000|$|A large {{proportion}} of a semitrailer's weight {{is supported by a}} <b>tractor</b> <b>unit,</b> or a detachable front-axle assembly known as a dolly, or the tail of another trailer. A semitrailer is normally equipped with landing gear (legs which can be lowered) to support it when it is uncoupled. Many semitrailers have wheels that are capable of being totally dismounted and are also relocatable (repositionable) to better distribute load to bearing wheel weight factors. Semitrailers are more popular for transport than full trailers, which have both front and rear axles. Ease of backing is cited as one of the semi's chief advantages. A <b>road</b> <b>tractor</b> coupled to a semi-trailer is often called a semitrailer truck or [...] "semi" [...] in North America & Australia, and an articulated lorry or [...] "artic" [...] in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Although {{normally}} {{used as a}} truck, the Zetros has also been put to work as an off-road <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> in the middle east. The Zetros Secutor is a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> for heavy agricultural applications.|$|R
50|$|The AEC Mandator {{dates from}} the 1930s. The post-war Mk II was {{available}} as a lorry and a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and the name was used for <b>tractor</b> <b>units</b> built from the 1950s to the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|A heavy hauler {{typically}} {{consists of}} a heavy <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and multi-axled lowboy flatbed trailer. Some trailers may have independently steerable wheels, and several might be towed {{by one or more}} <b>tractor</b> <b>units</b> in a train.|$|R
50|$|A {{trackless}} train usually {{consists of}} a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> pulling a number of articulated trailers or carriages {{in the manner of}} a locomotive-hauled railway train. The <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> can be powered by an internal combustion engine or an electric motor.|$|R
50|$|The current U.S. Army vehicle used in {{this role}} is an Oshkosh-built M1070 <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> in A0 and A1 {{configurations}} which is coupled to a DRS Technologies M1000 semi-trailer. This combination replaced the earlier Oshkosh-built M911 <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and M747 semi-trailer.|$|R
50|$|Unusually, the <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> {{was fitted}} with both an armored cab and two winches with a {{combined}} pull of 60 tons. The intention was {{that as well as}} hauling the tank transporter semi-trailer, the <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> could itself be used for battlefield light recovery work.|$|R

50|$|The mileage covered within Switzerland is {{read off}} the {{tachograph}} that is fitted {{in almost all}} vehicles which {{are subject to the}} fee. A fee is not charged separately for trailers but in conjunction with the <b>tractor</b> <b>unit.</b> In this case, the rate is calculated according to tariffs for maximum permitted weight on Swiss roads. This maximum permitted weight may be lower than the sum of the maximum total weight of the <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and the trailer since it depends on the type of <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and is subject to the general national weight limit. The national weight limit is 40 tonnes.|$|R

50|$|In the mid 1970s, Faun {{supplied}} tractor trucks for the Soviet Union in {{the framework}} of the so-called Delta project: to develop oilfields in Siberia, build the Baikal-Amur Mainline and realise industrial projects, the Soviet Union need heavy, all-terrain and extremely robust low-bed <b>tractor</b> <b>units.</b> Faun delivered 86 HZ 34.30/41 articulated trucks with V12-Deutz engine and an output of 326HP. Later, the Soviet Union ordered more <b>tractor</b> <b>units</b> by Faun of all frame sizes, from HZ 32.25/40 with a 305-HP-V10 engine to the super-heavy HZ 40.45/45 all-terrain <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> with a 456HP V12 Deutz engine. In total, Faun delivered 254 tractor trucks to the USSR, the last in 1989.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to develop a {{calculation}} method for slipping parameters of friction clutches (of the slipping work and time) in tractor gearboxes at various gear overlaps and for different friction clutches installation on the shafts. The work has used theoretical and experimental research methods: the former were based on methods of analytical mechanics and motion theory of wheeled and tracked vehicles, while the latter assumed testing full-sized prototypes of friction clutches and friction clutches in gearboxes. The work has brought the following results: a universal acceleration diagram has been offered for a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> at shifting gears with different overlaps, valid for any relation between the gearing time and friction clutch slipping; based on the mathematical models of acceleration of the <b>tractor</b> <b>unit,</b> we have developed a generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction clutch slipping (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears with different overlaps, at starting off a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and at bench tests of friction clutches and friction clutches in gearboxes. The scientific novelty {{of the work is}} in development of the following: - A theoretical acceleration diagram of a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> with gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps; - A mathematical acceleration model of a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> and friction clutch slipping in the gearbox at gear shifting with different overlaps, and when starting a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> off; - A generalized calculation method for parameters of the friction clutch slipping (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears in the gearbox with different overlaps, when starting a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> off and at bench tests of friction clutches and friction clutches in the gearbox. Conclusions: The developed universal acceleration mathematical model for a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit</b> at gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps, and of its acceleration at starting off, allows defining – at the designing stage of gearboxes with friction clutches – their work and slipping time, and the acceleration time of a <b>tractor</b> <b>unit,</b> which may lead to designing reliable friction clutches and gearboxes with friction clutches. The proposed calculation method of the work of the friction clutch slipping in the gearbox at bench tests allows transferring test results into the operation loading mode, and, therefore, to perform fine-tuning of gearboxes with friction clutches at bench tests. </p...|$|R
