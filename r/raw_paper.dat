50|$|Shortage of {{learning}} materials in accessible languages soon presented {{the newly independent}} post-colonial governments with a problem. Due to the price-fixing actions of publishing cartels in London and New York, prices for educational materials, which were still under copyright, were far {{beyond the reach of}} ordinary people, and governments were unable to subsidise the quantity of books needed to construct a viable statewide education system. Pirating the necessary texts (a radical option) was also difficult, given a lack of printing presses paper mills, and <b>raw</b> <b>paper</b> stock.

The League of Nations' investigation found Hungary's motives were to avenge its post-WWI territorial losses (blamed on Georges Clemenceau) and to use profits from the counterfeiting business to boost a militarist, border-revisionist ideology. Germany and Austria had {{an active role in}} the conspiracy, which required special machinery. The quality of fake bills was still substandard however, owing to France's use of exotic <b>raw</b> <b>paper</b> material imported from its colonies.|$|E

5000|$|Since the aseptic {{packages}} contain {{different layers}} of plastic and aluminium {{in addition to}} <b>raw</b> <b>paper,</b> they cannot be recycled as [...] "normal" [...] paper waste, but {{need to go to}} special recycling units for separation of the different materials. Tetra Pak has operated limited recycling since the mid-1980s, introducing a recycling program for its cartons in Canada as early as 1990. In 2000, Tetra Pak invested ฿20 million (€500,000) in the first recycling plant for aseptic packages in Thailand. Recycling of the aseptic packages has indeed been one of Tetra Pak's big challenges. Once separated, the aseptic carton results in aluminium and pure paraffin, which can be used in industry. Even without separating the carton materials, however, the aseptic carton can be reused, a Tetra Pak spokesman said, for example in engineering equipment. In 2010, 30 billion used Tetra Pak carton packages were recycled, a doubling since 2002. The company stated that it aims to help double the recycling rate within the next ten years, something that will require an engagement within the whole recycling chain. As of 2011, 20% of Tetra Pak cartons are recycled globally, with countries like Belgium, Germany, Spain and Norway showing local recycling rates of over 50%. To increase the level of recycling and meet the targets, Tetra Pak has engaged in driving recycling activities such as facilitating the development of collection schemes, launch new recycling technologies and raise the awareness about recycling and sustainability. Used Tetra Pak packages have been used as construction material in different design projects, with varying results.|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 19 th century, Opium trading out-flowed China’s silver cash {{currency}} and pushed {{up the price}} of silver. The Chinese market was also overflowing with foreign silver dollars. As a result of this, numerous unauthorized currencies were introduced into the market due to insufficient coinage. In 1896, Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Hubei and Hunan, introduced banknotes from Japan in order to address the problem. The imported bills were very popular among the public and became widely circulated. Yuan Shikai was transferred to Shandong as Grand Coordinator in 1903 when the finances there deteriorated. Yuan attempted to improve the situation by issuing banknotes, however, the roughly made banknotes triggered a severe social crisis. Accordingly, following Zhang’s example, Yuan introduced Japanese made banknotes to Shandong Province in 1901 and 1902 respectively. After this successful introduction, Yuan was promoted to Governor-general of Zhili Province and minister in the Northern Warlords Government. He intended to introduce the <b>raw</b> <b>paper</b> used in Japanese made banknotes to Zhili in order to print and issue bills. This paper will discuss Yuan’s introduction of <b>raw</b> <b>paper</b> used in Japanese made banknotes and the process of commissioning Japan’s National Printing Bureau to produce the <b>raw</b> <b>paper.</b> 研究ノー...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Silicon oxide (SiOx) were {{deposited}} on many substrates such as silicon, glass, and poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and {{widely used in}} industry due to their excellent impressive barrier, electrical, optical and eco-friendly properties. However, few publications that focus on paper as substrate in sputtering have been found. SiOx films were {{deposited on}} papers by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The influences of process parameters, RF power density and deposition time on deposition rate, surface roughness, mechanical properties and humidity barrier of the films were investigated. The result from atomic force microscopy (AFM) applied to investigate the surface morphologies showed that papers being deposited SiOx (SiOx/Paper) films with the average roughness were much more homogenous and smoother than <b>raw</b> <b>papers.</b> Horizontal, vertical elastic modulus and yield strength of SiOx/Pap clearly increased. The water vapor transmission rate of SiOx/Paper films, which prepared at RF density of 2. 78 W/cm 2, argon (Ar) flux of 40 sccm and deposition time of 36 min decreased 15 times, and the oxygen transmission rate did 10 times.

40|$|Background: Providing patient {{information}} to physicians in usable form is of high importance. Electronic presentation of patient data may have benefits in efficiency and error rate reduction for these physician facing interfaces. Using a cancer symptom measurement tool (the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)) we assessed the usability of patient data in its <b>raw</b> <b>paper</b> form and compared that to presentation on two electronic presentation formats of different sizes. Methods: In two separate experiments, undergraduates completed two identical six-part questionnaires on two twenty-patient MDASI data sets. In Experiment 1, participants completed one questionnaire using a paper packet {{and the other}} questionnaire using an in-house designed iPad application. In Experiment 2, MDASI data was evaluated using an iPad and iPod Touch. Participants assessed the usability of the devices directly after use. In a third experiment, medical professionals evaluated the paper and iPad interfaces in order to validate the findings from Experiment 1. Results: Participants were faster and more accurate answering questions about patients when using the iPad. The results from the medical professionals were similar. No appreciable accuracy, task time, or usability differences were observed between the iPad and iPod Touch. Conclusions: Overall, the use of our tablet interface increased the accuracy and speed that users could extract pertinent information from a multiple patient MDASI data set compared to paper. Reducing {{the size of the}} interface did not negatively affect accuracy, speed, or usability. Generalization of the results to other physician facing interfaces is discussed...|$|E
