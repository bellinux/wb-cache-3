40|$|Network {{reconstruction}} {{from data}} is a data mining task which is receiving a significant attention {{due to its}} applicability in several domains. For example, it can be applied in social network analysis, where {{the goal is to}} identify connections among users and, thus, sub-communities. Another example can be found in computational biology, where the goal is to identify previously unknown relationships among biological entities and, thus, relevant interaction networks. Such task is usually solved by adopting methods for link prediction and for the identification of relevant sub-networks. Focusing on the biological domain, in [4] and [3] we proposed two methods for learning to combine the output of several link prediction algorithms and for the identification of biological significant interaction networks involving two important types of RNA molecules, i. e. microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The relevance of this application comes from the importance of identifying (previously unknown) <b>regulatory</b> and <b>cooperation</b> activities for the understanding of the biological roles of miRNAs and mRNAs.

Liberalization has been accompanied by gradual harmonization of national markets to overcome resistance to competitive forces. Less steps than necessary have been undertaken to promote market integration; yet, positive and normative reasons remain for the participation of national or even regional/local powers. Vertical institutional cooperation will remain a necessary condition for a sound <b>regulatory</b> framework, but <b>cooperation</b> may sometimes be inhibited by distributive considerations. federalism; regulation; electricity; telecommunications;...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Comparative {{studies on}} cross-national policy {{transfer}} and diffusion emphasize an impressing degree of policy convergence in many areas. This holds true, in particular, {{for the environmental}} field. However, we are still confronted with limited knowledge about the mechanisms accounting for this phenomenon. Against this backdrop, we theoretically investigate the impact of three different convergence mechanisms that are generally seen as central sources of cross-national policy convergence: <b>regulatory</b> competition, international <b>cooperation</b> and transnational communication. We focus {{not only on the}} isolated effects of each mechanism, but also on the effects of their interaction. As will be shown, the empirically rather likely interaction of different mechanisms constitutes a plausible explanation for the still puzzling gap between the theoretical prediction of a race to the bottom through regulatory competition and the lacking empirical support for this hypothesis. ...|$|R

30|$|National {{regulatory}} authorities {{are charged with}} the responsibility {{to ensure that the}} health products used by their populations are safe, efficacious and of good quality. It is also the duty of these authorities to expedite access of patients to the medicines and medical devices they need in a timely manner. With the ever increasing complexity of new biomedical and biotechnological products and development, coupled with the challenges arising from the global supply chain, the need for <b>regulatory</b> convergence and <b>cooperation</b> is essential rather than optional. In today’s world, no single regulatory authority can claim that it is fully resourced to manage all issues relating to pre- and post-marketing of all the medicines and medical devices available in its country. The rational way forward is therefore to optimize the use of scarce resources in cooperation with regional and international regulatory counterparts, while administering a robust regulatory system that does not duplicate efforts to ensure timely access of health products to patients in a reliable and efficient manner.|$|R
