5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the metals are then <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the metals.|$|E
5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate. Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate. Rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution.|$|E

Midway through her answer, pageant host Paolo Bediones encouraged her off-microphone to continue in Tagalog, though she proceeded with her response in English.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Wat Tyler's entrance in 1381, in 1450, Jack Cade and 4,000 rebels were barred entry {{from the city}} at West Gate. In 1533, Canterbury <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> concern to the news of Thomas Wyatt's rebellion in Kent; repairs {{were made to the}} walls, guns and ammunition mobilised, and the Riding Gate was blocked up. Queen Mary later thanked the city for their efforts.|$|E

5|$|Rhodium {{is found}} in {{platinum}} or nickel ores together with {{the other members of}} the platinum group metals.

5|$|The Madison Square Garden {{audience}} <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> wild {{applause and}} demonstrations {{for half an}} hour. On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while he shook Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity. Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The painting's dreamlike and {{haunting}} erotic {{evocation of}} infatuation and obsession {{was a huge}} popular success. After its first exhibition, at the 1782 Royal Academy of London, critics and patrons <b>reäcted</b> <b>with</b> horrified fascination and the work became widely popular, {{to the extent that}} it was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced at least three other versions.|$|E

5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium {{is extracted}} by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E

5|$|Since {{irreversible}} inhibition {{often involves}} the initial {{formation of a}} non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme {{in more than one}} way. For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine mustard are bound in its active site. The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> an amino acid residue through its nitrogen mustard group.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{produced}} considerable {{quantities of}} brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) {{as early as}} 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> zinc oxide. The zinc oxide {{is thought to have}} been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace. This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor, which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide. This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD. Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India, dating from {{the second half of the}} first millennium BC. This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass.|$|E
5|$|The purest metal is {{obtained}} from nickel oxide by the Mond process, which achieves a purity of greater than 99.99%. The process was patented by Ludwig Mond {{and has been}} in industrial use since before the beginning of the 20th century. In this process, nickel is <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> carbon monoxide {{in the presence of a}} sulfur catalyst at around 40–80°C to form nickel carbonyl. Iron gives iron pentacarbonyl, too, but this reaction is slow. If necessary, the nickel may be separated by distillation. Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by-product, but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non-volatile solid.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} the first 15 {{years of the}} sentence, Lebrón's social worker {{told her that she}} could ask for parole, but she did not display interest in the proposal, never signing the required documentation. Due to this lack of interest, she was mandated to attend a meeting before a penitentiary committee, where she presented a written deposition expressing her position about the parole proposal as well as other subjects including terrorism, politics and the United States' use of the atomic bomb. Following this the other inmates <b>reacted</b> <b>with</b> skepticism over her intentions to refuse the offer, which made her distance herself from them and focus her attention in studying as well as writing poetry. During this timeframe, Lebrón's interest in religion grew. Lebrón's daughter Gladys died in 1977, while her mother was in prison.|$|E
