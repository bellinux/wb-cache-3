There is also discussion about how the Scrapped Princess {{can be used as a}} <b>Rally</b> <b>Point</b> to prevent the Peacemakers from taking over the minds of humans. This suggests that <b>Rally</b> <b>Points</b> are magic focal points that can be used for other purposes.|$|R

5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged even the most determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich was interred in Berlin's Invalidenfriedhof, a {{military}} cemetery. The exact burial spot is not known—a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran {{the city in}} 1945 was never replaced, so that Heydrich's grave could not become a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for Neo-Nazis. A photograph of Heydrich's burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A, which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststraße, {{at the front of}} the cemetery. A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A. Hitler planned for Heydrich to have a monumental tomb (designed by sculptor Arno Breker and architect Wilhelm Kreis) but, due to Germany's declining fortunes, it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the flag was {{completed}} in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire background to be red, but the Cabinet decided against this, as red {{was regarded as a}} <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for communism. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese population wanted five stars, which were modeled off the flag of the People's Republic of China and the Muslim population wanted a crescent moon. Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E

5|$|In this programme, by {{presidential decree}} Sudirman {{was no longer}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the military starting on 2January 1948. He was demoted to lieutenant general, while Chief of the Air Force Soerjadi Soerjadarma {{was intended to be}} commander-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, Sjarifuddin was ousted in a vote of no confidence for his involvement in the Renville Agreement, and the new prime minister, Mohammad Hatta, worked to implement the rationalisation programme. This led to a several months-long debate between pro- and anti-rationalisation groups. Sudirman served as a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> and driving force for soldiers, including numerous older commanders, who were against the programme. Sudirman was formally reinstated on 1June 1946, upon which he effectively rescinded the command to rationalise. He chose Colonel Abdul Haris Nasution as his deputy, but remained a lieutenant general.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April 1978 a {{prominent}} leftist named Mir Akbar Khyber was assassinated {{and the murder}} was blamed on Mohammed Daoud Khan's Republic of Afghanistan. His death served as a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for the pro-communist Afghans. Fearing a communist coup d'état, Daoud ordered the arrest of certain PDPA leaders, including Taraki and Karmal, while placing others such as Hafizullah Amin under house arrest. On 27 April 1978 the Saur Revolution was initiated, reportedly by Amin while still under house arrest. Khan was killed the next day along with most of his family. The PDPA rapidly gained control and on 1 May Taraki became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, a role which subsumed the responsibilities of both president and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (literally prime minister in Western parlance). The country was then renamed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), installing a regime that would last until April 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{storming}} of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, {{had been}} celebrated annually since 1790, initially through quasi-religious rituals, {{and then later}} during the Revolution with grand, secular events including the burning of replica Bastilles. Under Napoleon the events became less revolutionary, focusing instead on military parades and national unity {{in the face of}} foreign threats. During the 1870s, the 14 July celebrations became a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for Republicans opposed to the early monarchist leadership of the Third Republic; when the moderate Republican Jules Grévy became president in 1879, his new government turned the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille into a national holiday. The anniversary remained contentious, with hard-line Republicans continuing to use the occasion to protest against the new political order and right-wing conservatives protesting about the imposition of the holiday. The July Column itself remained contentious and Republican radicals unsuccessfully tried to blow it up in 1871.|$|E

50|$|On {{or before}} April 10, Bundy asked the Oath Keepers to request that their volunteers {{who came to}} the protest follow certain rules. He asked that they not wear {{military}} camouflage and to leave their rifles in their vehicles rather than open carry them. He also asked that they check in with him when they arrived at the protest <b>rally</b> <b>point.</b> In addition, he asked that they not drive past the <b>rally</b> <b>point</b> to the Bundy ranch. Furthermore, he asked that no protester give a media interview, instead referring the media to Bundy family members, in particular him, his father, or one of his brothers.|$|R
5|$|Howard {{immediately}} sent messengers {{to summon}} reinforcements from the III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles) and the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north {{to take a}} position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> if the Union troops could not hold their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E
5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E

5|$|By October 1991, Ferraro {{was ready}} to enter {{elective}} politics again, {{and ran for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1992 United States Senate election in New York. Her opponents were State Attorney General Robert Abrams, Reverend Al Sharpton, Congressman Robert J. Mrazek, and New York City Comptroller and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was considered the early front-runner. The D'Amato campaign feared facing Ferraro the most among these, as her Italian ancestry, effective debating and stump speech skills, and her staunch pro-choice views would eat into several of D'Amato's usual bases of support. Ferraro emphasized her career as a teacher, prosecutor, congresswoman, and mother, and talked about how she was tough on crime. Ferraro drew renewed attacks during the primary campaign from the media and her opponents over Zaccaro's finances and business relationships. She objected that a male candidate would not receive nearly as much attention regarding his wife's activities. Ferraro became the front-runner, capitalizing on her star power from 1984, and using the campaign attacks against her as an explicitly feminist <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for women voters. As the primary date neared, her lead began to dwindle under the charges, and she released additional tax returns from the 1980s to try to defray the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Knudtzon {{was born}} in Trondheim in Sør-Trøndelag; he was the sixth and {{youngest}} child of Hans Carl Knudtzon (1751–1823), a merchant and burgomaster, and Karen Knudtzon (née Müller, 1752–1818). Knudtzon's father was of German origin and had moved to Norway to further {{his career as a}} merchant. His firm was flourishing financially, and the Knudtzon family became a <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for Trondheim's artists and authors. Having spent his childhood in Trondheim, Broder Knudtzon moved to Flensburg, Germany in 1796 to live in the house of his father's uncle. Upon his confirmation, Knudtzon travelled back to Trondheim where he was apprenticed to his father. He subsequently travelled around in France in search of a mercantile education; in Paris he met the Danish poet and playwright Adam Oehlenschläger. After a brief visit to his sister in Nantes, he relocated to England, where he came in contact with poet Lord Byron and other leading figures in the national liberal movement. During his stay in England, he acquired a great fondness and knowledge of the English language, literature and culture. In a later trip to Italy he met the Danish-Icelandic sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, who made portrait busts of him and other persons in his family.|$|E
5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} <b>rallying</b> <b>point</b> for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E
