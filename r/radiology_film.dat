40|$|A {{solid-phase}} extraction {{method for}} preconcentration {{of silver and}} consequent determination by atomic absorption spectrometry is described. The method {{is based on the}} adsorption of silver on naphtha-lene modified with dithizone in a column. The adsorbed silver is eluted from the column with a thiourea solution and determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The adsorption conditions including pH, reagent concentration, eluent volume, flow rate and interfering ions were investigated. The calibra-tion graph was linear in the range 10 - 1000 ngmL- 1 of Ag in the initial solution with r = 0. 9998. The limit of detection based on 3 Sb was 3. 9 ng mL- 1. The relative standard deviation for ten replicate measurements of 40 and 600 ng mL- 1 of Ag was 4. 4 % and 0. 9 %, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of silver in mineral, <b>radiology</b> <b>film</b> and wound dressing samples...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure combined with flame {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (FAAS) was designed for the extraction and determination of trace amounts of silver. A column of immobilized 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) on microcrystalline naphthalene {{was used as the}} sorbent. Silver was quantitatively retained on the column in the pH range of 0. 5 – 6. 0. After extraction, the solid mass consisting of silver complex and naphthalene was dissolved out of the column with 5. 0 mL of dimethylformamide, and the analyte was determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Under the optimum experimental conditions, the adsorption capacity was found to be 1. 18 [*]mg of silver per gram of the sorbent. A sample volume of 800 [*]mL resulted in a preconcentration factor of 160. The relative standard deviation obtained for ten replicate determinations at a concentration of 0. 8 [*]µg[*]L− 1 was 1. 4 %, and the limit of detection was 0. 02 [*]µg[*]L− 1. The method was successfully applied to the determination of silver in <b>radiology</b> <b>film,</b> waste water, and natural water samples.

40|$|A {{very simple}} cloud point {{extraction}} (CPE) methodology for the preconcentration of trace amounts {{of silver and}} magnesium as a prior step for their determination by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) has been developed. The method {{is based on the}} extraction of silver and magnesium at pH 10 by using non-ionic surfactant Triton X- 114 and 4 methyl- 3 -((1 -H-Indol- 3 -iyl) (phenyl) methyl)) - 1 -H-Indol (MPBIM) as a complexing agent. Several important variables that affect the CPE efficiency and FAAS signal were investigated and optimized. The calibration curves, using the preconcentration system, were linear in the range of 0. 007 - 0. 200 &# 956;g mL- 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 999. The lower limits of detection (3 s) obtained in the optimal conditions were 1. 47 ng mL- 1 and 3. 00 ng mL- 1 for Mg²+ and Ag+ ions, respectively. The relative standard deviation for five replicate determinations of magnesium and silver at 0. 133 &# 956;g mL- 1 concentration level, were 1. 17 and 0. 97, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the ultra-trace determination of silver and magnesium in various water samples, blood serum, urine, and <b>radiology</b> <b>film</b> samples...|$|E

40|$|When a typographic {{error of}} a patient {{identification}} number occurs on a patient document such as an envelope for <b>radiology</b> <b>films</b> or the cover {{of a patient}} record, it will result in misplacement of the document. Once misplaced, such documents are often extremely difficult to recover. After analyzing 290 numerical typos, we found that errors do not occur randomly. Instead, many of the typos share certain specific patterns. Six major types of non-random numeral typographic error patterns have been identified and their frequency characterized. Knowing these patterns and their odds increases the likelihood of finding a misplaced file. In addition, awareness of these patterns during transcribing or writing a patient ID may decrease the chance of typographic errors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that chronic arterial occlusion protects the distal vessels from disease progression. Methods: Peripheral angiograms from the <b>radiology</b> <b>film</b> store filed under 1997 – 1999 were reviewed. Those showing unilateral iliac occlusion and those showing unilateral femoro-popliteal occlusion were selected. The severity of arterial disease distal to the occlusion was compared with the patent side. Subsequently, in a subgroup of patients undergoing repeat angiography, the frequency and distribution of disease progression was recorded and related to the initial disease distribution. Results: In {{the presence of a}} unilateral iliac occlusion, femoro-popliteal occlusion was less likely {{on the side of the}} iliac occlusion than on the opposite side (difference in proportion 10 %. 95 % C.

In the presence of a unilateral occlusion proximal to the knee joint, there were more patent calf vessels on the side of the occlusion than on the opposite side (difference in proportion 9 %. 95 % C.

The Ag(I) -imprinted polymer (IIP) particles were characterized by SEM (scanning electron microscope), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and BET/BJH (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller/Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) analysis. The imprinted Ag(I) ions were completely removed by leaching the IIP with thiourea (0. 5 mol L- 1). The polymer was employed as a selective sorbent for extraction and separation of the trace amounts of the Ag(I) ions. The preconcentrated ion was determined via the flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) or it was reduced to silver nanoparticles and quantified by spectrophotometry based on its localized surface plasmon resonance peak (LSPRP). The figures of merit of both methods were compared. Under the optimized conditions, a sample volume of 80 mL resulted in an enhancement factor of 312. The detection limit (3 Sb/m) and the relative standard deviation (n = 10) at 10 &# 181;g L- 1 level for FAAS were found to be 0. 06 &# 181;g L- 1, 2. 9 %, whereas for the LSPRP method they were 0. 5 &# 181;g L- 1 and 10. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Introduction: In 2000, the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) {{developed}} a national radiology quality assurance (QA) and {{continuing medical education}} (CME) program for rural and remote non-specialist Australian doctors. The program commenced on 1 January 2001. It required rural doctors to obtain 30 radiology QA/CME points over a 4 year period. At least 15 - 20 of these points had to be obtained by one of two mandatory options of the program, either: (1) film interpretation, report and review clinical audit activity; or (2) a radiology clinical attachment. Method: Doctors submitted their completed film review forms and clinical attachment logbooks to the program manager as confirmation of their educational activity to receive their professional development points. Data from film review forms and clinical attachment logbooks were de-identified and entered into two Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheets. The data were categorised and analysed in EXCEL. Results: From 1 January 2001 to September 2004, 823 rural and remote doctors enrolled in the ACRRM radiology program. This included 281 locums who enrolled in the short-term locum option {{of the program and}} 563 doctors who enrolled in the full program. In September 2004, 419 doctors had completed a <b>radiology</b> <b>film</b> review with a radiologist and 41 doctors completed a radiology clinical attachment in 31 different public and private radiology practices. One hundred and ninety-five doctors completed the short-term locum activity. Ninety-two different specialist radiologists participated in the program and assisted rural and remote doctors to enhance their radiology knowledge, confidence and skills. This article describes results from the two mandatory activities. Conclusion: The evaluation of the ACRRM radiology program after its first 3 years and 9 months shows there are a large number of rural and remote Australian doctors undertaking professional development and quality assurance activities in radiology...|$|E

However, no study has been conducted in Pakistan to demonstrate an academic framework of medical radiology education at an undergraduate level. Therefore, we aimed to document and compare {{the current level of}} teaching duties, teaching methodologies, and teaching rewards among radiologists and residents in private and public teaching hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: A survey was conducted among 121 radiologists and residents in two private and two public teaching hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. Radiologists who were nationally registered with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council either part-time or full-time were included. Radiology residents and fellows who were nationally registered with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council were also included. Self-administered questionnaires addressing teaching duties, methods, and rewards were collected from 95 participants. Results: The overall response rate was 78. 51 % (95 / 121). All of the radiologists were involved in teaching residents and medical students, but only 36 % reported formal training in teaching skills. Although most of the respondents (76 %) agreed that medical students appeared enthusiastic about learning radiology, the time spent on teaching medical students was less than five hours per week annually (82 %). Only 37 % of the respondents preferred dedicated clerkships over distributed clerkships (41 %). The most common preferred teaching methodology overall was one-on-one interaction. Tutorials, teaching rounds, and problem-based learning sessions were less favored by radiologists than by residents. Teaching via <b>radiology</b> <b>films</b> (86 %) was the most frequent mode of instruction. Salary (59 %) was the most commonly cited teaching reward. The majority of respondents (88 %) were not satisfied with their current level of teaching rewards. Conclusion: All radiologists and residents working in an academic radiology department are involved in teaching undergraduate students at multiple levels. The most valued teaching methodology involves use of images, with one-on-one interaction between the trainer and trainee. The monetary reward for teaching is inbuilt into the salary. The methodology adopted for teaching purposes was significantly different between respondents from private hospitals and those from public teaching hospitals. Because of low satisfaction among the respondents, efforts should be made to provide satisfying teaching rewards. Keywords: radiology, hospital, department, medical faculty, teaching hospita...|$|R

30|$|The frame components, being {{relatively}} radio-opaque, {{have the}} capacity to either obscure the view of the region of interest (predominantly in the case of plain <b>film</b> <b>radiology)</b> or distort the quality of the image to some degree (in the case of CT). For both of these imaging modalities, strategies to minimise this fall under three general categories. Firstly, the surgeon has some degree of choice as to the positioning of certain components (e.g. rings and rods) relative to the region of interest. Secondly, {{the way in which the}} patient is positioned during image acquisition can be optimised [2]. Thirdly, some components, such as the connecting rods, can be temporarily removed or repositioned during imaging. With CT there is an additional strategy; many modern scanners have the facility to reduce the effect of metal artefacts through the use of dual-energy CT (DECT) and/or metal artefact reduction algorithms [3, 4, 5, 6]. However, such scanner settings are not specific to the individual patient/frame construct, and so not only do they have varying ability to reduce metallic artefacts, but in addition they may also adversely affect image quality in general.|$|R

METHODS: We developed and tested at the Hospital Divina Providencia (HDP) in Luanda, Angola, a digital X-ray device and a telemedicine network to acquire and print digital X-ray images and send them as DICOM files for remote consultation. RESULTS: 20, 564 digital X-ray images were made at HDP from November 2010 to December 2012, with no major technical problems and no need for on-site supervision. Digital radiology largely improved the number of X-ray images of good and very good quality (100 % of images with digital radiology, compared to 15 % of screen-film images, p< 0. 0001). Teleradiology using digital images was used in 7. 6 % of paediatric cases, and provided, in these cases, an important contribution to case management.

30|$|External {{fixation}} is {{a common}} tool {{in the treatment of}} complex fractures, correction of limb deformity, and salvage arthrodesis. These devices typically incorporate radio-opaque metal rods/struts connected at varying distances and orientations between rings. Whilst the predominant imaging modality is plain <b>film</b> <b>radiology,</b> computed tomography (CT) may be performed in order for the surgeon to make a more confident clinical decision (e.g. timing of frame removal, assessment of degree of arthrodesis). We used a fractured sheep leg to systematically assess CT imaging performance with a Discovery CT 750 HD CT scanner (GE Healthcare) to show how rod coupling in both traditional Ilizarov and hexapod frames distorts images. We also investigated the role of dual-energy CT (DECT) and metal artefact reduction software (MARS) on the visualisation of the fractured leg. Whilst mechanical reasons predominantly dictate the rod/strut configurations when building a circular frame, rod coupling in CT can be minimised. Firstly, ideally, all or all but one rod can be removed during imaging resulting in no rod coupling. If this is not possible, strategies for configuring the rods to minimise the effect of the rod coupling on the region of interest are demonstrated, e.g., {{in the case of a}} four-rod construct, switching the two anterior rods to a more central single one will achieve this goal without particularly jeopardising mechanical strength for a short period. It is also shown that the addition of DECT and MARS results in a reduction of artefacts, but also affects tissue and bone differentiation.|$|R
40|$|Radiological {{examination}} of the abdomen {{is critical to the}} diagnosis of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). Previous studies on the reproducibility of radiological findings have been limited in size and based only on infants with the disease. We conducted a study among a sample of high-risk infants with and without the diagnosis of NEC: (1) to measure the degree of inter-observer agreement of NEC radiological diagnosis and signs and (2) identify a profile of radiological signs which led the observers to make a diagnosis of NEC. We collected 297 X-rays from a sample of 57 newborns admitted in 1999 to neonatal intensive care and neonatal surgery units in Rome, Italy. Three specialists in paediatric <b>radiology</b> examined the <b>films</b> independently and without any clinical information about patients. The analyses were conducted on a total of 891 forms filled in by the observers. Kappa values were calculated to measure the inter-observer reliability. To identify the profiles of radiological signs, a multidimensional analysis, binary segmentation, was carried out. The reproducibility of radiographic signs was 0. 55 (P < 0. 01) for diffuse gaseous intestinal distention, 0. 22 (P < 0. 01) for bowel wall thickening, 0. 10 (P < 0. 01) for presence of portal venous gas and 0. 29 (P < 0. 01) for pneumatosis intestinalis. The agreement for radiographic diagnosis suspected/confirmed of NEC was 0. 31 (P < 0. 01). Among the 23 possible combinations of radiographic signs, the three radiologists indicated four profiles that produced a diagnosis of NEC containing, respectively, two, three, four and five signs. Our study found, in a large sample of radiographs selected from a population of infants with and without NEC, a poor reliability for NEC diagnosis and individual radiological signs among three expert radiologists.

40|$|There {{is now a}} wide {{choice of}} medical imaging to show both focal and diffuse pathologies in various organs. Conventional <b>radiology</b> with plain <b>films,</b> {{fluoroscopy}} and contrast medium have many advantages, being readily available with low-cost apparatus and a familiarity that almost leads to contempt. The use of plain films in chest disease and in trauma does not need emphasizing, yet there are still too many occasions when the answer obtainable from a plain radiograph has not been available. The film may have been mislaid, or the examination was not requested, or the radiograph had been misinterpreted. The converse is also quite common. Examinations are performed that add nothing to patient management, such as skull films when CT will in any case be requested or views of the internal auditory meatus and heal pad thickness in acromegaly, to quote some examples. Other issues are more complicated. Should the patient who clinically has gall-bladder disease {{have more than a}} plain film that shows gall-stones? If the answer is yes, then why request a plain film if sonography will in any case be required to 'exclude' other pathologies especially of the liver or pancreas? But then should cholecystography, CT or scintigraphy be added for confirmation? Quite clearly there will be individual circumstances to indicate further imaging after sonography but {{in the vast majority of}} patients little or no extra information will be added. Statistics on accuracy and specificity will, in the case of gall-bladder pathology, vary widely if adenomyomatosis is considered by some to be a cause of symptoms or if sonographic examinations 'after fatty meals' are performed. The arguments for or against routine contrast urography rather than sonography are similar but the possibility of contrast reactions and the need to limit ionizing radiation must be borne in mind. These diagnostic strategies are also being influenced by their cost and availability; purely pragmatic considerations are not infrequently the overriding factor. Non-invasive methods will be preferred, particularly sonography as it is far more acceptable by not being claustrophobic and totally free of any known untoward effects. There is another quite different but unrelated aspect. The imaging methods, apart from limited exceptions, cannot characterize tissues as benign or malignant, granulomatous or neoplastic; cytology or histology usually provides the answer. Sonography is most commonly used to locate the needle tip correctly for percutaneous sampling of tissues. Frequently sonography with fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy is the least expensive, safest and most direct route to a definitive diagnosis. Abscesses can be similarly diagnosed but with needles or catheters through which the pus can be drained. The versatility and mobility of sonography has spawned other uses, particularly for the very ill and immobile, for the intensive therapy units and for the operating theatre, as well in endosonography. The appointment of more skilled sonographers to the National Health Service could make a substantial contribution to cost-effective management of hospital services. Just when contrast agents and angiography have become safe and are performed rapidly, they are being supplanted by scanning methods. They are now mainly used for interventional procedures or of pre-operative 'road maps' and may be required even less in the future as MRI angiography and Doppler techniques progress. MRI will almost certainly extent its role beyond the central nervous system (CNS) should the equipment become more freely available, especially to orthopaedics. Until then plain films, sonography or CT will have to suffice. Even in the CNS there are conditions where CT is more diagnostic, as in showing calculations in cerebral cysticercosis. Then, too, in most cases CT produces results comparable to MRI apart from areas close to bone, structures at the base of the brain, in the posterior fossa and in the spinal cord. Scintigraphy for pulmonary infarcts and bone metastases and in renal disease in children plays a prominent role and its scope has increased with new equipment and radionuclides. Radio-immunoscintigraphy in particular is likely to expand greatly not only in tumour diagnosis but also in metabolic and infective conditions. Whether the therapeutic implications will be realized is more problematic. The value of MRS and NM for metabolic studies in clinical practice is equally problematical, although the data from cerebral activity are extremely interesting. While scanning has replaced many radiographic examinations, endoscopy has had a similar effect on barium meals and to a lesser extent on barium enemas. The combined visual/sonographic endoscope is likely to accelerate this process. There is no doubt that over the last 2 decades medical imaging has changed the diagnostic process, but its influence on the outcome of disease other than infections is less certain and probably indefinable. Data concerning the comparative efficacy in terms of patient outcome for each of the imaging techniques would be of considerable interest and a great help in determining diagnostic strategies...|$|R
