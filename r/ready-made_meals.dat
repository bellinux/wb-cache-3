[br/] Six <b>ready-made</b> <b>meals</b> models (lentils, mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes with cheese, béchamel sauce, vegetable soup, Bolognese sauce) were prepared and packaged in plastic bags. They were stored at 23 °C and at a partial oxygen pressure of 96 kPa to accelerate the oxidation phenomena. Two plastic packaging, Alu and Alox, were used presenting in these conditions an oxygen permeability of respectively 0. 028 and 0. 040 cm 3 /(packaging. day). Three bags of each ready-meal x plastic packaging combinations were sampled at 6 different times: T 0 the start of the experiment, 20 days (equivalent to 3 months), 40 days (equivalent to 6 months), 59 days (equivalent to 9 months), 79 days (equivalent to 12 months) and 119 days (equivalent to 18 months). Samples were then frozen at − 20 °C until measurements. After thawing, samples were directly, without grinding, measured in attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy between 4000 and 650 /cm performing five replications to evaluate the sample heterogeneity. Multivariate analyses applied on spectral data allowed to highlight some changes in the global profile. For example, in the case of Bolognese sauce, samples were clearly discriminated (i) from 12 months, (ii) according to the packaging at 18 months with a greater oxidation in the Alox packaging. The eigenvectors allowed to identify several clear absorption bands which increased over storage, such as 2918 /cm, 2850 /cm, 1741 /cm and 1164 /cm. 吀ese absorption bands could be attributed to fats, which thus appeared to have a major effect in sample discrimination.

The recent restrictions in the use of bisphenol A have led the plastic industry to look for alternative chemicals, most of them belonging to the same family of p,p′-bisphenols. The aim of the current work was to develop and validate a method based on stable-isotope dilution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of bisphenol A and its main analogs – bisphenol S, 4, 4 ′-sulfonylbis(2 -methylphenol), bisphenol F, bisphenol E, bisphenol B, bisphenol Z, bisphenol AF, bisphenol AP, tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol P – in solid foodstuffs, and particularly in <b>ready-made</b> <b>meals.</b> Extraction was carried out by ultrasound-assisted extraction after sample disruption with sand. A selective solid-phase extraction procedure was then applied to reduce potential matrix interferences. Derivatization of bisphenols with pyridine- 3 -sulfonyl chloride increased their ionization efficiency by electrospray ionization. Validation of the proposed method was performed in terms of selectivity, matrix effects, linearity, precision, measurement uncertainty, trueness and limits of detection. Satisfactory repeatability and intermediate precision were obtained; the related relative standard deviations were ≤ 7. 8 % and ≤ 10 %, respectively. The relative expanded uncertainty (k= 2) was below 17 % for all bisphenol analogs and the trueness of the method was demonstrated by spike recovery experiments.

Features of ready-made meal packaging appreciated by 'current' (aged 65 ≥ years) and 'future' (aged 55 - 64 years) seniors were studied as an internet survey in Finland (n = 764) and in the Netherlands (n = 457). Only minor significant differences were found between these two senior groups. The four packaging features most valued by both the Finnish and Dutch consumers were: easy readability, easy disposability and recyclability, visibility of the contents, and easy opening. These features were basically the same regardless of age group, gender or country. Older people did not show interest either in multi-packages or in eating meals directly from the package.

This paper focuses on the economic aspects to estimate the life cycle costs, value added and consumer costs of <b>ready-made</b> <b>meals,</b> in comparison with the equivalent meals prepared at home. Their life cycle environmental impacts are also considered. A typical roast dinner is considered, consisting of chicken, vegetables and tomato sauce. Different production and consumption choices are evaluated, including sourcing of ingredients, chilled or frozen supply chains and types of appliance used by the consumer to prepare the meal. The estimated life cycle costs of the ready-made meal range from £ 0. 61 –£ 0. 92 per meal and for the home-made from £ 0. 68 –£ 1. 12. The lowest life cycle costs are found for the chilled ready-made meal heated in a microwave, 11 % below the costs of the best home-made option. The life cycle costs of the frozen meal are similar to the best home-made option. The chilled ready-made meal has the highest value added (£ 2. 01) compared to the frozen (£ 1. 22) and the home-made meal (£ 0. 44). However, from the consumer perspective, the cheapest option is the home-made meal (£ 1. 17) while the chilled ready-made option is most expensive (£ 2. 61). If the meal options are compared on both the life cycle costs and environmental impacts, the home-made meal is the best option overall.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{compares the}} life cycle {{environmental}} impacts of <b>ready-made</b> <b>meals</b> manufactured industrially with meals prepared at home from scratch. A typical roast dinner consisting of chicken meat, vegetables and tomato sauce is considered. The {{results suggest that the}} impacts of the home-made meal are lower than for the equivalent ready-made meal. For example, the global warming and human toxicity potentials are up to 35 % lower and eutrophication, photochemical smog and ozone layer depletion are up to 3 times lower. The main reasons for this are the avoidance of meal manufacturing, reduced refrigeration and a lower amount of waste in {{the life cycle}} of the home-made meal. For the ready-made meal, the lowest impacts are found for the frozen meal prepared from fresh ingredients and heated at home in a microwave. The worst option for most impacts is the frozen ready-made meal with frozen ingredients that is heated in an electric oven. For the same cooking method, chilled <b>ready-made</b> <b>meals</b> have higher impacts than the frozen. The type of refrigerant used in the supply chain influences the impacts, particularly global warming and ozone layer depletion. The contribution of packaging is important for some impacts, including global warming, fossil fuel depletion and human toxicity. The main hotspots for both types of meal are the ingredients, waste and cooking method chosen by the consumer. Using organic instead of conventional ingredients leads to higher impacts. Sourcing chicken and tomatoes from Brazil and Spain, respectively, reduces environmental impacts of the meals compared to sourcing them from the UK, despite the long-distance transport. The findings of the study are used to make recommendations to producers, retailers and consumers on reducing the environmental impacts from food production and consumption...|$|E
