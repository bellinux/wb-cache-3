25|$|During 1981 and 1982, Webb {{recorded}} {{her next}} album, I'm Not That Kind of Girl, which was eventually released in 1983. Although {{not based on}} a musical, the album had a <b>running</b> <b>story</b> concerning {{a woman who is}} reunited with a former lover. The album culminates with her on the way to their wedding. The songs were composed by David Hentschel and Don Black and were very much in a contemporary pop vein. Phil Collins played drums on the album and Kiki Dee contributed backing vocals. Despite the album's strong pedigree in terms of personnel, it failed to chart and was Webb's final album on the Polydor label.|$|E
500|$|In season three, Abby {{sets her}} {{sights on the}} wealthy Gary Ewing, the husband of her good friend Valene Ewing. While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I can’t believe I did that but it really provided us with some great stories. And it was the longest <b>running</b> <b>story</b> on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, and sets it up so that his wife will discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her – jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen. Carole Glinez said, [...] "Mills' character faced her rival Paige, played by future Desperate Housewives sexpot Nicollette Sheridan." ...|$|E

500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest <b>running</b> <b>story</b> on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E
500|$|The moral panic was not {{confined}} {{solely to the}} gender of the murderers, but also the role played by so-called [...] "video nasties". The news media immediately made a connection between the Bulger murder trial and the Capper murder trial when the horror movie [...] was mentioned as part of the testimonies. D.I. Wall said [...] "throughout interviews with the accused there was no suggestion that the reason Suzanne was killed {{had anything to do with}} [...] "Child's Play" [...] but this was overlooked by more sensationalist headlines (Demonic doll Chucky links the horror crimes; The curse of Chucky). Neither Powell or McNeilly owned a video recorder, and the Child's Play–inspired music that had been used to torture Capper was a popular track at the time, taped direct from Manchester's Piccadilly Radio. Broadcaster David Elstein called the video connection [...] "a false story... branded into the consciousness of the media," [...] and questioned the news media's fascination with the film: [...] "There is no reason to believe that Suzanne Capper [...] would be alive today if the audiotape had instead contained the torture scene from King Lear, or a catchphrase from Bruce Forsyth... But the Child's Play hare has been running ever since the last day of the James Bulger murder trial." [...] Elstein argued that the film was simply a scapegoat which the press [...] "made a three-course meal out of." [...] The Guardian reported that 21,000 four–nine-year-olds watched each of BSkyB's two transmissions of Child's Play 3 – but Elstein explained the figure was [...] "simply a projection based on an average of just two actual viewers from BARB's reporting panel, and that the margin of error means even the two may have been just one. But why spoil a good <b>running</b> <b>story</b> by asking what the figures mean?" ...|$|E

That came out of my love for comics and that style, the anthropomorphic animals, but also {{it was part of a}} <b>running</b> <b>story</b> line." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within {{the concept}} of the album, Ruben Sano was the leader of the fictitious Chicano band [...] "the Jets". The back cover {{depicted}} Ruben with an early high school photograph of Zappa. According to artist Cal Schenkel, [...] "I started working on the story of Ruben and the Jets that is connected with the Uncle Meat story, which is this old guy turns this teenage band into these dog snout people [...] We started that before it actually became Ruben and the Jets. That came out of my love for comics and that style, the anthropomorphic animals, but also {{it was part of a}} <b>running</b> <b>story</b> line." [...] The tongue in cheek liner notes declare that the band had eleven members and kept the name [...] "Reuben and the Jets" [...] even after Reuben quit the group: [...] "His girl friend said she would leave him forever if he didn't quit playing in the band and fix up his car so they could go to the drive-in and make out." ...|$|E

While Dacre said [...] "it is the duty of the media to take an ethical stand", according to Wilby [...] "his idea of ethics includes <b>running</b> <b>stories</b> that are, at best, distorted and, at worst, plain wrong".|$|R
