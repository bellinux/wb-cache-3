40|$|Accretionary lapilli {{evolution}} remains controversial. Based on field, modelling {{and rare}} geochemical studies most workers argue for formation and growth within an eruption plume, although recent studies suggest formation within a pyroclastic density current. Here we adopt an integrated field and geochemical approach to test existing models of formation. A sequence of massive lapilli tuffs and breccias from the Isle of Skye, NW Scotland, record deposition from the sustained {{passage of a}} pyroclastic density current. Accretionary lapilli in two vertically chemically zoned massive lapilli tuff units within this sequence display evolving chemical trends from core to rim. The accretionary lapilli formed initially as basaltic ash pellets in a co-ignimbrite plume before falling under gravity into the underlying density current, where they accreted progressively more evolved laminae. These laminae record <b>reverse</b> <b>tapping</b> of a magma chamber with sequential pulses of basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite magma being fed into the density current. Accretion of laminae was initially supported by available moisture and turbulence, but growth ceased with the input of dacitic magma and drier conditions. The accretionary lapilli were formed within a sustained pyroclastic density current, which demonstrates that accretionary lapilli are not necessarily formed by simple fallout from an ash plume. Our model demonstrates that accretionary lapilli {{may be used to}} trace physical and chemical characteristics of complex eruptions, and understand the magmas which fed those eruptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of the bark of rubber tree {{over a long period}} is a major concern for rubber planters in order to cope with problems of early replanting due to limited financial means. One of the efficient solutions to this concern is tapping with less longer tapping cuts. The reduction of the tapping cut length in <b>reverse</b> <b>tapping</b> permits to manage better the tapping panel, to improve the productivity of the tapper and to increase the economical life span of rubber trees. On that respect, a study was conducted during six years in south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to determine the}} length(s) of tapping cut, in downward tapping, which would provide a suitable solution to the problem of rubber farmers. The influence of the reduction of the tapping cut length on the parameters of yield, radial vegetative growth and physiological profile is evaluated in clones GT 1 and PB 235 of Hevea brasiliensis. Half, third, quarter and eighth spiral tapping cuts were compared to each other and to a full spiral cut (control). The reduction of the tapping cuts length induces losses in rubber yield compared with the control which yet are not proportional to the reduction of the tapping cuts length. The yield per centimetre of tapping cut is more important with the short cuts than the long cuts. Very strong correlations were determinate between tapping intensity and rubber yield, tapping intensity and annual mean girth increment and between tapping intensity and physiological parameters (DRC and Pi). The curve tendency equations were also determinate. In terms of rubber yield, the PB 235 fits the reduction of the tapping cut length better than the GT 1. The reduction of tapping cuts length favours a better vegetative radial growth. It does not impair the physiological profile of the trees which show signs of under-exploitation.

During the mission, the alien serving as the base commander is discovered to have psychic abilities, but is nevertheless defeated by the soldiers. The commander's psychic communication device is recovered and <b>reverse</b> engineered. <b>Tapping</b> into the aliens' communications reveals a previously hidden, stealth [...] "Overseer" [...] UFO making rounds across the Earth. When the UFO is shot down, it is found to hold an alien species {{that had not been}} previously encountered, as well as a strange psionic artifact.

40|$|The IEEE 802. 3 aq {{standard}} {{recommends a}} multi-tap decision feedback equalizer be implemented to remove inter-symbol interference and additive system noise from data transmitted over a 10 Gigabit per Second (10 Gbps) multi-mode fiber-optic link (MMF). The recommended implementation produces a design in an analog process. This design process is difficult, time consuming, and is expensive to modify if first pass silicon success is not achieved. Performing {{the majority of}} the design in a well-characterized digital process with stable, evolutionary tools reduces the technical risk. ASIC design rule checking is more predictable than custom tools flows and produces regular, repeatable results. Register Transfer Language (RTL) changes can also be relatively quickly implemented when compared to the custom flow. However, standard cell methodologies are expected to achieve clock rates of roughly one-tenth of the corresponding analog process. The architecture and design for a parallel linear equalizer and decision feedback equalizer are presented. The presented design demonstrates an RTL implementation of 10 GHz filters operating in parallel at 625 MHz. The performance of the filters is characterized by testing the design against a set of 324 reference channels. The results are compared against the IEEE standard group s recommended implementation. The linear equalizer design of 20 taps equalizes 88 % of the reference channels. The decision feedback equalizer design of 20 forward and 1 <b>reverse</b> <b>tap</b> equalizes 93 % of the reference channels. Analysis of the unequalized channels in performed, and areas for continuing research are presented. Ph. D.

5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then <b>reverse</b> the <b>tap</b> for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole is threaded.|$|R
40|$|Observational {{results from}} the CRRES {{satellite}} near times of substorm onsets support the theoretical premise that substorms initiate near the inner edge of the plasma sheet. The region is connected latitudinally to the equatorward-most pre-breakup arc. During the growth phase, the inner edge of the plasma sheet moves towards the earth. This motion is modulated by various cavity oscillations of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupled magnetosphere. This modulation can locally reverse the background convection electric field. The <b>reversed</b> convection <b>taps</b> energy stored in the inner-edge region of the plasma sheet. The near earth plasma sheet moves out of equilibrium with the lobes, and a rarefaction is launched tailward. This allows current driven dissipation to grow and a near-earth X-line to form. A model is presented which explains the observations of the CRRES satellite, and can account for the behavior associated with auroral intensification and substorm onset...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic normal {{pressure}} hydrocephalus (iNPH) is {{a highly}} prevalent condition in the elderly population; however, the underlying pathophysiology {{in relation to the}} aging process remains unclear. To investigate the effect of removal of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar “tap test” on the cerebral circulation in patients with iNPH, 14 patients with “probable” iNPH were studied using a novel blood tracking technique based on blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance signal intensity. By tracking the propagation of the low-frequency component of the BOLD signal, extended venous drainage times were observed in the periventricular region of the patients, which was <b>reversed</b> by <b>tap</b> test. Interestingly, the venous drainage time in the periventricular region exhibited an age-related prolongation in the healthy control group. Additional regression analyses involving 81 control subjects revealed a dissociation of deep and superficial venous systems with increasing age, presumably reflecting focal inefficiency in the deep system. Our results not only provide insights into the etiology of iNPH, but also point to a potential non-invasive biomarker for screening iNPH...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} three multiuser tap weight estimators for multipath channels in data aided (DA) and decision directed (DD) modes for a BPSK DS-CDMA <b>reverse</b> link. The <b>tap</b> weights are estimated using different algorithms working separately or jointly {{in order to obtain}} good estimates as required for coherent detection or synchronization purposes. The performance of these algorithms and their sensitivity to the observation window, to the delay estimation error and to the difference between successive delays are investigated.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} reinforcement effect of the Makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makinoi Hayata) root system on the stability of slopeland through numerical analyses and in situ tests. Based on the field surveys of Makino bamboo root morphology, a three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical model of the soil-root system consisting of the <b>reverse</b> T-shape <b>tap</b> root and hair roots was developed and successfully applied to the finite element simulations of in situ pull-out tests. In the simulations, the soil mass was simulated by a soil element with a perfect elastic-plastic (or Mohr-Coulomb) material model whereas the root system was simulated by a ground anchor element with a linear elastic material model. In addition, a mechanical conversion model with simple mathematical form, which enables a direct transformation of the ultimate pull-out resistance into the shear strength increment of soil-root system was proposed. The conversion model offered a convenient way to quantify the reinforcement effect of the Makino bamboo root system required for the 3 -D slope stability analyses. The numerical {{results indicated that the}} shear strength increment of the Makino bamboo soil-root system ranged from 18. 4 to 26. 3 kPa and its effect on the slope stability was insignificant when compared with those adverse influence factors such as the steep slope angle (= 50 - 70 degrees), shallow root depth (= 0. 8 - 1. 0 m) and large growth height (> 10 m) of the Makino bamboo forest slopeland. It can be also speculated that the tension cracks widespread over the slope surface due to the wind loading acting on the bamboo stems and the sequential rainwater infiltration is the dominating factor in the collapse failure of slopeland. For a Makino bamboo forest slopeland with medium slope (25 degrees 40 degrees). Conclusively, the contribution of the Makino bamboo root system to the stability of slopeland is not as significant as expected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{majority}} of elderly Americans have {{the bulk of}} their assets tied up in the houses they own. <b>Reverse</b> mortgages could <b>tap</b> this home equity, providing loan disbursements without requiring older homeowners to make monthly payments on principal and interest. In this paper we analyze the potential of using home equity to finance long-term care of the elderly, including payments for home care and for long-term care insurance. We first estimate each homeowner’s risk of need for care (and risk of institutionalization) and then calculate the degree to which home equity could be used to cover the costs of home care (or of insurance premiums). Special emphasis is placed on those in the highest risk group and on those with the lowest incomes, who often {{turn out to be the}} same people. Financing long-term care for the elderly poses severe problems for them, their families, and the general public. In the past 20 years, costs have mushroomed in spite of numerous efforts to hold them down. While the financial burden is carried in part by federal and state governments, much is borne privately. Half of the $ 25 billion annual nursing home bill is paid by the elderly themselves o...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} nose (e-nose) {{technology has}} rapidly {{evolved in the}} past decade with a range of applications in the food industry, medical diagnosis, and recently environmental monitoring. This {{is the first time that}} this technology has been examined in detail for a range of specific environmental applications including: detection of low concentrations of bacterial, fungal and heavy metal contaminants in potable water; analyses of changes in the microbial activity of soil samples amended with heavy metals; and the detection of fungal contaminants in paper samples from library material. In some studies comparisons between different e-nose systems has also been carried out. The e-nose system based on a conducting polymer (CP) sensor array Bloodhound (BH 114) was able to detect different bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes), initially inoculated in <b>tap,</b> <b>reverse</b> osmosis and bottled water with a concentration of 102 cells mL- 1, after 24 hrs incubation. In the presence of low concentrations (0. 5 ppm) of a mixture of heavy metal ions including cadmium, lead and zinc, the volatile pattern produced by the bacterial species was discriminated from that where no metal was added, probably due to a change in the microbial metabolism. The Bloodhound e-nose system was also used to detect fungal spores of Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium culmorum and a Penicillium species, inoculated in water samples. The initial concentrations were 102 – 105 spores mL- 1. Good discrimination was observed between the control samples after 24 hrs incubation at 25 oC. After 48 hrs incubation, it was possible to differentiate between the various spore concentrations present in water samples. Good reproducibility was achieved as results from different days were consistent and data could be pooled and combined for analysis. A comparative study was performed with three e-nose instruments, two of them had CP sensor arrays (Bloodhound (BH- 114)); Neotronics (eNOSE 4000), and the third was a metal oxide (MO) sensor-based system, the NST 3220. The experiments carried out with the CP based-systems showed similar results when analysing water samples contaminated with 104 and 102 bacterial cells mL- 1 after 24 hrs incubation. Both CP and MO based e-nose systems could differentiate control water samples from those contaminated with both bacteria and fungal spores. GC-SPME analyses confirmed the results obtained with the e-nose system of metal ions and bacterial cells in water samples. At-line studies were performed with the MO array-based system (NST 3220), for the detection of contamination episodes. E. coli and P. aeruginosa cells were used as contamination agents for <b>tap</b> and <b>reverse</b> osmosis sterile water, in two concentration levels, 102 and 106 cells mL- 1. The samples collected downstream in a simulated watercourse, were analysed by the e-nose over a period of 1 - 2 hrs. The results suggested the potential of this technique to monitor episodes of bacterial cells at a low concentration in water samples. Experiments performed in soil samples artificially and naturally contaminated with heavy metal ions were analysed with the MO-based e-nose system. Results indicated that for artificially contaminated soil samples, after 40 days incubation the control samples could be discriminated from those containing 3 and 100 ppm of metal ions. For naturally contaminated soils, the sensor array was only able to separate samples containing a high concentrations of metal ions. Headspace analysis of cellulose-based agar showed good discrimination between Aspergillus terreus, A. hollandicus and Eurotium chevallieri, after 20 hrs incubation at 25 oC. An increase in the incubation period to 40 hrs resulted in better separation between the control and fungal treatments. In situ studies performed on paper samples suggested that the e-nose was able to discriminate between control samples and paper inoculated with 103 fungal spores mL- 1. The substrate was a determinant factor in the headspace analysis of microbial species. It was shown that the same fungal species produced different volatile profiles according to the growth substrate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
