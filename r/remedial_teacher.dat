The results of this study indicated an agreement between the <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers</b> and previous research found regarding the use of technological learning aids, the adjustment made for students with dyslexia as well as using formative assessment. However, the <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers</b> appeared to show a divided approach to the aspect of focusing on grading requirements when supporting student with dyslexia in English. Since previous research on the area of working on grades appeared to be deficient, these finding could indicate a need for research of effective strategies to support students with dyslexia in developing and reaching higher grades in English. This study therefore concludes the necessity of further and wider research within the area of supporting student with dyslexia in the process of learning a foreign language...|$|R

On our partner schools, {{we have been}} facing but little information about how to invite the parents to collaborate with the school. Our thought is that the schoolwork is favorable to the pupils if both school and home are working together side by side. Therefore, we decided to dig deeper into this matter of how one particular school is working with parental collaboration, {{to be able to}} see if their method is useful. This particular school is offering studies in a course form so called family class. Here the pupils can get extra help from <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers</b> and their parents are also invited. At these lessons the parents are helping their child side by side with the teachers. We want to look further how this school actually works, whether this way of working is favorable or has a restraining influence on the pupil's education- with focus on a teacher´s perspective. The title “Parental collaboration- how to invite” is a result of our investigation of one school´s family classes. We have been interviewing teachers that are mentors for pupils in the family class, the pupils taking the course and also the responsible <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers</b> giving the course. The purpose of this research is to make a survey of theirs ideas about the school´s method and how the school operates in the relation between home and school.

Inclusion is {{not only}} about {{philosophy}} but more importantly about the practical changes that must be brought about {{in order to help}} all learners in our school system to excel and unfold their potential. Inclusive education can be seen as an approach that aims to transform our education system in order to respond to the diversity of learners. It aims to enable both teachers and learners to feel comfortable with diversity and to see it as a challenge and enrichment in the learning environment. Good teaching is good for all learners, irrespective of their differences and improved teacher training and on-going professional teacher support {{may be one of the}} most important strategies to create quality education for all. This research seeks to understand how a <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher</b> negotiated her role to that of a support teacher and to explore her experiences in providing support to a greater number of learners and teachers. This study was conducted at a primary school in Pinetown. A qualitative approach was used in conducting this research.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 252 - 280. Special Education {{encompasses}} a wide field. It {{is an expensive}} form of education and is often criticized for its shortcomings. One part of Special Education is remedial teaching for children with learning disabilities. In order to provide good quality services, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate what is currently being offered and what is envisaged as desirable for the future. This study focusses on those two factors by examining the perceptions of remedial teaching as held by educators (principals, regular class teachers and remedial teachers themselves) in fifty-two schools of the Department of Education and Culture - House of Representatives (DEC-HR). Current service provisions and the desired role of the <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher</b> are thus examined to determine whether educators perceive these as adequate and desirable. A study of the literature was undertaken and guided by those insights a questionnaire was drawn up. This was distributed to educators and the information was verified and augmented by personal interviews with remedial educators. Three hundred and twenty questionnaires were distributed. The views of principals, regular class teachers and remedial teachers were surveyed in those primary schools served by a <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher.</b> Descriptive statistical analyses were used to arrive at both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the position of Remedial Services in the Department of Education (House of Representatives). The study revealed a strong correspondence between the three groups of educators regarding their perception of remedial services. The author endeavours to illustrate that the lack of consensus about criteria for definition and classification of Learning Disability and consequently Remedial Education, leads to confusion of the role(s) remedial teachers are expected to fulfil. This affects the provision of adequate and effective remedial services to pupils in need of such specialised educational facilities. Results from this study led the author to draw up a proposed structure for Specialised Education, in particular, Remedial Education, in a unitary Education System in South Africa...|$|E

Altruism is opposed to selfishness, which is incompatible with disinterested concern {{for the welfare of}} others and willingness to sacrifice personal interests for them. The main driving force behind altruistic behaviour is a drive to improve the situation of others rather than expecting some reward.

40|$|The present thesis reports an {{empirical}} {{study of how}} ten <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers</b> or special <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers,</b> all women, encountered reality as supervisors or tutors in schools during the 1990 s. The study sought to define the conditions for supervision and tutoring in the remedial-teaching function. Data was collected in two steps. The preparatory step consisted of a scrutiny of Report DsU 1986 : 13 on the modified remedial-teacher function, and perusal of the referees’ comments thereon. The second step consisted ofinterviews with all ten participants three years after their training as supervisors/tutors at the Stockholm Institute of Education. Neither in the above Report nor in the referees’ comments was supervision defined or discussed. Despite this resistance, supervision is required by the macro level for the modified remedial-teacher function. Regarding the micro-level situation for supervising in school, two themes were distinguished: an organisational theme and a legitimacy theme. The informants saw school management, the organisation’s pre-understanding of supervision and the profession’s continual adaptation to areas of knowledge not possessed by teachers as important aspects. The legitimacy theme expresses how differentiation of the supervisory task and the design of teaching posts influence the implementation. The supervision/tutoring examined here is described through six experiential themes: the dialogical here-and-now-theme, the relational theme, the didactic ”technical” theme, the reflective and self-fostering theme, the change theme and the leadership theme. Remedial-educational supervision {{as described in the}} study appears as vertical but does not extend to the depth of therapeutic intervention. It is seen as an ethical act where consideration or recognition, rather than care, is a distinctive feature. Care may represent ”tacit” gender-loaded knowledge and needs to be discussed in educational contexts where supervision or tutoring is included in the special-remedial-teacher function...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{internship}} was to implement a motivationally based remedial reading program, using principles of behaviour modification, designed to improve the performance of seven grade five children who were severely retarded in reading and were apathetic to improvement. A related aim was to provide school personnel with some evaluative data concerning the efficacy of behaviour modification as a practical technique to apply in the remediation of reading difficulties. [...] Subjects {{of the study were}} five girls and two boys who lived in the Shea Heights area of St John's. They ranged in chronological age from twelve to fourteen and in mental age from 8 - 4 to 12 - 5 years. The students attended St. John Bosco School where they received regular class instruction which was supplemented by help in reading given in another classroom by a <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher.</b> Each student had a history of academic failure and was retarded by at least two years in reading achievement. Most were from low socioeconomic families and all were highly negative in their attitudes toward school. [...] The internship covered a period of approximately seven weeks. During this time the intern worked with the subjects' <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher</b> in carrying out the procedures designed to fulfill the purposes of the study. These procedures included diagnosing the subjects' instructional needs in reading, planning and implementing effective remedial reading instruction, and establishing a token reinforcement system whereby students received reward contingent upon their performance in specified reading activities. [...] The effectiveness of the internship in achieving its purposes was reflected by desirable changes in students' reading achievement, productivity, class attendance, and attitudes toward school. The subjects showed gains in reading achievement of 0. 3 years in vocabulary and 0. 8 years in comprehension which, when compared with anticipated growth, were statistically significant for comprehension (p. 10). The students accomplished more and better work. Attendance figures improved for those whose rate of absenteeism had been high. Attitudes toward school became more positive through increased enjoyment of remedial class sessions and heightened enthusiasm for school work.

Specifically, its main purpose is to explore how the teaching and learning process of the remedial reading is conducted and what are the factors that support or hinder the success of the activities. The respondents of the study consisted of 27 Year 1 remedial pupils, school administrators (Head Mistress and Academic Senior Assistant), the <b>Remedial</b> <b>Teacher,</b> Bahasa Melayu subject teachers of those remedial pupils, School Counsellors, Media Teacher, remedial pupils’ parents and Ministry Officials who are responsible for the Remedial Programme in the Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) and the State Education Department of Selangor. This study was conducted as a case study. The study focussed on the following aspects: how the remedial reading activities were implemented, and what are the factors that support or hinder the success of the implementation of the activities. The data collection is conducted through observation, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis in relation with remedial reading activities in the sample school. Three types of instruments were prepared to provide guidelines for the data collection namely, Interview Schedule, Anecdotal Observation Guidelines, and Document Analysis Guidelines. The documentation and data analysis was carried out simultaneously to maintain the validity of the data. In order to produce a holistic thick-description of the research, the data analysis was obtained in two phases, i. e., during and after the data collection. The impact of the research was observed through the sharing of ideas in the focus group in order to triangulate and maintain validity of the data. The researcher employed a narrative approach to report the findings vi in accordance with the respective groupings and sub-groupings which is based on the objectives and the research questions of the study. The result of the overall remedial reading activities in the school sample has shown that the activities, which were carried out at the operational/implemenatiton level, have been carried out in tandem with the Remedial Programme Guidelines of the MOE with some adjusted elements from the Remedial Teacher’s experieces and creativity to fulfill the requirements and the needs of the remedial pupils. The findings of the research concurred that <b>Remedial</b> <b>Teacher,</b> remedial programme facilities (infrastucture), the related teaching and learning remedial reading materials and support system at all levels formed the four critical success factors of the remedial reading activities implementation. On the contray, failure to pay attention to these same four factors could also contribute to the hinderence of a successful implementation of the remedial reading activities, besides the quality of the pupils and parental factors, ability of the pupils to understand the phonemic and semantic system of the learned language, in this case, Bahasa Melayu, and the interference of the pupils’ native language. Accordingly, all the factors that help in the success of the remedial reading activities should be strengthened whereas those factors that hinder its success should be remedied in order to reduce and to completely abolished the illiteracy rate among the primary school children...|$|E
40|$|Abstract All {{students}} in the Swedish elementary school that do not reach the educational objectives in mathematics have a legal right to receive support {{in order to reach}} these objectives. An action plan shall be created, where it should be visible what supportive measures the student is given to reach the objectives. The purpose of our final thesis is to investigate how the action plan can contribute to the work with students that experience difficulties within mathematics. The study is performed on 7 - 9 th grade schools, and the empirical material is gathered through reading of hundreds of action plans, observations, and interviews of students, teachers, remedial teachers and headmasters. The theoretical frame used is hermeneutics, constructivism and perspective on special education. The result of the study is that action plans do {{play an important role in}} the work with students that experience difficulties within mathematics, but the quality of the programs seems to vary. Some action plans are clearly stated, contain tangible actions, both on individual as well as on a group level, that help the student in their learning, whereas other programs are unclear and aimed only at what the student himself should perform to reach the objectives, i. e. only on an individual level. The remedial teaching support is often categorical, they are assuming that the student is the owner of the problem, and the support is also given from that perspective. That means that the student is given support in the format of individual education by a <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher</b> or by education in a smaller group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to study which methods teachers are using to develop children’s reading and writing skills. The purpose is also to investigate necessarily conditions to individualize the teaching of reading and writing. The qualitative research is {{based on interviews with}} six elementary school teachers. The interviewed teachers think {{that it is important to}} see every child individually to be able to develop the reading and writing skills. Education can only be stimulating and delightful when it is individualized. In spite of this, the result shows that the majority of the teachers are using only one method when teaching children reading and writing. The teachers agree that there should be collaboration with the children’s previous teachers to be able to know each child faster. Mapping and documentation are also useful for teachers. The result of the study also shows that computers and fiction books are good complements to the regular reading and writing teaching. The most common reading and writing methods among the teachers are a combination of the sound imitating method and the full word method. Success in individualizing depends on the access of <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher</b> and the number of stand by teachers. Furthermore, it is immensely important that all teaching is well thought-out and well planned, according to the interviewed teachers. My conclusions are that teachers have to offer a lot of different methods in order to get all children the same conditions for their learning. I feel that it’s important to meet and see every child and their needs. To be able to do so teachers must vary their approach when children learn to read and write...|$|E

40|$|This {{study shows}} how two {{different}} schools use dogs {{as a method}} of education. The purpose was to find out what kind of pedagogical thoughts my informants have about children' slearning in their connection with dogs, and in which way the interaction between the children and the dogs could affect the learning ability. I also wanted to find out what kind of possibilities and restrictions the dogs could give to the education according to my informants but also to find out how the projects were financed. To be able to answer these questions I put together a qualitative study, I had four interviews with people that were involved in the projects in one way or the other. To analyse the empirical material I looked up different theories about teaching, communication, interaction and motivation. My results showed that both schools have applied the method of “teaching dogs” as a form of resource for students with special needs. One of the two schools only applies the method on one class consisting of six students and their <b>teachers,</b> who are <b>remedial</b> <b>teachers.</b> The other school cooperates with a company that educates therapy dogs. The dog handlers, who don't have a <b>remedial</b> <b>teacher's</b> education, come every week with one or two dogs. All students in the school who are in need of extra support can work with the dogs after an investigation made by the health department at the school. All my informants believe that the project has given positive results such as the notification that students are more motivated, communicate and interact better with each other and the teachers. The students are also happier and have a higher regularity of attendance in school than before. But the project requires {{a lot of money and}} also needs to be thought through thoroughly because of allergies and the risks of dogs causing any kind of physical damage.
