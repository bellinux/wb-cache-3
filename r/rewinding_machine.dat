In brief, the comparison of results obtained by nonlinear real-time control with pre-identification, and by adaptive real-time control with on-line identification was performed. The <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine</b> was controlled by PC from MATLAB's Real-Time Toolbox using technological card, terminal board and wires. Each of two used approaches has its advantages and its drawbacks, which was proven, and nonlinear control {{seemed to be more}} suitable for the <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine,</b> minimally because of the action signal history from the nonlinear control, the action is more consistent.

Surakarta: Industrial Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Sebelas Maret University, Juli 2007. PT. Tomoko Daya Perkasa {{is one of}} {{the company}} in a {{metallizing}} industry. The most often material handling equipment using by production division is handlifter. It can be seen at frequency usage of highest material handling appliance for the handlifter. The prime situation from material handling problems, early from less fluent of material intake in floor and in rewindingslitting machine. This matter because of handlifter cannot conducting of material intake which is in form of coil at location in floor and in <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine</b> directly. Other problem at the of conducting of material intake that is in <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine,</b> operator have to use appliance assist. At material intake in floor also there are additional constraint, besides operator have to use the appliance assist, the operator also have to push material to part of lifter.

In order to link up the product innovation design and the knowledge required by the designer, the iterative method of quality function knowledge deployment is refined, as well as the knowledge retrieval model and knowledge support model based on quality function knowledge deployment are established. In the whole life cycle of product design, in view of the different requirements for knowledge in conceptual design stage, components’ configuration stage, process planning stage, and production planning stage, the quality function knowledge deployment model could link up the required knowledge with the engineering characteristics, component characteristics, process characteristics, and production characteristics in the four stages using the mapping relationship between the function characteristics and the knowledge and help the designer to track the required knowledge for realizing product innovation design. In this article, an instance about <b>rewinding</b> <b>machine</b> is given to demonstrate the practicability and validity of product innovation design knowledge support technology based on quality function knowledge deployment...|$|E

5000|$|User {{data was}} {{originally}} stored on cassette tape. Radio Shack's model CTR-41 cassette recorder was {{included with the}} US$599 package. The software-based cassette tape interface was very slow and erratic; Green described it as [...] "crummy ... drives users up the wall", and {{the first issue of}} 80 Micro had three articles on how to improve cassette performance. It was sensitive to audio volume changes, and the machine gave only the very crudest indication as to whether the correct volume was set, via a blinking character on screen while data was being loaded. To find the correct volume, one would sometimes have to attempt to load a program once, adjusting volume until the machine picked up the data, then reset the <b>machine,</b> <b>rewind</b> the tape and attempt the loading again. Users quickly learned to save a file three or more times in hopes that one copy would prove to be readable. Automatic gain control or indicator circuits could be constructed to compensate for this (the owner's manual provided complete circuit diagrams for the whole machine, including the peripheral interfaces, with notes on operation).|$|R

A Toyota car alternator taken from a junkyard is characterized via an Open-Circuit test to evaluate its operating specifications. The car alternator is also measured to determine its physical dimensions. The acquired values are used with the generated voltage equation to determine the machine’s unknown rotor values— {{the product of the}} rotor winding factor and the number of rotor windings (kfNf). Using the generated voltage equation with the determined machine parameters, the number of stator windings required for the machine to generate power at low speeds is determined. The alternator’s stator is then rewound and remounted to the body of the machine for testing. Inexpensive scrap materials are used to reduce the cost of the project and to simulate the experience of executing such a project in an environment where high-end tools are not accessible. The methods to disassemble the <b>machine,</b> <b>rewind</b> its stator and reassemble the alternator are noted and recorded to develop a guide that will be accessible to the public...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{automotive}} {{electrical power}} system {{is based on an}} engine-driven alternator regulated at 14 V which charges a 12 V battery and delivers power to the loads. Installed electrical power is growing rapidly with model year, and future electrical power requirements are expected to exceed the capability of the present 14 V system by about 2005. A high/dual-voltage electrical system is necessary to meet these requirements. A new alternator system which substantially improves the present Lundell alternator design is proposed. This new system can double the output power and greatly improve efficiency without the need to <b>rewind</b> the <b>machine.</b> Inherent load-dump transient suppression and jump-start charging features are also achieved. The attributes of this novel system have been experimentally demonstrated. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate and develop analytical system and subsystem models for dual/high-voltage automotive electrical systems. Detailed time-domain and simplified averaged models for synchronous machines and three-phase rectifiers with constant-voltage loads are developed. A load-matching technique based on a switched-mode rectifier is introduced and used in conjunction with the developed machine/rectifier models to design the new high-power, highefficiency alternator system. Analytical models for two dual-voltage systems, one based on interleaved dc/dc converters and the other on a dual-stator Lundell alternator, are developed and used to investigate their characteristics. The analytical models for the dc/dc converter system are used in the design of a prototype which experimentally demonstrates the high performance features of the system while verifying the analytical results. A comparison of the characteristics of dual/high-voltage architectures is presented and it is shown that the load-matching technique {{can be used in a}} number of dual-voltage systems to improve performance. An attractive complete dual-voltage system, which incorporates the new alternator and a dc/de converter, is introduced. by Vahe Caliskan. Thesis (Sc. D.)

5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into narrower rolls. There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form narrower rolls. The multiple narrower strips of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For <b>rewind</b> slitting the <b>machine</b> used is called a slitter rewinder, a slitter or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|R
