Such <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> content constitutes “content-chaining” of digital media, including texts from across the spectrum of other virtual platforms (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc.; Fig.  14) and media (TV, newspapers, blogs, etc.; Figs.  2, 3, 7, 9, 12, 14). Content-chaining is marked by the modality pluralism of languaging in digital spaces (see also Gynne and Bagga-Gupta 2015; Messina Dahlberg 2015). Content-chaining often has the goal of presenting a convergence of a specific message (this includes, but is not restricted to, party slogans; Figs.  10, 14); it also highlights some news or event (Fig.  2). Party symbols and colors are also important dimensions of content-chaining.|$|R

40|$|The leftmost {{portion of}} the {{coliphage}} T 7 genome is transcribed by the RNA polymerase Escherichia coli immediately after infection. This "early" operon is delineated by three promoters on the left, and a transcriptional terminator on the right. The terminator is efficient both in vivo, and with highly purified RNA polymerase in vitro. We have studied termination in vitro, using synchronously initiated transcription reactions with low enzyme:DNA ratios. We show that recognition of the stop signal and release of RNA product are relatively rapid. Dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA is quite slow, and probably rate-limiting for <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> the polymerase. It is well established that the sigma subunit of RNA polymerase is required for specific initiation, but redundant during RNA elongation.

40|$|We {{introduce}} an {{in silico}} {{model for the}} initial spread of an aberrant phenotype with Warburg-like overflow metabolism within a healthy homeostatic tissue in contact with a nutrient reservoir (the blood), aimed at characterizing {{the role of the}} microenvironment for aberrant growth. Accounting for cellular metabolic activity, competition for nutrients, spatial diffusion and their feedbacks on aberrant replication and death rates, we obtain a phase portrait where distinct asymptotic whole-tissue states are found upon varying the tissue-blood turnover rate and the level of blood-borne primary nutrient. Over a broad range of parameters, the spreading dynamics is bistable as random fluctuations can impact the final state of the tissue. Such a behaviour turns out to be linked to the <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> overflow products by non-aberrant cells. Quantitative insight on the overall emerging picture is provided by a spatially homogeneous version of the model. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{discovery}} of two distinct succinate thiokinases in mammalian tissues, one (G-STK) specific for GDP/GTP {{and the other}} (A-STK) for ADP/ATP, poses the question of their differential metabolic roles. Evidence {{has suggested that the}} A-STK functions in the citric acid cycle in the direction of succinyl-CoA breakdown (and ATP formation) whereas one role of the G-STK appears to be the <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> succinate to succinyl-CoA (at the expense of GTP) for the purpose of ketone body activation. A third metabolic participation of succinyl-CoA is in haem biosynthesis. This communication shows that in chemically induced hepatic porphyria, when the demand for succinyl-CoA is increased, it is the level of G-STK only which is elevated, that of A-STK being unaffected. The results implicate G-STK in the provision of succinyl-CoA for haem biosynthesis, a conclusion which is further supported by the observation of a high G-STK/A-STK ratio in bone marrow...|$|R

40|$|The {{filamentous}} cytoskeletal systems fulfil seemingly incompatible functions {{by maintaining}} a stable scaffolding to ensure tissue integrity and simultaneously facilitating rapid adaptation to intracellular processes and environmental stimuli.

This cycle of assembly and disassembly is independent of protein biosynthesis and consists of distinct, temporally and spatially defined steps.

40|$|Contaminated {{soils are}} a large issue {{worldwide}} and much effort {{has been made to}} find efficient remediation methods. At many contaminated sites, mixtures of dif­ferent contaminants with different properties are present, which may lead to addi­tional problems, and thus additional costs, during the remediation process. This thesis presents the results from soil remedia­tion of two mixed contaminated soils, containing explosives and heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and arsenic, respectively. The re­sults demonstrate that bioremediation may be an efficient method for moderate explosives concentration, but that too high contaminant concentrations may prevent the biodegradation, measured by both chemical and ecotoxicological analyses. If the contaminant concentration is very high, soil washing with alkaline pH (~ 12, NaOH) may be a good alterna­tive, which was observed to remove both explosives and heavy metals. For a PAH and arsenic contaminated soil, little degradation of organics was ob­served during the bioremediation. However, the arsenic present was re-distributed in the soil, which could poten­tially lead to increased availability and thus in­creased risk for contaminant spreading. Soil washing at alkaline pH (~ 12 - 13; Ca(OH) 2) with a combination of a biodegradable non-ionic sur­factant and a biodegradable chelating agent, executed at high temperature (50 °C), reached treatment goals for both arsenic and PAH after 10 min treatment. Measurement of ecotoxicity using Microtox® demonstrated that remaining surfactant in the soil may lead to increased toxicity despite lower con­taminant concentrations. Soil is a basically non-renewable resource and thus <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> remediated soil ought to be commonly occurring. Yet, the <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> remediated masses has so far been limited in Sweden, mainly because of the risk of spreading of pollu­tant remains. However, a recent proposition from the Swedish EPA opens for re-cycl­ing, even though the thresholds are very con­servative. Risk assessment of the re­mediated soil includes the utilization of leach­ing tests to estimate the risk of spreading of remaining pollutants. A comparison of the leaching from four reme­diated soils using three different leaching solutions reveals that leaching of both heavy metals and PAH occurs. In addition, differ­ences between different legisla­tions were observed, which could imply that the same soil could be re-cycled in one country (the Netherlands) but not another (Sweden) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} microbial communities {{on the degradation of}} arsenoribosides from E. radiata tissues decomposing in sand and seawater-based microcosms. During the first 30 days, arsenic was released from decomposing E. radiata tissues into seawater and sand porewaters in all microcosms. In microcosms containing autoclaved seawater and autoclaved sand, arsenic was shown to persist in soluble forms at concentrations (9 - 18 µg per microcosm) far higher than those present initially (~ 3 µg per microcosm). Arsenoribosides were lost from decomposing E. radiata tissues in all microcosms with previously established arsenoriboside degradation products, such as thio-arsenic species, dimethylarsinoylethanol (DMAE), dimethylarsenate (DMA) and arsenate (AsV) observed in all microcosms. DMAE and DMA persisted in the seawater and sand porewaters of microcosms containing autoclaved seawater and autoclaved sand. This suggests that the degradation step from arsenoribosides → DMAE occurs on algal surfaces, whereas the step from DMAE → AsV occurs predominantly in the water-column or sand-sediments. This study also demonstrates that disruptions to microbial connectivity (defined as the ability of microbes to recolonise vacant habitats) result in alterations to arsenic cycling. Thus, the <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> arsenoribosides released from marine macro-algae is driven by microbial complexity plus microbial connectivity rather than species diversity as such, as previously assumed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ion {{microprobe}} dating of zircons from post-collapse rhyolites at Yellowstone caldera {{reveals the}} time scales of crystallization and storage of silicic mag-ma in a differentiating magma reservoir, the role <b>of</b> <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> crystals from the caldera-forming magmatism, {{and the timing}} and efficacy of crystal-melt separation. Zircons in the voluminous (900 km 3) Central Plateau Member lavas, which progressively erupted between 70 to 160 ka, yield 238 U – 230 Th disequilibrium ages dom-inantly spanning the range from those of their respective eruptions to 200 ka; mean zircon ages range to ca. 60, 000 years before eruption. When considered together with the trace element and Sr- and Nd-isotope compo-sitions of their host melts, the age distributions of the CPM zircons show that the rhyolites are cogenetic and differentiated {{tens of thousands of}} years prior to eruption from an evolving magma reservoir. Thus, the post-caldera CPM rhyolites were not erupted from a long-standing body of rhyolitic magma left over from the caldera-forming eruption, nor do they represent significant remobilization of the plutonic roots of the caldera. Rather, the CPM magma was generated and differentiated by episodes of effective crystal-melt sepa-ration at 200 and 125 ka and, sustained by thermal inputs, stored for timescales on par with estimates for other voluminous caldera-related rhyolites...|$|R

In this study, we established highly metastatic GC cell lines by in vivo selection designed for the enrichment of PD-associated GC cells. By microarray analysis, we found C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4) can be a novel marker for highly metastatic CSCs, since CXCR 4 -positive cells can grow anchorage-independently, initiate tumors in mice, be resistant to cytotoxic drug, and produce differentiated daughter cells. In clinical samples, these CXCR 4 -positive cells were found from not only late metastasis stage (accumulated ascites) but also earlier stage (peritoneal washings). Moreover, treatment with transforming growth factor-β enhanced the anti-cancer effect of docetaxel via induction of cell differentiation/asymmetric cell division of the CXCR 4 -positive gastric CSCs even in a dormant state. Therefore, differentiation inducers hold promise for obtaining the maximum therapeutic outcome from currently available anti-cancer drugs through <b>re-cycling</b> <b>of</b> CSCs...|$|R

This has been done to obtain the true release rate of thyroidal-I 131.

At the level of 0. 05 % tapazole used up to this time, it has been noted that tapa-zole even with thyroxine administration tended to reduce egg production and feed consumption and birds sometimes began to molt. It has been suggested, also, that goi-trogens may influence thyroxine secretion. Sell and Balloun (1960) reported an in-creased occurrence of capillary rupture in the thyroids of cockerels treated for four weeks with tapazole.
