Further research interests are the regulation and structure of financial institutions, security design and capital structure. Special focus in his research goes out to <b>relationship</b> <b>banking,</b> an important and returning topic in many of his publications (see the following publications; Relationship Banking: What Do We Know?, 2000, Journal of Financial Intermediation; Can <b>Relationship</b> <b>Banking</b> Survive Competition?, 2000, Journal of Finance). The potential friction between short-term oriented transactional activities and a longer term relationship-oriented focus has his particular interest. He has published in major international academic journals such as the American Economic Review, the Journal of Finance, and the Review of Financial Studies.

5000|$|Some {{argue that}} the creditor-debtor long term {{relationship}} arises from the valuable [...] "inside information" [...] revealed via repeated bank-firm interactions. This [...] "inside information" [...] reduces the information asymmetries and identifies the most productive firms (those with lower default risks). Hence the bank is able to better allocate financial resources and ensure that more capital goes to higher quality firms. This view is usually referred to as <b>relationship</b> <b>banking,</b> and it has attracted significant research interests {{in the field of}} finance. The empirical evidence for <b>relationship</b> <b>banking</b> is mixed. A recent study shows [...] "that repeated borrowing from the same lender translates into a 10-17 basis points lowering of loan spreads and that relationships are especially valuable when borrower transparency is low" [...] by using data from the US, However, using survey data from Japan, another recent study finds that the long term relationship between borrower and lender [...] "in some cases increased cost, from stronger relationships for opaque borrowers and for borrowers who get funding from small banks. These latter findings suggest the possibility that relationship borrowers may suffer from capture effects".|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that banks often engage in refinancing of intrinsically insolvent debtors instead of writing of their non-performing loans.

40|$|A vast {{research}} in banking addresses {{the question of}} {{the costs and benefits of}} multiple <b>bank</b> <b>relationships</b> versus a single <b>bank</b> <b>relationship.</b> Although no clear-cutting conclusion is reached, several contributions suggest that multiple <b>bank</b> <b>relationships</b> might lead to a suboptimal level of monitoring, compared to a single <b>bank</b> <b>relationship,</b> as a result of free riding and coordination problems. We take a novel approach to tackle this research question, by looking at the role, if any, played by the number of lending relationships in initial public offerings (IPOs). We look at the short-term performances of IPOs as measured by underpricing and find that firms that go public with multiple <b>bank</b> <b>relationships</b> exhibit more underpricing than those that go public with a single <b>bank</b> <b>relationship.</b> This finding is independent of the number of <b>bank</b> <b>relationships</b> and/or whether any of the lending banks also acts as underwriter in the offering. We interpret our results as suggesting that the market attributes a weaker certification role to multiple <b>bank</b> <b>relationships</b> because of their less effective monitoring of IPO firms...|$|R

5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{features}} of financial deepening is that it accelerates economic growth through the expansion of access {{to those who do}} not have adequate finance themselves. Typically, in an underdeveloped financial system, it is the incumbents who have better access to financial services through <b>relationship</b> <b>banking.</b> Moreover, incumbents also finance their growth through internal resource generation. Thus, in an underdeveloped financial system, growth is constrained to the expansion potential of incumbents. In mature financial systems on the other hand, financial institutions develop appraisal techniques, and information gathering and sharing mechanisms, which then enable banks to even finance those activities or firms that are at the margin, thereby leading to their growth-inducing productive activities in addition to the incumbents. It is this availability of external finance to budding entrepreneurs and small firms that enables new entry, while also providing competition to incumbents and consequently encouraging entrepreneurship and productivity.|$|E

The merger, however, quickly turned disastrous as efforts to consolidate operations, which were placed on an ambitious timetable, led to major problems.

40|$|All {{families}} have assets. Strengthening them {{is critical for}} a healthy family life. This NebGuide presents several opportunities for doing that. The Family <b>Relationship</b> <b>Bank</b> Account Successful family living requires two bank accounts: a financial account, which allows the purchase of goods and services, and a relationship account, which promotes sustainability, bonding and togetherness.

The <b>relationship</b> <b>bank</b> account metaphor instructs the family to make deposits on a regular basis to increase asset reserves. Like the financial bank account, the balance in the family <b>relationship</b> <b>bank</b> account is constantly changing with its inputs and outflows.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} <b>bank</b> <b>relationships</b> on a firm’s cost of debt. We focus on relationships with the main bank. We find that a firm’s cost of debt decreases with relationship strength, proxied by the share of bank debt provided by the main lender, but rises with relationship length. While the increase over time is weak on average, bank-dependent borrowers face a significant premium after several relationship years. Moreover, cost of debt increases with concentration in the lender’s portfolio. Switching the main lender initially leads to only a small price discount on average. However, the discount is considerable for borrowers that switch and had a strong relationship to the previous main lender. Our {{results indicate that the}} information advantage acquired by the <b>relationship</b> <b>bank</b> leads to benefits for the firm, but also to potential hold-up costs in the long-term.
