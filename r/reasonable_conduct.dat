60|$|Plum Point {{looked as}} it had always looked by night, with the {{exception}} that now there were beacons to mark the crossings, and {{also a lot of}} other lights on the Point and along its shore; these latter glinting from the fleet of the United States River Commission, and from a village which the officials have built on the land for offices and for the employees of the service. The military engineers of the Commission have taken upon their shoulders the job of making the Mississippi over again --a job transcended in size by only the original job of creating it. They are building wing-dams here and there, to deflect the current; and dikes to confine it in narrower bounds; and other dikes to make it stay there; and for unnumbered miles along the Mississippi, they are felling the timber-front for fifty yards back, with the purpose of shaving the bank down to low-water mark with the slant of a house roof, and ballasting it with stones; and in many places they have protected the wasting shores with rows of piles. One who knows the Mississippi will promptly aver--not aloud, but to himself--that ten thousand River Commissions, with the mines of the world at their back, cannot tame that lawless stream, cannot curb it or confine it, cannot say to it, Go here, or Go there, and make it obey; cannot save a shore which it has sentenced; cannot bar its path with an obstruction which it will not tear down, dance over, and laugh at. But a discreet man will not put these things into spoken words; for the West Point engineers have not their superiors anywhere; they know all that can be known of their abstruse science; and so, since they conceive that they can fetter and handcuff that river and boss him, it is but wisdom for the unscientific man to keep still, lie low, and wait till they do it. Captain Eads, with his jetties, has done a work {{at the mouth of the}} Mississippi which seemed clearly impossible; so we do not feel full confidence now to prophesy against like impossibilities. Otherwise one would pipe out and say the Commission might as well bully the comets in their courses and undertake to make them behave, as try to bully the Mississippi into right and <b>reasonable</b> <b>conduct.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Brazilian {{competition}} law establishes that {{every kind of}} economic power abuse is against the economic order, hence, anticompetitive. The classic example of anticompetitive conduct is price fixing or cartel. The main challenge regarding {{the implementation of a}} public policy against such horizontal collusions is to adequately show that an agreement among competitors exists, especially in oligopolistic markets. Our hypothesis is the following: if the administrative {{competition law}} does not require an agreement in order to label a conduct abusive, it should be legally possible to reach unwanted coordinated market behavior {{even in the absence of}} an agreement. However, as tacit collusion results exclusively from converging individual interests (spontaneous cooperation), there is no <b>reasonable</b> <b>conduct</b> order available to courts to remedy such evil in case of conviction. The Unified Theory of Collusion is proposed as a means to partially overcome the referred practical limitation, by offering a possibility of restricted, but uniform legal treatment. At the end, a step-by-step guideline for analysis of cartel and tacit collusion cases is provided...|$|E

40|$|The general {{principles}} {{to be applied}} by court or jury in deciding whether conduct is reasonable have been examined elsewhere.

In analyzing these problems it must be borne constantly in mind that rules which enlarge the jury 2 ̆ 7 s function work on the whole towards expanding liability, while rules whereby the law fixes specific standards or requires special modes of proof tend to narrow the jury 2 ̆ 7 s role and, on the whole, to restrict liability and the possibilities for compensating accident victims...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{challenges}} the core assumptions on behavior within the commercial transport sector. It is often {{taken for granted}} that actors intend to follow public regulations and that the authorities’ enforcement of criminal liability is a sufficient measure to ensure the expected behavior. Despite limited access to accident data on root causes, we claim that risk in the transport sector has changed significantly {{over the past ten}} years. Professional competence increasingly appears to mean competence in the art of bending rules and regulations. The reasons for this perturbing trend need to be investigated. In this article we restrict our analysis to the elucidation of different categories of rule-bending, in the light of possible rationalities for such behaviors. The study does not aim to present evidence of any breaches of law but is rather an attempt to illustrate issues in a sector that is very difficult to regulate, emphasizing the key forces that influence safety-related aspects of the transport sector. For this purpose we need to address the holistic transport chains in the search for multiple attribute preferences in which safety, economy and power play major roles. Finally, we propose the development of much-needed standards of sound professional practice and <b>reasonable</b> <b>conduct...</b>|$|E
40|$|Typical {{consequences}} {{of child sexual}} abuse, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (‘PTSD’), prevent many survivors of this abuse bringing civil legal proceedings within the statutory time limit. On discovering {{the nature and extent}} of their psychiatric injury, or its connection with the abuse, survivors may apply to the court for an extension of time to allow their claim to proceed. Outcomes of these applications often turn on judgments about the survivor’s knowledge of the injury and its cause, and about whether the survivor has taken reasonable steps to discover the nature, extent and cause of their injuries. Reported cases of applications for extensions of time in this context are rare, but Queensland has an emerging body of decisions. These cases demonstrate that judgments about the issues of knowledge and <b>reasonable</b> <b>conduct</b> are made without considering evidence about the symptomatology of PTSD, especially the avoidance criterion. This article summarises the {{consequences of}} child sexual abuse, focussing on PTSD, before outlining the statutory provisions for extensions of time. Case studies of applications by survivors with PTSD to extend time are then synthesised. The psychological evidence is used as a standard against which to analyse judicial reasoning about survivors’ knowledge and ‘reasonable’ conduct. Finally, the question of whether PTSD can constitute a legal disability in the context of an application for an extension of time is addressed. Because similar questions are raised by extension provisions in nearly all Australian jurisdictions, the analysis in this article has implications for future cases in both Queensland and other jurisdictions...|$|E

40|$|The Representation of Renewable Energy in Postimees Online This bachelor’s thesis {{focused on}} {{analysing}} {{the representation of}} renewable energy in Postimees Online in the year 2008. The research {{was based on the}} representation theory by Stuart Hall. To compare the media representation with real-life, energy situation and public opinion in Estonia was described. In addition, all the main terms were explained. The conducted analysis covered 174 articles from the chosen period. The selection was analysed using content analysis. Author’s main aim was to find out which renewable energy sources were represented and how they were depicted, who were used as sources of information and what was their attitude towards renewabel energy. Author illustrated the gained results with qualitative text samples from the analysed articles. It is concluded that almost every type of renewable energy was reflected in the analysed articles. The texts focused mainly on wind-, bio- and solar energy which reflected the real-life situation in the given period. Renewable energy as a wider term was also used very often. Other types of renewable energy were rarely written about. The main spokespersons concerning renewable energy were the investor and developers of the renewable energy projects and they spoke mainly about positive aspects of renewable energy. Their ability to influence the representation was also supported by {{the fact that many of}} the articles published without an author were recognisably developers’ press releases. Estonian politicians were also often sources of information and they were also favorably inclined. Scientist and local residents were used as sources more rarely. The outcome of the analyse proved that different aspects are being focused on concerning different types of renewable energy and it would be <b>reasonable</b> <b>conduct</b> additional research on these types. It is also concluded that the argumentation of different spokespersons should be analysed to disclose the presence of discussion, shared language and shared knowledge...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} {{directly}} measure {{the importance of}} queries in the source domain to the target domain where no rank labels of documents are available, which {{is referred to as}} query weighting. Query weighting is a key step in ranking model adaptation. As the learning object of ranking algorithms is divided by query instances, we argue that it’s more <b>reasonable</b> to <b>conduct</b> importance weighting at query level than document level. We present two query weighting schemes. The first compresses the query into a query feature vector, which aggregates all document instances in the same query, and then conducts query weighting based on the query feature vector. This method can efficiently estimate query importance by compressing query data, but the potential risk is information loss resulted from the compression. The second measures the similarity between the source query and each target query, and then combines these fine-grained similarity values for its importance estimation. Adaptation experiments on LETOR 3. 0 data set demonstrate that query weighting significantly outperforms document instance weighting methods. ...|$|R

40|$|The DGPS (Differential GPS) and EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) systems {{belong to}} a group of systems {{supporting}} the global satellite system GPS (Global Positioning System).

The analysis of the positioning accuracy of GPS leads to the conclusion: from year to year the accuracy of the positioning determination increases. The effect of the permanent increasing of the GPS positioning accuracy is the parallel increasing of the positioning accuracies of all the supporting systems.
