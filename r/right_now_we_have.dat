As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J.

Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so {{there is no question that}} there is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E

In this paper we will review the prospects for physics at the CDF and DØ experiments. Topics ranging from QCD, to electro-weak precision measurements, to top-quark physics, to searches for the Higgs boson and signals of physics beyond the Standard Model will be discussed. B-Physics at the Tevatron is covered in a separate contribution to these proceedings. We will outline how upgrades to the accelerator and the detectors make these studies possible with precisions higher than ever achieved previously and will show results from the first data collected in Run II. These results give us confidence in our ability to achieve ambitious physics goals, and point the way toward a bright future for the Tevatron. “High energy physics is a particularly exciting field <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> ” <b>We</b> <b>have</b> all heard that statement so many times that it has begun to ring rather desperately in our ears.
