40|$|The Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 th December 2004 was {{a series}} of giant sea waves {{unleashed}} by the massive earthquake beneath the sea with its epicentre located about 250 km South East of Sumatra, Indonesia. The huge waves of tsunami lashed across thirteen countries of the world, one among the worst hit being India. Tsunami caused considerable destruction and causalities in the coastal regions of the states including Tamil Nadu, Pondichery, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. In Kerala, 187 villages were affected, <b>registering</b> <b>a</b> <b>death</b> toll of 180 persons and huge damage to assets and livelihood. This study was conducted at different landing centres in the tsunami affected regions of Kerala. The impact of tsunami on the fisheries was catastrophic {{as in the case of}} other affected segments, impinging on the livelihood of already poverty stricken fisher households. Non-mechanized and motorized segments were the worst affected among different sectors of marine fisheries. Maximum reduction in landings was experienced by plank-built boats with gillnet (motorized) and country crafts with gillnets (non-mechanized) ...|$|E

5000|$|Registration in the UK is {{organised}} {{separately in}} the constituent jurisdictions. <b>A</b> <b>register</b> of <b>deaths</b> contains the information supplied by an informant, nowadays usually containing and repeating the information given in a Medical Certificate of Death (MCOD) {{supplied by the}} medical practitioner who certifies that life is extinct, this being the real [...] "death certificate" [...] distinct from the [...] "registration of a death" [...] in <b>a</b> <b>register.</b> Further information might be added after the first registration if the death {{was the subject of}} an inquest (Northern Ireland or England and Wales) or a Fatal Accident Inquiry (Scotland); this can result in a later copy of <b>a</b> <b>death</b> registration giving more details of the cause of death or the associated circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Background: {{there is}} limited {{understanding}} of symptoms and care {{in the last few}} months of life for adults dying from causes other than cancer. Objective: the aim of the study is to compare the experiences in the community in the last 3 months of life of older adults dying from cancer and non-cancer causes. Design: the study employed a retrospective cross-sectional survey of bereaved relatives. Setting: the survey took place across eight cancer networks in England. Subjects: a random sample of 1, 266 adults who <b>registered</b> <b>a</b> <b>death</b> occurring in someone aged 65 and over between August 2002 and February 2004 was drawn. Methods: VOICES (Views of Informal Carers—Evaluation of Services) questionnaires were sent to sampled informants by the Office for National Statistics 3 – 9 months after the registration of the death. Differences in the reported experiences of cancer and non-cancer decedents in symptoms, treatment and care were assessed using Pearson’s chi square test. Results: cancer decedents were significantly more likely than non-cancer decedents to have had pain (93 vs 79 %, P < 0. 001), nausea and vomiting (62 vs 40 %, P < 0. 001) and constipation (74 vs 66 %, P = 0. 03), whilst a greater proportion of non-cancer decedents experienced breathlessness (74 vs 65 %, P = 0. 006). Across both groups, less than half of the decedents were reported to have received treatment which completely relieved their symptoms some or all of the time. There were significant variations in the receipt of district nursing, general practitioner care and other health and social care and the reported quality of this care, for decedents dying of cancer and non-cancer causes. Further, informants for cancer deaths reported greater satisfaction with support received. Conclusions: there are important differences in the reported experiences of older adults dying from cancer and non-cancer causes in the last months of life, independent of age...|$|R

5000|$|Don Circostanza is {{the real}} enemy {{of the people of}} Fontamara, even though he is known as LAmico del Popolo (the friend of the people) ( [...] p. 74), always greets them one by one, and shouts Long live my Fontamaresi. He is a lawyer and does nothing but cheat them and always acts in favour of the most powerful. He can be read as a {{caricature}} of the role played by {{a large part of the}} professional class under Fascism, for instance those lawyers and accountants who purported to represent the workers in wage negotiations and accept wage reductions on their behalf. Physically he is described as With a melon hat, a spongy porous nose, ears like fans and belly at the third stage (of his concertina trousers) ( [...] p. 73) and regarding his character, Giuvà says in his narration that he always had a goodwill for the people of Fontamara, he was our Protector, and talk of him would require a long litany. He has always been our defence but also our downfall. All the disputes of Fontamara passed through his office. And most of the chickens and eggs of Fontamara over 40 years ended up in Don Circostanzas kitchen ( [...] p. 73). The author describes how he cheats the villagers. In order to get votes in elections, he sent a teacher to teach the cafoni to write his name so that In this way when they went to vote, not knowing what to write, they would write his name on their ballot paper. To get even more votes, as he was the one to <b>register</b> <b>a</b> <b>death,</b> when someone died he paid the family five francs and kept the names on the electoral roll and voted for them. [...] "The living betray me, Don Circostanza reproached me bitterly, but the blessed souls of the departed remain faithful to me." [...] Another scam is when they are discussing the water, he says that the water will be returned not after 50 years but after 10 lustri (5-year periods) ( [...] p. 183), knowing that the cafoni dont know how long a lustro is. He also buys Berardos piece of land at a very low price when Berardo is hoping to go to America, even though he knows that the emigration laws have come into effect and knows that Berardo will not in fact be able to emigrate. He also decreases the workers pay in Fontamara to 40% under the new law.|$|R
40|$|Stroke is {{the third}} {{leading cause of death}} in the UK. Despite this, {{little is known about the}} care needs of people who die from or {{following}} a stroke. In early 2003, a total of 183 questionnaires were returned from a survey of 493 people who had <b>registered</b> <b>a</b> stroke-related <b>death</b> in four Primary Care Trusts, giving a response rate of 37 %. This paper reports on 53 deceased from the survey who had lived at home during their last 3 months and who had been ill for more than 1 month. The data were analysed to explore the role of informal carers and the provision of community-based care in the last 3 months of life. Family and friends helped 82 % of deceased with household tasks, 68 % with personal care, 66 % with taking medication and 54 % with night-time care. By contrast, health and social services helped 30 % with household tasks, 54 % with personal care, 20 % with taking medication and 6 % with night-time care. Two-fifths (43 %) of informants had to give up work or make major life changes to care for the deceased, and 26 % of informants found looking after them ‘rewarding’. Half (51 %) reported that help and support from health services were excellent or good compared to 38 % for social services. Results from the Regional Study of Care for the Dying indicated that people who died from a stroke in 1990 and their informal carers would have benefited from increased levels of community-based care and enhanced communication with care professionals. Our data suggest that informal carers continue to provide the majority of care for those who die from stroke, despite government initiatives to improve care for stroke patients and frail elderly people. Further research is required to explore best practice and service provision in caring for this group. <br/...|$|R
