40|$|The Elastomeric {{materials}} have found {{use in a}} wide range of applications, including hoses, tires, gaskets, seals, vibration isolators, bearings and dock fenders. The analysis of <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> for its compression and shear behavior has been carried out using the imaging techniques. The dynamic stressing and its associated change in shape of the <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> during large compression are very limited as their measurements were difficult. A newly developed Machine Vision based image processing test has been effectively used to study the deformation characteristics of the <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> under large strains. An extended analysis on the <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> has been carried out to understand the compression and deformation behavior in static and dynamic condition and the nonlinear behavior were also characterized. The <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> of distinguished geometries have shown diverse change in shape and nonlinear deformation behavior under compression/shear loading...|$|R

5000|$|Kraton {{polymers}} are styrenic {{block copolymer}} (SBC) consisting of polystyrene blocks and rubber blocks. The rubber blocks consist of polybutadiene, polyisoprene or their hydrogenated equivalents. The tri-block with polystyrene blocks at both extremities linked {{together by a}} <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> {{is the most important}} polymer structure observed in SBC. If the <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> consist of polybutadiene, the corresponding triblock structure is: poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) usually abbreviated as SBS. Kraton D (SBS and SIS [...] ) and their selectively hydrogenated versions Kraton G (SEBS and SEPS) are the major Kraton polymer structures. The microstructure of SBS consists of domains of polystyrene arranged regularly in a matrix of polybutadiene, as shown in the TEM micrograph. The picture was obtained on a thin film of polymer cast onto mercury from solution, and then stained with osmium tetroxide.|$|E
50|$|Rubber pad forming (RPF) is a {{metalworking}} {{process where}} sheet metal is pressed between a die and a <b>rubber</b> <b>block,</b> made of polyurethane. Under pressure, the rubber and sheet metal are {{driven into the}} die and conform to its shape, forming the part. The rubber pads can have a general purpose shape, like a membrane. Alternatively, they can be machined {{in the shape of}} die or punch.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the first}} batch was {{delivered}} the next three batches were the Leopard 1A1 model, which included a new gun stabilization system from Cadillac-Gage, allowing the tank to fire effectively on the move. The 1A1 also added the now-famous [...] "skirts" [...] along the sides to protect the upper tracks, and a new thermal jacket on the gun barrel to control heating. A less important change was to use rectangular <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> fastened to the treads with a single pin instead of the earlier two-pin [...] "shaped" [...] versions. The <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> could be easily replaced with metal X-shaped crampons for movement on ice and snow in the winter.|$|R

50|$|The book {{electrode}} {{consists of}} a silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> with slots. Each slot contains three platinum foils which function as electrodes, anode electrodes and one cathode. The spinal roots of the nerve are placed into these slots and the slots are then covered with a flap made of silicone and fixed with silicone glue. This electrode is mostly used to interrupt reflex circuits of the dorsal sacral roots and to control bladder function. Book electrodes are still considered very bulky.|$|E
50|$|The export plan never materialised and the Milemaster, {{with its}} modest specificationhand gear change and bicycle seatand lacking rear suspension, was marketed instead in the United Kingdom until 1952. In 1949, Tandon {{introduced}} the 122 cc Superglid featuring conventional foot gear-change {{and a new}} frame with swinging-arm rear suspension. However, the suspension itself was highly unusual with damper units being replaced by a bell crank linked to rubber bands for suspension and a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> for compression action, all located under the gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Three {{versions}} of the front suspension were installed in the cars (aside from the rubber-disc style used on the prototype). Cars #1001-1002 used a rubber torsion tube design, which suffered from severe toe-in during heavy braking. Tucker then switched to a rubber sandwich type suspension (with a <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> sandwiched between {{the upper and lower}} A-arms) on cars #1003-1025, however this type was severely stiff. Starting on car #1026, Tucker finally settled on a suspension design with {{a modified version of the}} rubber torsion tube with the toe-in braking problem corrected.|$|E
50|$|On 14 October 1931 Vauxhall {{announced}} their Silent 80 with a quieter engine, constant mesh 3rd gear and quieter gearbox. Car bodies were now mounted on <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks,</b> {{and they were}} given a chromium-plated shell for the radiator, large hubs with chromium hubcaps and new body styles.|$|R
5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber damper. The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks.</b> This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression type coil springs placed between the input and output shafts of the cush drive assembly.|$|R

50|$|In American {{football}} and its variants, a tee {{may be used}} on kickoffs to raise the ball slightly above the playing surface (up to one inch, by NFL and NCAA rules). First use of the tee is attributed to Arda Bowser, {{a member of the}} Canton Bulldogs NFL championship team of 1922. The CFL and some high school leagues also allow the use of tees on field goal and extra point kicks, where another player (the holder) places one end of the ball on the tee (usually just a <b>rubber</b> <b>block)</b> and holds the opposite end.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} petrol versions {{were given}} type numbers that indicate their features. The first production started with Type 501, then with advancements like a starter motor a Type 502 was later released. The 501 model, built from 1957 to 1959, had {{the rear wheel}} supported on one side only and suspended by a <b>rubber</b> <b>block.</b> The later 502 model had a full fork with motorcycle shock absorbers. These types contain sub-types to further indicate their features, for example Type 502/00 is a 12V model with electric starter, and a Type 502/01 is a 6V model with foot-crank starting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a Dutch Anker [...] 2-stroke, {{situated}} between the rear wheels. The pressed-steel forward {{section of the}} frame, supported by torsion bars, could swivel to enable the rider to lean the vehicle into bends like a motorcycle. The front [...] "fork" [...] was a single-sided down tube with a rudimentary <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> suspension. All three pressed steel wheels were interchangeable. Drive was to {{just one of the}} rear wheels, and only one of the rear wheels had a brake, a small drum item. There was a similar front drum brake. A true moped, the Ariel 3's engine was started by first pedalling and then releasing a decompressor trigger. The rider could assist the little motor on hills by pedalling. The six volt headlight was single beam, with no dip. There was no rear suspension.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years great efforts were {{directed}} to the numerical description of the sliding behavior of <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> on various surfaces {{by means of the}} Finite Element (FE) Method. Two major mechanisms of the load trans-fer of traction forces can be observed depending on the characteristics of the sliding surface. On ªsoftº sur-faces, i. e., snow surfaces, the pene-tration of the sliding surface by <b>rubber</b> <b>blocks</b> results in a resistance against sliding motion. This resistance per-mits in addition to the frictional pro-cess the transfer of traction forces. Such a mechanism may be viewed as an ªedge effectº. On ªhardº surfaces a frictional mechanism is responsible for the transfer of the traction forces. In this paper details of different ef-fects of both mechanisms are ex-plained. For both of them appropriate numerical models were established. Das Reibungsverhalten von Gummi auf Schnee- un...|$|R

5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a die cast metal piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger screws holding the neck on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the split line between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's SG series have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black plastic nut, mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated metal with plastic skirts. As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} thin adhesive layer on the modulus of an elastic <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> bonded between two plates. The plates were assumed to be rigid, both in extension and flexure, and subjected to vertical compression loading.

There was a good agreement between both methods. The modulus of the bonded <b>rubber</b> <b>block,</b> defined as effective modulus, was then studied. The effective modulus was increased by the factor (1 + (a/ 2 t) 2 (6 G r h/G a t+ 1) - 1), which is composed of the shape factor of the <b>rubber</b> <b>block</b> (a/ 2 t, ratio of the bonded and unbonded areas), and the shear stiffness factor (G r h/G a t, ratio of modulus and thickness of rubber and adhesive).
