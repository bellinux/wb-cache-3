40|$|O presente estudo teve como objetivo {{investigar}} a influência da postura corporal na execução do movimento de alcance em quatro lactentes a termo, saudáveis, com idade de 4 meses de vida. A condição experimental consistia na apresentação de dois brinquedos, alternadamente, na altura dos ombros dos lactentes. Após o alcance, o brinquedo era retirado e apresentado novamente, durante um período de dois minutos para cada brinquedo ou até que o lactente realizasse 10 alcances. Este procedimento foi repetido nas posturas supina (0), reclinada (45) e sentada (70), sendo a ordem escolhida de forma aleatória. As avaliações foram filmadas e analisadas pelo sistema Dvideow, com objetivo de verificar o comportamento das variáveis cinemáticas de ângulo de ombro (flexão/extensão e abdução/adução) e cotovelo (flexão/extensão), índice de retidão (distância percorrida pela mão durante o alcance dividido pela distância entre os pontos de início e fim) e tempo (segundos) em cada uma das três posições, além da freqüência de alcances unimanuais e bimanuais. O método estatístico empregado para o índice de retidão foi o teste t-Student e para a freqüência de alcances, a análise por variância (ANOVA). A partir dos resultados obtidos constatamos que houve diferença entre a freqüência de alcances unimanuais e bimanuais (p= 0, 0341) na postura sentada. A freqüência de alcances na postura sentada foi maior que na supina (p= 0, 038). Em relação ao índice de retidão, o teste indicou diferença significativa entre as posturas supina e reclinada (p= 0, 001) e entre supina e sentada (p= 0, 002). Os lactentes gastaram o mesmo tempo no alcance nas 3 posturas. Na análise dos ângulos, apenas dois lactentes usaram o mesmo padrão motor para as três posições. Baseando-se na abordagem dos sistemas dinâmicos, verificamos que o alcance ainda é um padrão instável de comportamento, o qual pode ser modificado pela posição do lactente. Cada lactente possui uma dinâmica intrínseca e responde de maneiras diferentes à restrição do ambiente imposta por meio das diferentes posições do corpo. The aim of {{this work}} {{was to investigate the}} influence of body posture during reaching movements in four healthy, four-month-old infants. Experimental conditions consisted of presenting two toys alternately, at the infants midline and shoulder levels and midway between the infants shoulder and wrist. After the reaching, the toy was taken away and given back again for a period of two minutes (for each toy) or until the infant reached for it a total of ten times. This procedure was repeated at the supine <b>posture</b> (0), a <b>reclined</b> <b>posture</b> (45) and a sitting posture (70). We randomized this order these positions. The results were recorded on video and analyzed using the Dvideow system for the purpose of checking the kinematics of the angle of the shoulder (flexion/extension and abduction/aduction) and elbow flexion/extension). Also, we analyzed the rectitude index (the distance traveled by the hand during a reaching movement divided by the distance between the starting and the end points), time (in seconds) {{in each of the three}} positions, as well as the frequency of reaching unimanually and bimanually. The statistical method used for the rectitude index was t-Student test and for the frequency of reaching was the analysis of variance (ANOVA). From the results showed that there were differences between the frequency of reaching unimanually and bimanually (p-value= 0, 0341) in sitting posture. The frequency of reaching was more in sitting posture than in supine posture. In relation to the rectitude index, the test showed a significant difference between the supine and <b>reclined</b> <b>postures</b> (p-value= 0, 001) and the supine and sitting postures (p-value= 0, 001). The infants spent the same time reaching in the tree postures. When analyzing the angles, only two babies used the same movement pattern for the three positions. We concluded that, the age of 4 months, reaching does not follow a stable pattern, which can be modified by the position of the infant. Each infant has its own intrinsic dynamics and reacts in different ways to the environmental restrictions imposed by different body positions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determined}} how backrest inclination and {{the frequency}} and magnitude of vertical seat vibration influence vibration discomfort. Subjects experienced vertical seat vibration at frequencies in the range 2. 5 to 25 Hz at vibration magnitudes in the range 0. 016 to 2. 0 ms^- 2 r. m. s. Equivalent comfort contours were determined with five backrest conditions: no backrest, and with a stationary backrest inclined at 0 degree (upright), 30, 60 and 90 degree. Within all conditions, the frequency of greatest sensitivity to acceleration decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. Compared to an upright backrest, around the main resonance of the body, the vibration magnitudes required to cause similar discomfort were 100 % greater with 60 -degree and 90 -degree backrest inclinations and 50 % greater with a 30 -degree backrest inclination. It is concluded that no single frequency weighting provides an accurate prediction of the discomfort caused by vertical seat vibration at all magnitudes and with all backrest conditions. Practitioner Summary: Vertical seat vibration is a main cause of vibration discomfort for drivers and passengers of road vehicles.

However, whereas participants in most psychological experiments sit upright, many modern neuroimaging techniques (e. g., fMRI) require participants to lie supine.

The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder belt with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more <b>reclined</b> initial <b>postures</b> and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap belt guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap belt anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower belt anchorage locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on belt restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|R
