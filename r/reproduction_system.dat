5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher than what it could earn, Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound <b>reproduction</b> <b>system</b> that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E

25|$|Disregarding intermediates, {{the basic}} {{distinction}} between asexual and sexual reproduction {{is the way}} in which the genetic material is processed. Typically, prior to an asexual division, a cell duplicates its genetic information content, and then divides. This process of cell division is called mitosis. In sexual reproduction, there are special kinds of cells that divide without prior duplication of its genetic material, in a process named meiosis. The resulting cells are called gametes, and contain only half the genetic material of the parent cells. These gametes are the cells that are prepared for the sexual reproduction of the organism. Sex comprises the arrangements that enable sexual reproduction, and has evolved alongside the <b>reproduction</b> <b>system,</b> starting with similar gametes (isogamy) and progressing to systems that have different gamete types, such as those involving a large female gamete (ovum) and a small male gamete (sperm).|$|E
25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as phototypesetting, utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs {{on a film}} strip (in {{the form of a}} film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the <b>reproduction</b> <b>system</b> used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

This paper examines 3 D sound <b>reproduction</b> <b>systems</b> using spherical arrays of fixed-directivity loudspeakers which reduce the sound field radiated outside the array. A generalized form of the simple source formulation and a mode-matching solution are derived for the required loudspeaker weights. The exterior field is derived and expressions for the exterior power and direct to reverberant ratio are derived. The theoretical results and simulations confirm that minimum interference occurs for loudspeakers which have hyper-cardioid polar response...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Inbreeding {{depression}} in plants, caused by selfing or crossing among plants {{with a high}} degree of relatedness, is a genetic phenomenon that affects quantitative traits. This study aimed at verifying the occurrence of inbreeding {{depression in}} crambe progenies originated from selfing, in comparison with open pollination progenies. A randomized blocks design, with three replications, in a 32 x 2 factorial arrangement, with 32 crambe progenies and two <b>reproduction</b> <b>systems</b> (artificial selfing and open pollination), was used. Grain yield, 1, 000 -grain weight, plant height and final stand were evaluated. A significant interaction was observed between progenies and <b>reproduction</b> <b>systems</b> in all traits evaluated. A reduction in grain yield, 1, 000 -grain weight and plant height occurred in the majority of the selfing progenies, when compared to open pollination progenies. Inbreeding depression was observed in all traits, especially for grain yield.

40|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of spatial audio <b>reproduction</b> <b>systems</b> available, from a single {{loudspeaker}} to many spatially distributed loudspeakers. An important factor in the selection, development, or optimization of such systems is listener preference, and the important perceptual characteristics that contribute to this. An experiment was performed to determine the attributes that contribute to listener preference for a range of spatial audio reproduction methods. Experienced and inexperienced listeners made preference ratings for combinations of seven program items replayed over eight <b>reproduction</b> <b>systems,</b> and reported the reasons for their judgments. Automatic text clustering reduced redundancy in the responses by approximately 90 %, facilitating subsequent group discussions that produced clear attribute labels, descriptions, and scale end-points. Twenty-seven and twenty-four attributes contributed to preference for the experienced and inexperienced listeners respectively. The two sets of attributes contain a degree of overlap (ten attributes from the two sets were closely related); however, the experienced listeners used more technical terms whilst the inexperienced listeners used more broad descriptive categories...|$|R
