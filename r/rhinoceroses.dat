5|$|The {{superfamily}} Rhinocerotoidea, {{which includes}} modern <b>rhinoceroses,</b> {{can be traced}} back to the early Eoceneabout 50 million years agowith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; Amynodontidae, Rhinocerotidae ("true rhinoceroses"), and Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and squat, semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most <b>rhinoceroses</b> have a pi-shaped (π) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil <b>rhinoceroses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{primitive}} <b>rhinoceroses,</b> {{the front}} teeth of Paraceratherium {{were reduced to}} {{a single pair of}} incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and have been described as tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known <b>rhinoceroses,</b> this arrangement is unique to Paraceratherium and the related Urtinotherium. The incisors may have been larger in males. The canine teeth otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large diastema (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (π) pattern and a reduced metastyle. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar {{was the size of a}} human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans, though they were small relative to the size of the skull. The lower cheek teeth were L-shaped, which is typical of <b>rhinoceroses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ancestral <b>rhinoceroses</b> first diverged {{from other}} perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA {{comparison}} suggests {{the ancestors of}} modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} white <b>rhinoceros</b> or southern square-lipped <b>rhinoceros</b> (Ceratotherium simum simum), {{is one of}} the two subspecies of {{the white}} <b>rhinoceros</b> (the other being the Northern white <b>rhinoceros).</b> It is the most common and widespread subspecies of <b>rhinoceros.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{last major}} {{eruption}} {{occurred in the}} late Miocene, about 7million years ago. The resulting stratum, the Rattlesnake Formation, lies {{on top of the}} Mascall and is capped by an ignimbrite. The Rattlesnake stratum has fossils of mastodons, camels, <b>rhinoceroses,</b> the ancestors of dogs, lions, bears, and horses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later <b>rhinoceroses</b> were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other <b>rhinoceroses,</b> Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern <b>rhinoceroses.</b> Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and <b>rhinoceroses</b> are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. The ears of elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, {{this would have been}} true for Paraceratherium; he points to robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea.|$|E

5|$|Elephants, lions, buffalo, hippopotamuses, <b>rhinoceroses,</b> giraffes, antelopes, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, {{and many}} species of snakes are found here, {{although}} most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced since the early 20th century. Elephant poaching, particularly {{in the south of}} the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem. The small group of surviving West African crocodiles in the Ennedi Plateau represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.|$|E
5|$|Sumatran <b>rhinoceroses</b> {{were once}} quite {{numerous}} throughout Southeast Asia. Fewer than 100 individuals are now estimated to remain. The species is classed as critically endangered (primarily due to illegal poaching) while the last survey in 2008 estimated that around 250 individuals survived. From the early 1990s, the population decline {{was estimated at}} more than 50% per decade, and the small, scattered populations now face high risks of inbreeding depression. Most remaining habitat is in relatively inaccessible mountainous areas of Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The family Rhinocerotidae {{consists}} of only four extant genera: Ceratotherium (White <b>rhinoceros),</b> Dicerorhinus (Sumatran <b>rhinoceros),</b> Diceros (Black <b>rhinoceros)</b> and <b>Rhinoceros</b> (Indian and Javan <b>rhinoceros).</b> The living species fall into three categories. The two African species, the white <b>rhinoceros</b> {{and the black}} <b>rhinoceros,</b> belong to the tribe Dicerotini, which originated in the middle Miocene, about 14.2 million years ago. The species diverged during the early Pliocene (about 5 million years ago). The main difference {{between black and white}} rhinos is the shape of their mouths - white rhinos have broad flat lips for grazing, whereas black rhinos have long pointed lips for eating foliage. There are two living Rhinocerotini species, the Indian <b>rhinoceros</b> and the Javan <b>rhinoceros,</b> which diverged from one another about 10 million years ago. The Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> is the only surviving representative of the most primitive group, the Dicerorhinini, which emerged in the Miocene (about 20 million years ago).|$|R
50|$|The Northern Sumatran <b>rhinoceros</b> (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis), {{also known}} as Chittagong <b>rhinoceros</b> or {{northern}} hairy <b>rhinoceros</b> was the most widespread subspecies of Sumatran <b>rhinoceros,</b> also the only known subspecies native to mainland Asia whilst the latter live in Indonesian islands.|$|R
50|$|The black <b>rhinoceros</b> (Diceros bicornis) is a large, thick-skinned {{herbivore}} {{having one}} or two upright horns on the nasal bridge. <b>Rhinoceros</b> may refer to either black or white <b>rhinoceros.</b> Among big five game hunters, the black <b>rhinoceros</b> is preferred, although it is now critically endangered.|$|R
5|$|Remains {{assignable}} to Paraceratherium {{have been}} found in early to late Oligocene (34–23 million years ago) formations across Eurasia, in modern-day China, Mongolia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Balkans. Their distribution may be correlated with the palaeogeographic development of the Alpine-Himalayan mountain belt. The range of Paraceratherium finds implies that they inhabited a continuous landmass with a similar environment across it, but this is contradicted by palaeogeographic maps that show this area had various marine barriers, so the genus was successful in being widely distributed despite this. The fauna which coexisted with Paraceratherium included other <b>rhinoceroses,</b> artiodactyls, rodents, beardogs, weasels, hyaenodonts, nimravids and cats.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in {{the late}} Miocene contributed to the Mascall Strata, layers of stream-deposited {{volcanic}} tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses, camels, <b>rhinoceroses,</b> bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12million years ago. The fossils of oak, sycamore, maple, ginkgo, and elm trees reflect the area's cool climate during this time period.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{established}} a diplomatic {{presence in the}} Tarim Basin of Central Asia during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC). Han envoys brought gifts of sheep, gold, and silk to the urban oasis city-states. The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency; however, silk was favored {{as a means to}} pay for food and lodging. Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and {{established a}} Protectorate there, Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging. These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs, precious stones, and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court. The Arsacid court sent exotic animals including lions and ostriches to the Han court, and a king ruling in what is now Burma sent elephants and <b>rhinoceroses.</b> Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits.|$|E
50|$|The Asiatic <b>rhinoceros</b> beetle, coconut <b>rhinoceros</b> beetle or {{coconut palm}} <b>rhinoceros</b> beetle, (Oryctes <b>rhinoceros)</b> is {{a species of}} <b>rhinoceros</b> beetle {{belonging}} to the Scarabaeidae family. O. <b>rhinoceros</b> attacks the developing fronds of Raffia, coconut, oil, and other palms in tropical Asia {{and a number of}} Pacific islands. Damaged fronds show typical triangular cuts. The beetle kills the palms (particularly newly planted ones) when the growing point is destroyed during feeding. The larvae do not damage crops, but instead grow in dead, decaying trunks and other organic matter.|$|R

50|$|The black <b>rhinoceros</b> or hook-lipped <b>rhinoceros</b> (Diceros bicornis) is {{a species}} of <b>rhinoceros,</b> native to eastern and {{southern}} Africa including Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Although the <b>rhinoceros</b> {{is referred to as}} black, its colors vary from brown to grey.|$|R
5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan <b>rhinoceroses</b> are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. Other studies have suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species. The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago, or as far back as 25.9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data.|$|E
5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern <b>rhinoceroses,</b> whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{are part}} of a group of exotic animals that are the core of zoo {{exhibits}} since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, <b>rhinoceroses,</b> hippopotamuses, large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can reach an age of over 20 years in captivity; Apollo, a resident lion of Honolulu Zoo in Honolulu, Hawaii, died at age 22 in August 2007. His two sisters, born in 1986, were still alive in August 2007. Breeding programs need to note origins to avoid breeding different subspecies and thus reducing conservation value. However, several Asiatic-African lion crosses have been bred.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the most}} {{widespread}} of Asian <b>rhinoceroses,</b> the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, {{with a population of}} as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. A second population in Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam was confirmed as extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression.|$|E
5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white <b>rhinoceroses,</b> grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
