In this paper, {{we propose}} a domain and genre-independent {{approach}} {{to identify the}} discourse relation called attributive, included in Grimes ’ <b>relation</b> <b>list</b> [7]. An attributive relation provides details about an entity or an event or {{can be used to}} illustrate a particular feature about a concept or an entity. Since attributive relations describe attributes or features of an object or an event, they are often used in text summarization (e. g. [2]) and question answering systems (e. g. [12]). However, to our knowledge, no previous work has focused on tagging attributive relations automatically. We propose an automatic domain and genre-independent approach to tag attributive relations by utilizing dependency relations of words based on dependency grammars [3]. In this paper, we also show how attributive relations can be utilized in text summarization. By using a subset of the BLOG 06 1 corpus, we have evaluated the accuracy of our attributive classifier and compared it to a baseline and human performance using precision, recall, and F-Measure. The evaluation results show that our approach compares favorably with human performance. ...|$|E

40|$|Terminological {{resources}} have traditionally focused on terms referring to entities, thereby ignoring other important concepts (processes, events and properties) in specialized fields of knowledge. Consequently, {{large parts of}} the conceptual structure of these fields are not taken into consideration nor represented. In this article, we show how terms that refer to processes and events (and, to a lesser extent, properties) can be characterized using Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1982) and the methodology developed within the FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al., 2010). More specifically, we applied the framework to a subset of terms in the field of the environment. Frames are unveiled first by comparing similarities between the argument structures of terms already recorded in a terminological database and the relationships they share with other terms. A comparison is also carried out with the lexical units recorded in FrameNet. Then, relations between frames are defined that allow us to build small conceptual scenarios that are specific to the field of the environment. These relations are determined {{on the basis of the}} set of <b>relations</b> <b>listed</b> in the FrameNet project. This article reports on the methodology, the frames defined up to now and two specific conceptual scenarios (Risk_scenario and Managing_waste). ...|$|R
