5|$|Continued drought, <b>road</b> <b>competition,</b> and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to <b>road</b> <b>competition,</b> and closed in 1935.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century brought {{increasing}} <b>road</b> <b>competition,</b> {{and this}} led the Great Southern Railways {{to close the}} Clifden branch in 1935. In the 1970s the state railway authority Córas Iompair Éireann closed the Sligo-Athenry-Ennis line to passenger services. It later closed to freight as well.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s and 30s {{and again}} after the Second World War the {{railways}} also faced increasing <b>road</b> <b>competition.</b> The L closed its line in 1953, followed by the CDRJC in 1954. The Ulster Transport Authority took over the NCC in 1949 and the GNR's lines in Northern Ireland in 1958. The UTA also took over the LPHC railway, which it closed in 1962. In accordance with The Benson Report submitted to the Northern Ireland Government in 1963, the UTA closed the former GNR line to Derry in 1965.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{appeared to}} endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2billion), but did so largely for political reasons. This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs. The dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, {{and a lack of}} standardisation. At the same time containerised freight was being developed. The marshalling yard building programme was a failure, being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon load traffic in the face of increasingly effective <b>road</b> <b>competition,</b> and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight.|$|E

500|$|Victoria {{does not}} have a {{dominant}} mining base as with other states, and has traditionally been more dependent on agriculture for rail freight traffic. In the early 20th century rail was a [...] "common carrier" [...] and was required to carry almost any freight offered. After World War I <b>road</b> <b>competition</b> increased, until in 1933 legislation was passed to regulate trucks competing with rail on specific routes. From 1974 to the 1980s intrastate road freight was deregulated, and rail [...] "common carrier" [...] obligations were removed, resulting in the loss of to road of much non-bulk freight. In 1987 10.51 million tonnes of freight was carried by rail, with bulk grain being the main commodity consisting of 31.4% of traffic.|$|E
2500|$|The Plymouth to Yealmpton Branch was a Great Western Railway {{single track}} branch railway line in Devon, England, that ran from Plymstock to [...] The line was planned {{as part of}} a route to Modbury, but the scheme was cut back to Yealmpton; it opened in 1898, and the {{passenger}} train service ran from , but <b>road</b> <b>competition</b> led to declining usage and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1930.|$|E
2500|$|Road {{transport}} grew rapidly {{during the}} 1920s, {{stimulated by the}} cheap sale of thousands of war-surplus vans and lorries and the subsidised construction of new roads, which was mainly funded by local authorities. The revenues of the railway companies suffered because {{of the loss of}} freight to road haulage in particular. This was largely because the Government would not release the railways from their obligations as 'common carriers', which had been brought in the 19th century. It obliged railway companies to carry any cargo offered to it at a nationally agreed charge, which was usually well below a rate necessary to make the operation profitable for the railways. The intention had been to stop railway companies [...] "cherry picking" [...] the most profitable freight whilst refusing to carry less profitable freight. This had been a necessary measure when railways had had an effective monopoly over land transport. But with <b>road</b> <b>competition</b> encroaching, it put the railways at a disadvantage, because they had to subsidise unprofitable freight operations with profitable ones, which drove up charges.|$|E
