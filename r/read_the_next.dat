25|$|Van der Wijck {{was first}} {{published}} as a serial in his weekly Islamic-themed magazine Pedoman Masjarakat in Medan in 1938.

First, read the M/2 first and last elements into the buffer and sort them. <b>Read</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> element from the beginning or end to balance writing. If the next element is less than the least of the buffer, write it to available space at the beginning. If greater than the greatest, write it to the end. Otherwise write the greatest or least of the buffer, and put the next element in the buffer. Keep the maximum lower and minimum upper keys written to avoid resorting middle elements that are in order. When done, write the buffer. Recursively sort the smaller partition, and loop to sort the remaining partition. This is a kind of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition (buffer) represents a sorted subarray of elements that are approximately equal to the pivot.|$|E
