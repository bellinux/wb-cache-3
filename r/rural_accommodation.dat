40|$|Historically, {{rural areas}} have been the place {{where most of the}} {{population}} lived and made its living. As a result of various economic, demographic, social and cultural changes, {{the second half of the}} 20 th century was characterized by structural change in many western rural regions. Within this transition the countryside evolves as a location for leisure, recreation and tourism (LRT). Today, rural LRT is a rapidly growing industry, considered as 'panacea' to the economic and social problems of many rural communities. However, being crucially dependent on the fragile rural environment, an excessive growth of the industry may results with negative externalities, which may destroy the very same amenities that attract visitors in the first place. Accordingly, many EU countries regulate and support the rural LRT since the 1990 s. Focusing on the industry's popular product; <b>rural</b> <b>accommodations</b> (RA), one possible negative result at the village level occurs as the attractiveness of localities as well as agglomeration economies create incentives for more and more households to enter the industry up to a level that harms the club good amenities of the village. A sustainable development that maintains optimum density is hence required. In this pioneer study, a conceptual and empirical framework to address this issue is provided, and the density in the RA industry is analyzed. For this purpose, a regional equilibrium model, which accounts for agglomeration effects, club-good effects as well as product differentiation, was developed. The model was estimated using data on the Israeli <b>rural</b> <b>accommodations</b> market from 2000. Significant evidences for the existences of club-good and agglomeration externalities were found and quantified in the consumer preferences and the production of <b>rural</b> <b>accommodations,</b> respectively.

40|$|This study investigates copreneurship {{in rural}} tourism businesses. It explores the {{experiences}} of owners of <b>rural</b> tourism <b>accommodation</b> businesses in New Zealand {{within the framework of}} copreneurship. It also examines roles within copreneurial rural tourism businesses and studies women’s experiences of entrepreneurship specifically. Copreneurs are couples who share ownership, commitment and responsibility for a business together (Barnett and Barnett, 1989) and these couples in business together (copreneurs) are one form of family business. To date there has not been any published discussion of the concept of copreneurship and tourism, which is remarkable, given that many tourism businesses are SMEs built around lifestyle and integration of life stakeholders such as family and partners. This dissertation represents the first attempt to study copreneurship within tourism entrepreneurship, and within a rural tourism environment specifically. It uses an interpretive approach as part of the study to give the participants a voice and to stress the methodological importance of reflexivity where the researcher is an insider to the study. Triangulation of data sources and methods, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques enables a rich understanding of copreneurial expectations, roles and responsibilities and of women’s experiences specifically. The method of the research is a postal survey of <b>rural</b> tourism <b>accommodation</b> business owners complemented by in-depth interviews with women in copreneurial business relationships. This thesis concludes that the <b>rural</b> tourism <b>accommodation</b> sector in New Zealand is characterised by lifestylers and copreneurs running their businesses as a ‘hobby’, with the main aim being ‘to meet people’ and that non-economic, lifestyle motivations are important stimuli to business formation. Specific analysis of women’s experiences of tourism production in copreneurial situations has shown that any perception of copreneurship as a tool for enabling women to become freed from traditional gender roles may not equal the reality. Women’s voices were able to come through in both the survey and the interview part of this research, revealing that a gendered ideology persists even through copreneurial relationships in rural tourism. The copreneurs in this study have strong and widely shared preconceptions of their roles as accommodation providers and as task managers in their households; role perceptions which appear to be largely invariant of the situation. Copreneurial couples appear to engage in running the accommodation business using traditional gender-based roles mirroring those found in the private home...|$|R

40|$|In {{many rural}} regions, tourism is {{accepted}} as {{a natural part of}} the socio-economic fabric juxtaposed with agriculture. It is clear that rural tourism is based on rural amenities; however, {{it is not clear how}} this relates to agriculture. Are these inter-relationships of mutual benefit, in the sense that while rural tourism provides the farmer with auxiliary funding to continue his/her agricultural activity, the latter is an important or even necessary component of rural tourism? Do active farms with rural tourism enjoy economies to scope and run their businesses more efficiently than firms with only a single activity? The focus of this paper is on these inter-relationships and their impact on the supply and demand for <b>rural</b> tourism <b>accommodations.</b> The demarcation between farm tourism and rural tourism is somewhat hazy. Nilsson (2002), in his work on farm tourism, defines farm tourism as a subset of rural tourism. According to him, rural tourism is based on the rural environment in general whereas farm tourism is based on the farm and the farmer. This means that within the framework of rural tourism, farm tourism enterprises are more closely related to agriculture than other rural tourism operations. Clarke (1996) elaborates further an...|$|R

A hedonic price model that relates the price of <b>rural</b> <b>accommodation</b> to environmental amenities as well as equipment, services offered, and the locational characteristics of the accommodation is estimated. The rural accommodations in the study are the self-catering cottages, the intrinsic features of which promote the development of rural tourism sustainability. Geographic information systems (GIS) data are used to measure the location and the proximity to amenities of these self-catering cottages. The main results indicate that agricultural land use has an important impact on the price of accommodation in self-catering cottages. Specifically, a high percentage of grassland in the municipality where the self-catering cottage is sited has a positive effect on rental prices, while a high percentage of arable crops has the opposite effect.

The results showed: (1) During 2002 - 2012, the rate of farmland marginalization was 16. 18 %, which was mainly found in the high areas of northern Qiyao mountains and the medium-altitude areas of southern Qiyao mountains. And this farmland marginalization will increase, associated with non-agriculturalization of rural labourers and aging of the remaining labourers. (2) Elevation, distance radius from villages and road connections had a great influence on farmland marginalization. Farmland marginalization rates showed an increasing trend {{with the increase of}} elevation, and 60. 88 % of the total farmland marginalization area is found at an altitude greater than 1000 m above sea level. The marginalization trend also increases with slope and distance from the distribution network. (3) Farmland area per labourer and the average age of farm labourers were major factors driving farmland marginalization. Farmland transfer and small agricultural machinery sets affect farmland marginalization with respect to management and productivity efficiency. (4) Farmland with "comparative-disadvantage-dominated marginalization" accounted for 55. 32 % of the total farmland marginalization area, followed by "location-dominated marginalization" (33. 80 %). (5) According to the specifics of each real situation, different policies are suggested to mitigate the marginalization. A "continuous marginalization" policy will encourage the return of farmland to forest in "terrain-dominated marginalization". An "anti-marginalization" policy is suggested to create new <b>rural</b> <b>accommodation</b> and improve the rural road system to counteract "terrain-dominated marginalization".
