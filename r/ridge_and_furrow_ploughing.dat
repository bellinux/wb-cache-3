5000|$|The {{remains of}} a medieval village are present at [...] near Haycroft, with six house {{platforms}} and evidence of medieval <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traces of {{traditional}} <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> survive {{in much of}} the parish, and particularly in the south. They are evidence of the open field system of farming that prevailed in the parish until 1758, when Parliament passed the Inclosure Act for Helmdon.|$|E
50|$|The {{surrounding}} manor of Wilderhope is {{also managed}} by the National Trust and comprises wooded valleys, pasture, flower rich meadows and ancient hedgerows dating back centuries along unchanged field boundaries. Evidence of medieval <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> can still be seen in fields below Wilderhope Coppice.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} the few {{surviving}} {{areas of}} neutral grassland in the county, where <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> from medieval <b>ploughing</b> can be seen. There is a rich variety of species, such as red fescue in drier areas, and salad burnet in damper ones.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} fields are pasture {{and others are}} hay meadows, <b>and</b> they display <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrows</b> from medieval <b>ploughing.</b> They are a type of neutral {{grassland}} which is declining nationally. Flowers include cowslips and yellow-rattles, and there are fauna such as green woodpeckers and great crested newts.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} {{triangular}} meadow in the corner where two railway lines merge. It was cut off when the railways were constructed in the 1850s, and at the northern end there are traces of the ancient <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> method of <b>ploughing.</b> The site has {{a wide range of}} flowers, such as cowslip, salad burnet and quaking grass. A small stream and hedgerows provide additional habitats for wildlife.|$|R
50|$|Traces of {{traditional}} <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> survive {{in much of}} the parish, many in the S-shaped pattern characteristic of ox-drawn ploughs. They are evidence of the open field system of farming that prevailed in the parish until 1760, when Parliament passed the Inclosure Act for Eydon.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the present}} Hellaby Hall estate is listed with English Heritage as the deserted site of a Medieval village, with {{the remains of a}} well, square ditched enclosure, example of <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> method, post Medieval long house, corn drying oven and {{indications}} of metal working.|$|E
50|$|Rushock Hill has {{extensive}} {{evidence of}} <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> which extends {{into a lot}} of surrounding woodland. Other features include the uncommon site of dry stone walling (not a common local feature) and specimen trees and earthworks which suggest 18th century landscaping. Capability Brown is known to have visited Eywood House in the valley below in Titley and though no evidence of any work being done by him exists the substantial evidence of landscaping suggests that great wealth and imagination was used to greatly alter the hill and surrounding area and would benefit from some modern archaeological investigation.|$|E
500|$|The 4th-century temple {{gradually}} {{fell into}} disuse and Maiden Castle was used predominantly as pasture. There is evidence for {{activity on the}} site {{in the form of}} a few post-Roman or Anglo Saxon burials, some possibly Christian, but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, a barn was built over the [...] "war cemetery". The only other significant activity on the hill top after the Romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century, as demonstrated by traces of <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> caused by <b>ploughing.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> {{topography}} was {{a result}} of ploughing with non-reversible ploughs on the same strip of land each year. It is visible on land that was ploughed in the Middle Ages, but which has not been ploughed since then. No actively <b>ploughed</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> survives.|$|R

50|$|The {{earthworks}} {{are located}} {{a little to}} the north west of the present village of Spurstow, which is believed to have subsequently contracted or moved. They lie in a valley, which formerly contained a stream. There are six house platforms which are 25-40 metres2 in area, each of which is surrounded by a 2-metre ditch. To {{the north side of the}} platforms and abutting them there is evidence of medieval <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> A later causeway runs north-south, bisecting the site. The existing lane to Haycroft farm represents part of an old road from Ridley Green to Beeston.|$|E
50|$|The site {{is one of}} the {{few small}} areas of ancient hay meadow in the Vale of Aylesbury. It has been {{traditionally}} managed, with a hay cut followed by cattle grazing, and no use of herbicides or fertilisers. One area has the remains of medieval <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> There is a marshy area where there was formerly a pond, but most of the field is dry grassland, with an unusually wide variety of plants, and over 100 species of grasses, sedges, herbs and rushes have been recorded. The main grasses are sweet vernal grass and Yorkshire fog.|$|E
5000|$|Wendlebury Meads {{consists}} of several meadows {{which have been}} traditionally managed, and have complex and varied flora. Calcareous pastures were common in southern England {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century, and these meadows are among the few have survived agricultural improvements. Almost all show evidence of medieval <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing.</b> Mansmoor Closes were enclosed very early, before 1622, and are important from both a landscape and archaeological point of view. More than 160 plant species have been recorded, including 11 of dandelion. There are birds such as snipe and curlew, and many common butterlies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result of}} this was to twist {{the end of each}} furrow {{slightly}} to the left, making these earlier <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrows</b> into a slight reverse-S shape. [...] This shape survives in some places as curved field boundaries, even where the <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> pattern itself has vanished.|$|R

50|$|A {{flight of}} four lynchets survive {{south of the}} village: a rare {{survival}} in Northamptonshire. In 1758 the open field system of farming around Woodford Halse was ended by enclosure. The <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> pattern of the common fields is visible {{in parts of the}} parish, and especially just south of the village. Allotments northeast of the village are laid out along the <b>ridges</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrows,</b> <b>and</b> follow their uneven widths and reverse S-curve.|$|R

50|$|Bailliehill Mount, {{also known}} as Woodhill Mount, at 60m in height overlooks Carmyle or Waterpark Farm and the Carmel Water with steep slopes to the NW and SE; it is partly wooded. The site has well {{preserved}} rig <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> <b>ploughing</b> marks internally <b>and</b> externally to the NE. A farmer's access track with a bridge across the Woodhill Burn at the Whin Gaw ran to the site from the nearby lane to Knockentiber.|$|R

50|$|In {{most places}} {{ploughing}} continued over the centuries, and later methods removed the <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> pattern. However, {{in some cases}} the land became grassland, and where this has not been ploughed since, the pattern has often been preserved. Surviving <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> may have a height difference of 18 to 24 in in places, and gives a strongly rippled effect to the landscape. When in active use, the height difference was even more, over 6 ft in places.|$|R
