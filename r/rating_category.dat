Rather than having raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's <b>rating</b> <b>category</b> and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E

40|$|GivEN that {{rating scales}} are so {{widely used in}} the social sciences, both as {{research}} tools and in practical applications, determination of the optimal number of <b>rating</b> <b>categories</b> becomes an important consideration {{in the construction of}} such scales. As Garner (1960) pointed out, the basic question is whether for any given rating in-strument there is an optimum number of <b>rating</b> <b>categories,</b> or at least a number of <b>rating</b> <b>categories</b> beyond which there is no further improvement in discrimination of the rated items. Garner and Hake (1951), Guilford (1954), and Komorita and Graham (1965) in-dicated that if we use too few <b>rating</b> <b>categories,</b> our scale is obviously a coarse one, and we lose much of the discriminative powers of which the raters are capable. Conversely, we could also grade a scale so finely that it is beyond the rater’s limited powers of discrimination. Ghiselli (1948) and Guilford (1954) contended that the optimal number of steps is a matter for empirical determination in any situation, and suggested that there is a wide range of variation in refinement around the optimal point in which reliability changes very little. Guilford felt that it may be advisable in some favorable situations to use up to 25 scale deviations. Ghiselli suggested that either reliability of measurement or ease of rating be used as a basis for the empirical determination of the optimal number of steps.
