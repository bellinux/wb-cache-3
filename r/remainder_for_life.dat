40|$|For undocumented persons, federal Medicaid funds {{may only}} be used {{to provide health care}} {{services}} <b>for</b> <b>life</b> threatening emergencies or labor and delivery services for pregnant women. The Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (SOBRA) was enacted by Congress in 1986 to provide a funding stream for these services. In Kansas, eligibility for this program is processed through Social and Rehabilitative Services (SRS) area offices. If the medical event is labor and delivery, the case worker can approve SOBRA eligibility. If the event is not labor and delivery, the provider of the service receives a form to fill out and return with the medical record. The Medicaid fiscal agent, EDS, receives this information and works with the SOBRA program manager to approve or deny eligibility. In 2007, there were 576 requests for non-labor and delivery medical expenses of which 295 were denied. The main challenge in administering this program is consistent application of the federal definition of covered services. Although this is a concern, the quarterly review of SOBRA claims for payment errors shows a current error rate of less than one percent. In 2007, Kansas SOBRA expenditures for almost 6, 000 claims were approximately $ 10 million. Over $ 7 million was paid for labor and delivery services with the <b>remainder</b> paid <b>for</b> <b>life</b> threatening emergency services such as tracheotomies, trauma OR, trauma of the brain, and coronary events. The expenditures for FY 09 are estimated to be $ 10 -$ 12 million...|$|R
