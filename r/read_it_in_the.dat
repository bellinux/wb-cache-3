[...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E

Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call.

[...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer {{and sent it to}} Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down.

2500|$|The {{end of the}} Commune {{left the}} city's {{population}} deeply divided.

[...] This sentiment soon became secondary to the need to reconstruct the buildings that had been destroyed in {{the last days of the}} Commune. The Communards had burned the Hôtel de Ville (including all the city archives), the Tuileries Palace, the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture of Police, the Ministry of Finances, the Cour des Comptes, the State Council building at the Palais-Royal, and many others. Several streets, particularly the Rue de Rivoli, had also been badly damaged by the fighting. [...] Besides the cost of reconstruction, the new government was obliged to pay an indemnity of 210 million francs in gold to the victorious German Empire as reparations for the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870. On 4 August 1871, at the first meeting of the city council after the Commune, the new Prefect of the Seine, Léon Say, put forward a plan to borrow 350 million francs for reconstruction and indemnity payments. The city's bankers and businessmen quickly raised the money, and the reconstruction was soon underway.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series in}} Australia 'emphasised {{the gulf between}} players and administrators' and John Snow wrote 'I was sick of the biased {{attitude}} and incompetence which was apparent in cricket administration. David Clark was the MCC tour manager, Bernard Thomas of Warwickshire the assistant manager and physiotherapist and G.C.A. Saulez the scorer. Clark had been the amateur captain of Kent in 1949-51 who was described by Ray Illingworth as [...] "an amiable, but somewhat ineffectual man". and there were soon divisions {{between him and the}} players. John Snow had bowled over 50 eight-ball overs in the First Test and was rested for the state match against Western Australia, but Clark insisted that he practice in the nets with the other bowlers. Snow bowled a couple of desultory overs and Clark berated him for five minutes after which Snow told him [...] "that as far as my good conduct money was concerned he could swallow it" [...] and went walkabout until the next day. Ray Illingworth smoothed things over, but in Second Test Clark criticised both captains for cautious play and England for their short-pitched bowling. When asked by the press if he would prefer four more draws or a 3-1 Australian victory he replied [...] "I'd rather see four results" [...] as if they were drawn there might be no Ashes left to play for. Ray Illingworth only discovered this when he was asked for a comment by a journalist in the morning and the team when they <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspapers. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour {{with the support of the}} players and Clark's influence declined. Clark's only ally was the vice-captain Colin Cowdrey, also from Kent, who became isolated as a result. Unlike his predecessors Illingworth insisted on good hotel accommodation, decent sporting facilities, better travel arrangements, higher allowances and pay and fought hard to get them, which was greatly appreciated by the players. In the final Sydney Test Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field when he took the team off because of the crowd throwing beer cans after the Snow-Jenner incident. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down and objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. When the team returned to England Illingworth said that [...] "all hell would break loose" [...] if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus (as had happened with Fred Trueman in the West Indies in 1953-54), but this did not happen. However, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow had to report to Lord's for a dressing down for their behaviour by the Secretary of the MCC Billy Griffith.|$|E

The definition of ‘syllable’ (syl- labé) must thus be read in close connection with the definition of ‘element’ (stoicheion). For Aristotle, the syllable cannot be reduced to its elements (Met. Z 17), because the syllable has a prosodic and metrical structure which de- fines it as minimal linguistic unity. A vocal expression is a prosodic configura- tion determined by the alternation of long and short syllables (Cat. 4 b 33 - 5).
