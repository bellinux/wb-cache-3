5|$|During {{the fourth}} {{round of the}} 2011 German Chess Championships, Falko Bindrich was late to his game and tournament {{director}} Ralph Alt declared the game lost on Bindrich's arrival after a few minutes. Bindrich <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> penalty and withdrew from the tournament shortly after, {{and went on to}} blog about the double standards of arbiters, claiming that he had seen several other players arrive late in the previous rounds, and no penalty was issued to them.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 Auden fell in {{love with}} Chester Kallman and {{regarded}} their relationship as a marriage; this ended in 1941 when Kallman <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> faithful relation that Auden demanded, but the two maintained their friendship, and from 1947 until Auden's death they lived in the same house or apartment in a non-sexual relationship, often collaborating on opera libretti such as The Rake's Progress, for music by Igor Stravinsky.|$|E

5|$|The {{judge for}} the wager, {{the editor of}} Field magazine, {{declared}} Wallace the winner, but Hampden <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than {{the amount of the}} wager and the controversy frustrated him for years.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications to the Mexican diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> modifications to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|In February 1928, Disney {{hoped to}} {{negotiate}} a larger fee for producing the Oswald series, but found Mintz wanting to reduce the payments. Mintz had also persuaded many of the artists involved to work directly for him, including Harman, Ising, Carman Maxwell and Friz Freleng. Disney also found out that Universal owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald. Mintz threatened {{to start his own}} studio and produce the series himself if Disney <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> reductions. Disney declined Mintz's ultimatum and lost most of his animation staff, except Iwerks, who chose to remain with him.|$|E

5|$|It was Voivode Basarab I (c. 1310–1352) {{who broke}} {{off with the}} Kingdom of Hungary and <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> king's suzerainty. Basarab I {{received}} international support and {{the recognition of the}} autonomy of Wallachia due to his great military victory over King Charles I of Hungary (1301–1342) at Posada on November 12, 1330. The Metropolitan See of Wallachia, directly subordinated to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, was set up during the reign of Basarab I's son, Nicolae Alexandru (1352–1364). The first silver and bronze coins were minted in Wallachia in 1365.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{came down}} firmly {{in favour of}} Henry, but the French {{arbitration}} failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> verdict. England slipped back into the Second Barons' War, which was won by Henry's son, Prince Edward. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta. In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the Statute of Marlborough, which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.|$|E
5|$|The Bharat Ratna, {{along with}} other {{personal}} civil honours, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during {{the change in the}} national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqué announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.|$|E

50|$|On August 15, 1945, {{one week}} after the Potsdam Conference he created facts by {{establishing}} Polish administrators in these areas. The new government, almost as expected, began its campaign against the Church by withdrawing from the concordat and expelling the Papal Nuncio and <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> appointments by Cardinal Hlond. The Vatican was accused of <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> authority of the new communist government and for breaking the concordat in the war years by appointing temporary German administrators in Polish territory.|$|R

5|$|The League soon sent envoys to its neighbors, Stefan I Crnojević and Đurađ Branković. Branković, a lord of Serbian Despotate, who {{was also}} in dispute with Venice over the Principality of Zeta, {{expressed}} his willingness to help Skanderbeg against the Republic but not against the Ottoman Empire. The Venetians sent an ambassador to Skanderbeg offering him 1,000 ducats to lay aside all claims to Dagnum in return that the Albanians would protect the country and keep the roads free from violence. Skanderbeg, however, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> offer and hostilities continued. Alongside the Spani family, the Dushmani family was against the war with Venice and {{did not participate in}} it.|$|E
5|$|There are {{hundreds}} of clubs and student organizations at the university. Many of them are centred around McGill's student union building, the University Centre. There are student-run teams located in the McConnell building such as the McGill Racing Team, McGill EV and McGill Baja. In 1992, students held a referendum which called for the University Centre to be named for actor and McGill alumnus William Shatner. The university administration <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> name and {{did not attend the}} opening. Traditionally, the administration names buildings in honour of deceased members of the university community or for major benefactors—Shatner is neither.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the Emperor and to defend the Empire {{whenever}} needed. He also accepted the appointment of a Greek Patriarch. In return, he was given the titles of sebastos and doux (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa. Following this, Bohemond retreated to Apulia and died there. His nephew, Tancred, who was regent in Antioch, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> terms of the Treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, {{but it was not until}} 1158 that it truly became a Byzantine vassal.|$|E

5|$|In May 1922, John Hylan {{launched}} a new plan for the freight and passenger tunnel, and the Board of Estimate recommended that $4,080,000 be initially appropriated for the project. The Transit Commission and the Port Authority <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> plan, as they each had their own plans. This plan was much less extensive than the original plan. The original plan {{would have had the}} tunnel from Owl's Head Park under the Narrows to Staten Island, and then continuing to a freight yard to be built in the center of Staten Island, from which a trunk line would run across the Arthur Kill to New Jersey as far as Paterson, before merging with the West Shore Railroad. The new revised plan would only cover the Narrows Tunnel, and a three-mile spur to Arlington Yard.|$|E
5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> cars, citing numerous technical {{issues with the}} cars and their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out of Suburban Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York - Washington service. They were {{moved back to the}} Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 {{season began}} disastrously for Roberts when he {{suffered}} career-threatening back injuries and a ruptured spleen in a pre-season crash while testing a motorcycle in Japan. His injuries {{caused him to}} miss the season opening Grand Prix in Venezuela, but he completed an impressive recovery by winning the second round in Austria, followed by a second place in Germany, and another victory in Italy. Controversy again surrounded Roberts at the Spanish Grand Prix when Spanish race organisers, knowing that Roberts had to race to maintain his points lead, refused to pay him starting money as guaranteed by FIM regulations. An angered Roberts proceeded to win the race, and then <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> winner's trophy. The FIM initially suspended the championship points leader for his actions, but the suspension was later reduced to probation.|$|E
