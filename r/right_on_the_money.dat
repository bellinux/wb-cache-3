500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he yelled at the television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale was <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> [...] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E

[...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link all the action up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes. [...] All the flashforward scenes tonight were <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> as far as I was concerned."

The first time I heard Tommy Dorsey was when Gene Krupa was his drummer. It was completely dark in the theater and you heard those drums begin - it was Krupa doing a tom-tom solo, and before you knew it they were into 'Song of India.'

Collisions with opposing racers have a sometimes unpredictable outcome, making the action very frustrating when trying to win the Hot Wheels Cup. Worst of all, though, is that theres no damage meter to clue you in when youre about to blow up. Nitpicking aside, Hot Wheels Turbo Racing does pulse-pounding fun like few other titles.

40|$|The {{critics have}} panned Justice Kennedy’s {{majority}} opinion in United States v. Windsor. Supporters {{and opponents of}} same-sex marriage have together bemoaned what may be called Kennedy’s “doctrinal obscurity” in Windsor. Doctrinal obscurity describes the opinion’s failure to justify striking down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) using any discernable accepted test for substantive due process or equal protection. Specifically, Kennedy does not ask whether DOMA burdens a right “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” nor does he identify sexual orientation as a suspect or semi-suspect classification, nor does he subject DOMA to explicit rational basis review. To the critics, Justice Scalia’s dissenting characterization of the majority’s analysis as “nonspecific hand-waving” seems <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Yet this line of critique assumes that the Court should always aspire to specificity and clarity in its doctrinal analysis. In this brief essay, I seek to challenge that assumption and argue for the occasional virtue of doctrinal obscurity. My argument here concerns situations like that presented by DOMA where the Court confronts ugly social realities that have become codified in unpleasant laws or distasteful precedents. Like speaking with a homophobic relative at a series of family dinners, these situations are inherently awkward and sometimes less-than-direct words are {{the best way to}} move the conversation in a productive direction. Sometimes respect for etiquette counsels that the Court should dance around a little before declaring: “the Constitution does not allow this. ” In my view, Justice Kennedy’s obscurity in Windsor is justified by such doctrinal etiquette. To flesh out these ideas, I identify earlier instances of virtuous doctrinal obscurity in the Court’s equal protection and due process jurisprudence and show how these cases employed a strategy of polite obfuscation to deal with embarrassing precedent. Importantly, these cases – Skinner v. Oklahoma, Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, Romer v. Evans, and Lawrence v. Texas – also provide the legitimate doctrinal justification for the result in Windsor. In the end, I argue that doctrinal obscurity served a useful role in all of these cases by smoothing over difficult constitutional contradictions and facilitating the transition from a regrettable past to a more promising future...|$|E
