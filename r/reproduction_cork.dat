40|$|The use {{of reverse}} {{transcription}} quantitative PCR technology to assess gene expression levels requires an accurate normalization of data {{in order to}} avoid misinterpretation of experimental results and erroneous analyses. Despite being the focus of several transcriptomics projects, oaks, and particularly cork oak (Quercus suber), have not been investigated regarding the identification of reference genes suitable for the normalization of real-time quantitative PCR data. In this study, ten candidate reference genes (Act, CACs, EF- 1 a, GAPDH, His 3, PsaH, Sand, PP 2 A, ß-Tub and Ubq) were evaluated to determine the most stable internal reference for quantitative PCR normalization in cork oak. The transcript abundance of these genes was analysed in several tissues of cork oak, including leaves, <b>reproduction</b> <b>cork,</b> and periderm from branches at different developmental stages (1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year old) or collected in different dates (active growth period versus dormancy). The three statistical methods (geNorm, NormFinder, and CV method) used in the evaluation of the most suitable combination of reference genes identified Act and CACs as the most stable candidates when all the samples were analysed together, while ß-Tub and PsaH showed the lowest expression stability. However, when different tissues, developmental stages, and collection dates were analysed separately, the reference genes exhibited some variation in their expression levels. In this study, and for the first time, we have identified and validated reference genes in cork oak {{that can be used for}} quantification of target gene expression in different tissues and experimental conditions and will be useful as a startin...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} processes {{associated with}} cork development in Quercus suber L. are poorly understood. A previous molecular approach identified {{a list of}} genes potentially important for cork formation and differentiation, providing a new basis for further molecular studies. This report is the first molecular characterization {{of one of these}} candidate genes, QsMYB 1, coding for an R 2 R 3 -MYB transcription factor. The R 2 R 3 -MYB gene sub-family has been described as being involved in the phenylpropanoid and lignin pathways, both involved in cork biosynthesis. The results showed that the expression of QsMYB 1 is putatively mediated by an alternative splicing (AS) mechanism that originates two different transcripts (QsMYB 1. 1 and QsMYB 1. 2), differing only in the 5 '-untranslated region, due to retention of the first intron in one of the variants. Moreover, within the retained intron, a simple sequence repeat (SSR) was identified. The upstream regulatory region of QsMYB 1 was extended by a genome walking approach, which allowed the identification of the putative gene promoter region. The relative expression pattern of QsMYB 1 transcripts determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed that both transcripts were up-regulated in cork tissues; the detected expression was several times higher in newly formed cork harvested from trees producing virgin, second or <b>reproduction</b> <b>cork</b> when compared with wood. Moreover, the expression analysis of QsMYB 1 in several Q. suber organs showed very low expression in young branches and roots, whereas in leaves, immature acorns or male flowers, no expression was detected. These preliminary results suggest that QsMYB 1 may be related to secondary growth and, in particular, with the cork biosynthesis process with a possible alternative splicing mechanism associated with its regulatory function.
