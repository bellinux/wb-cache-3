40|$|The {{depletion}} of the stratospheric burdens of particulate "'Zr for times up to around 1 year, and gaseous HTO for times up to 3 years, attributed to the November 17, 1976 Chinese high-yield test indicates that both have about the same <b>residence</b> <b>half-time</b> (10 months). The indications are that gravitational settling of particles in the lower stratosphere can {{be considered to be}} negligible in studying transport processes. The rate of {{depletion of}} the stratospheric burden of HTO from the high-yield Chinese test of June 27, 1973 is not as well-defined in part due to greater uncertainties in calculating the stratospheric burdens...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of fallout 137 Cs   within the Nigerian soil {{has been studied}} in this paper by a compartment   model. The measured concentrations of the radionuclide in the soil layers were examined by the model in order to estimate the transport parameters of <b>residence</b> <b>half-time</b> and the migration velocity of the radionuclide in the soils. The residence half-times were observed to be short and decreased with soil depth with a   mean ranging from 0. 3 years at 0 – 2 cm soil depth in Akure site to 1. 4 years at 10 - 15 cm depth in Igbeti site.   The migration velocity  , calculated from the residence times with the consideration of the different thicknesses of the layers were observed to decrease slowly with depth at all the sampling sites with a range from 3. 62 cm y - 1 at Igbeti site to 8. 21 cm. y - 1 at Ikogosi site. The migration velocities obtained are quite higher than those reported in literature for global fallout. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{analyzed}} {{the organization and}} function of mitochondrial DNA in a stable human cell line (ECV 304, which {{is also known as}} T- 24) containing mitochondria tagged with the yellow fluorescent protein. Results Mitochondrial DNA is organized in ~ 475 discrete foci containing 6 – 10 genomes. These foci (nucleoids) are tethered directly or indirectly through mitochondrial membranes to kinesin, marked by KIF 5 B, and microtubules in the surrounding cytoplasm. In living cells, foci have an apparent diffusion constant of 1. 1 × 10 - 3 μm 2 /s, and mitochondria always split next to a focus to distribute all DNA to one daughter. The kinetics of replication and transcription (monitored by immunolabelling after incorporating bromodeoxyuridine or bromouridine) reveal that each genome replicates independently of others in a focus, and that newly-made RNA remains in a focus (<b>residence</b> <b>half-time</b> ~ 43 min) long after it has been made. This mitochondrial RNA colocalizes with components of the cytoplasmic machinery that makes and imports nuclear-encoded proteins – that is, a ribosomal protein (S 6), a nascent peptide associated protein (NAC), and the translocase in the outer membrane (Tom 22). Conclusions The results suggest that clusters of mitochondrial genomes organize the translation machineries {{on both sides of the}} mitochondrial membranes. Then, proteins encoded by the nuclear genome and destined for the mitochondria will be made close to mitochondrial-encoded proteins so that they can be assembled efficiently into mitochondrial complexes. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant {{accident}} in 1986 caused radionuclide contamination {{in most countries}} in Eastern and Western Europe. A prime example is Belarus where 23 % of the total land area received chronic levels; about 1. 5 x 10 (6) ha of forested lands were contaminated with 40 - 190 kBq m(- 2) and 2. 5 x 10 (4) ha received greater than 1, 480 kBq m(- 2) of Cs- 137 and other long-lived radionuclides such as Sr- 90 and Pu- 239,Pu- 240. Since the radiological dose to the forest ecosystem, will tend to accumulate over long time periods (decades to centuries), we need to determine what countermeasures {{can be taken to}} limit this dose so that the affected regions can, once again, safely provide habitat and natural forest products, To address some of these problems, our initial objective is to formulate a generic model, FORESTPATH, which describes the major kinetic processes and pathways of radionuclide movement in forests and natural ecosystems and which can be used to predict future radionuclide concentrations, The model calculates the time-dependent radionuclide concentrations in different compartments of the forest ecosystem based on the information available on <b>residence</b> <b>half-times</b> in two forest types: coniferous and deciduous, The results show that the model reproduces well the radionuclide cycling pattern found in the literature for deciduous and coniferous forests, Variability analysis was used to access the relative importance of specific parameter values in the generic model performance. The FORESTPASTH model can be easily adjusted for site-specific applications...|$|R
