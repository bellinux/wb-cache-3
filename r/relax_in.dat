5|$|To the band's consternation, {{they were}} forced to cancel their {{appearance}} at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, informing the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist– a meeting he did not attend. He was sent to <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> the sun on the Spanish island of Formentera with Waters and Sam Hutt (a doctor well-established in the underground music scene), but this led to no visible improvement.|$|E
5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E

5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention and harassment he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few days off from the club to <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E

25|$|The whole human GI tract {{is about}} nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy.

25|$|Such was {{the extent}} and {{efficacy}} of his preparation of the script that almost no line of dialogue was eliminated in the final edit of the film. Except for some exterior night shots, Huston shot the entire film in sequence, which greatly helped his actors.

The three-day event, which averaged 3,000–5,000 fans per day, was headlined by Ashley MacIsaac, Dwight Yoakam, and The Stampeders and offered the community's residents {{an opportunity to}} <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> the midst of rebuilding efforts. On July 6, Prince William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, visited the town to offer encouragement to residents and rebuilding efforts.|$|E
25|$|Sarajevo is host to many parks {{throughout}} the city and {{on the outskirts of}} city. A popular activity among Sarajevo citizens is street chess, usually played at Trg oslobođenja Alija Izetbegović. Veliki Park is the largest green area in the center of Sarajevo. It’s nestled between Titova, Koševo, Džidžikovac, Tina Ujevića and Trampina Streets and in the lower part there is a monument dedicated to the Children of Sarajevo. Hastahana skate park is a popular place to <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> the Austro-Hungarian neighborhood of Marijin Dvor. Goat's Bridge, locally known as Kozija Ćuprija, in the Miljacka Canyon is also a popular park destination along the Dariva walkway and river Miljacka.|$|E
25|$|The photo-isomerization of {{azobenzene}} {{is a form}} of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization {{can also}} lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> random positions. However, those relaxed (trans) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will {{no longer be able to}} absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems). For instance, it has been used to orient liquid crystal domains selectively, and to create nonlinear optical (NLO) materials.-sonogel glasses|journal=Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology|year=2010|volume=56|issue=1|pages=7–18|doi=10.1007/s10971-010-2265-y|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/f06488h188176783/}} Azo isomerization can also be used to photo-switch the liquid crystal phase of a material from cholesteric to nematic or to change the pitch of a cholesteric phase.|$|E

25|$|The Standard Unified Contract is a {{contract}} between the Employer and the migrant domestic worker. It was {{drawn up by}} The Ministry of Labour {{and it is the}} main source of the worker’s rights. The right for a clean and private place in which to <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> their free time. Also, clean and appropriate clothes, and sufficient food (Article 8). The right to medical care when needed, including dental and eye care, the costs of which should be met by the employer. The workers are covered by health insurance in the case of emergency (Article 9). The right to work for ten non-consecutive hours every day with frequent short breaks, and at least eight continuous hours of rest at night (Article 11). The right for a weekly rest period of 24 hours, and deciding which day in the week is to be discussed between the worker and the employer (Article 12). The right for annual leave consists of 6 days also the dates should be discussed between the employer and the worker (Article 12). The right for a return ticket {{at the end of the}} contract (Article 13). The right for one phone call every month on the charge of the employer (Article 14). The right for sick leave when there is a medical report, half a month with pay and half a month with half pay (Article 15). There is no stipulation in the contract for any free legal assistance for the domestic workers.|$|E
25|$|The void which {{cuts through}} the entire height of the building, and this was {{intentionally}} done by the architect to visually connect {{the upper and lower}} spaces. This longitudinal void opens to a rooftop skylight, bringing in natural daylight into the atrium below. The typical dependence of artificial lighting for a building of this size would typically account for more than 13% of its electricity use. However, with the installation of this void, a great portion of that cost is reduced. This spatial device was intended as a sustainable element of the design, as seen in many of Foster’s projects, it is an effective solution to reducing electricity consumption which is vital to a structure of this scale. The most important aspect that this vertical void contributes to the building is that is creates a distinctive social space for its users. Norman Foster has been experimenting and studying with the reconfiguration of spaces and the natural lighting conditions to redefine institutions. This void creates a vast, open, daylight space for the students to gather and <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> between classes. Also, the 23 research laboratories and teaching laboratories are intentionally planned and organized in such a manner where they are fully integrated into other programs- service spaces for faculty members, students and administrators. These programs are connected by bridges which cross the void at the upper floors. As for the pods which are suspended {{in the middle of the}} atrium, these mysterious pods were intentionally designed to give the illusion of defying gravity due to their size and weight. One architectural detail that most be noted, the bottom of the glass-clad cube of the larger volume was specifically designed to line up with the cornices of its adjacent historic buildings. Furthermore, the bottom of the new building will be transparent so that the older buildings will be visible through the lobby, says David Nelson of Foster and Partners.|$|E

There, he trained with the coach Elizabeth Kemp of whom he says: [...] "I {{was never able to}} <b>relax</b> <b>in</b> my life before her." [...] She has since advised him on many of his films.
