5|$|Bembo's {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. From these drawings, Benton-pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E

5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by {{the perception that the}} methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{under what}} conditions employers <b>recruit</b> <b>from</b> the long-term unemployed. We know that firms employ long-term unemployed when the labour market tightens sufficiently. This paper explores whether employers <b>recruit</b> <b>from</b> the long-term unemployed when the pool of long-term unemployed becomes more heterogeneous and of higher quality, which occurs in slack labour market conditions. In such conditions the effectiveness of stigma evaporates. We employ a British survey on firms participating in wage subsidy schemes. We find support for our proposition. Employers <b>recruit</b> <b>from</b> the long-term unemployed for progressively more complex jobs when labour market tightness eases...|$|R

5|$|In the 1st century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of auxiliary common soldiers were <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> the Roman peregrine (second-class citizens). In the Julio-Claudian era, conscription of peregrini seems to have been practiced alongside voluntary recruitment, probably {{in the form of a}} fixed proportion of men reaching military age in each tribe being drafted. From the Flavian era onwards, the auxilia were an all-volunteer force. Although recruits as young as 14 are recorded, the majority of recruits (66%) were from the 18–23 age group.|$|E

Following liberation in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom – {{the demands of}} reconstruction in mainland Normandy and Brittany employed domestic labour.|$|E

5|$|The {{creative}} {{team was}} largely <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as Blackadder and the Monty Python films.

It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.|$|E
5|$|The first Corps was a {{small unit}} that served in the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810, <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> former slaves to address the {{shortage}} of military manpower in the Caribbean.

5|$|The main {{striking}} {{force of the}} Parthian army was its cataphracts, heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor. The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines, but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers. Due {{to the cost of}} their equipment and armor, cataphracts were <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> among the aristocratic class who, in return for their services, demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings. The light cavalry was <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> among the commoner class and acted as horse archers; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle. They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them; this technique, known as the Parthian shot, was a highly effective tactic.|$|E

5|$|A {{short period}} of {{rudimentary}} training followed {{under the tutelage of}} members of the Australian Instructional Corps. This was completed by April 1940, and that month the battalion– under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Godfrey, a First World War veteran who had previously commanded the 23rd/21st Battalion– embarked for the Middle East on the transport ship Neuralia, departing from Port Melbourne and sailing via Fremantle, Colombo, Aden and the Suez Canal. At this time it was attached to the 17th Brigade, which was assigned to the 6th Division. <b>Recruited</b> <b>from</b> Victoria– although at various times the battalion's composition was boosted by recruits from other states– the 17th also consisted of the 2/5th, 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as he}} took office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, <b>recruited</b> <b>from</b> Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo.
