5|$|The {{development}} of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the <b>Roaring</b> <b>forties</b> means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties,</b> between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|E
25|$|Commenting on McIntyre's {{theory in}} 1984, Captain A. Ariel {{suggested}} {{it was extremely}} unlikely any sixteenth century mariner {{would have taken a}} voyage southwards down Australia's eastern coast, through uncharted dangerous waters and against prevailing winds, on the assumption Magellan was sailing westwards, in southern latitudes, against the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alan Villiers, {{a modern-day}} expert in {{traditional}} sailing ships, wrote many books about traditional sailing, including By way of Cape Horn. More recent sailors {{have taken on}} the Horn singly, such as Vito Dumas, who wrote Alone Through The <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> based on his round-the-world voyage; or with small crews.|$|E
25|$|The Falkland Islands {{are located}} in the South Atlantic Ocean between 51°S and 53°S on a {{projection}} of the Patagonian Shelf, part of the South American continental shelf. In ancient geological time this shelf was part of Gondwana, and around 400 million years ago split from what is now Africa and drifted westwards from it. Today the islands are subjected to the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties,</b> winds that shape both their geography and climate.|$|E
25|$|At between about 46° – 50° {{south of}} the equator, in the region often {{referred}} to as the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties,</b> are the Crozet Islands, Prince Edward Islands, Bounty Islands, Snares Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Antipodes Islands, and Auckland Islands. The geography of these islands is characterized by tundra, with some trees on Snares and Auckland Islands. These islands are all located near the Antarctic Convergence (with Kerguelen {{south of the}} Convergence) and are properly considered to be subantarctic islands.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} in the area can be extreme, with the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> wind being a particular problem. The maximum wind gust ever recorded was 176km/h. Reportedly, the first keepers of the light took chickens with them to Maatsuyker but the fowls blew away into the ocean. Given the wind and lack of shelter, this is possible if they were left outside during storms. Vegetables get blown flat by the wind, but surprisingly, can be grown successfully, even though the garden is {{on the west side}} of the island, facing into the prevailing winds.|$|E
25|$|The {{years between}} its first {{sighting}} by Sprent {{and the first}} successful summit expedition almost 50 years later saw a mixture of hardy pioneer adventurers trying to bag the peak. The thick horizontal scrub, mixed with ancient cool temperate rainforest which dominates the area {{proved to be the}} barrier between men and the mountain. Together with the harsh weather generated by the <b>roaring</b> <b>forties</b> the mountain did not give itself easily. It {{is a testament to the}} wildness of the Tasmanian South West that it took almost 50 years to reach its heart and jewel.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} for the Københavns disappearance have been advanced. The most commonly accepted {{is that the}} ship struck an iceberg in the dark or fog. If so, the ship may have sunk too quickly for the crew to react. The lack of wreckage found later {{may have been the}} result of the ship's particularly secure loading and rigging, a necessity against the strong winds known as the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties.</b> An alternate theory is that the ship, which was in ballast with no cargo, may have been capsized by heavy winds, disabling the lifeboats for survivors.|$|E
25|$|In 1611 Hendrik Brouwer, {{working for}} VOC, {{discovered}} that sailing from Europe to Batavia was much quicker if the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> were used. Up to that point, the Dutch had followed a route copied from Arab and Portuguese sailors who followed {{the coasts of}} Africa, Mauritius and Ceylon. The Brouwer Route involved sailing south from the Cape of Good Hope (which is at 34° latitude south) into the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> (at 40–50° latitude south), then sailing east before turning north to Java using the South Indian Ocean Current. The Brouwer Route became compulsory for Dutch vessels in 1617. The problem with the route, however, {{was that there was}} no easy way at the time to determine longitude, making Dutch landfalls on the west coast of Australia inevitable, as well as ships becoming wrecked on the shoals. Most of these landfalls were unplanned. The first such landfall was in 1616, when Dirk Hartog, employed by VOC, reached land at Shark Bay (on what is now called Dirk Hartog Island) off the coast of Western Australia. Finding nothing of interest, Hartog continued sailing northwards along this previously undiscovered coastline of Western Australia, making nautical charts up to about 22° latitude south. He then left the coast and continued on to Batavia. He called Australia T Landt van d'Eendracht (shortened to Eendrachtsland), after his ship, a name which would be in use until Abel Tasman named the land New Holland in 1644.|$|E
25|$|Polynesian {{contact with}} the prehispanic Mapuche culture in central-south Chile has been {{suggested}} because of apparently similar cultural traits, including words like toki (stone axes and adzes), hand clubs similar to the Māori wahaika, the sewn-plank canoe as used on Chiloe island, the curanto earth oven (Polynesian umu) common in southern Chile, fishing techniques such as stone wall enclosures, a hockey-like game, and other potential parallels. Some strong westerlies and El Niño wind blow directly from central-east Polynesia to the Mapuche region, between Concepcion and Chiloe. A direct connection from New Zealand is possible, sailing with the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties.</b> In 1834, some escapees from Tasmania arrived at Chiloe Island after sailing for 43 days.|$|E
25|$|The Tryall {{was only}} the second English ship to attempt to sail from the Cape of Good Hope to Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) along the Brouwer Route, a route pioneered by the Dutch and used {{routinely}} by them since 1616. The Brouwer Route drastically shortened voyage times by keeping ships sailing eastwards in the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> {{for as long as}} possible before turning north. The captain of the Tryall, John Brookes, grossly underestimated the longitude of the ship, and ended up around 1000 kilometres (600mi) farther east than the route specified. On turning north, the Tryall found itself skirting the west coast of Australia. Around 11pm on 25 May 1622, it struck the Tryal Rocks and sank. 46 of 139 lives were saved, including Brookes'.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 {{and arrived at}} Mauritius on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; {{there was plenty of}} fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor Adriaan van der Stel. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October using the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as Pieter Nuyts in 1626/27.) On 7 November snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-eastern direction, expecting to arrive one day at the Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|Australia has {{excellent}} wind {{resources by}} world standards. The southern coastline {{lies in the}} <b>roaring</b> <b>forties</b> and hundreds of sites have average wind speeds above 8 or even 9m/s at 50m above ground (the hub height of a modern wind generator). The southwest of Western Australia, southern South Australia, western Victoria, northern Tasmania and elevated areas of New South Wales and Queensland have good wind resources. Several states engaged in systematic wind speed monitoring in the 1980s and 1990s, the results of which are publicly available. Australian wind farms produce on average capacity factors of 30–35%, making wind an attractive option. South Australia's large share (along with nearby Victoria) means most of Australia's wind power occurs around the same time. The correlation between South Australia and NSW is 0.34, whereas the correlation between South Australia and Tasmania is 0.10.|$|E
25|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition {{departed}} the UK {{less than}} {{five months after the}} Discovery was launched and only a week after the ship left Dundee. This left little time for the ship to undergo sea trials and the voyage to New Zealand was also the brand new vessel's shakedown cruise. Scott's first impression of the ship was poor, considering her slow and unresponsive while the shallow hull, built with no protuberances to work well in ice, provided minimal stability. Discovery rolled heavily once in the open sea (she was recorded rolling through 94 degrees - 47 degrees either side of vertical- in the Southern Ocean) and tended 'gripe' (wander to and fro along her course). Shackleton described the ship as a bad sailer, carrying too much sail aft and not enough forward while Scott also worried that the design of the ship's hull was unsuitable for work in pack ice. But once the expedition reached the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> the ship proved to have excellent seakeeping and, because she was heavy and carried relatively little sail area for her size, she could make good progress in high winds and heavy seas without having to reef. The Discovery's unusual rounded, overhanging stern (one of the main changes from the original Bloodhound design) not only provided more protection for the rudder but also prevented all but the largest following seas breaking {{over the back of the}} ship and kept the decks dry, although the stern was prone to 'slamming' into waves, making the officer's accommodation and wardroom noisy.|$|E

[...] The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the progression of west to east winds to slow down.

500|$|The {{sea state}} of the ocean is {{determined}} by the size of these waves, which—on the open ocean—depends upon the wind speed and the fetch, the distance over which the wind blows upon the water. The smallest waves are called ripples, strongly affected by surface tension. As strong and prolonged winds push against ripples' raised crests, larger and more irregular waves form, which are known as seas. These waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are traveling nearly matches the speed of the wind. As the wind drops, the waves remain as swell and, over time, they naturally separate into long, powerful waves with a common direction and wavelength. These swells can travel over large distances—even half the globe—and originate particularly often from the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> of the Southern Hemisphere where the wind blows continuously. When the wind dies down, ripples easily disappear owing to water's internal friction (viscosity), but longer waves in seas and swells are only (very) slowly reduced by viscosity. Constructive interference, however, can also cause individual (unexpected) rogue waves much higher than normal. Most waves are less than [...] high and {{it is not unusual for}} strong storms to double or triple that height; offshore construction such as wind farms and oil platforms use metocean statistics from measurements in computing the wave forces (due to for instance the hundred-year wave) they are designed against. Rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above [...]|$|E

2500|$|The Southern Alps on the South Island {{were formed}} by tectonic {{uplifting}} and pressure as the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates collided along the island's western coast. The uplifting continues, raising Aoraki / Mount Cook {{an average of}} [...] each year. However, erosive forces are also powerful shapers of the mountains. The severe weather {{is due to the}} mountain's jutting into powerful westerly winds of the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> which run around approximately 45°S latitude, south of both Africa and Australia. The Southern Alps are the first obstacle the winds encounter after South Africa and Australia, having moved east across the Southern Ocean.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} trade clipper {{route from}} Australia and New Zealand to Europe took a line-of-latitude route in the Southern Ocean. Ships would drop below the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> (40°S latitudes) {{to make use}} of the prevailing westerlies which carried them around Cape Horn. [...] These winds could be strong and the waters treacherous; moreover, the smattering of islands was often poorly charted. For example, in 1868, Henry Armstrong of the Amherst notified the New Zealand government that the commonly used chart prepared by James Imray in 1851 placed the Auckland Islands 35 miles south of their true position.|$|E
2500|$|In 1885 Richard Woodget was {{appointed}} captain on {{a salary of}} £186 per year and continued to improve on the fastest trip record, achieving 77 days on his first outward trip and 73 days returning to Britain from Australia. He achieved this by taking a more southerly route than previously, to catch the strongest winds in the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> despite having to face icebergs, gales and storms whipped up by the winds he sought. Cutty Sark was the fastest ship on the wool trade for ten years.

2500|$|Wellington {{is at the}} {{south-western}} tip of the North Island on Cook Strait, {{separating the}} North and South Islands. On a clear day the snowcapped Kaikoura Ranges are visible to the south across the strait. To the north stretch the golden beaches of the Kapiti Coast. On the east the Rimutaka Range divides Wellington from the broad plains of the Wairarapa, a wine region of national notability. With a latitude of 41° 17' South, Wellington is the southernmost capital city in the world. It {{is also the most}} remote capital city, the farthest away from any other capital. It is more densely populated than most other cities in New Zealand due to the restricted amount of land that is available between its harbour and the surrounding hills. It has very few open areas in which to expand, and this has brought about the development of the suburban towns. Because of its location in the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> and its exposure to the winds blowing through Cook Strait, Wellington is the world's windiest city, with an average wind speed of , and so is known by the nickname [...] "Windy Wellington".|$|E
2500|$|In August 1642, VOC {{despatched}} Abel Tasman and Franchoijs Visscher on {{a voyage}} of {{which one of}} the objects was to obtain knowledge of [...] "all the totally unknown provinces of the kingdom of Beach". This expedition used two small ships, the Heemskerck and the Zeehaen. Starting in Mauritius both ships left on 8 October using the <b>Roaring</b> <b>Forties</b> to sail east as fast as possible. On 7 November, because of snow and hail the ships' course was altered to a more north-eastern direction. On 24 November 1642 Abel Tasman sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east, Tasman then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island where he was blown out to sea by a storm, this area he named Storm Bay. Two days later Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay – in the larger Marion Bay. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay; however, because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag in North Bay. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.|$|E
