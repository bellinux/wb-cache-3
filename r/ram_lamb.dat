5000|$|The Bluefaced Leicester (BFL) is a longwool {{breed of}} sheep which evolved from a {{breeding}} scheme of Robert Bakewell, in Dishley, Leicestershire in the eighteenth century. First known as the Dishley Leicester, and then the Hexham Leicester, because of the prevalence of the breed in Northumberland, the name Bluefaced Leicester became known {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. In the 1970s, the Bluefaced Leicester was exported to Canada. Exported frozen semen from the United Kingdom is now used to expand the genetic diversity in Canada and the United States. [...] This breed is raised primarily for meat, but their fleece is becoming increasingly popular for handspinning. Bluefaced Leicester sheep may also have brown on their face. The sell record has been set by a brown <b>ram</b> <b>lamb</b> selling for 23,000 guineas.|$|E

Twenty, six-month old lambs (10 from each sex) from each genotype were used. <b>Ram</b> and ewe <b>lambs</b> were kept in separate groups from the beginning {{until the end of the}} experiment. Birth weight and weaning weight were recorded for all animals. Body weights and body condition scores were recorded at monthly intervals between 6. 5 and 12 months of age. Blood samples were collected weekly from ewe lambs and fortnightly from <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> to monitor progesterone and testosterone profiles, respectively. Semen character- istics and scrotal circumferences (SC) were evaluated fortnightly. Weight at puberty in ewe and <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> were not sig- nificantly different among the three genotypes and ranged around 35 kg and 42 kg, respectively. In ewe lambs, age at puberty was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in A (280 ± 11. 5 d) than in RA (232 ± 11 d) and CA (255 ± 11. 5 d).

40|$|Abstract. Severe {{encephalomyelitis}} with myelomalacia in {{two young}} sheep {{was associated with}} an unidentified sporozoan parasite that was passing through a schizogonic cycle in astrocytes. Mature merozoites were 5 - 7 urn in length, had a conoid, subpellicular micro-tubules, paired organelles and many micronemes. Their morphology is {{compared with that of}} Toxoplasma and other related sporozoans. The apparent absence of gametogony suggests that the schizogonic cycle in the central nervous system could be an aberrant dead-end cycle. There are many well-recognized bacterial and viral infections that cause encephalomyelitis in sheep [7]. A protozoan parasite suspected of being Tox-oplasma gondii has also been seen in isolated cases of ovine encephalomyelitis [5, 12, 16]. COLE et al. [I] described toxoplasmosis in sheep characterized by respiratory and neurological signs, and KOESTNER and COLE [9] described the neural lesions. Isolated cysts, morphologically resem bling Sarcocystis are oc-casionally seen in ovine brain but are not associated with any host reaction [4, 17]. The present paper reports a severe encephalomyelitis and myelomalacia in two sheep, which was associated with an unidentified protozoan parasite. Field Observations Case I.

Samples of Longissimus dorsi muscle were analyzed for their content in moisture, ash, crude protein, total lipids, and fatty acid profile. Oleic acid (18 : 1 n- 9) was in greater concentration than other fatty acids in all samples investigated.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{phenotype}} {{of increased}} muscle mass (IMM) and reduced fat, comparable to reported effects of deleterious mutations in the myostatin gene (MSTN), {{has been observed}} in the Norwegian Spælsau breed. However, the genotyping of five AI rams producing descendants with this phenotype, failed to reveal any of the known functional MSTN mutations. Findings In the present study, the coding region of the MSTN gene was sequenced in a Spælsau <b>ram</b> <b>lamb</b> with this particular phenotype. A one base-pair insertion mutation (c. 120 insA) producing a premature stop codon in amino acid position 49 was identified. The consequence of this mutation is that the bioactive carboxy-terminal end of the protein is not translated, and a completely non-functional myostatin protein is produced. Among the 98 available AI rams of this breed, all five individuals having descendants with this particular phenotype {{were found to be}} heterozygous for the c. 120 insA mutation. The probability that these five selected AI rams should be heterozygous carriers of the c. 120 insA mutation purely by chance was calculated to be 3. 1 × 10 - 7. In total, 7 AI rams were found to be heterozygous carriers of c. 120 insA. The estimated breeding values (EBVs) for EUROP carcass conformation and fat class for these 7 individuals also points towards a strong phenotypic effect of this mutation. Conclusion Based upon the completely deleterious effect this novel c. 120 insA mutation has on myostatin protein function, and the documented phenotypic effect of comparable MSTN mutations in Norwegian White Sheep and other species, we conclude that this mutation is the functional explanation underlying the IMM phenotype in Norwegian Spælsau. The allele distribution among the 98 genotyped AI rams support this conclusion, and also suggests that c. 120 insA is the most common reason for this phenotype in the Norwegian Spælsau breed. </p...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to estimate genetic parameters for feed intake, feeding behavior, and ADG in composite ram lambs (¹⁄₂ Columbia, ¹⁄₄ Hampshire, ¹⁄₄ Suffolk). Data were collected from 1986 to 1997 on 1, 239 ram lambs from approximately 11 to 17 wk of age at the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center near Clay Center, NE. Feeding equipment consisted of an elevated pen with an entrance chute that permitted access to the feeder by only one <b>ram</b> <b>lamb</b> at a time, with disappearance of feed measured by an electronic weighing system. Ram lambs were grouped 11 per pen from 1986 to 1989, and nine per pen from 1990 to 1997. Data were edited to exclude invalid feeding events, and approximately 80 % of the data remained after edits were applied. Traits analyzed were daily feed intake (DFI), event feed intake (EFI), residual feed intake (RFI), daily feeding time (DFT), event feeding time (EFT), number of daily feeding events (DFE), and ADG. Feed intake traits of DFI and EFI had estimated heritabilities of 0. 25 and 0. 33, respectively, whereas estimated heritability of RFI was 0. 11. Heritability estimates for feeding behavior traits, including DFT, EFT, and DFE, ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 36. Average daily gain had an estimated heritability of 0. 26. Genetic correlations were positive between all pairs of traits, except for RFI and ADG, and that estimate was essentially zero. Phenotypic correlations were generally similar to genetic correlations. Genetic correlations were large (0. 80) between DFI and ADG, intermediate between DFI and RFI (0. 61) and between DFT and DFE (0. 55), and low (0. 17 to 0. 31) for the other pairs of traits, {{with the exception of}} RFI and ADG (− 0. 03). Genetic correlations between behavioral traits were greater than correlations between behavioral traits and measures of feed intake or ADG; however, selection for ADG and/or feed intake would be expected to cause some changes in feeding behavior...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ram</b> <b>lamb</b> epididymitis, {{a serious}} {{reproductive}} disease of sheep, is caused principally by bacteria {{belonging to the}} genera Haemophilus and Actinobacillus. Six bacteria were studied: the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) of Actinobacillus seminis (ATCC 15768), ATCC of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 29522), field isolates of A seminis (86722 and 4101) and field isolates of Actin obacillus- like bacteria (Y 136 and D 107). The objectives {{of this study were}} to quantitate the adhesion of these 6 bacteria to bovine kidney epithelial cells (BKECs) and ram epididymal epithelial cells (REECs), evaluate the effect of rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared against ATCC 15768 (PoAb 15768) on bacterial adherence to BKECs and REECs, and partially characterize the adhesins present on these bacteria. In a bacterial adhesion assay (BAA), strain and species differences were noted. The number of bacteria adhering to each BKEC ranged (rom a low of 4. 27 ± 1. 00 (Actinobacillus-like 0107) to a high of 31. 84 ± 2. 00 (A seminis 86722). The number of bacteria adhering to each REEC ranged from a low of 3. 05 ± 0. 34 (Actinobacill us-like 0107) to a high of 21. 61 ± 2. 03 (Actinobacillus like Yl 36). In a bacterial inhibition assay (BIA), PoAb 15768 inhibited the adhesion of ATCC 15768 to both BKECs and REECs by 5 %. This same antiserum inhibited the adhesion of ATCC 29522 to BKECs by 14. 5 % and to REECs by 22 %. The inhibition of A seminis 86722 adherence to BKECs and to REECs was less than 14 % and 35 %, respectively. For A seminis 4101, Actinobacillus-like Y 136, and Actinobacillus-like 0107, PoAb 15768 failed to prevent adhesion to either BKECs or REECs. When the 6 bacteria were analyzed by autoradiography, 2 (Actinobacillus-like 0107) to 8 (ATCC 29522) potential adhesins were identified. However, the pathogenicity has not been firmly established for many Actinobacillus species and Actinobacillus-like bacteria. The potential adhesins identified in this study were not unequivocally confirmed as bacterial adhesins. An in vit ro model may facilitate the recognition of potential adhesins used by Actinobacillus species and Actinobacillus-like bacteria and may eventually lead to the development of an efficacious bacterin to prevent epididymitis in ram lambs at risk...|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies using}} the Booroola Merino {{crossbred}} animals were conducted. In the first, the flock mating performance of Booroola Merino-Romney crossbred ram lambs mated to Perendale ewes was examined. The second study comprised {{observations on the}} incidence of foot "conditions" in young Booroola Merino crossbreds and Perendale sheep grazed on hill country. MATING PERFORMANCE Eighteen Booroola Merino x Romney ram lam's (6 control, 12 mating group) were selected according to weaning weight, fleece characteristics and general body condition. Nine ram lambs were exposed to ewes prior to mating for two weeks (trained) and nine kept separate from any ewes (untrained). The ram lambs of the mating group (6 trained, 6 untrained) were allocated to six groups of ewes which were "single-sire" mated. Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 comprised 140 ewes each and Groups 5 and 6 comprised 100 e';̇res each. The ram lambs were changed after eight, eight, seven and seven days of mating, Periods P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4 respectively, {{and a total of}} 12 "single-sire" mating groups generated. All ram lambs produced a satisfactory semen sample before joining with the flocks. Mating commenced on 30 March 1981. The flock mating performance of each <b>ram</b> <b>lamb</b> was assessed by recording the percentage of ewes raddled, percentage of ewes returning to service, percentage of pregnant ewes, percentage of ewes lambing, docking rate and weaning rate. Differences among each of these parameters were attributed to various factors. Trained and untrained ram lambs were similar in most of the observed parameters of flock mating performance. There were no differences between individual ram lambs within each sire-group (trained or untrained) in mating performance. There were differences in the percentage of ewes raddled between first and second oestrous cycle of mating. Live weights of the ram lambs were measured from weaning (December 1980) {{until the end of the}} trial (December 1981), at weekly intervals during the mating periods and at monthly intervals during the post-mating and post-shearing periods. There was little loss in the mean live weight of the mating group ram lambs after P 1. Overall the live weights of both groups increased consistently throughout the trial. Semen samples (collected by electro-ejaculation) from the ram lambs of the mating group were microscopically examined for general motility after each mating period at least for three days. Recovery from mating exhaustion occurred four and six days after P 1 and Pz respectively, while three and two days were required after P 3 and P 4 respectively. Semen samples were also collected on two occasions from the rams (only 15) as two-tooths and examined for general motility, sperm concentration and percentage of live sperm. There were no differences in semen characteristics between rams of the mated and control groups. The two-tooth rams were also subjected individually and randomly on three occasions to pen-libido tests, each with two oestrous ewes. Mating ability was assessed by recording the number of mounts attempted on the oestrous ewes, the number of services, the reaction time to mount (in seconds) and the reaction time to service. There were no differences between the mating and control groups in the number of mounts and number of services performed on each occasion of the libido test. Significant differences were found between both groups in reaction time to mount and in reaction time to service but only at the first libido test. It was concluded that the Booroola Merino x Romney ram lambs had achieved satisfactory levels of flock mating performance under the conditions of the trial. No adverse effects of mating on the post-mating body development of the <b>ram</b> <b>lamb</b> could be detected. Semen quality from the ram lambs deteriorated during mating but recovered shortly after mating. The use of ram lambs as sires had no adverse effects on their semen characteristics and libido performance at the two-tooth age. FOOT "CONDITIONS" The incidence of abnormal foot shape, foot scald and footrot was observed in Perendale and Booroola Merino crossbreds. The animals were generated in 1980 and 1981. Observations on foot "conditions" were made at the lamb, hogget and two-tooth ages for animals born in 1980, and at the lamb and hogget ages for those born in 1981. A scoring system was used to rank the various foot "conditions" (shape; scald; footrot) which were assessed separately. Booroola Merino crossbreds showed significantly a higher incidence of abnormal foot shape, foot scald and footrot than did Perendale sheep. Significant differences in foot "conditions" were also found between (Booroola x Romney) x Perendale and Booroola x Romney sheep. Sires of the progeny generated in 1980 and 1981 provided a major source for the variation in the incidence of these foot "conditions". Estimates of heritability of each of the observed foot "conditions" were calculated at different ages (lamb, hogget and two-tooth). Sex of the lamb caused significant effects on the incidence of abnormal foot shape and foot scald between ram lambs and ewe lambs, but not on the incidence of footrot. Differences in the incidence of abnormal foot shape and foot scald occurred between 1980 - and 1981 -born sheep. These differences were attributed partly to the particular climatic conditions in each year (notably the annual rainfall). It was concluded that under environmental conditions similar to that of the present trial, long-term selection programmes could be applied to enhance the natural resistance of sheep against foot diseases...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the head load effect on nutrient utilization and blood parameters of Awassi <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> and male Kilis goats fed different concentrate levels. Eight Awassi <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> (29. 63 ± 3. 5 kg) and 8 Kilis male goats (29. 72 ± 3. 01 kg) at same age (6 - 7 months) for apparent digestion trials were used as experimental animals. Experiment was arranged in 2 x 2 factorial in which season animal species (sheep versus goat), and concentrate level (80 versus 50 %) were the main effects to be investigated. Animal species {{had a significant effect}} on DMI and <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> consumed more DM than goats (2. 64 vs 2. 38 %of BW) (P < 0. 05). Increment of concentrate feed level improved DM, OM and CP digestibility due to decreasing level of straw which has very low digestibility comparison with concentrate feed. Increasing concentrate level decreased ADF (50. 29 vs 38. 21) and NDF (51. 27 vs 43. 49) digestibility. Animal species effect on rectal temperature was found significant (P < 0. 05) with animal species x concentrate level (39. 23 vs 39. 33 oC for goat and 40. 05 vs 39. 53 oC for sheep). As a conclusion, Awassi <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> and Kilis goats exposed to head load and fed different levels of concentrate had similar nutrient utilization and blood parameters levels. Goat had better heat dissipating capacity...|$|R
40|$|Divergent {{selection}} {{based on}} the LH response to a 5 -g 9 dose of GnRH in 10 -wk-old Finn Dorset <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> has created two lines of sheep that differ significantly in their response to both physiological and pharmacological dosages of GnRH. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate whether there are between-line differences in endogenous LH and FSH secretion in <b>ram</b> <b>lambs,</b> as in the adult ewes, and to determine whether these differences are related to differences in storage of gonadotropins within the pituitary glands of the two lines. To address the first aim, endogenous LH and FSH secretion was monitored in 20 <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> from each line for a 6 -h period at 2, 6, and 10 wk of age. To investigate potential between-line differences in gonadotropin storage, the LH responses to two acute challenges with either 0. 5, 5. 0, or 50. 0 pg of GnRH were examined in 10 -wk-old <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> from each line. The results demonstrated that the between-line difference in the LH response to a 5 -pg GnRH challenge in <b>ram</b> <b>lambs</b> is accompanied by significant between-line differences in the regulation of endogenous gonadotropin secretion. Specifically, lambs from the High line secreted LH pulses of significantly greater amplitude than did lambs from the Low line at 2 and 10 wk of age. In addition, the results demonstrated that the readily releasable and releasable pools of LH were larger in the lambs from the High line than in those from the Low line but that there were no differences in the dynamics of LH secretion from these two pools between the two lines. In conclusion, the observed differences in the amount of releasable gonadotropin stored within the pituitary glands of lambs from the two lines explain the between-line differences in LH responsiveness to pharmacological dosages of GnRH but not the observed between-line difference in pituitary sensitivity...|$|R
