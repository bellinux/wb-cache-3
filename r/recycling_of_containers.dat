The BCMB oversees two non-profit corporations which process the materials, the Alberta Beer Container Corporation (ABCC) for standard-sized beer bottles (which reuses rather than recycles the bottles) and the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation (ABCRC) for all other beverage containers.

Some plastics and aseptic packages have been assessed as [...] "relatively good" [...] in overall costs, although no packaging is always better. The major problem, however, {{is that the}} hydrapulping facilities are not that common, and thus the multimaterial packages are relatively difficult to recycle. Tetra Pak, a notable company in the industry, has launched an initiative to increase the <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> aseptic <b>containers.</b> A 1995 book on recycling notes that aseptic containers were not widely recycled. In 1993, aseptic packages could be recycled in 19 US states. Confusion over whether aseptic packages can be recycled led to a 1990 ban on them in Maine. The ban was repealed in 1994.|$|R

50|$|The {{implementation}} <b>of</b> reusable plastic <b>containers</b> arises as {{a consequence}} of concerns with sustainability and environmental impact. Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive. The adoption <b>of</b> reusable plastic <b>containers</b> will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods. The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses. Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost <b>of</b> the <b>containers</b> as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime <b>of</b> reusable plastic <b>containers.</b> One cycle consists of the initial stages <b>of</b> processing plastic <b>containers</b> {{all the way to the}} use and <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> these <b>containers</b> by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs. Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost <b>of</b> reusable plastic <b>containers</b> is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system. Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.|$|R
40|$|EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) or Policy Means for Recycling {{is adapted}} in many OECD countries. Its Policy Effect, however, is {{different}} in each country. In Germany and South Korea, the amount used of can or plastic product, becomes less instead of increasing of that of bottle or paper product. In the United States and Japan, however, a disposable plastic, metallic, aluminum, etc. are increasing rapidly. These are the different Policy Effects resulting from the different Policy Means of each country. The difference in the reducing policy <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> and packaging waste in each country {{is based on the}} following five Policy Means. 1. To what extent (production, recovery, processing stage) is producer responsibility expanded? 2. With what kind of responsibility are the persons concerned burdened? 3. Which source of discharge of waste (house discharge, office or company discharge, especially service and retail store discharge) is set up as an object <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> system? 4. What container packing material as the object <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> is set? 5. How are the policy means such as a mandatory control means, an economical means, and autonomous agreement combined? Based on the issues above, we aim to examine which means is the most efficient for reduction <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> and packaging waste. As a part of the research, this paper focuses on the direct regulation of the disposable product in South Korea. In conclusion, the regulation policy has an effect on reduction and <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>container</b> and packaging waste to a great extent...|$|R

5000|$|On a {{national}} level, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees {{a variety of}} waste issues.

Further regulation is reserved for individual states to create. State regulation falls into two major categories: landfill bans and recycling goals. Landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in a landfill. Most often these items include yard waste, oil, and recyclables easily collected in curbside recycling programs. States with landfill bans of recyclables include Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and North Carolina. [...] Other states focus on recycling goals. These include California and Illinois.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a TNO study of the present situation in Europe with regard to PET-bottle recycling. The overview concentrates on the main PET-bottles consuming countries in Europe i. e. : France, Italy, Spain and the UK. In addition the system in Belgium is presented. Applying a statistical forecasting model to existing data from European collection systems it is forecast that a <b>recycling</b> rate <b>of</b> about 40 Vo is achievable in the year 2000 for Italy and France. The collection of PET in the UK is not as advanced as in the former countries. However, with the data available it is forecasted that with the present system it is expected that about 12 % wlll be recycled in the year 2, 000. The introduction of a legalised system in the UK may improve the situation. In the case of Spain, many obstacles still have to be overcome before PET-recycling will be effective, although some positive developments can be mentioned from public initiatives. The effect of the introduction of an eco-tax in Europe is still difficult to forecast depending on which way the levies will be applied (i. e., a levy on new material or discarded material). On average, for all countries in Europe, <b>recycling</b> <b>of</b> PET <b>containers</b> should reach a level close to 15 % contributing to the EU-target of at least 15 % material recycling for all plastics packaging. The collection systems studied are either drop-off systems or kerbside collection. Both of these systems have their draw-backs, either in capture rate, quality or in costs. Improvements of the collection systems may be necessary or a quite different approach could be followed. TNO is of the opinion that the return shop might {{be one of the best}} future options to use in conjunction with or as an alternative to the current systems.

5|$|Saint Anselm College RECYCLES was a {{greening}} movement {{which started}} on campus in 2009. Up to that time, recycling was limited on campus, and {{students had to}} resort to their own methods <b>of</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>containers</b> and other recyclables in dorms.

In the 2010 spring semester, this plan funded by Club Soccer and the Knights of Columbus provided over fifty recycle bins, purchased from the city of Providence, Rhode Island. In the spring of 2010, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics installed seven recycling bins throughout its facilities. Inspired by this student-led activity, the college's physical plant purchased 120 bins for all of the apartments in the Uppers, Lowers and Falvey and Collins Houses. In the fall of 2010, Physical Plant installed five Waste Management recycling dumpsters throughout campus. Campus-wide recycling is planned by 2013.|$|R
