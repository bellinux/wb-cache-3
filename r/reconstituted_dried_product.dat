40|$|To {{establish}} whether starters used in {{the production}} of DOP Montasio cheese, whether prepared in liquid milk or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dried</b> milk, can be regarded as a true ingredient, bearing in mind that all its components (particularly the casein) are found in the curd, 2 batches of cheese were made using approx. 3600 l milk plus 1 % (v/v) starter in either liquid or <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dried</b> milk form; batch milk without starter was used as control. After 60 days' ripening, the cheeses were examined for yield and contents of moisture, DM, NaCl, fats, total N, and total protein. Use of the <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dried</b> milk starter increased yield by about 3 kg compared with the control, the liquid milk starter giving a 2 -kg increase. Chemical composition of the cheeses was approximately the same. It is concluded that <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dried</b> milk starters should not be considered as a mere "technological coadjuvant" when used within the limits set by Italian Ministry of Health Circular 703 / 21. 64 / 6 / 551, dated May 22, 1985...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a project}} {{designed}} to utilize common dairy waste <b>products</b> profitably, <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dry</b> whey permeate and delactosed whey were tested as growth substrates for mycelia of the edible mushroom Lentinus edodes. This mushroom was chosen because {{it is possible to}} profitably cultivate it due to its popular culinary appeal and perceived medical benefits. Growth experiments were performed in petri dishes containing either <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dry</b> whey permeate or delactosed whey as a growth substrate, and the measured response was the size of the growing mycelia colony. When <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dry</b> whey permeate was utilized as a growth substrate, the factors of substrate concentration, pH, and growth temperature were controlled in an effort to determine the optimal growth conditions for the mushroom mycelia. These conditions were determined by applying an analytical method known as response surface methodology (RSM). RSM is a collection of mathematical techniques that is able to determine optimal values for many variables run simultaneously in an experiment. Mycelia were also grown on delactosed whey at different substrate concentrations in an effort to determine if this substrate would be suitable for the growth of mushroom mycelia. Results: RSM was successfully utilized to determine the optimal growth conditions for L. edodes when grown on <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dry</b> whey powder. These conditions were 40 g/L substrate concentration, pH 4. 97, and temperature 23. 6 °C Delactosed whey was successfully utilized as a growth substrate for L. edodes.

40|$|Tie {{problem was}} to {{determine}} the effects of scalding <b>reconstituted</b> nonfat <b>dry</b> milk solids on the volume and texture of yeast bread. Results of experimental work during the summer in 1971 in Advanced Experimental Foods, RFN 520, aroused interest in continuing investigation. The basic problem in 1977. was to measure the effects of heat treatment on <b>reconstituted</b> <b>dry</b> milk solids on the quality of yeast breads. Bread using mi k scalded at 920 C appeased to have less volume and a compact and. inelastic texture. Such results were not expected and could not be explained from information available in the literature. Original plans for the present research project Were to determine if further chemical changes occurred during scalding that had not occurred during the drying process and to study the effect of heat treatment on the volume and texture of bread. Determination of the chemical changes was eliminated since it required more specialized procedures and. equipment than were available. The present study {{was to determine}} if the changes noted in the quality of the bread made With the heat treated dry milk solids was due to evaporation. Therefore, yeast breads were meds using three different treatments of the milk before it Was incorporated into the other ingredients (1) <b>reconstituted</b> nonfat <b>dry</b> milk solids were premeasured then scalded; (2) <b>reconstituted</b> nonfat <b>dry</b> milk solids were scaled then measured; and (3) <b>reconstituted</b> nonfat <b>dry</b> milk solids were measured with no heat 4 rea nt. 7 he present problem vas del sited by using only one brand of nonfat dry milk solids. Present literature available in textbooks and periodicals does not give specific directions in using nonfat dry milk solids in bread-making. All consumers, especially homemakers and classroom teachers of foods and nutrition, should be aware of any significant difference in the volume and texture of the bread made from scalded nonfat dry milk solids.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were; 1) to design and develop a microwave vacuum dehydration system; 2) to commission and test the microwave vacuum dehydration system and 3) to compare the effectiveness with conventional dehydration methods. A microwave vacuum dehydration system was successfully developed for dehydration of heat sensitive materials such as biological and agricultural products. Microwave is recognized as a fast heating process characterised by volumetric heating. Contrary to conventional dehydration method which heats {{from the surface of}} material, microwave heats material from inside out. Incorporation of vacuum enhances the microwave dehydration process by allowing water to vaporize at lower temperature. Thus, dehydration of heat sensitive materials can be achieved at low temperature and shorter time thereby preventing degradation of nutritional values and texture. Commissioning and testing of the developed microwave vacuum dehydration system showed that the system is capable to produce good quality of dehydrated products. This can be achieved by adjusting microwave power and vacuum pressure. In comparison of different dehydration methods for jackfruit, it was found that vacuum microwave dried sample had higher rehydration potential, better in colour, aroma and structure, lower density and softer texture than hot air <b>dried</b> <b>products.</b> The hot air <b>dried</b> <b>products</b> were darker in colour, hardness and shrunken.
