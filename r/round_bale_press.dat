40|$|The {{results of}} {{economical}} and energy requirements evaluation of hay production {{are presented in}} the paper. A model of a cheap, fitted to natural land profile ramp for delivery of hay to a place for storage was proposed. We determined that maximum angle of the ramp, at average density of hay - approximately 78 kg/m³ was - 18 ° using pick-up trailer T 084. It was estimated that direct expenses, for pickup of hay in windrows and for unloading in a storage using the ramp, were 1, 25 times less than using a pneumatic loader, 1, 35 times less than for pressing in bales and for a belt conveyor, and 2 times less than using a <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> <b>press</b> and a self-loading trailer Dromader...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida on the {{conservation}} of forages as <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage. Grasses and legumes have been harvested using conventional hay making equipment and ensiled as large, <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> of high moisture forage sealed in plastic. When compared to hay, <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage offers an alternative forage conservation system that decreases {{the amount of time}} spent drying the forage prior to storage. The benefits of this system include reduced rain damage and field losses, and increased flexibility in scheduling harvesting (allowing producers to harvest for optimum forage quality and yield). When compared with chopped silage, the benefits of <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage include excellent dry matter recovery, decreased energy costs and lowered initial capital investment. Main disadvantages are increased capital investment and costs for expendable supplies (when the system is compared to hay), and the susceptibility of plastic used to store <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage to rodent damage and deterioration under intense sunlight. Field wilting (to increase dry matter at time of storage to 40 to 50 %) improves the quality of <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage made under Florida conditions. Three to four hours usually is required to accomplish this degree of wilt with bermudagrass. Adding ammonia to <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage prevents external molding but may result in undesirable fermentation characteristics, especially when high moisture, tropical forages are ensiled. Microbial inoculation (to promote lactic acid production) temporarily improves the quality of direct-cut, high moisture (< 30 % dry matter) <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage made with bermudagrass, but pH of inoculated silage generally is not lowered enough to stabilize such silage in a high-quality state. The combination of cellulase-enzyme treatment and inoculation, however, has shown potential to improve the quality of bermudagrass <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage...|$|R

40|$|Some of {{the best}} quality silage ever made has come from <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> sealed in plastic. On the other hand, {{some of the worst}} silage that I have ever seen {{likewise}} came from <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> in plastic. These extremes in quality are related to procedural techniques for putting up <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage and problems that can occur during storage. If proper techniques are followed, excellent quality silage can be produced, especially from late summer and fall cuttings. But if bales are not managed properly, it can be a disaster resulting in total loss of the silage. It may be easier to preserve hay crop silage in upright, trench and bunker silos than in large bales sealed in plastic. Plastic is much more susceptible to air leaks and oxygen infiltration than concrete or steel, so the ease of maintaining an oxygen-free storage environment is much less for bales surrounded by plastic than for conventional silos. The <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> silage system, sometimes referred to as `balage', has a number of advantages over hay and conventional silage systems: 1. Substantially reduces the risk of weather damage to the forage compared with a hay system. 2. Provides flexibility as the baler can be used for both hay and silage.

40|$|The {{amounts of}} wheat or hybrid sudan hay wasted with three large <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> feeding methods were {{evaluated}} at two ranch locations. The feeding methods were: 1) bale processor (Hay Forage Industries BP 25 ®) used to shred forage into bunks; 2) the same processor used to shred forage onto the ground; and 3) unrolling large <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> on the ground. Estimated forage wastages or refusals from unrolling, shredding onto ground, and shredding into bunks were 23, 13, and 8 % with wheat hay and 22, 16, and 11 % with sudan hay, respectively. These results demonstrate {{the potential for}} substantial savings of forage.

50|$|Alternatively, a {{grapple fork}} {{may be used}} to lift and {{transport}} large <b>round</b> <b>bales.</b> The grapple fork is a hydraulically driven implement attached {{to the end of a}} tractor's bucket loader. When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large <b>round</b> <b>bale,</b> the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the bucket is lifted with the bale in tow. Grab hooks installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle <b>round</b> <b>bales,</b> and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.|$|R
50|$|The rounded {{surface of}} <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> poses a {{challenge}} for long-haul, flat-bed transport, as they could roll off of the flat surface if not properly supported. This is particularly the case with large round bales; their size makes them difficult to flip, so {{it may not be}} feasible to flip many of them onto the flat surface for transport and then re-position them on the round surface at the destination. One option that works with both large and small <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> is to equip the flat-bed trailer with guard-rails at either end, which prevent bales from rolling either forward or backward. Another solution is the saddle wagon, which has closely spaced rounded saddles or support posts in which <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> sit. The tall sides of each saddle prevent the bales from rolling around while on the wagon, as the bale settles down in between posts. On 3 September 2010, on the A381 in Halwell near Totnes, Devon, UK an early member of British rock group ELO Mike Edwards was killed when his van was crushed by a large <b>round</b> <b>bale.</b> The cellist, 62, died instantly when the 600 kg bale fell from a tractor on nearby farmland before rolling onto the road and crushing his van.|$|R

50|$|A large <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> can be {{directly}} used for feeding animals by placing it in a feeding area, tipping it over, removing the bale wrap, and placing a protective ring (a ring feeder) around the outside so that animals don't walk on hay that has been peeled off the outer perimeter of the <b>bale.</b> The <b>round</b> baler's rotational forming and compaction process also enables {{both large and small}} <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> to be fed out by unrolling the bale, leaving a continuous flat strip in the field or behind a feeding barrier.|$|R
50|$|Farmers {{who need}} to make large amounts of hay are likely to choose balers which produce much larger bales, maximizing the amount of hay which is {{protected}} from the elements. Large bales come in two types, round and square. Large square bales, which can weigh up to 1000 kg, can be stacked and are easier to transport on trucks. Large <b>round</b> <b>bales,</b> which typically weigh 300 to(-) 400 kg, are more moisture-resistant, and pack the hay more densely (especially at the center). <b>Round</b> <b>bales</b> are quickly fed {{with the use of}} mechanized equipment.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ratio of}} volume to surface area makes it {{possible}} for many dry-area farmers to leave large bales outside until they are consumed. Wet-area farmers and those in climates with heavy snowfall can stack <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> under a shed or tarp, but can also use a light but durable plastic wrap that partially encloses bales left outside. The wrap repels moisture, but leaves the ends of the bale exposed so that the hay itself can [...] "breathe" [...] and does not begin to ferment.

50|$|This form of bale is {{not much}} used in {{large-scale}} commercial agriculture, because of the costs involved in handling many small bales. However, it enjoys some popularity in small-scale, low-mechanization agriculture and horse-keeping. Besides using simpler machinery and being easy to handle, these small bales {{can also be used}} for insulation and building materials in straw-bale construction. Square bales may generally weather better than <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> because a more much dense stack can be put up. However, they don't shed water as <b>round</b> <b>bales</b> do. Convenience is also a major factor in farmers deciding to continue putting up square bales, as they make feeding and bedding in confined areas (stables, barns, etc.) much easier.|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} tool for large <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> handling is the bale spear or spike, {{which is usually}} mounted {{on the back of}} a tractor or the front of a skid-steer. It is inserted into the approximate center of the <b>round</b> <b>bale,</b> then lifted and the bale is hauled away. Once at the destination, the bale is set down, and the spear pulled out. Careful placement of the spear in the center is needed or the bale can spin around and touch the ground while in transport, causing a loss of control. When used for wrapped bales that are to be stored further, the spear makes a hole in the wrapping that must be sealed with plastic tape to maintain a hermetic seal.|$|R

5000|$|For {{animals that}} eat silage, a bale wrapper {{may be used}} to seal a <b>round</b> <b>bale</b> {{completely}} and trigger the fermentation process.
