For this purpose, the flows of permanent migrations between European countries (NUTS 0 level) as well as internal flows of permanent migrations between regions (NUTS 2 level) were analyzed by selected European countries, and between Slovenian regions (NUTS 3 level). Travel time between regional centres at NUTS 0, NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 level were calculated using network analyst tools (software package ArcGIS).

For example, the popularity of second home tourism in the hinterland of population centres is based on the short distance between second homes and the permanent residence of second home owners.

The study examines the municipalities of residence of the second home owners in four large resorts – Levi, Ruka, Saariselkä and Ylläs – in northern Finland.

Our focus here is specifically on the Belgian case, namely the ‘Emirdag connection’. In Belgium, the majority of immigrants with a Turkish background come from the region of Emirdag, {{in the province of}} Afyon. On the basis of quantitative research methodologies, we first consider the magnitude of the phenomenon and the socio-economic situation of those involved. Using the qualitative research techniques of participant observation and in-depth interviews, we analyze the mechanisms in an attempt to explain marriage migration between these regions. Why do so many young people, born and raised in Western Europe, opt for an unknown partner from a region that is largely unknown to them but which proves to be their parents', or even grandparents', region of origin? Why does migration remain such a valuable life project for many young people in these regions of origin, despite the real danger of many negative side effects? The popularity of marriage migration is often explained by its role in making migration possible. However, migration theories alone cannot explain this phenomenon.

Predicting the East German outmigration to West Germany and the potential migration gains from Eastern Europe is of general interest for regional policy in East Germany. Strong migration gains are expected particularly from Poland, the direct neighbour of East Germany and the sixth-largest EU country. Even in case of German internal migration, existing empirical analyses at the macrolevel do not fully reflect the significant structural differences between both parts of the country.

While previous macroeconometric models of migration control for several regional determinants, they have so far neglected the effects of human capital investments.

30|$|Regarding {{multilateral}} {{resistance to}} migration, autocorrelation of residuals in (1)–(2) cannot be ruled out. In consequence, the estimated coefficient of {{unemployment in the}} origin country might be upward biased. To solve this problem, we follow Bertoli et al. (2013 a) who add as an auxiliary variable the cross-sectional (over countries) average of the dependent and independent variables, using monthly observations, to incorporate {{the changes in the}} willingness to migrate to alternative destinations (common correlated effect (CCE)). We will do the same averaging over countries and <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> If there is correlation between unemployment rates of alternative origin countries, the estimated coefficient of the impact of unemployment rate in the origin country on foreign migration flows is biased upwards. This is the case because we do not observe all bilateral movements, and the flows between two different origin countries that present a certain correlation in unemployment affect the flows between that country and Spain. In principle, this problem should be less problematic for Spaniards since we have all the relevant information for this particular group and internal migration is not very much affected by unemployment differentials (Bentolila and Dolado 1991; Antolín and Bover 1997). In order to check the above hypothesis, we also estimate Eq. (1) on internal migrations showing that they do not increase with unemployment differentials across regions. 12 Multilateral resistance to migration is not relevant to identify the coefficient of the unemployment rate <b>of</b> the <b>regions</b> in Spain. Indeed, there is a high correlation of unemployment among Spanish regions, and it is likely that foreigners in a first stage choose Spain and decide to go to one particular region balancing many other reasons such as the size of the community of foreigners there. 13 When we apply this CCE methodology at the regional level in (1), the autocorrelation disappears for foreign entries.|$|R
40|$|Diese Dissertation umfasst drei Aufsätzen, die sich mit Erwartungen, Entscheidungen und deren Rückwirkung auf die Umgebung beschäftigen. Der erste Aufsatz untersucht die Binnenwanderung von Ost- nach Westdeutschland. Dabei wird der Zusammenhang von Variation in ökonomischen Disparitäten zwischen der Ursprungs- und der Zielregion und Bildungsniveau, Alter und Arbeitsmarktstatus der wandernden Bevölkerung untersucht. Mit Hilfe der SOEP Daten von 1993 bis 2011 gelangt die Untersuchung zu dem Ergebnis, dass regionale Disparitäten in Verbindung mit der Selbstselektion der Wandernden stehen. Während die Wandernden im Durchschnitt jünger und besser ausgebildet als die Bleibenden sind, verringert sich dieser Unterschied, wenn die Differentiale in den Arbeitslosenquoten zwischen den Regionen steigen. Im zweiten Aufsatz entwickle ich ein Modell zur Untersuchung von prosozialem Verhalten in Begegnungen mit Fremden. Durch das Abstrahieren von Möglichkeiten der Reputationsbildung oder des Bestraftwerdens, entfallen die wesentlichen strategischen Motive für prosoziales Verhalten. Die Entscheidung prosozial zu Handeln ist dann nicht mehr strategisch vorteilhaft sondern intrinsisch motiviert durch Altruismus und einer Neigung sich an das Verhalten anderer anzupassen. In einem zweiten Schritt untersuche ich, ob die Erkenntnisse des Modells mit dem empirisch beobachteten Verhalten übereinstimmen. Der dritte Aufsatz skizziert eine (mögliche) Verhaltensstruktur und notwendige Bedingungen auf Mikroebene, die zu den beobachteten Verhaltensunterschieden in prosozialem Verhalten zwischen dem ländlichen und städtischen Raum führen. Den Rahmen des hier entwickelten Modells bildet das bekannte Gefangenen Dilemma, das wiederholt mit zufällig zugeordneten Partnern einer großen Gesellschaft gespielt wird. Das Modell bezieht Merkmale ein, die sich häufig in realen Begegnungen wiederfinden: imperfekte Information, freiwillige Teilnahme und eine Neigung sich dem Verhalten anderer anzupassen. This thesis {{consists}} of three essays that analyze choices and beliefs to explore how both lead to adaptive behavior. The first essay examines the positive net migration flow from the eastern to western parts of Germany. The migration decision is substantially based on expectations about future developments. With economic conditions changing substantially over the past 20 years {{in the eastern part}} of Germany, the incentives to migrate have also altered, so changing the composition of the east-to-west migrant body. This essay explores variations in economic disparities between the region of origin and <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> relating them to changes in the skill level, age and labor force status of the migrant population. Analyzing SOEP data from 1993 - 2011, the findings suggest that, with falling wage differentials, older migrants are less frequent job-to-job movers and are more likely to be non-working prior to migration. Furthermore, while migrants tend to be younger and better educated than stayers, the group of movers becomes partly less distinct from the group of stayers with respect to the skill and age composition when regional disparities in employment opportunities increase. The second and the third essay of this thesis model the decision making process in social interactions between strangers. In these situations, choices are often affected by beliefs about others behavior. In the second essay of this work, I develop a simple model of prosocial behavior for encounters between strangers. By abstracting from the possibility of reputation building and punishment between anonymous partners, I remove the main strategic motives for prosocial behavior so reducing it to a simple non-strategic decision. The principal motivation to behave prosocially is then intrinsic, based on altruism, with a taste for conforming to the behavior of others. In this way, individual decisions are conditional on the behavior of others. Emerging equilibria will then explain the occurrence of prosocial or cooperative behavior within a given society. In a second step, I analyze whether the model’s predictions are consistent with the empirical evidence on the link between beliefs and prosocial behavior using data on blood donations. The third essay outline a (possible) micro-structure and conditions which lead to the observed urban-rural differences in cooperative behavior using agent-based modeling. The model presented here adapts the familiar framework of a prisoners dilemma which is played repeatedly with randomly matched members of a large population. I introduce features that are often found in real world interactions: imperfect information, voluntary participation and a taste for conforming to majority behavior. In this analysis, peoples beliefs about the level of cooperation in the population and their resulting behavior are determined endogenously. Both are governed principally by the experience that they derive from interactions. I present results of an agentbased simulation in order to study the emerging dynamic relationships, to examine how cooperative behavior evolves over time under different circumstances, and to determine how urban-rural differences in behavior emerge. The factors that give rise to rural-urban differences are heterogeneity in individual loss aversion or risk taking, and limited migration possibilities between rural and urban areas...|$|E

One of the official administrative duties of Mets 4 hallitus is to provide hunting and fishing opportunities for citizens. In 2013, more than 81, 000 hunting licenses and 71, 000 fishing licenses were granted. As indicated in the study, during one season, Mets 4 hallitus hunting and fishing customers spent over EUR 33 million in the <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> licenses <b>destinations.</b> This paper indicates that hunters and fishers in Finland travel extensively and support the regional economy via their expenditures. In the summer and autumn of 2013, Mets 4 hallitus carried out a survey that provided rich and up-to-date information {{that could be used}} for quantitative and qualitative research. For modelling purposes the private expenditures of hunters and fishers were grouped into trade, accommodation, restaurants, local public transport, and entertainment. However, the study also analysed these expenditures in more detail, presenting the personal expenditures per trip, per day of a trip, and per license. Moreover, the location of the expenditures was disaggregated into the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> license <b>destination,</b> the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> residence, and "on the way" between those two. For example, an average grouse hunter with a short-time (1 ? 7 days) license in 2013 spent around EUR 150 per hunting trip within his or her <b>region</b> <b>of</b> residence, and more than EUR 440 per trip if the hunting area was located outside the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> residence. RegFin, a comparative-static regional Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model was used in this study to calculate the wider economic impacts at a regional level, as well as to serve as an engine for an Excel-based assessment tool. The assessment of the regional economic impacts focused on basic economic indicators such as regional gross domestic product (GDP), household consumption, and employment. The results of the study indicate that hunting and fishing activities have a positive impact on regional economies. Just considering license destination regions in 2013, hunting and fishing on state-owned land increased regional GDP by EUR 6. 4 million, created 86. 2 person working years, and produced household consumption of EUR 36. 6 million. Among the many conclusions, it was found that investments in regional services linked to hunting and fishing activities would increase the regional economic impacts of Mets 4 hallitus customers...|$|R
