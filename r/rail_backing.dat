The train crashed through shops {{at the front of the}} station, and out into Main Street, Largs. Being very early in the morning, there were no serious injuries. The cab of vehicle 77244 (from set 318254) needed to be completely rebuilt. 318262 managed to move by <b>rail</b> <b>back</b> to Shields depot. The reconstruction of the Largs railway station building took almost ten years to complete.|$|R

He earned his passage back to England by working as a cattle wrangler on a cattle boat and arrived home penniless in 1899. He obtained his master's certificate and joined Greenshields, Cowie & Co, for whom he made another trip on a cattle boat, this time as third mate of the Knight Companion.

During Indonesia-Japan Friendship Festival in November 2008, Japan has showcased their Shinkansen technology to impress Indonesian audiences. In 2009, a Japanese government-sponsored feasibility study was conducted for the planning of project - a high speed (300 km/hr) rail line extending 730 kilometers across the island of Java from Jakarta to Surabaya. The idea of high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>backed</b> by funding (soft loans) has been proposed by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the Indonesian island of Java, linking up the densely populated corridor from the capital Jakarta to Surabaya (730 km). The island, similar in many respects to pre-HSR Honshu, suffers greatly from both freight and passenger congestion.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, as {{the ship}} was sinking quickly, the two men decided to jump and attempt to swim to safety. Milton went first, jumping while facing the ship; {{it was the last}} time Jack ever saw him. Jack {{launched}} himself from the <b>rail,</b> <b>back</b> facing the ship and pushing outward. Once in the water, Jack reached the improperly launched and overturned Collapsible B. Too exhausted to save himself, he was pulled from the water. He and a number of other men, including Harold Bride, Archibald Gracie IV, chief baker Charles Joughin, and second officer Charles Lightoller, were able to balance on the boat for some hours. Jack later recalled that the cries of hundreds of people in the water reminded him of the high-pitched hum of locusts in his native Pennsylvania.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1870s, stagecoach and rail service was {{expanding}} rapidly in Washington County.

The same year, the first church, Gaston Congregational Church, was also built. In the 1880s, Joseph Gaston was responsible for draining Wapato Lake, which lay in the valley around the rail stop, creating the farmland that exists today. [...] "Wapato" [...] is a word from the local Indians that refers to a water-based starchy root vegetable related to arrowroot sometimes called a [...] "water potato" [...] in local English.

The men were sent to Louisville, Kentucky, and then by <b>rail</b> <b>back</b> to New York City for four weeks' leave of absence. [...] With the war not yet over, the government encouraged re-enlisting, and many of the 68th did so. The three-year men of the 8th and 29th Infantry, two other German-American units reduced by casualties and expiring enlistment terms, were consolidated into the 68th. Drafted men and substitutes brought the ranks up to 400 present for duty.|$|R
