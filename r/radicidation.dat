2500|$|Irradiation {{treatments}} are typically classified by dose (high, medium, and low), but are sometimes classified by {{the effects of}} the treatment (radappertization, <b>radicidation</b> and radurization). Food irradiation is sometimes referred to as [...] "cold pasteurization" [...] or [...] "electronic pasteurization" [...] because ionizing the food does not heat the food to high temperatures during the process, and the effect is similar to heat pasteurization. The term [...] "cold pasteurization" [...] is controversial because the term may be used to disguise the fact the food has been irradiated and pasteurization and irradiation are fundamentally different processes.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>Radicidation</b> {{is derived}} from {{radiation}} and 'caedere' (Latin for fell, cut, kill).|$|E
50|$|<b>Radicidation</b> is a {{specific}} case of food irradiation where the dose of ionizing radiation applied to the food is sufficient {{to reduce the number}} of viable specific non-spore-forming pathogenic bacteria to such a level that none are detectable when the treated food is examined by any recognized method. The required dose is in the range of 2 - 8 kGy. The term may also be applied to the destruction of parasites such as tapeworm and trichina in meat, in which case the required dose is in the range of 0.1 - 1 kGy. When the process is used specifically for destroying enteropathogenic and enterotoxinogenic organisms belonging to the genus Salmonella, it is referred to as Salmonella <b>radicidation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Up to {{the point}} where the food is {{processed}} by irradiation, the food is processed in the same way as all other food. To treat the food, they are exposed to a radioactive source, for a set period of time to achieve a desired dose. Radiation may be emitted by a radioactive substance, or by X-ray and electron beam accelerators. Special precautions are taken to ensure the food stuffs never come in contact with the radioactive substances and that the personnel and the environment are protected from exposure radiation.Irradiation treatments are typically classified by dose (high, medium, and low), but are sometimes classified by the effects of the treatment (radappertization, <b>radicidation</b> and radurization).

40|$|Arabic bread {{prepared}} {{from local}} Saudi flour contained {{a total of}} up to 10 (4) organisms per g. Most of these were bacterial spores that survived the baking process (1. 3 X 10 (2) to 3. 5 X 10 (3] and {{a small number of}} yeasts and molds (10 to 40 cells per g). The organisms in Arabic bread appear to be harmless to healthy individuals. However, for immune system-compromised cancer patients and bone marrow transplant recipients, it is prudent to irradiate the bread to reduce microbial contamination. The decimal reduction doses (10 % survival) for the most radiation-resistant organisms (spore formers) in bread were 0. 11 to 0. 15 Mrad. Accordingly, 0. 6 Mrad was sufficient {{to reduce the number of}} spores in Arabic bread by a factor of 10, 000, i. e., to less than 1 /g. This treatment constitutes radiation pasteurization (<b>radicidation),</b> and to this extent, provides a margin of microbiological safety. Sensory evaluation by the nine-point hedonic scale showed no detectable loss of organoleptic quality of bread up to 0. 6 Mrad, while irradiation to 2. 5 Mrad induced unacceptable organoleptic changes...|$|E
