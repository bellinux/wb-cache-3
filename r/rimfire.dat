5|$|On 15 March 1939, Germany {{invaded the}} {{remainder}} of Czechoslovakia. On the very first day, Chief Commander of German forces ordered surrender of all firearms present within the occupied territory. This pertained not only to civilian owned firearms, but also to those held by the police force. In August 1939, this order was replaced by Regulation of Reich Protector No. 20/39. The regulation again ordered surrender of all firearms and introduced personal responsibility of land plot owners for all firearms that would be find within their property. Reich and Protectorate officials (including police) and SS Members were exempt from the gun ban. Licensed hunters could own up to 5 hunting guns and up to 50 pieces of ammunition. Long <b>rimfire</b> rifles, sport pistols up to 6 mm calibre, air rifles and museum guns were allowed, however {{they needed to be}} registered. Simple failure to surrender a firearm carried up to 5 years imprisonment, while hiding of cache of firearms carried death penalty. Offenders were tried in front of German courts.|$|E
25|$|The Contender frame has two firing pins, and a {{selector}} on {{the exposed}} hammer, {{to allow the}} shooter to choose between <b>rimfire</b> or centerfire firing pins, or to select a safety position from which neither firing pin can strike a primer. The initial baseline design of the Contender had no central safe position on the hammer, having only centerfire and <b>rimfire</b> firing pin positions, each being selectable through using a screwdriver.|$|E
25|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the original}} Contender design were later developed, distinguished easily by the hammer design. The first variant has a push button selector on the hammer for choosing <b>rimfire</b> vs. centerfire, the second variant has a left-center-right toggle switch for selecting center fire-safe-rimfire firing pins, and the third variant has a horizontal bolt selection for choosing center fire-safe-rimfire firing pin positions. All three of these Contender variants have a cougar etched {{on the sides of}} the receiver, thereby easily distinguishing them from the later G2 Contender which has a smooth-sided receiver without an etched cougar. Some of the very earliest Contenders, those requiring a screwdriver to switch the firing pin between <b>rimfire</b> and centerfire, had smooth sides, without the cougar etched on the sides.|$|E

25|$|In 1861, Joslyn {{designed}} {{a modified version}} using a metal <b>rimfire</b> cartridge. The Federal Ordnance Department ordered 860 of these carbines, which were delivered in 1862. Most went to units from Ohio. In 1862, Joslyn received an order for 20,000 carbines. Delivery on these weapons started in 1863, {{but by the time}} the Civil War came to an end only about half of these had been delivered.|$|E
25|$|In 1903 and 1905, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company {{introduced}} the first semi-automatic <b>rimfire</b> and centerfire rifles designed {{especially for the}} civilian market. The Winchester Model 1903 and Winchester Model 1905 operated {{on the principle of}} blowback in order to function semi-automatically. Designed entirely by T.C. Johnson, the Model 1903 achieved commercial success and continued to be manufactured until 1932 when the Winchester Model 63 replaced it.|$|E
25|$|The weapon as {{approved}} for use was chambered for the 4 linjer <b>rimfire</b> ammunition already {{in use in}} the Remington M1867 rifles by Norwegian and Swedish armed forces, and apparently equipped with identical barrels to the Remington.

50|$|To allow {{shooting}} at ranges {{which may not}} have space for a full target layout, NRA rules allow the use of reduced scale pigs, turkeys and rams placed at the same distance as chickens. The scale will be reduced proportional to the change in distance, so the targets will cover the same angular distance as they would if set up at full range. Reduced scale matches fired at paper targets are also popular for informal competitions, especially for Internet based matches where the shooters may reside in different countries. These are generally fired with <b>rimfires</b> or airguns.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the barrel {{is to provide a}} {{consistent}} seal, allowing the bullet to accelerate to a consistent velocity. It must also impart the right spin, and release the bullet consistently, perfectly concentric to the bore. The residual pressure in the bore must be released symmetrically, so that no side of the bullet receives any more or less push than the rest. The muzzle of the barrel is the most critical part, since that is the part that controls the release of the bullet. Some <b>rimfires</b> and airguns actually have a slight constriction, called a choke, in the barrel at the muzzle. This guarantees that the bullet is held securely just before release.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{the later}} G2 Contender, the {{original}} Contender may be safely dry-fired (provided the hammer is not drawn {{back from the}} second notch) to allow a shooter {{to become familiar with}} the trigger pull. The break-action only has to be cycled, while leaving the hammer in the second notch position, to practice dry-firing. G2's with switchable firing pins (centerfire or <b>rimfire)</b> can be safely dry-fired with the hammer only in the safety (center) position.|$|E
25|$|Handguns are {{becoming}} increasingly popular for hunting. Intended to be fired {{with one or two}} hands, but lacking a shoulder support, handguns are more challenging to shoot accurately than a long gun (a rifle or shotgun). Hunting handguns differ from defensive handguns in a number of ways; hunting handguns usually have longer barrels, better sights (often mounting telescopic sights or red dot sights), and, depending on the game, will fire a much more powerful cartridge. <b>Rimfire</b> hunting handguns can be of any action type, but centerfire hunting handguns are dominated by the single shot and revolver actions, such as the Thompson Center Arms Contender.|$|E
25|$|Physicians for Human Rights {{describe}} one tactic {{employed by}} Barre's troops {{used in their}} campaign against the Isaaq people of the north:One of the cruelest – and clearly unlawful – tactics used by Siad Barre's troops was the deliberate mining of civilian homes. In 1988, government forces shelled and bombed the capital of Hargeisa. Before fleeing, many residents buried their valuables in holes dug in the floors or courtyards of their homes. Upon discovering these stashes, soldiers removed the jewellery and other valuables and placed booby-traps or mines in these hiding places. After the fighting ceased, {{many of those who}} had fled returned to their homes in the first months of 1991 only to be injured or killed by these hidden explosives... Some families were said to be squatting outside their houses because they were afraid to enter.... Siad Barre's forces deliberately mined wells and grazing lands in an effort to kill and terrorize nomadic herders whom the army viewed as protectors of the SNM. While direct evidence is not available, most observers agree that Siad Barre's forces undertook this extensive mining to prevent resettlement by the predominantly Isaak nomads and agriculturists. The British mine-clearing company <b>Rimfire,</b> contracted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to conduct de-mining activities has identified land-mines from 24 different countries in Somalia. The majority were from the Czech Republic, Russia, Pakistan and Belgium.|$|E
5000|$|During 1964-1966, the Czech {{government}} {{transferred the}} production of long guns from Zbrojovka Brno to Ceská Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod (ČZUB). Throughout the Cold War ČZUB manufactured {{a wide variety of}} military small arms including the Sa vz. 58 assault rifle, the Škorpion vz. 61 submachine gun, various [...]22 caliber training and target rifles and the very successful CZ 75 family of pistols. [...] While many firearm designs originated in Brno, Zbrojovka Brno was not the manufacturer. Because of this, the long guns manufactured in the mid-1960s, including the ZKK 600 and ZKK 602 series and the ZKM <b>rimfires,</b> were actually manufactured by CZ Uhersky Brod (ČZUB). Because of the Czech government's decision to merge manufacture within both companies, the Brno trademark was also used by Ceská Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod. [...] By the early 1980s, firearms production at Zbrojovka Brno accounted for less than 3% of its total capacity, as production was shifted to the manufacture of typewriters, diesel motors, and automatic machine tools.|$|R
40|$|In 1996, Australia’s {{gun laws}} and {{regulations}} {{came to the fore}} after a mass-shooting incident in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in which 35 people were killed and 37 injured by Martin Bryant with two military-style self-loading rifles. Bryant was a mentally challenged man with a low IQ and had exhibited disturbing behaviour for many years prior. He was ineligible for a firearm licence and had acquired the firearms illegally when he murdered two people with a knife and stole their firearms. Within a short period of time, newly-elected Prime Minister John Howard pressured the state governments, who control gun laws in Australia, to administer radical, reactionary and sweeping gun laws {{in the form of the}} National Firearm Agreement 1996, the crux of which was the compulsory buyback of self-loading longarms. The Federal Government put a 1 % increase on the Medicare levy for one year to finance the purchase and destruction of all self-loading rifles including. 22 <b>rimfires,</b> self-loading shotguns and pump-action shotguns. The buyback was implemented at a reported cost of half a billion dollars. Firearm retailers and wholesalers were compensated for their compulsory loss of stock and some businesses were paid to shut their doors. Mandator...|$|R
5000|$|The base is {{attached}} to the rifle, usually with screws, and is often designed to have a low profile, and to allow use of the iron sights if the scope is not present. Some manufacturers provide integral bases on many of their firearms; an example of such a firearm is the Ruger Super Redhawk revolver. The most commonly encountered mounting systems are the 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) and the 11 mm dovetail rails (sometimes called tip-off mounts), commonly found on <b>rimfires</b> and air guns, the Weaver type base and the STANAG 2324 (MIL-STD-1913 [...] "Picatinny rail") base. Ruger uses a proprietary scope base system, though adapters are available to convert the Ruger bases into Weaver type bases. Scope base and mounting systems are also manufactured in Europe. Specialized manufacturers like Ernst Apel GmbH offer an elaborate program of mounting solutions for many different guns. Some of the European mounting solutions are virtually unknown and hence rarely applied in America. Many European gun manufacturers also developed and offer proprietary scope base systems for their guns, for example Sako has tapered dovetails and Tikka uses 16 mm dovetail.|$|R
