500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, <b>relaxed</b> <b>position,</b> the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and claws). These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.|$|E

For non-orthorhombic systems, the determination of cell parameters might be more complicated, but many ab-initio numerical packages have utilities to make this calculation simpler.|$|R
50|$|In {{cartilaginous}} fish, the zonular fibres {{are replaced}} by a membrane, including a small muscle at {{the underside of the}} lens. This muscle pulls the lens forward from its <b>relaxed</b> <b>position</b> when focusing on nearby objects. In teleosts, by contrast, a muscle projects from a vascular structure in the floor of the eye, called the falciform process, and serves to pull the lens backwards from the <b>relaxed</b> <b>position</b> to focus on distant objects. While amphibians move the lens forward, as do cartilaginous fish, the muscles involved are not homologous with those of either type of fish. In frogs, there are two muscles, one above and one below the lens, while other amphibians have only the lower muscle.|$|E

50|$|When myosin {{phosphatase}} binds to myosin, it {{removes the}} phosphate group.

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics and a rigid ion potential, we studied the vibrational and structural {{properties of the}} NiO(001) surface with and without cationic adatoms. We found that the bulk phonon density of states (DOS) is altered {{by the presence of}} the surface and that the adatom introduces new frequency modes. From the <b>relaxed</b> <b>positions</b> of the surface ions, it came out that up to 0. 7 TT(m), the surface is contacted exhibiting rippling with outwards expansion of the cations and inwards contraction of the anions. The effect is detectable in five layers below the surface, while it persists at high temperatures. Strong contraction is found for the cationic adatom, relaxing on top of a surface anion that is lifted by more than 30 % from its equilibrium position at high temperatures.

30|$|The {{structural}} {{properties of}} boron and nitrogen atoms added on benzene (Bz) molecule are studied using density functional theory within Gaussian 03 program package. The adsorption energy, HOMO–LUMO energy gap (ΔH–L) {{and also the}} optimized bond lengths (C–C and C–H bond lengths) of the structures are evaluated. In this work, three adsorption sites for both boron and nitrogen were selected, hollow site (H), middle site (M) and top site (T), as their initial positions. It is found that for boron adsorption on Bz molecule, the relaxed middle site configuration has the most stable geometry, while in NBz, we obtained similar positions after optimization process. We have also illustrated that the <b>relaxed</b> NBz <b>positions</b> are in higher stability than the <b>relaxed</b> BBz <b>positions.</b> As a consequence, {{it is found that}} the stability of an isolated benzene molecule increases by adding boron or nitrogen on top of it.|$|R

50|$|In this technique, the {{practitioner}} identifies {{a point of}} musculoskeletal pain, called a tender point. Tender points are small, discrete, edematous areas on the body that elicit pain when palpated. Monitoring the tender point, {{the practitioner}} positions the patient such that the tenderness at the counterstrain point is minimized when pressed. The practitioner holds the patient in a maximally <b>relaxed</b> <b>position</b> for 90 seconds and then slowly returns the passive patient to a neutral body position. Success of treatment is evaluated by reassessing both the tender point and any accompanying change in range of motion.|$|E

40|$|The {{electronic}} and geometrical structures {{in particular the}} electric field gradients (EFGs), of [CdD]"- (D=P, As, Sb) acceptor-donor pairs in Si and Ge are studied using the full potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green's function method. Since the EFG depends very sensitively on lattice relaxations, the method is extended to treat large displacements with higher accuracy and less computing time. The efficiency is demonstrated for impurities in semiconductors and metals. The hyperfine fields of 5 sp- und 6 sp-defects in Fe are also calculated. In the case of [InD]" 0 the calculated geometrical structures are compared with pseudo-potential results and are in quite good agreement.

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} (AVs) are {{the focus}} for many research projects right now and are {{widely regarded as the}} most important next step for the automotive industry. AVs are anticipated to result in safer roads and with fully automated vehicles the driver {{does not need to be}} involved in the driving. This new situation opens up the possibility for new spatial orientations within the vehicle, which might be a challenge for today’s passive safety systems. This master thesis is done in collaboration with Autoliv and aims to deﬁne new potential load cases in fully automated cars and to evaluate how today’s passive safety systems handle these new load cases. A literature review were complemented with a qualitative study to understand what activities occupants expect they will be engaged in when no one needs to focus on the driving, and how they will be seated. The qualitative study was performed at a local exhibition called V˚arg˚ardam¨assan with a method called ”Setting the Stage”, developed speciﬁcally to explore user expectations. To evaluate the passive safety system, twelve sled tests with the THOR dummy were run in three of the newly deﬁned load cases. A position representing the extended living room, with the front seats rearward-facing, and a <b>relaxing</b> <b>position,</b> with the seatback reclined, were the most popular new seating positions both in the literature and in the qualitative study. These positions together with a conversation position, with the fronts seats rotated 30 °inboard, were run in sled tests. The test matrix included rear-end impact, frontal impact and three diﬀerent speeds (24 kph Euro NCAP rear-end pulse, 40 kph and 56 kph FMVSS 208 full frontal barrier pulse). The restraint parameters diﬀered for each test and consisted of a driver airbag, an extra belt, an simulated knee airbag, a PRC (Pelvis Restraint Cushion), load limiting, pretensioning and modiﬁcations of belt geometry and seat adjustments. The rearward-facing living room position generally performed well in frontal impact (rear-end impact for the dummy), with low injury risk values for HIC, BrIC and femur. The challenge for this position is to absorb the energy in the seat construction. The <b>relaxing</b> <b>position</b> was more challenging and got more focus in frontal impact; a beneﬁcial kinematic for keeping the dummy in position, without high spinal loads, was an immediate forward motion or rotation of the upper body. The extra belt was the most important restraint system for the conversation position in frontal impact, but new solutions might be found that could handle this position. Only a few tests were performed for this load case, but much can be learned from small overlap/NHTSA oblique testing that resemble the test carried out in the conversation position. The method ”Setting the Stage”, used in the qualitative study, resulted in detailed and realistic reﬂections from potential occupants and ﬁve new load cases were deﬁned in total in the ﬁrst part of the thesis. Some load cases were evaluated using sled tests, which limited the test matrix due to simpliﬁcations in the setup and limitations of the ATD; still, useful information was gained. Beneﬁcial kinematics were identiﬁed and future potential challenges addressed for the two most popular load cases: the <b>relaxing</b> <b>position</b> and the living room position. This thesis was a ﬁrst exploratory attempt to understand potential challenges within passive safety in autonomous vehicles, but more research and testing is needed to complete the results...|$|R
