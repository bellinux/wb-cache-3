He stated that further U.S. proposals {{to resolve the issue}} made in early 1982 were also ignored by the Sandinistas. The Sandinista government in 1983 began advancing proposals in which it would undertake not to support the rebels, but Schwebel noted that these were coupled with demands that the U.S. cease supporting the lawful government of El Salvador. The judge noted that since early 1985 the U.S. had increasingly made regime change a primary objective but argued this was not inconsistent with self-defense because it was reasonable to believe that Nicaragua would not maintain any commitments unless Sandinista power was diluted.|$|E

These included the unraveling of the union with Syria in 1961, which dissolved his United Arab Republic (UAR), damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the Arab world.

500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of <b>regime</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros is astonishing. There is no talk of revolution; the {{people are in the}} favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see everywhere. You can give as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want." [...] In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen's launch of the story's English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.|$|E
500|$|The {{rationale}} behind {{the meeting of}} the four kings is uncertain. One possibility is that it was related to Máel Coluim's annexation of Lothian, a region that likely encompassed an area roughly similar to the modern boundaries of Berwickshire, East Lothian, and possibly parts of Mid Lothian. The considerable span of years between this conquest and Knútr's meeting, however, could suggest that there were other factors. There appears to be evidence that the violent <b>regime</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> Moray (which enabled Mac Bethad to assume the mormaership) prompted Knútr to meet with the kings. Echmarcach and Máel Coluim may thus have been bound to keep the peace with Mac Bethad's troubled lordship. Certainly, the accounts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record that Knútr met the kings in [...] "Scotland", a region that likely refers to land north of Firth of Forth. Another possibility is that Máel Coluim aimed to gain Knútr's neutrality in a Scottish campaign against Mac Bethad, and sought naval support from Echmarcach himself. The absence of the King of Strathclyde from the assembled kings, and the possibility that Echmarcach's powerbase was situated somewhere in the Isles beyond Kintyre, could indicate that Knútr's main focus was on the troubled region of Moray, and the rulers whose lands it bordered. Another possibility is that the nonappearance of a Strathclyde representative is evidence that this Cumbrian realm had been recently annexed by the Scots which in turn drew a response from Knútr.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{indicator}} for detecting business cycle turning points involving mixed frequency business survey unbalanced data. It {{is based on}} a hidden Markov-switching model and allows for the detection of <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> a given economy where information is displayed monthly and/or quarterly. Starting from Gregoir and Lenglart (2000) we propose an adaptable framework which can be applied to many situations involving monthly, bimonthly and quarterly data. The proposed methodology is applied to the French economy. Using balances from business survey, this indicator measures the probability of being in an accelerating or a decelerating phase referring to the output growth rate cycle. The index is confronted over the past with a reference dating based on the growth cycle of the French GDP estimated through a Christiano-Fitzgerald filter. By extracting information from business survey, our index exhibits quite clearly and timely <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> France. Moreover, the signal delivered by the indicator is mainly unrevised and available many quarters before the ex-post dating. Considering this adequacy with the reference dating over the past, the turning point index therefore provides an accurate signal on the current outlook.

30|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the evidence of non-linearity of the series, Hamilton (1989) proposes a non-linear model with <b>regime</b> <b>changes.</b> <b>In</b> that model there are two regimes, one of positive output growth and one of negative growth. According to the author, the output in differences depends not only on its lags, {{but there is also}} a discrete <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the mean that generates a transition between positive and negative growth <b>regimes.</b> The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the mean is caused by an unobserved exogenous variable that follows a first-order Markov process. One of the advantages of the model is the estimation of <b>regime</b> <b>changes</b> from data <b>in</b> the series. Additionally, it is possible to estimate the probabilities of being in a given regime, for example, a recession. Hamilton (1989) employs an AR (4) specification in order to model the quarterly growth rate of US GNP from 1950 to 1985. He finds a recurrence <b>in</b> the <b>regime</b> <b>changes.</b> The transition from expansion to recession is associated with a drop of 3  % of real output and a similar drop in the permanent component; that is, permanent shocks dominate output fluctuations. Later, Krolzig (1997) carries out a characterization of the different variables of the Markov-switching model, with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the mean, variance and/or intercept. Additionally, he generalizes Hamilton’s proposal to a multivariate analysis. Whereas, Goodwin (1993) applies the Hamilton model to 8 countries of OECD without finding significant gains in comparison to other linear models, although the symmetry hypothesis is rejected for the majority of the countries.|$|R
