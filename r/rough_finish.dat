2500|$|In autumn he ran at Newmarket, {{winning the}} Buckenham Stakes and a Triennial Stakes and then walking {{over in the}} October Produce Stakes when no other horses opposed him, [...] before contesting one of the year’s most prestigious two-year-old races, the Middle Park Plate. His {{previous}} successes meant {{that he had to}} carry a seven pound weight penalty, as did the season's leading filly Sunshine. In a <b>rough</b> <b>finish,</b> Sunshine was beaten a head by another filly, Frivloity, with Knigcraft a further head behind in third. [...] On his final start in the Criterion Stakes he was beaten by yet another filly named Hester, who {{went on to win the}} following year's 1000 Guineas. Although the defeat was disappointing, it was pointed out that Kingcraft was not an [...] "every day" [...] horse and may not have recovered from his run in the Middle Park. Kingcraft's performances as a two year old earned his owner £3,765.|$|E

5000|$|Connaught {{appeared}} {{to be short of}} full fitness when reappearing in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse in August but was nevertheless made the 1/3 favourite. After being held up by Barclay in the early stages he was beaten a neck by Riboccare in a <b>rough</b> <b>finish,</b> but was awarded the race after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards. In September, Connaught started 10/11 favourite for the 192nd running of the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster. Racing on heavy ground, he failed to reproduce his best form and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Ribero. After the race, Barclay commented that [...] "the ground did not suit him at all".|$|E
5000|$|The Sauer 38H was {{produced}} in three basic models. Generally, the slide of the first model says [...] "JP Sauer und Sohn" [...] on the left. The second version says only [...] "CAL 7.65", and the third version omits the safety and the cocking/decocking lever. Towards {{the end of the}} war, weapons produced were simplified for quicker, cheaper production. For the 38H, this meant simpler markings, <b>rough</b> <b>finish,</b> and the elimination of features like the slide-mounted safety. Much more rarely, some late production examples retained the safety but omitted the cocking/decocking lever. So-called [...] "late-war" [...] models were still fully functional though. Final examples, produced until April 1945 when the factory was overrun by the Allies, feature mismatched serial numbers and poor fit and finish.|$|E

A timber kindergarten room, clad in the same material, with a steep pitch gable roof is attached to the north. The building has narrow lancet hopper windows, with leadlight panels to the nave and transept, concrete stumps to the perimeter and a timber and asbestos cement tile hood to the north nave round window.|$|E
5000|$|In 1919, the Kevorkian Gallery in New York City {{published}} an exhibition catalog of Mowbray-Clarke's work, which includes reproductions of his sculpture and medals. The catalog lists {{a total of}} seventy-three works, and reveals a radical evolution in Mowbray-Clarke's style during the nineteen-teens. Early works were executed in a small scale and had a <b>rough</b> <b>finish,</b> {{in a manner that}} [...] "emphasized the artist's hand." [...] By contrast, later sculptures such as Broadway, ca. 1919-which the artist intended to be 40 feet high and ideally stand in Times Square-were executed on a monumental scale, and featured a smooth and refined finish. According to the critical essays in the catalog, Mowbray-Clarke is depicted as an idealistic individualist, whose work offers metaphoric social and political commentary; topics of his sculptures included satirical critiques of capitalism, militarism, and other aspects of Western society.|$|E
5000|$|In agriculture, a harrow (often {{called a}} set of harrows in a plurale tantum sense) is an {{implement}} for breaking up and smoothing out {{the surface of the}} soil. In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the <b>rough</b> <b>finish</b> left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing. Harrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, such as to prepare a seedbed, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that skirt crop rows (to kill weeds).|$|E

5000|$|In the Derby at Epsom, Premonition started 5/1 joint-favourite with Pinza in a {{field of}} twenty-seven runners. He was never in {{contention}} at any stage and finished unplaced behind Pinza and the Queen's colt Aureole. At the end of June, Premonition was sent to contest the Irish Derby at the Curragh. He won by a head from the Irish-trained favourite Chamier, ridden by Bill Rickaby, in a <b>rough</b> <b>finish.</b> Following a consultation with Chamier's trainer Vincent O'Brien, Rickaby lodged an objection to the winner on the grounds of [...] "boring" [...] in the closing stages. The stewards sustained the objection and disqualified Premonition. Boyd-Rochfort felt that he had been unfairly treated and did not run a horse in an Irish Classic for twelve years. He also purchased a newsreel film of the race and had it shown for a week at cinemas in Newmarket.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final design}} of the bridge was of three reinforced-concrete arches {{supported}} on concrete piers with Art Deco embellishments. The bridge incorporates three permanent hinges enabling the structure to adjust to changes in temperature, the first reinforced concrete bridge structure in the UK to use such an innovation. The arch springings, {{as well as the}} arch crowns, have decorative bronze cover plates. Ribbed shuttering was used in the casting of the concrete piers and abutments, giving the main faces a ribbed finish that was then knocked back. The approach viaduct and retaining walls were constructed in precast blocks that were wire brushed to create a <b>rough</b> <b>finish.</b> The balustrades and lamps were constructed of open bronzework. The Bromsgrove Guild was employed in casting and fitting the bronze lamp standards and parapets as well as the railings on the four staircases between road level and the river bank ...|$|E
