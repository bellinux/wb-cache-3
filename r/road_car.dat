5|$|In 20 {{months of}} {{existence}} London Country North East had lost £5.5 million, on a turnover of £14 million. Two operating subsidiaries {{were created to}} help improve the situation, {{under the control of}} a single holding company, initially called the London Country Travel Group and later renamed to South of England Travel Group. Its chief executive, Bob Howells, had previously been West Yorkshire <b>Road</b> <b>Car</b> Company's traffic manager. A third company, Cambridge based Premier Travel Services, was added to the group in 1989 but was sold to Cambus in 1991. Both subsidiaries continued to be owned by AJS until 1991, when they were sold to new owners.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before the 2011 Indian Grand Prix, Force India {{announced}} that the Sahara Group had purchased a 42.5% stake in the team, valued at US$100million. The investment gave the Sahara Group and team principal Vijay Mallya an equal stake in the team, with team director Michiel Mol controlling the remaining 15% of the team. Under the terms of the sale, the Sahara Group became Force India's naming-rights sponsor. Mercedes GP also changed the name of their team, announcing that they were to become known as Mercedes AMG. The new name originates from AMG, Mercedes-Benz's performance and luxury <b>road</b> <b>car</b> brand.|$|E
5|$|Most bus {{services}} {{are provided by}} First West of England or Crosville Motor Services. All services call at stops in the Regent Street and Big Lamp Corner area, including some stops in the adjacent High Street. Some town services and those to Sand Bay, Wells, Burnham-on-Sea and Bristol Airport start from or run via the main railway station. The service to Sand Bay is sometimes operated by an open top bus. National Express and Bakers Dolphin operate long distance coach services, mostly from the coach terminal in Locking <b>Road</b> <b>Car</b> Park which {{is close to the}} railway station.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} BMW M3, the Cosworth Sierras {{were the first}} Group A touring cars that were not <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> that had been put into use as race cars. Both Ford and BMW {{designed}} their cars as race cars, which under Group A rules needed {{to be put into}} production as <b>road</b> <b>cars.</b> All other leading Group A contenders up to 1987 (Jaguar XJS, Holden Commodore, BMW 635 CSi, Mitsubishi Starion, Rover Vitesse, Ford Mustang, Nissan Skyline DR30 RS and Skyline HR31 GTS-R and the Volvo 240T) were <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> first that later found a home in touring car racing.|$|R
50|$|All the <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> {{were capable}} of {{reaching}} 75 mi/h km/h.|$|R
50|$|Between 2000 and 2004 TVR built a {{total of}} seven race cars and six or seven <b>road</b> <b>cars.</b> Of the latter, the 2001 {{prototype}} (since scrapped) had the TuscanR body but from 2002 the other cars were of T400R design. The <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> had no standard interior as these were specified by the customers.|$|R
5|$|On 22 April 1988, London Country North East {{was sold}} by the National Bus Company, the last of 72 {{subsidiaries}} to be privatised. The buyer was Alan Stephenson's AJS Group, which had been formed by the management buyout of West Yorkshire <b>Road</b> <b>Car</b> Company. As part of the sale LCNE's property was bought by Parkdale Holdings and leased back to the company; some was sold for redevelopment, while the remainder was later sold back to LCNE. Parkdale Holdings later {{went out of business}} having changed their name to Pavilion Leisure.|$|E
5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his <b>road</b> <b>car</b> but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E
5|$|Villeneuve started {{competitive}} {{driving in}} local drag-racing events, entering his <b>road</b> <b>car,</b> a modified 1967 Ford Mustang. He was soon bored by this {{and entered the}} Jim Russell Racing School at Le Circuit Mont Tremblant to gain a racing licence. He then had a very successful season in Quebec regional Formula Ford, running his own two-year-old car and winning seven of the ten races he entered. The next year he progressed to Formula Atlantic, competing there for four years, running his own car again {{for one of those}} seasons. He won his first Atlantic race in 1975 at Gimli Motosport Park in heavy rain. In 1976, teamed with Chris Harrison's Ecurie Canada and factory March race engineer Ray Wardell, he dominated the season by winning {{all but one of the}} races and taking the US and Canadian titles. He won the Canadian championship again in 1977.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{doubled the}} Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit to 3litres for the 1966 season and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm Repco, {{which had never}} produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 engine blocks from the defunct American Oldsmobile F85 <b>road</b> <b>car</b> project, and other off-the-shelf parts. Consulting and design engineer Phil Irving (of Vincent Motorcycle fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive, but the light and reliable cars ran at the front {{from the start of}} the season. At the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, Bruce McLaren, has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (cf Surtees, Hill and Fittipaldi Automotive). In 1967, the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first. The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.|$|E
5|$|Renault had {{introduced}} turbocharged engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a BMW four-cylinder M12 turbocharged engine {{in the summer}} of 1981. For the 1982 season the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a <b>road</b> <b>car</b> engine block, the BMW M10. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D {{in the early part of}} the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the Canadian Grand Prix. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers Riccardo Patrese, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the Monaco Grand Prix, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the 1983 season, Piquet took the championship lead from Renault's Alain Prost at the last race of the year, the South African Grand Prix to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. Riccardo Patrese was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

50|$|The Type 13 was {{the first}} true Bugatti car. Production of the Type 13 and later Types 15, 17, 22, and 23, began with the company's {{founding}} in 1910 and lasted through 1920 with 435 examples produced. Most <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> used an eight-valve engine, though five Type 13 racers had 16-valve heads, {{some of the first}} ever produced. The <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> became known as pur-sang ("thoroughbred") in keeping with Ettore Bugatti's feelings for his designs.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} meet {{requirements}} {{laid out in the}} rules of certain racing series that the Viper GTS-Rs planned to run, <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> similar to the race cars would have to be sold to the public. Although the GTS-R was already similar to the GTS, a closer replica was needed to meet homologation requirements. Chrysler commissioned the construction of 100 <b>road</b> <b>cars</b> in 1998 that would use elements of the race car.|$|R
5000|$|The 993-generation GT2 was {{initially}} built {{in order to}} meet homologation requirements for motorsports.
