40|$|Background. There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} development of vessel substitutes, and many studies are currently focusing on the development of biodegradable scaffolds capable of fostering vascular regeneration. We tested a new biocompatible and biodegradable material with mechanical properties similar to those of blood vessels. Methods. The material used comprises a mixture of a,b-poly(N- 2 -hydroxyethyl) -D,L-aspartamide (PHEA) and polylactic acid (PLA), combined with polycaprolactone (PCL) by means of electrospinning technique. Low-molecular-weight heparin was also linked to the copolymer. A tubular PHEA-PLA/PCL sample was used to create an arteriovenous fistula in a pig model {{with the use of the}} external iliac vessels. The flow was assessed by means of Doppler ultrasound examination weekly, and 1 month after the implantation we removed the scaffold for histopathologic evaluation. Results. The implants showed a perfect leak-proof seal and adequate elastic tension to blood pressure. About w 3 weeks after the implantation, Doppler examination revealed thrombosis of the graft, so we proceeded to its removal. Histologic examination showed chronic inflammation, with the presence of foreign body cells and marked neovascularization. The material had been largely absorbed, leaving some isolated spot residues. Conclusions. The biocompatibility of PHEA-PLA/PCL and its physical properties make it suitable for the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessels.</b> In the future, the possibility of functionalizing the material with a variety of molecules, to modulate the inflammatory and coagulative responses, will allow obtaining devices suitable for the replacement of native vessels...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Although {{the need}} for a {{functional}} arterial replacement is clear, the lower blood flow velocities of small-diameter arteries like the coronary artery have led to the failure of synthetic materials that are successful for large-diameter grafts. Although autologous vessels remain the standard for small diameter grafts, many patients do not have a vessel suitable for use because of vascular disease, amputation, or previous harvest. As a result, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach to address the shortcomings of current therapies. Investigators have explored the use of arterial tissue cells or differentiated stem cells combined with various types of natural and synthetic scaffolds to make tubular constructs and subject them to chemical and/or mechanical stimulation in an attempt to develop a functional small-diameter arterial replacement graft with varying degrees of success. Here, we review the progress in all these major facets of the field. (Circ Res. 2006; 98 : 25 - 35.)

On the other hand, some major shipping lines relocate their transshipment hubs from existing major hub ports to newly developed ports due to advantages such as low cost and congestion free operations, as per the operational-oriented approach.|$|R

The errors that may arise in determining the mass of the cargo due to roughness when measuring draft, due to using the inclinometer to determine the draft from one of boards, due to instrumental errors in the determination of the density of seawater, due to other possible errors have been investigated and evaluated. To estimate the errors of draft due to heaving and errors of inclinometer some formula are to be applied, their derivation has been done in this paper. It has been recommended to use the traditional formula of high-speed drawdown with the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> speed on current rate to calculate the error of precipitation arising from the drawdowns ship on a current. The value per unit displacement draft from loading scale has been used to evaluate the error of the displacement appearing in the presence of draft errors. As a result two similar criteria (rigorous and statistical) of allowable discrepancies calculated by draft survey mass of cargo in the port of loading and port of discharge have been substantiated. These criteria require the calculation and accumulation in a table of all the errors and calculate the total error of displacement.

EC seeding was developed to build a monolayer on the luminal surface. Because ECs show little or no adhesion on synthetic prostheses, it is necessary to promote their retention. On ePTFE surfaces we successfully deposited polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PMFs) consisting of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), poly(sodium 4 -styrenesulfonate) (PSS), and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) to obtain PEI-(PSS-PAH) 3 films. EC adhesion and spreading on modified ePTFE were assessed by scanning electron and confocal microscopies. Cell viability was evaluated by Alamar Blue assay. After 7 days of culture, the ePTFE modified with PMF exhibited improvements of EC viability as compared to that of the controls (nonmodified ePTFE) or even ePTFE coated by a PAH monolayer (p < 0. 05). Moreover, the spreading of ECs was largely enhanced compared to that of the same controls, resulting in a healthy confluent cell monolayer formation. Positive staining for the von Willebrand factor confirmed the EC phenotype. Promoting EC attachment and function on ePTFE modified with PMFs could become in the future a promising treatment for synthetic small-diameter vascular grafts...|$|R

40|$|Effort {{management}} {{has been proposed}} as an alternative for quota management in mixed demersal fisheries. It requires a metric to estimate the fishing mortality imposed by a given quantity of nominal fishing effort. Here, we estimate the partial fishing mortality rate imposed by one unit of fishing effort (Fpue) during individual fishing trips and explore the usefulness of this indicator for managing North Sea beam trawlers > 300 hp targeting sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Fpue is positively related to vessel engine power, and increased annually by 2. 8 % (sole) and 1. 6 % (plaice).

Unfortunately, the initiative proved to be poorly managed and resulted in an increase in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) coral fishing. This forced the government to review and amend the precious coral fisheries management regulations, which had been in place for decades. The Taiwanese government introduced stringent monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) management methods, already used in deep water fisheries, as a precautionary approach. At the same time, an investigation and evaluation of existing resources was carried out. Together, these initiatives were introduced in order to encourage the domestic industry to adopt the concept of ecosystem-based fishery management. This paper reviews the development of precious coral fisheries management in Taiwan, discusses the causes of illegal coral fisheries and looks at the reasons for adjustments to the current management system.

40|$|The high {{long-term}} {{failure rate}} of synthetic vascular grafts in the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> small <b>vessels</b> {{is known to}} be associated with the lack of physiological signals to vascular cells causing adverse hemodynamic, inflammatory or coagulatory events. Current studies focus on developing engineered vascular devices with ability of directing cell activity in vitro and in vivo for tissue regeneration. It is also known that controlled molecule release from scaffolds can dramatically increase the scaffold ability of directing cell activities in vitro and in vivo for tissue regeneration. To address the mechanical and biological problems associated with graft materials, we demonstrated a degradable polyester-fibroin composite tubular scaffolds which shows well-integrated nanofibrous structure, endothelial-conducive surface and anisotropic mechanical property, suitable as engineered vascular constructs. Tissue regeneration needs not only functional biomolecules providing signaling cues to cells and guide tissue remodeling, but also an adequate modality of molecule delivery. In fact, healthy tissue formation requires specific signals at well-defined place and time. To develop scaffolds with multi-modal presentation of biomolecules, we patterned electrospun nanofibers over the thickness of the 3 -dimensional scaffolds by programming the deposition of interpenetrating networks of degradable polymers poly(å-caprolactone) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid in tailored proportion. Fluorescent model molecules, drug and growth factors were embedded in the polymeric fibers with different techniques and release profiles were obtained and discussed.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether the endothelial layer would make a favorable contribution at the time of implantation of the TEBV by investigating in vitro the hemocompatible properties of the endothelial cells covering its interior. MethodsThe secretion of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) and expression of thrombomodulin by the endothelium were assessed, and the adhesive molecules E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) were quantified as a function of maturation time. To evaluate the functional response of the endothelium on injury, the cellular response to physiological stimulatory factors (thrombin and lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) was analyzed. ResultsThe endothelial cells formed a confluent monolayer displaying favorable hemocompatible properties (78 % ± 10 % of cells expressing thrombomodulin with only 12 ± 3 mU/ 106 cells of vWF secreted over a 2 -hour period), which acquired their full expression after a culture period of 4 days. Moreover, pro-adhesive properties toward inflammatory cells were not observed. The cells were also able to respond to physiological-stimulating agents (thrombin and LPS) and demonstrated a statistically significant overexpression of the corresponding molecules under the conditions tested. ConclusionsThese results indicate that the endothelium of the tissue-engineered blood vessel produced by the self-assembly approach displays advantageous qualities with regard to the vessel's future implantation as a small-diameter vascular prosthesis...|$|R

50|$|In 2014, {{the navy}} {{reported}} the recurrence of hull cracking around the engine spaces, {{which has been}} attributed to a combination of design issues related to the aluminium hull, and the high tempo of operations. By 2015, several patrol boats were confined to port because of structural, mechanical, and corrosion issues. In response, the Department of Defence threatened to cancel DMS' maintenance contract based on the company's poor performance in maintaining the Armidales (but did not go ahead due to the political repercussions from potentially losing local jobs). Defence and Serco (the parent company of DMS) later agreed to end the contract in 2017, with the Australian government to tender for a new in-service support contract during 2016. The patrol boat fleet began a mid-life refit program in October 2015, in order to extend hull life until a <b>replacement</b> class <b>of</b> larger <b>vessels</b> enters service from 2022. Patrol boats are being refitted two at a time in Singapore, with the RAN chartering the Cape-class patrol boats Cape Byron and Cape Nelson from mid-2015 until the end of 2016 to supplement naval patrol boat availability. During work on the first two patrol boats, the estimated cost of work-per-vessel doubled to A$7 million.|$|R

A liver biopsy specimen showed an unusual lesion of the small intrahepatic arteries. Many <b>of</b> these <b>vessels</b> showed circumferential <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> their adventitial coat by a non-caseating granuloma whilst others showed localized granulomata focally interrupting the adventitial coat. The medial and intimal coats of the affected arteries were normal...|$|R
