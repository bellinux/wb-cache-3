5|$|Pigs {{and goats}} were {{released}} {{on the island}} as potential food in the early 1800s, the goats destroying shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs eating eggs and chicks and disturbing the land by nuzzling for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, robust white-eye, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E
25|$|Raoul {{is part of}} the Kermadec Islands {{subtropical}} moist forests ecoregion and {{is largely}} covered with closed-canopy forest, predominantly of the evergreen Kermadec pōhutukawa (Metrosideros kermadecensis) and the Kermadec nikau palm (Rhopalostylis baueri, formerly described as Rhopalostylis cheesemanii). It is just far enough south that the occasional fertile coconut from Polynesia that washes up on shore and takes root will not survive in the longterm {{due to a lack of}} warmth. The island has no native land mammals and was formerly home to vast colonies of seabirds who nested in the forests. The islands may once have had a species of megapode (based on early settler records) and a subspecies of kereru. Currently native landbirds on the island include the Kermadec <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae cyanurus), the Australasian harrier, pukeko, tui and several introduced species. The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds.|$|E
2500|$|Polynesian {{visitors}} {{introduced the}} Polynesian rat in the 14th century and Norway rats, cats and goats were introduced by European and American visitors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The rats and cats greatly reduced the seabird colonies, which mostly withdrew to offshore islets, and exterminated the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> the last confirmed record of resident parakeets {{for over a}} century being made in 1836. Although the goats did not eliminate the tree canopy as they did on other islands, they greatly reduced the understory vegetation and were removed in 1986. The Department of Conservation eradicated rats and cats between 2002 and 2006, following which red-crowned parakeets soon returned naturally, presumably from the Herald Islets, [...] away. The parakeets had been absent from the island for 150 years and their natural return was a notable event in parrot conservation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{can live}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{habitats}} including dense temperate rainforests, coastal forests, scrubland, forest edges and open areas. When their range overlaps with Yellow-crowned <b>parakeets,</b> <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> favour forest edges and open areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Red-crown</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{are green}} parrots with large tails. They are easiest to {{identify}} by their bright yellow-green plumage, and crimson forehead, lores, eye-stripes and {{front of the}} crown. They also have red patches on either sides of the rump. While they are flying, their dark blue outerwing can be visible. <b>Red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> have grey or pale brown legs and feet. Their bills are white to grey with a black tip.|$|R

40|$|Summary: The diet of <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae novaezelandiae) and yellowcrowned parakeets (C. auriceps auriceps) was {{compared}} on Little Barrier Island, New Zealand between 1986 and 1987. Significant dietary differences {{were observed in}} these sympatric, congeneric species. Yellowcrowned parakeets ate significantly more invertebrates than <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets,</b> which fed on {{a greater variety of}} plant foods. <b>Red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> were found in all vegetation types depending on the availability of food and were commonly seen foraging on the ground in open habitats. In contrast, yellowcrowned parakeets were more arboreal and showed distinct preferences for forested habitats. The existence of both parakeet species in sympatry is examined as is the ecological importance of invertebrate food sources. Observed differences in the behaviour and ecology of parakeet species on Little Barrier Island are used to provide insight into the present day distribution and status of parakeets on mainland New Zealand. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

50|$|Forbes’ parakeet {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from the Chatham Island <b>Red-crowned</b> <b>Parakeet</b> by its golden-yellow forecrown, as like its name suggests the Chatham Island <b>Red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> has a red forecrown. It is also distinguishable from the Yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps) despite looking quite similar, as C. auriceps is {{not found in the}} Chatham Islands.|$|E

50|$|<b>Red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{were once}} {{widespread}} across the North and South Islands of New Zealand. Nowadays however, {{most of those}} mainland populations have disappeared due to predation by introduced species.|$|R
50|$|Various {{reintroduction}} {{attempts have}} been studied. Between 1976 and 1986, seventeen <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> were released in the Waitakere Ranges near Auckland. The project was not monitored very meticulously and it apparently failed.|$|R
50|$|We can {{recognise}} <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{by their}} soft musical chattering calls. Those vocalisations are stronger and lower-pitched than the yellow-crowned parakeet's. During flight and take off, they also emit a ki-ki-ki-ki-ki or kek-kik-kek sound.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{is common}} in aviculture and is {{relatively}} easy to breed. Several colour mutations are available including yellow, cinnamon, and piebald.|$|E
5000|$|Reischek’s parakeet was {{previously}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> C. novaezelandiae, which it resembles in appearance, but was later lumped with the Macquarie parakeet from Macquarie Island in a 2001 paper by Wee Ming Boon and others following an examination of the molecular systematics of the genus which found that many of the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> subspecies should be elevated to full species. [...] However, subsequently the provenance of Boon et al.’s supposed Macquarie Island material was shown to be mistaken, originating from the Antipodes Islands instead.|$|E
50|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis}} has also indicated {{a high degree}} of hybridisation between Forbes’ parakeet and the Chatham Island <b>Red-crowned</b> <b>Parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae chathamensis), which is also found on Mangere Island in the Chatham Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{are common}} in aviculture and they are {{relatively}} easy to breed. They lay five to eight white eggs in a nesting box. A cinnamon colour variety, a pied variety, and yellow are available.|$|R
50|$|Juvenile <b>red-crown</b> <b>parakeet</b> look {{similar to}} adults. However, their bill has a slight pinkinsh tinge. Moreover, the iris of young parakeets starts off as dull black or brown, and becomes {{increasingly}} red as they age. Juvenile males also sport a stripe under the wing like the females.|$|R
50|$|For 172 years no {{breeding}} {{was recorded}} on Raoul, although occasional vagrant individual birds were seen. In 2008, following island restoration {{that included the}} removal of goats by 1986, the rats by 2004 and the cats by 2006, <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> were again recorded breeding on Raoul Island, presumably having recolonised it from the Herald Islets.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) was {{a common}} bird {{throughout}} the North and South Island but is now virtually extinct on the main islands. It is however common {{on a number of}} offshore islands.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainland}} {{species are}} the kea (Nestor notabilis), the New Zealand kaka (Nestor meridionalis), the kākāpō (Strigops habroptila), and three species of kākāriki: the yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps), the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) and the orange-fronted parakeet (Cyanoramphus malherbi).|$|E
50|$|The Kermadec <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> is a medium-sized, {{predominantly}} green parrot with a crimson cap and eye-stripe. At about 29 cm in length, and 80-90 g in weight, it {{is significantly}} {{larger than the}} nominate subspecies, as well as having noticeably bluer plumage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-crown</b> <b>parakeet</b> is {{a member}} of the order Psittaciformes, also known as the parrots. It is part of the Cyanoramphus genus, which {{currently}} includes 12 species of parakeets. C. novaezelandiae was once lumped with several other parrots from New Zealand's outlying islands, New Caledonia and Norfolk Island, but these have now been afforded full species status.|$|R
40|$|Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a {{single-stranded}} DNA {{virus that}} is the etiological agent of beak and feather disease in both wild and captive parrots. Given that BFDV is globally recognized as a conservation threat for wild parrots, between 2011 - 2013, <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae, n = 229), which are endemic to New Zealand, were captured in mist nets on Tiritiri Matangi Island and Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier Island (LBI), New Zealand, for disease surveillance. Blood and feathers from all birds were tested by PCR for BFDV, and full genomes were recovered and sequenced. A subset of blood samples (n = 96) were tested for antibodies to BFDV by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. A further 238 feather samples were obtained from <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> from three sites in the Wellington region of the North Island, and these were screened for BFDV. The DNA-based prevalence of BFDV infection determined on Tiritiri Matangi Island was 1. 09 % (CI 95 %, 0. 1 - 3. 9 %); on Hauturu-o-Toi/LBI, 4. 4 % (95 % CI, 0. 5 %- 15. 1 %); on Kapiti Island, 3. 4 % (CI 95 %, 1. 1 - 7. 8 %); at the ZEALANDIA-Karori sanctuary, 1. 6 % (95 % CI, 0 - 8. 4 %); and on Matiu-Somes Island, 0 % (CI 95 %, 0 - 12. 3 %). Seroprevalence for BFDV, indicating prior or current exposure, in the Tiritiri Matangi Island population, it was 2 % (CI 95 %, 0 - 10. 1 %), and in the Hauturu-o-Toi/LBI population was 14 % (CI 95 %, 5. 3 - 27. 9 %). BFDV-positive birds {{showed no signs of}} clinical disease, with the exception of an individual bird obtained opportunistically from Shakespear Regional Park during the study period, which had classical signs of feather loss. Phylogenetic analysis of the 11 full genome sequences recovered from BFDV-positive <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> revealed evidence of ongoing viral flow between <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> and eastern rosellas (Platycercus eximius) in the Hauraki Gulf/Auckland region, with separate but closely related strains from the Wellington region of the North Island. This is the first study to report HI results for a New Zealand endemic parrot species, and the first epidemiological analysis of serial cross-sectional surveys in a BFDV-infected population of <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> in New Zealand. We postulate that although BFDV remains a threat to small, isolated or naïve populations of parrots globally, the low viral prevalence in this and other studies suggests that native parakeets in New Zealand may act as dead-end or spillover hosts...|$|R
50|$|The diet of Forbes’ parakeets {{consists}} of invertebrates, flowers, seeds, leaves, fruit, shoots and bark. They {{have been noted}} feeding in the forest canopy and on the forest floor, {{as well as in}} trees, shrubs or other plants when fruiting, seeding or flowering. Forbes’ parakeet feeds both individually and in groups with conspecifics, as well as with Chatham Island <b>Red-crowned</b> <b>Parakeets</b> and hybrids of the two species.|$|R
5000|$|Forbes’ parakeet, C. forbesi : There is {{much debate}} {{regarding}} the taxonomic {{status of the}} Forbes’ parakeet. It was first described as a distinct species, but was later considered a subspecies of red-crowned parakeets or yellow-crowned parakeet. However, more recent genetic studies concluded {{that it should be}} classed as a separate species within the genus Cyanoramphus. Although it remains the closest genetic relative of the <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> the Forbes’ parakeet differs slightly in voice, colour, morphology, as well as possibly ecology and behaviour. Moreover, hybrids rarely occur as individuals tend to mate with members of their own group. This species seems to have independently derived from the Chatham <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet.</b> Others suggest it might be the result of hybridisation. Overall, at present, the Forbes’ parakeet is still considered a distinct species.|$|E
50|$|The Norfolk parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii), {{also called}} Tasman parakeet, Norfolk Island green parrot or Norfolk Island <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> is {{a species of}} parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to Norfolk Island (located between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in the Tasman Sea). The species was once {{considered}} a subspecies of the red-fronted parakeet of New Zealand. The name Tasman parakeet is used by Christidis and Boles on the argument that this species and the Lord Howe <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae subflavescens) are probably a single species for which they use biogeographical arguments. Tasman is used for other species with the same distribution and they propose that name for that reason. However, the latter subspecies {{was not included in}} the genus-wide phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences, and the lumping of the species should be considered tentative.|$|E
50|$|The {{forests are}} home {{to a number of}} rare birds {{including}} the endangered North Island kōkako wattlebird, the North Island brown kiwi, and three endemic parrots <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> the New Zealand kaka and the kakapo, the last of which now only survives on the offshore Little Barrier Island. Invertebrates found in the region include the large wetas and cave wetas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island is}} part of the Auckland Island group Important Bird Area (IBA), {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because of the significance of the group as a breeding site for several species of seabirds as well as the endemic Auckland shag, Auckland teal, Auckland rail and Auckland snipe. Both [...] <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> and [...] yellow-crowned parakeets live on Ewing Island, making this the second southernmost location of living parrots.|$|R
50|$|<b>Red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{are highly}} {{generalised}} and diverse {{when it comes}} to feeding. They consume flowers, fruits, seeds, leaves and buds from a variety of plants. They also complement their diet with a few invertebrates such as small aphids. Their feeding habits vary throughout the year depending on the seasonal availability of food. In winter and spring, the birds mostly eat flowers. In summer and fall, their main food items consist of seeds.|$|R
50|$|Egg laying {{takes place}} from November to January, peaking in December. On average, {{clutches}} count 7 eggs, yet {{can range from}} 4 to 9. Eggs look oval and white with a slight gloss which fades during incubation. In <b>red-crowned</b> <b>parakeets,</b> only the female incubates. While in the nest, they are seen turning their eggs regularly. Otherwise, they spend their time sleeping, preening or digging. This period last from 23 to 25 days. Again, males visit the nest regularly to feed their companion by regurgitation.|$|R
