2500|$|At {{the time}} of the hypercycle theory formulation, ribozymes were not known. After the {{breakthrough}} of discovering RNA's catalytic properties in 1982, it was realized that RNA had the ability to integrate protein and nucleotide-chain properties into one entity. Ribozymes potentially serving as templates and catalysers of replication can be considered components of quasispecies that can self-organize into a hypercycle without the need to invent a translation process. In 2001, a partial RNA polymerase ribozyme was designed via directed evolution. Nevertheless, it was able to catalyse only a polymerization of a chain having the size of about 14 nucleotides, even though it was 200 nucleotides long. The most up-to-date version of this polymerase was shown in 2013. While it has an ability to catalyse polymerization of longer sequences, even of its own length, it cannot replicate itself {{due to a lack of}} sequence generality and its inability to transverse secondary structures of long RNA templates. However, it was recently shown that those limitations could in principle be overcome by the assembly of active polymerase ribozymes from several short RNA strands. In 2014, a cross-chiral RNA polymerase ribozyme was demonstrated. It was hypothesized that it offers a new mode of recognition between an enzyme and substrates, which is based on the shape of the substrate, and allows avoiding the Watson-Crick pairing and, therefore, may provide greater sequence generality. [...] Various other experiments have shown that, besides bearing polymerase properties, ribozymes could have developed other kinds of evolutionarily useful catalytic activity such as synthase, ligase, or aminoacylase activities. Ribozymal aminoacylators and ribozymes with the ability to form peptide bonds might have been crucial to inventing translation. An <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase,</b> in turn, could link various components of quasispecies into one chain, beginning the process of a genome integration. An RNA with a synthase or a synthetase activity could be critical for building compartments and providing building blocks for growing RNA and protein chains as well as other types of molecules. Many examples of this kind of ribozyme are currently known, including a peptidyl transferase ribozyme, a ligase, and a nucleotide synthetase. A transaminoacylator described in 2013 has five nucleotides, which is sufficient for a trans-amino acylation reaction and makes it the smallest ribozyme that has been discovered. It supports a peptidyl-RNA synthesis that could be a precursor for the contemporary process of linking amino acids to tRNA molecules. An RNA ligase's catalytic domain, consisting of 93 nucleotides, proved to be sufficient to catalyse a linking reaction between two RNA chains. Similarly, an acyltransferase ribozyme 82 nucleotides long was sufficient to perform an acyltransfer reaction. Altogether, the results concerning the RNA ligase's catalytic domain and the acyltransferase ribozyme are in agreement with the estimated upper limit of 100 nucleotides set by the error threshold problem. However, it was hypothesized that even if the putative first RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases are estimated to be longer—the smallest reported up-to-date RNA-dependent polymerase ribozyme is 165 nucleotides long—they did not have to arise in one step. It is more plausible that ligation of smaller RNA chains performed by the first RNA ligases resulted in a longer chain with the desired catalytically active polymerase domain.|$|E

Neglected tropical diseases like African {{sleeping sickness}} cause significant death and {{suffering in the}} world's poorest countries. Current treatments for African sleeping sickness either have high costs, terrible side effects, or limited effectiveness. Consequently, new medicines are urgently needed. <b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> 1 is an important protein critical {{for the survival of}} Trypanosoma brucei, the unicellular parasite that causes African sleeping sickness. In this paper, we describe our recent efforts to use advanced computer techniques to identify chemicals predicted to prevent <b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> 1 from functioning properly. We subsequently tested our predicted chemicals and confirmed that a number of them inhibited the protein's function. Additionally, one of the chemicals was effective at stopping the growth of the parasite in culture.

40|$|Trypanosome RNA editing is {{a unique}} U {{insertion}} and U deletion process that involves cycles of pre-mRNA cleavage, terminal U addition or U removal, and religation. This editing can occur at massive levels and is directed by base pairing of trans-acting guide RNAs. Both U insertion and U deletion cycles are catalyzed by a single protein complex that contains only seven major proteins, band I through band VII. However, {{little is known about}} their catalytic functions, except that band IV and band V are RNA ligases and genetic analysis indicates that the former is important in U deletion. Here we establish biochemical approaches to distinguish the individual roles of these ligases, based on their distinctive ATP and pyrophosphate utilization. These in vitro analyses revealed that both ligases serve in RNA editing. Band V is the <b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> that functions very selectively to seal in U insertion (IREL), while band IV is the <b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> needed to seal in U deletion (DREL). In combination with our earlier findings about the cleavage and the U-addition/U-removal steps of U deletion and U insertion, these results show that all three steps of these editing pathways exhibit major differences and suggest that the editing complex could have physically separate regions for U deletion and U insertion.

While other ligases such as T 7 DNA ligase have both a catalytic and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) -fold domain, T. brucei RNA editing ligases contain only the catalytic domain. The OB-fold domain, which is required for interaction with the substrate RNA, is provided in trans by KREPA 2 (for TbREL 1) and KREPA 1 (for TbREL 2). KREPA 2 enhancement of TbREL 1 ligase activity is presumed to occur via an OB-fold-mediated increase in substrate specificity and catalysis. We characterized the interaction between TbREL 1 and KREPA 2 in vitro using full-length, truncated, and point-mutated ligases. As previously shown, our data indicate strong, specific stimulation of TbREL 1 catalytic activity by KREPA 2. We narrowed the region of contact to the final 59 C-terminal residues of TbREL 1. Specifically, the TbREL 1 C-terminal KWKE (441 - 444) sequence appear to coordinate the KREPA 2 -mediated enhancement of TbREL 1 activities. N-terminal residues F 206, T 264 and Y 275 are crucial for the overall activity of TbREL 1, particularly for F 206, a mutation of this residue also disrupts KREPA 2 interaction.

As an example of the latter, a recent study showed that a functional deoxyribozyme can be selected through in vitro evolution of a non-catalytic oligonucleotide precursor strand. An arbitrarily chosen DNA fragment derived from the mRNA transcript of bovine serum albumin was evolved through random point mutations over 25 rounds of selection. Through deep sequencing analysis of various pool generations, the evolution of the most catalytic deoxyribozyme strand could be tracked through each subsequent single mutation.This first successful evolution of catalytic DNA from a non-catalytic precursor could provide support for the RNA World hypothesis.

40|$|Conventional drug design {{embraces the}} "one gene, one drug, one disease" philosophy.

The rational design of drugs that act via polypharmacological mechanisms can produce compounds that exhibit increased therapeutic potency and against which resistance is less likely to develop.

One third of potential therapeutic compounds fail in clinical trials or are later removed from the market due to unacceptable side effects often caused by off-target binding. In the current work, we introduce a multidimensional strategy for the identification of secondary targets of known small-molecule inhibitors in the absence of global structural and sequence homology with the primary target protein.

The opened ends are held in place by other proteins in the complex. Another enzyme, a U-specific exoribonuclease, removes the unpaired Us. After editing has made mRNA complementary to gRNA, an <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> rejoins the ends of the edited mRNA transcript. As a consequence, the editosome can edit only in a 3' to 5' direction along the primary RNA transcript. The complex can act on only a single guide RNA at a time.

In this regard, directed evolution has been used on γ-humulene synthase, an enzyme that creates over 50 different sesquiterpenes, to create enzymes that selectively synthesize individual products.

Similarly, an acyltransferase ribozyme 82 nucleotides long was sufficient to perform an acyltransfer reaction. Altogether, the results concerning the RNA ligase's catalytic domain and the acyltransferase ribozyme are in agreement with the estimated upper limit of 100 nucleotides set by the error threshold problem. However, it was hypothesized that even if the putative first RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases are estimated to be longer—the smallest reported up-to-date RNA-dependent polymerase ribozyme is 165 nucleotides long—they did not have to arise in one step. It is more plausible that ligation of smaller RNA chains performed by the first RNA ligases resulted in a longer chain with the desired catalytically active polymerase domain.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} multicomponent complexes involved in kinetoplastid mitochondrial mRNA editing. Mitochondrial extracts from Trypanosoma brucei were fractionated on 10 - 30 % glycerol gradients and assayed for RNAs and activities potentially involved in editing, including pre-edited mRNA, guide RNA (gRNA), endonuclease, terminal uridylyltransferase (TUTase), <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> and gRNA-mRNA chimera-forming activities. These experiments suggest that two distinct editing complexes exist. Complex I (19 S) consists of gRNA, TUTase, <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> and chimera-forming activity. Complex II (35 - 40 S) is composed of gRNA, preedited mRNA, <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> and chimera-forming activity. These studies provide the first evidence that editing occurs in a multicomponent complex. The possible roles of complex I, complex II and <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> in editing are discussed...|$|E

Using cells infected by the double mutant, <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> was purified to homogeneity with a 20 % yield. Unlike previous preparations of this enzyme, the ligase is free of contaminating nuclease and is therefore suitable for intermolecular ligation of DNA substrates. In the course of these studies it was discovered that adenylalation of the enzyme [...] a step in the reaction pathway [...] markedly decreased the electrophoretic mobility of <b>RNA</b> <b>ligase</b> through polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate.

40|$|<b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> 1 (TbREL 1) is {{required}} for the survival of both the insect and bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for the devastating tropical disease African sleeping sickness. The type of RNA editing that TbREL 1 is involved in is unique to the trypanosomes, and no close human homolog is known to exist. In addition, the highresolution crystal structure revealed several unique features of the active site, making this enzyme a promising target for structure-based drug design. In this work, two 20 ns atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to investigate the dynamics of TbREL 1, both with and without the ATP substrate present. The flexibility of the active site, dynamics of conserved residues and crystallized water molecules, and the interactions between TbREL 1 and the ATP substrate are investigated and discussed in the context of TbREL 1 ’s function. Differences in local and global motion upon ATP binding suggest that two peripheral loops, unique to the trypanosomes, may be involved in interdomain signaling events. Notably, a significant structural rearrangement of the enzyme’s active site occurs during the apo simulations, opening an additional cavity adjacent to the ATP binding site that could be exploited in the development of effective inhibitors directed against this protozoan parasite. Finally, ensemble averaged electrostatics calculations over the MD simulations reveal a novel putative RNA binding site, a discovery that has previously eluded scientists. Ultimately, we use the insights gained through the MD simulations to make several predictions and recommendations, which we anticipat...|$|R
40|$|RNA editing, catalyzed by the multiprotein editosome complex, is an {{essential}} step {{for the expression of}} most mitochondrial genes in trypanosomatid pathogens. It has been shown previously that Trypanosoma brucei <b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> 1 (TbREL 1), a core catalytic component of the editosome, is essential in the mammalian life stage of these parasitic pathogens. Because of the availability of its crystal structure and absence from human, the adenylylation domain of TbREL 1 has recently become the focus of several studies for designing inhibitors that target its adenylylation pocket. Here, we have studied new and existing inhibitors of TbREL 1 to better understand their mechanism of action. We found that these compounds are moderate to weak inhibitors of adenylylation of TbREL 1 and in fact enhance adenylylation at higher concentrations of protein. Nevertheless, they can efficiently block deadenylylation of TbREL 1 in the editosome and, consequently, result in inhibition of the ligation step of RNA editing. Further experiments directly showed that the studied compounds inhibit the interaction of the editosome with substrate RNA. This was supported by the observation that not only the ligation activity of TbREL 1 but also the activities of other editosome proteins such as endoribonuclease, terminal RNA uridylyltransferase, and uridylate-specific exoribonuclease, all of which require the interaction of the editosome with the substrate RNA, are efficiently inhibited by these compounds. In addition, we found that these compounds can interfere with the integrity and/or assembly of the editosome complex, opening the exciting possibility of using them to study the mechanism of assembly of the editosome components.

40|$|The protist {{parasite}} Trypanosoma brucei causes Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), which threatens {{millions of}} people in sub-Saharan Africa. Without treatment the infection is almost always lethal. Current drugs for HAT are difficult to administer and have severe side effects. Together with increasing drug resistance this results in urgent need for new treatments. T. brucei and other trypanosomatid pathogens require a distinct form of post-transcriptional mRNA modification for mitochondrial gene expression. A multi-protein complex called the editosome cleaves mitochondrial mRNA, inserts or deletes uridine nucleotides at specific positions and re-ligates the mRNA. <b>RNA</b> editing <b>ligase</b> 1 (REL 1) is essential for the re-ligation step and has no close homolog in the mammalian host, making it a promising target for drug discovery. However, traditional assays for RELs use radioactive substrates coupled with gel analysis and are not suitable for high-throughput screening of compound libraries. Here we describe a fluorescence-based REL activity assay. This assay is compatible with a 384 -well microplate format and sensitive, satisfies statistical criteria for high-throughput methods and is readily adaptable for other polynucleotide ligases. We validated the assay by determining kinetic properties of REL 1 and by identifying REL 1 inhibitors in a library of small, pharmacologically active compounds. Wellcome Trust [WT 094899 MA to A.
