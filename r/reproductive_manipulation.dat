40|$|Wolbachia are maternally {{transmitted}} endosymbionts {{that often}} alter their arthropod hosts’ biology {{to favor the}} success of infected females, and they may {{also serve as a}} speciation microbe driving reproductive isolation. Two of these host manipulations include killing males outright and reducing offspring survival when infected males mate with uninfected females, a phenomenon known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. Little is known about the mechanisms behind these phenotypes, but interestingly either effect can be caused by the same Wolbachia strain when infecting different hosts. For instance, wRec causes cytoplasmic incompatibility in its native host Drosophila recens and male killing in D. subquinaria. The discovery of prophage WO elements in most arthropod Wolbachia has generated the hypothesis that WO may encode genes involved in these reproductive manipulations. However, PCR screens for the WO minor capsid gene indicated that wRec lacks phage WO. Thus, wRec seemed to provide an example where phage WO is not needed for Wolbachia-induced <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation.</b> To enable investigation of the mechanism of phenotype switching in different host backgrounds, and to examine the unexpected absence of phage WO, we sequenced the genome of wRec. Analyses reveal that wRec diverged from wMel approximately 350, 000 years ago, mainly by genome reduction in the phage regions. While it lost the minor capsid gene used in standard PCR screens for phage WO, it retained two regions encompassing 33 genes, several of which have previously been associated with reproductive parasitism. Thus, WO gene involvement in <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation</b> cannot be excluded and reliance on single gene PCR should not be used to rule out the presence of phage WO in Wolbachia.

40|$|Abstract Background Wolbachia are {{intracellular}} bacteria {{known to}} be facultative reproductive parasites of numerous arthropod hosts. Apart from these <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulations,</b> recent findings indicate that Wolbachia may also modify the host’s physiology, notably its immune function. In the parasitoid wasp, Asobara tabida, Wolbachia is necessary for oogenesis completion, and aposymbiotic females are unable to produce viable offspring. The absence of egg production is also associated {{with an increase in}} programmed cell death in the ovaries of aposymbiotic females, suggesting that a mechanism that ensures the maintenance of Wolbachia in the wasp could also be responsible for this dependence. In order to decipher the general mechanisms underlying host- Wolbachia interactions and the origin of the dependence, we developed transcriptomic approaches to compare gene expression in symbiotic and aposymbiotic individuals. Results As no genetic data were available on A. tabida, we constructed several Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) libraries, and obtained 12, 551 unigenes from this species. Gene expression was compared between symbiotic and aposymbiotic ovaries through in silico analysis and in vitro subtraction (SSH). As pleiotropic functions involved in immunity and development could {{play a major role in}} the establishment of dependence, the expression of genes involved in oogenesis, programmed cell death (PCD) and immunity (broad sense) was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. We showed that Wolbachia might interfere with these numerous biological processes, in particular some related to oxidative stress regulation. We also showed that Wolbachia may interact with immune gene expression to ensure its persistence within the host. Conclusions This study allowed us to constitute the first major dataset of the transcriptome of A. tabida, a species that is a model system for both host/ Wolbachia and host/parasitoid interactions. More specifically, our results highlighted that symbiont infection may interfere with numerous pivotal processes at the individual level, suggesting that the impact of Wolbachia should also be investigated beyond <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulations.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWolbachia pipientis is {{possibly}} the most widespread endosymbiont of arthropods and nematodes. While all Wolbachia strains have historically been defined as a single species, 16 monophyletic clusters of diversity (called supergroups) have been described. Different supergroups have distinct host ranges and symbiotic relationships, ranging from mutualism to <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation.</b> In filarial nematodes, which include parasites responsible for major diseases of humans (such as Onchocerca volvulus, agent of river blindness) and companion animals (Dirofilaria immitis, the dog heartworm), Wolbachia has an obligate mutualist role and is the target of new treatment regimens. Here, we compare the genomes of eight Wolbachia strains, spanning {{the diversity of the}} major supergroups (A-F), analysing synteny, transposable element content, GC skew and gene loss or gain. We detected genomic features that differ between Wolbachia supergroups, most notably in the C and D clades from filarial nematodes. In particular, strains from supergroup C (symbionts of O. volvulus and D. immitis) present a pattern of GC skew, conserved synteny and lack of transposable elements, unique in the Wolbachia genus. These features could be the consequence of a distinct symbiotic relationship between C Wolbachia strains and their hosts, highlighting underappreciated differences between the mutualistic supergroups found within filarial nematodes...|$|E
40|$|Wolbachia are intracellular, maternally {{inherited}} bacteria with {{an impressive}} history of adaptation to intracellular lifestyles. Instead of adapting to a single host lineage, Wolbachia evolved ways to jump across host species and establish relatively stable associations maintained through vertical transmission. Wolbachia are capable of manipulating the reproduction of infected hosts in a remarkable way. Traditionally, such reproductive manipulations have been regarded as the general mechanism by which Wolbachia spread through host populations. Recent evidence suggests that Wolbachia-host interactions are more complex than previously thought and may be driven by the onset and resolution of conflicts of interest. Here, we discuss how <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation</b> phenotypes may be transient. As the host adapts to infection, manipulation phenotypes attenuate and {{the continuity of the}} symbioses may rely on the physiological advantages Wolbachia may confer to their host. For facultative symbionts, such benefits are likely to be dependent on the environment. Here, we also review evidence that supports the view of environment-dependent facultative mutualism as a stable evolutionary outcome of Wolbachia infections beside extinction and obligate symbioses. Finally, our current understanding of the biology of mitochondria and Wolbachia unravels remarkable parallels in the way they interact with the nuclear genome.

40|$|Wolbachia is {{the most}} {{widespread}} endosymbiotic bacterium that manipulates reproduction of its arthropod hosts to enhance its own spread throughout host populations. Infection with Wolbachia causes complete parthenogenetic reproduction in many Hymenoptera, producing only female offspring. The mechanism of such <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation</b> by Wolbachia has been extensively studied. However, the effects of Wolbachia symbiosis on behavioral traits of the hosts are scarcely investigated. The parasitoid wasp Asobara japonica is an ideal insect to investigate this because symbiotic and aposymbiotic strains are available: Wolbachia-infected Tokyo (TK) and noninfected Iriomote (IR) strains originally collected on the main island and southwest islands of Japan, respectively. We compared the oviposition behaviors of the two strains and found that TK strain females parasitized Drosophila melanogaster larvae more actively than the IR strain, especially {{during the first two}} days after eclosion. Removing Wolbachia from the TK strain wasps by treatment with tetracycline or rifampicin decreased their parasitism activity {{to the level of the}} IR strain. Morphological and behavioral analyses of both strain wasps showed that Wolbachia endosymbionts do not affect development of the host female reproductive tract and eggs, but do enhance host-searching ability of female wasps.

40|$|Wolbachia pipientis is a {{widespread}} endosymbiont of filarial nematodes and arthropods.

These various phenotypic effects may be linked to differences in host physiology, and in particular to endocrine-related processes governing growth, development and reproduction. Indeed, a number of evidences links Wolbachia symbiosis to insulin and ecdysteroid signalling, two multilayered pathways known to work antagonistically, jointly or even independently for the regulation of different molecular networks. At present it is not clear whether Wolbachia manipulates one pathway, thus affecting other related metabolic networks, or if it targets both pathways, even interacting at several points in each of them.

Survival was significantly greater for Spiroplasma-infected flies, and the effect of Spiroplasma infection was most evident during the host’s pupal stage. We examined whether or not increased survival of Spiroplasma-infected flies was due to reduced oviposition by the wasp (i. e., pre-oviposition mechanism).

40|$|Wolbachia pipientis is a {{worldwide}} bacterial parasite of arthropods that infects germline cells and manipulates host reproduction {{to increase the}} ratio of infected females, the transmitting sex of the bacteria. The most common <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation,</b> cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), is expressed as embryonic death in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. Specifically, Wolbachia modify developing sperm in the testes by unknown means to cause a post-fertilization disruption of the sperm chromatin that incapacitates the first mitosis of the embryo. As these Wolbachia-induced changes are stable, reversible, and affect the host cell cycle machinery including DNA replication and chromosome segregation, we hypothesized that the host methylation pathway is targeted for modulation during cytoplasmic incompatibility because it accounts {{for all of these}} traits. Here we show that infection of the testes is associated with a 55 % increase of host DNA methylation in Drosophila melanogaster, but methylation of the paternal genome does not correlate with penetrance of CI. Overexpression and knock out of the Drosophila DNA methyltransferase Dnmt 2 neither induces nor increases CI. Instead, overexpression decreases Wolbachia titers in host testes by approximately 17 %, leading to a similar reduction in CI levels.

However, phylogenetic analyses were unable to resolve whether the bacteria in the two species are monophyletic, or represent independent origins of male-killing among the B-group Wolbachia. We also found signi¢cant divergence within the wsp gene of Wolbachia strains found in di¡erent A. bipunctata individuals, suggesting this host species contains two Wolbachia strains, diverged in wsp sequence but monophyletic. Our observations reinforce the notion that Wolbachia may be an important agent driving arthropod evolution, and corroborates previous suggestions that male-killing behaviour is easily evolved by invertebrate symbionts...|$|R
40|$|Wolbachia {{bacteria}} are cytoplasmic endosymbionts that infect {{a wide range}} of arthropod and nematode hosts. They are transmitted from mother to offspring via the eggs (vertical transmission) and enhance their transmission to the next generation by manipulating the reproductive system of their hosts. These manipulations occur in many forms, such as the induction of cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminization, mate killing and parthenogenesis induction. Wolbachia is estimated to occur in up to 66 % of all insect species, but the greatest diversity of <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulations</b> is found in the order of the Hymenoptera. Studies of Wolbachia in Drosophila-parasitoid communities have allowed for important insights into different aspects of Wolbachia biology. The extensive knowledge available on Drosophila parasitoids provides a solid base on which to test new hypotheses on host-Wolbachia interactions. The large range of Wolbachia phenotypes present in Drosophila parasitoids, combined with the recent acquisition of the bacteria from their Drosophilid hosts, make them an ideal model system to study the evolution and dynamics of Wolbachia infections, both in the laboratory as in the field. in this chapter, we aim to review the current knowledge on the associations between Wolbachia and Drosophila parasitoids, and identify open questions and specify new research directions...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that maternally inherited endosymbionts can promote their spread and persistence in host populations by enhancing {{the production of}} daughters by infected hosts, either by improving overall host fitness, or through <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation.</b> In the doubly infected parasitoid wasp Encarsia inaron, Wolbachia manipulates host reproduction through cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), but Cardinium does not. We investigated the fitness costs and/or benefits of infection by each bacterium in differentially cured E. inaron as a potential explanation for persistence of Cardinium in this population. We introgressed lines infected with Wolbachia, Cardinium or both with the cured line to create a similar genetic background, and evaluated several parasitoid fitness parameters. We found that symbiont infection resulted in both fitness costs and benefits for E. inaron. The cost was lower initial egg load for all infected wasps. The benefit was increased survivorship, which in turn increased male production for wasps infected with only Cardinium. Female production was unaffected by symbiont infection; we therefore have not yet identified a causal fitness effect that can explain the persistence of Cardinium in the population. Interestingly, the Cardinium survivorship benefit was not evident when Wolbachia was also present in the host, and the reproduction of doubly infected individuals {{did not differ significantly}} from uninfected wasps. Therefore, the results of our study show that even when multiple infections seem to have no effect on a host, there may be a complex interaction of costs and benefits among symbionts...|$|E
40|$|Obligately {{intracellular}} Wolbachia bacteria infect numerous invertebrates {{and often}} manipulate host reproduction {{to facilitate the}} spread of infection. An example of <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation</b> is Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which occurs commonly in insects. This CI {{has been the focus}} both of basic scientific studies of naturally occurring invasion events and of applied investigations on the use of Wolbachia as a vehicle to drive desired genotypes into insect populations (“gene drive” or “population replacement” strategies). The latter application requires an ability to generate artificial infections that cause a pattern of unidirectional incompatibility with the targeted host population. A suggested target of population replacement strategies is the mosquito Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito), an important invasive pest and disease vector. Aedes albopictus individuals are naturally “superinfected” with two Wolbachia types: wAlbA and wAlbB. Thus, generating a strain that is unidirectionally incompatible with field populations requires the introduction of an additional infection into the preexisting superinfection. Although prior reports demonstrate an ability to transfer Wolbachia infections to A. albopictus artificially, including both intra- and interspecific Wolbachia transfers, previous efforts have not generated a strain capable of invading natural populations. Here we describe the generation of a stable triple infection by introducing Wolbachia wRi from Drosophila simulans into a naturally superinfected A. albopictus strain. The triple-infected strain displays a pattern of unidirectional incompatibility with the naturally infected strain. This unidirectional CI, combined with a high fidelity of maternal inheritance and low fecundity effects, suggests that the artificial cytotype could serve as an appropriate vehicle for gene drive...|$|E

Candidate host interaction factors include 54 predicted ankyrin proteins hypothesized {{to play a role}} in host <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulation,</b> a Type IV secretion system linked to ankyrin protein export, and a bacterioferritin linked to host iron homeostasis.   Several metabolic capabilities were identified in wDi that are absent from Liberibacter. FtsZ and Wsp phylogenies indicate that the Wolbachia strain in the Florida D. citri isolate falls into a sub-clade of supergroup B, distinct from Wolbachia present in Chinese D. citri isolates, supporting the hypothesis that the D. citri introduced into Florida did not originate from China. The Wolbachia sequence and annotation can be viewed on the CG-HLB Genome Resources Website ([URL] together with the sequences of publically available Liberibacter genomes sequenced to date. Future plans involve development of a searchable Liberibacter diagnostic sequence database using the over 1700 publically available Ca. Liberibacter gene sequences...|$|E
40|$|Obligate, {{intracellular}} bacteria of {{the genus}} Wolbachia often behave as reproductive parasites by manipulating host reproduction to enhance their vertical transmission. One of these <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulations,</b> cytoplasmic incompatibility, causes a reduction in egg-hatch rate in crosses between individuals with differing infections. Applied strategies based upon cytoplasmic incompatibility have been proposed for both the suppression and replacement of host populations. As Wolbachia infections occur within {{a broad range of}} invertebrates, these strategies are potentially applicable to a variety of medically and economically important insects. Here, we examine the interaction between Wolbachia infection frequency and host population size. We use a model to describe natural invasions of Wolbachia infections, artificial releases of infected hosts and releases of sterile males, as part of a traditional sterile insect technique programme. Model simulations demonstrate the importance of understanding the reproductive rate and intraspecific competition type of the targeted population, showing that releases of sterile or incompatible individuals may cause an undesired increase in the adult number. In addition, the model suggests a novel applied strategy that employs Wolbachia infections to suppress host populations. Releases of Wolbachia-infected hosts can be used to sustain artificially an unstable coexistence of multiple incompatible infections within a host population, allowing the host population size to be reduced, maintained at low levels, or eliminated...|$|R

40|$|Maternally {{transmitted}} bacteria of {{the genus}} Wolbachia are obligate, intracellular symbionts that are fre-quently found in insects and cause a diverse array of <b>reproductive</b> <b>manipulations,</b> including cytoplasmic in-compatibility, male killing, parthenogenesis, and feminization. Despite {{the existence of a}} broad range of sci-entific interest, many aspects of Wolbachia research have been limited to laboratories with insect-rearing facilities. The inability to culture these bacteria outside of the invertebrate host has also led to the existing bias of Wolbachia research toward infections that occur in host insects that are easily reared. Here, we demonstrate that Wolbachia infections can be simply established, stably maintained, and cryogenically stored in vitro using standard tissue culture techniques. We have examined Wolbachia host range by introducing different Wolbachia types into a single tissue culture. The results show that an Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) cell line can support five different Wolbachia infection types derived from Drosophila simulans (Diptera: Drosophilidae), Culex pipiens (Culicidae), and Cadra cautella (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae). These bacterial types include infection types that have been assigned to two of the major Wolbachia clades. As an additional examination of Wolbachia host cell range, we demonstrated that a Wolbachia strain from D. simulans could be established in host insect cell lines derived from A. albopictus, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Drosophila mel...|$|R
