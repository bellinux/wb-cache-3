5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis {{needed to take}} place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and others and the ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex impedance) laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A <b>Reactance</b> Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a driving point impedance, that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's <b>reactance</b> theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the <b>reactance</b> must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E
25|$|As {{frequency}} approaches infinity, the {{capacitive impedance}} (or <b>reactance)</b> approaches zero and the ESR becomes significant. As the <b>reactance</b> becomes negligible, power dissipation approaches PRMS = VRMS² /RESR.|$|E

25|$|If {{the current}} J is {{alternating}} because the applied voltage or E-field varies in time, then <b>reactance</b> must {{be added to}} resistance to account for self-inductance, see electrical impedance. The <b>reactance</b> may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.|$|E
25|$|For film capacitors, the {{dissipation}} factor tanδ will be {{specified in the}} relevant data sheets, instead of the ESR. The {{dissipation factor}} {{is determined by the}} tangent of the phase angle between the capacitive <b>reactance</b> XC minus the inductive <b>reactance</b> XL and the ESR.|$|E

50|$|Bias tees are {{designed}} to operate over a range of signal frequencies. The <b>reactances</b> are chosen to have minimal impact at the lowest frequency.|$|R
50|$|Note that (as shown above) {{the signs}} of <b>reactances</b> become {{reversed}} in the admittance domain; i.e. capacitive susceptance is positive and inductive susceptance is negative.|$|R
25|$|X denotes <b>reactance</b> (units in ohms, Ω) of the load.|$|E
25|$|The antenna is an {{integral}} part of the tuned circuit and its <b>reactance</b> contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have capacitive <b>reactance.</b> Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant parasitic capacitance in the coil) to form the tuned circuit with the coil.|$|E
25|$|At sin(ωt) = -1, the {{capacitor}} has {{a maximum}} (or peak) current whereby I0 = ωCV0. The ratio of peak voltage to peak current {{is due to}} capacitive <b>reactance</b> (denoted XC).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{computer}} simulation models {{of two different}} topologies of 18 -pulse rectifiers are presented. Each rectifier topology consists of three parallel, three-phase six-pulse full-bridge thyristor converters connected via interphase transformers. The influence of the interphase transformer's layout and AC line <b>reactances</b> variations on the particular thyristor converter current sharing is analysed. Various configurations of 18 -pulse rectifiers are examined by simulating operation with symmetric input voltage supply, {{as well as in}} the cases of different levels of voltage supply asymmetry, at unequal input conductors impedance, and at different thyristor voltage drops. According to {{computer simulation}} results, an optimal 18 -pulse rectifier circuit topology is recommended. The optimal topology has three AC line <b>reactances</b> with two input current-balancing interphase transformers. These added AC <b>reactances</b> are also involved with the current commutation process between thyristors. Application of the recommended optimal topology of an 18 -pulse rectifier could enable the reduction of the AC line <b>reactances</b> number from nine to three, while the dissipated power of the AC/DC converter's most loaded thyristor could be reduced by approximately 11 %. During the simulation of the nominally loaded 18 -pulse rectifier, in all considered cases the effective value of the output signal ripple below one promil of total current and voltage values has been achieved...|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} the models of {{hyperbolic}} geometry, this Cayley transform relates the Poincaré half-plane model to the Poincaré disk model. In electrical engineering the Cayley transform {{has been used to}} map a <b>reactance</b> half-plane to the Smith chart used for impedance matching of transmission lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality factor}} (or Q) of a {{capacitor}} is {{the ratio of}} its <b>reactance</b> to its resistance at a given frequency, and {{is a measure of}} its efficiency. The higher the Q factor of the capacitor, the closer it approaches the behavior of an ideal, lossless, capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Where V denotes voltage in phasor form, {{with the}} {{amplitude}} as rms, and I denotes current in phasor form, with the amplitude as rms. Also by convention, the complex conjugate of I is used. This is done such that a leading current (capacitive load, negative <b>reactance),</b> results in negative reactive power.|$|E
40|$|Abstract � {{high voltage}} {{synchronous}} generators known as powerformers, by changing stator configuration and their winding compared to conventional generator could generate fit voltage for connecting to transmission lines directly. Because of the innovation in their configuration and complication, fields and consequently <b>reactances</b> calculations {{would be so}} difficult by analytical formulas.

25|$|A purely {{reactive}} {{component is}} distinguished by the sinusoidal voltage across the component being in quadrature with the sinusoidal current through the component. This {{implies that the}} component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure <b>reactance</b> will not dissipate any power.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to ESR, the capacitor's leads add {{equivalent}} {{series inductance}} or ESL to the component. This is usually significant only at relatively high frequencies. As inductive <b>reactance</b> is positive and increases with frequency, above a certain frequency capacitance is canceled by inductance. High-frequency engineering involves accounting for the inductance of all connections and components.|$|E
25|$|The back-emf is {{the source}} of the {{opposition}} to current flow. A constant direct current has a zero rate-of-change, and sees an inductor as a short-circuit (it is typically made from a material with a low resistivity). An alternating current has a time-averaged rate-of-change that is proportional to frequency, this causes the increase in inductive <b>reactance</b> with frequency.|$|E
40|$|General {{relations}} for the energy spectral densities of nonperiodic signals constrained in bandwidth in nonlinear <b>reactances</b> are derived. It is assumed that the charge-voltage characteristics of the <b>reactances</b> are polynomials. In addition certain conditions for the frequency bands of the signals must be met. By contrast with the Manley-Rowe relations integrals with respect to frequency appear instead of the ratios power over frequency. The integrands are energy spectral densities divided by frequency. For parametric devices inequalities can be derived for the ratios of the energy levels in the different circuits and the limiting frequencies of the energy spectral densities. With these inequalities {{it is possible to}} determine limits for the energy levels...|$|R
5000|$|The {{power factor}} of {{induction}} motors varies with load, typically from around 0.85 or 0.90 {{at full load}} to as low as about 0.20 at no-load, due to stator and rotor leakage and magnetizing <b>reactances.</b> Power factor can be improved by connecting capacitors either on an individual motor basis or, by preference, on a common bus covering several motors. For economic and other considerations, power systems are rarely power factor corrected to unity power factor.Power capacitor application with harmonic currents requires power system analysis to avoid harmonic resonance between capacitors and transformer and circuit <b>reactances.</b> [...] Common bus power factor correction is recommended to minimize resonant risk and to simplify power system analysis.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{impedances}} [...] and [...] (or the normalised impedances [...] and [...] ) {{are pure}} <b>reactances,</b> then the networks become all-pass, constant-resistance, {{with a flat}} frequency response but a variable phase response. This makes them ideal as delay networks and phase equalisers.|$|R
25|$|The {{impedance}} Z is {{the vector}} sum of <b>reactance</b> and resistance; it describes the phase difference and {{the ratio of}} amplitudes between sinusoidally varying voltage and sinusoidally varying current at a given frequency. In this sense impedance {{is a measure of}} the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents and can be used like Ohm's law.|$|E
25|$|For thin wires (diameter= 0.00001 wavelengths), k is {{approximately}} 0.98; for thick conductors (diameter= 0.008 wavelengths), k drops to about 0.94. This {{is because the}} effect of antenna length on <b>reactance</b> is much greater for thinner conductors. For the same reason, antennas with thicker conductors have a wider operating bandwidth over which they attain an acceptable standing wave ratio.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} loading, attenuator probes (e.g.,10X probes) are used. A typical probe uses a 9megohm {{series resistor}} shunted by a low-value capacitor {{to make an}} RC compensated divider with the cable capacitance and scope input. The RC time constants are adjusted to match. For example, the 9megohm series resistor is shunted by a 12.2pF capacitor for a time constant of 110microseconds. The cable capacitance of 90pF in parallel with the scope input of 20pF and 1megohm (total capacitance 110pF) also gives a time constant of 110 microseconds. In practice, {{there will be an}} adjustment so the operator can precisely match the low frequency time constant (called compensating the probe). Matching the time constants makes the attenuation independent of frequency. At low frequencies (where the resistance of R is much less than the <b>reactance</b> of C), the circuit looks like a resistive divider; at high frequencies (resistance much greater than <b>reactance),</b> the circuit looks like a capacitive divider.|$|E

The fictitious <b>reactances</b> can be automatically controlled and continuously regulated by varying the d. c. field excitation such that a resultant anisotropic torque can be obtained.
