The qualification <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>competition</b> are more lenient, and the Falcons were able to play non-New Zealand born players to make them competitive against Australian sides from country leagues. The Falcons were not successful at the event, losing heavily to Queensland, by 9 points to Victoria B and by 63 points to the Indigenous All-Stars.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper extends {{an elitist}} multi-objective {{evolutionary}} algorithm, named GAME, based on several Pareto fronts corresponding to various fitness definitions. An additional operator is defined {{to create an}} adaptive version of this algorithm, called aGAME. This new operator alternates different modes of exploration of the search place all along a GAME execution. Mode switching is controlled according {{to the values of}} two performance indicators, in order to maintain a good compromise between quality and diversity of the returned solutions. aGAME is compared with the previous version (GAME) and with the three best ranked algorithms of the CEC 2009 competition, using five bi-objective benchmarks and the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>competition.</b> This experimental comparison shows that aGAME outperforms these four algorithms, which validate both the efficiency of the proposed dynamic adaptive operator and the algorithm performance...|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} of the Nordic team leaders at the 40th IMO in 1999 was never implemented {{in the context of}} the NMC, but its <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> eligibility was adobted for the Baltic Way competition in 2000 hosted by Norway and except for a minor change of wording it remains the basic <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> eligibility <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>competition.</b> In 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2006, the hosts of the NMC issued a statement whose version from 2005 is cited below. According to this statement, the eligibility to the IMO is the main criterion for the eligibility to the NMC. It is accepted, however, that this criterion may not be fulfilled in [...] "some borderline cases". About the problems it is stated only that they should be [...] "slightly below the IMO level". The marking scale is specified according to the tradition. The full text of the statement reads as follows in its version from 2005: ...|$|R
40|$|The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{paper is}} to provide a brief {{overview}} of the issue of definition of relevant market in civil aviation within the European Union. The liberalization of the market since the early 1990 s has led to a rapid {{increase in the number of}} airlines operating in the EU. The increase in the competitiveness of the market has brought many positive changes for passengers, such as lower fares and a better network of connections. At the same time it has created a risk that the airlines, in order to gain a competitive edge, would infringe the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> <b>This</b> is especially important in the context of the phenomenon that is the development of the airline alliances, which could lead to an abuse of a dominant position. A clear definition of the relevant market is a first step in an assessment of whether such an abuse occurred. This paper focus on the elements that Internal Market regulator, the European Commission, takes into consideration when defining relevant market in the airline industry...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a result of the author's summer {{internship}} assignment with Pratt & Whitney (P&W), one of the major manufacturers of jet engines in the world. Although P&W has many aspects to its business, this paper will only concentrate on P&W's large commercial engine business, jet engines sold to commercial airliners and cargo operations all over the world. The objectives <b>of</b> <b>this</b> paper are manifold. First, it seeks to educate the reader about the jet engine business, its structure and the global players involved in it. Specifically, it would describe how the industry structure and new trends have changed the industry's monopolistic competition environment. Second, the author will suggest ways in changing the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> the game and developing a competitive advantage in the light of the current environment. Finally, the paper will touch on how challenges, opportunities and the dynamics in the Asia-Pacific region can change the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> <b>This</b> will emphasize the fact that although the business is global in nature, there are variations in its character that is region and even airline specific. These variations can be a means of developing a competitive advantage for Pratt & Whitney (or the other major contender...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{competition}} {{is to provide a}} common benchmark to demonstrate scien-tific progress in robotics in the field of Urban Search and Rescue. The <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>competition</b> are inspired by the rules of the RoboCup Rescue Robot League and Agent competition. As in the Robot League, a devastated area has to be explored for victims with a team of robots controlled by an operator. Compared the Robot League, the focus of the research is more focused on team work to accurately explore large areas and less on mobility. As in the Agent competition, the disaster situation is not known before a competition run. Compared to the agent league, the focus is more on the sensory and actuation level and less on planning. This year the Technical Committee is looking forward to see cooperation between heterogeneous robots, as for instance a ground robot and an air robot. ...|$|E
