Plant extracts of five Libyan medicinal plants were used in this study to investigate their in vivo effects on spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in male rats and on ovulation and fertility in female rats. The In vitro effects of these plant extracts were also investigated on TM 3 Leydig cells and MCF 7 breast cancer cells. A phyto-chemical analysis of the five Libyan medicinal plants (flaxseed, black seeds, <b>radish</b> <b>seed,</b> date palm pollen and nutmeg) was done. The results showed that date palm pollen had a higher antioxidant activity than all of the above mentioned plants. In addition to this, Nigella sativa was observed to possess high flavonol content as well as high antioxidant activity. Male rats exposed to flaxseed, radish seeds and date palm pollen showed no significant alterations in body weight gain, whereas date palm pollen (240 mg/kg, p 0. 05) increase in Aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. Besides this, superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) in testis was increased significantly by <b>radish</b> <b>seed</b> (160 mg/kg), flaxseed (200 mg/kg) and date palm pollen (120 mg/kg). There was also improved catalase activity in testis of male rats exposed to <b>radish</b> <b>seed</b> and date palm pollen. Regarding male sexual behavior, the time to reach the female and the mount frequency decreased significantly in male rats exposed to flaxseed (300 mg/kg) and date palm pollen (120 and 240 mg/kg; p > 0. 05) thus, these plant extracts exhibit aphrodisiac properties. In addition, exposure of male rats to date palm pollen (120 mg/kg) produced a significant (p 0. 05). However, the relative uterus weights exposed to nutmeg (200 mg/kg) and date palm pollen (120 and 240 mg/kg) were significantly decreased (p 0. 05 or 0. 01) when the female rats have been exposed to black seed (200 mg/kg), nutmeg (200 mg/kg) or date palm pollen (120 mg/kg). The LH level significantly (p 0. 05). The creatinine activity in female rat serum in all treated groups was significantly decreased (p 0 · 05) and date palm pollen (500 μg/ml; p > 0 · 01). MCf- 7 cells treated with BS 10 - 50 μg/ml black seed and nutmeg 10 - 50 μg/ml significantly increased cell proliferation. However, the treatment with date palm pollen produced only a weak estrogenic effect, which resulted in a concentration dependent significant increase as observed between 50 - 1000 μg/ml date palm pollen. In conclusion, in this study, we observed that date palm pollen, <b>radish</b> <b>seed</b> and flaxseed increased libido as well as steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis, improved hepato and nephron-protective effects. In female rats, the plant extracts NM, BS and date palm pollen potentiated the production of gonadotropic hormones.

The effects of various densities of wild radish and wheat on the growth and reproductive output of each other were investigated in field studies in 2003 and 2004.

The effect of wild radish density on wheat yield loss and wild <b>radish</b> <b>seed</b> production were described with a rectangular hyperbola model. The presence of wild radish in wheat reduced aboveground dry matter, leaf-area index (LAI), and grain yield of wheat, and {{the magnitude of this}} reduction was dependent on weed density. Increasing the density of wheat substantially reduced the adverse effects of wild radish on wheat. As crop density increased, wild radish dry matter, LAI, and seed production per unit area decreased. The maximum seed production of wild radish was achieved at its highest density (60 plants m⁻²), and was 43, 300 and 61, 200 seeds m⁻² for the first and second year, respectively. The results indicated that higher densities of wheat were able to suppress seed production of this weed species. From a practical viewpoint, this study shows that increased wheat density in the range of 200 to 400 wheat plants m⁻² can reduce wild <b>radish</b> <b>seed</b> production and also give some reduction in crop yield loss, and could be an important component of an integrated weed management program.

60|$|<b>Radish</b> <b>seeds</b> (Raphanus sativus) of the {{previous}} year were placed on three leaves, which became moderately inflected, and re-expanded on the third or fourth day. Two of these seeds were transferred to damp sand; only one germinated, and that very slowly. This seedling had an extremely short, crooked, diseased, radicle, with no absorbent hairs; and the cotyledons were oddly mottled with purple, with the edges blackened and partly withered.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hydrostatic}} pressure (0. 1 - 400 MPa) and temperature (4 ˚C, 25 ˚C, and 35 ˚C) on the germination of {{three types of}} seeds (garden cress, leaf mustard, and radish) were studied. The normal germination rate of {{the three types of}} seeds was decreased at high hydrostatic pressure, and germination time tended to be delayed. Pressure and tempera-ture had two types of effects on seed germination. Germination of garden cress and leaf mustard seeds was more resis-tant to pressure at lower temperature. Conversely, germination of <b>radish</b> <b>seeds</b> was most pressure-sensitive at low tem-perature, and germination drastically decreased with treatment at 50 MPa and 4 ˚C. Generally, pressure and tempera-ture effects on protein structure and enzyme activity have been classified into two types, “hillside”-like (pressurization decreases the stable temperature range) and “tongue”-like (stabilizing effect of moderate pressure against heat dena-turation). Therefore, the type of temperature-pressure effects on germination of garden cress and leaf mustard seeds is classified as “hillside”-like and that of <b>radish</b> <b>seeds</b> is classified as “tongue”-like, similarly to the generally observed effects on protein denaturation...|$|R
40|$|A lectin {{isolated}} and purified by gel chromatography from the internal organs of Holothuria scabra Jaeger was assayed for different biological properties. The lectin {{was found to}} have hemolytic and mitogenic activities. It was also found to be a good inhibitor of seed germination and inhibited the germination of <b>radish</b> <b>seeds.</b> LC 50 against Artemia salina is lower than commercial therapeutic agents.
