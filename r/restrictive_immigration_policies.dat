The US state department's Trafficking in Persons report has identified the following eight structural {{factors that contribute to}} human trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean: (1) the high demand for domestic servants, agricultural laborers, sex workers, and factory labor; (2) political, social, or economic crises, as well as natural disasters such as the January 2010 earthquake; (3) lingering machismo (chauvinistic attitudes and practices) that tends to lead to discrimination against women and girls; (4) existence of established trafficking networks with sophisticated recruitment methods; (5) public corruption, especially complicity between law enforcement and border agents with traffickers and smugglers of people; (6) <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policies</b> in some destination countries that have limited the opportunities for legal migration flows to occur; (7) government disinterest in the issue of human trafficking; and (8) limited economic opportunities for women. [...] The restavek tradition is perpetuated by widespread tolerance for the practice throughout Haiti. [...] Other contributing factors to the restavek system include poverty and lack of access to contraception, education, and employment in the countryside. Poor rural families with many children have few opportunities to feed and educate them, leaving few options other than servitude in the city.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} {{immigrants}} remained relatively small {{during the second}} wave of Arab immigration, primarily due to the <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policies</b> of the US. However, in 1965, the United States passed new immigration reforms allowing {{a new wave of}} Arabs to immigrate. This new group of Arab immigrants was demographically similar to those that immigrated during the past 20 years; however, this wave differed largely in its scope and in their reasons for immigrating. Between 1967 and 2003 some 757,626 Arabs came to the United States, nearly eleven times the number of immigrants during the second wave. Moreover, during this time, in addition to increasingly regular conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, this era was marked by widespread [...] "intra-Arab warfare" [...] and a general increase in religious, ethnic and sectarian tensions in the region. Also, the rise of Islamism in the Middle East during the past few decades helped further drain the region of its native Christian populations.|$|E

This crisis {{highlights}} {{the need to}} explain the following questions: What {{is the relationship between}} refugee law and <b>immigration</b> <b>policy?</b> How much <b>immigration</b> do States need to tolerate for moral and practical reasons even if they do not wish any immigration? The general legal principle of necessity offers a useful theoretical basis for refugee law. Necessity explains the conditions under which it would be unfair to fight off unwanted immigrants by deportation and punishment. Necessity also explains the conditions under which a <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> is not feasible at a reasonable cost versus desperate individuals. It follows that necessity overrules a <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> and qualifies as a robust explanation of the purpose of a fair refugee policy. This study explores the consequences of the theory of necessity for the interpretation of key concepts of refugee law (persecution, well-founded fear, reasons of persecution, asylum) and concludes that a generous refugee practice can be conceived and logically justified even if a <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> is a political reality...|$|R

40|$|This paper models <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> as {{the outcome}} of {{political}} competition between interest groups representing individuals employed in different sectors. In standard positive theory, <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> results from a low-skilled median voter voting against predominantly low-skilled immigration. In the present paper, in contrast, once trade <b>policies</b> are liberalized, <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>policy</b> results from anti-immigration lobbying by interest groups representing the non-traded sectors. It is shown that this {{is in line with}} empirical regularities from recent episodes of <b>restrictive</b> <b>immigration</b> legislation in the European Union. It is further shown that if governments negotiate bilaterally over trade and migration policy regimes, the equilibrium regime depends (i) on the sequencing of the international negotiation process and (ii) on the set of available trade and migration policy regimes. In particular, the most comprehensive and most welfare-beneficial type of liberalization may be rejected only because a less comprehensive type of liberalization is available.
