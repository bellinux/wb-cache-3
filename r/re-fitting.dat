30|$|We {{intend to}} perform a larger, {{randomised}} controlled study {{in the future to}} either have the ring pessaries fitted using digital assessment or by the Ring Pessary Sizer with follow-up which would include time to fit, number of wasted ring pessaries, and requirement for subsequent <b>re-fittings.</b>|$|R
25|$|The current organ was {{originally}} installed in 1973, {{although it is}} still housed in the old late Victorian organ case. It was rebuilt in 20023, with additions and <b>re-fittings.</b> The current chapel is open to members of all denominations. The current chaplain is Reverend Dr Dominic Keech, who also serves in a pastoral capacity. The Chapel also houses a portrait and a painting of one hand of the Childe of Hale, described in contemporary sources as man of 9 foot 3 inches in height. This recalls {{a visit to the}} College on his return from a visit to London in 1617.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{non-linear}} Finite Element (FE) {{model was}} created and analyzed {{to determine the}} pressure distribution between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket of a transfemoral amputee. This analysis was performed {{in an attempt to}} develop a process allowing healthcare providers and engineers to simulate the fit and comfort of transfemoral prosthetics {{to reduce the number of}} <b>re-fittings</b> needed for the amputees. The analysis considered the effects of interference due to insertion of the limb into the prosthesis, referred to as donning, and also the effects due to the body weight of the amputee. A non-linear finite element static implicit analysis method was utilized. This analysis implemented multiple finite element techniques, including geometric non-linearity due to large deflections, non-linear contacts due to friction between the contact surfaces of the residual limb and the socket, and non-linear hyper-elastic material properties for the residual limb’s soft tissue. This non-linear static analysis was carried out in two time-steps. The first step involved solving the interference fit analysis to study the pre-stresses developed due to the effect of donning. The donning process results in soft tissue displacement to accommodate the internal geometry of the prosthesis. In the second load application time-step, an additional load of half the person’s body weight was applied to the femur. The maximum normal stress (contact pressure) of 84 kPa was observed due to the combined effect of the donning procedure and body weight application, comparable to the studies performed by other researchers. The procedure developed through this work can be used by future researchers and prosthetic designers in understanding how to better design transfemoral prosthesis...|$|R
25|$|With the {{technology}} looking {{like it could}} {{be made into a}} commercial enterprise, Ballard contacted an acquaintance, John Horton, to provide further backing. Horton {{was in the process of}} <b>re-fitting</b> the Ben Franklin (PX-15) in North Vancouver for oil exploration, and Ballard convinced him that their new battery would be a perfect fit. Horton agreed to provide several thousand dollars a month in funding. With this in place, Ballard purchased an abandoned motel in Arizona for $2,000 and set about turning it into a lab.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, Ultra Energy {{operated}} out of {{the same}} hangar where Horton was <b>re-fitting</b> his submarine. By the mid-1970s the refit was complete, with no battery in site, and Horton dropped his support for the battery project. After obtaining some private bridge financing, they won a contract for a non-rechargeable lithium battery with a shelf life of 10 years for the fire detector company, Firenetics. After about a year the battery was ready and production was going to be started in Hong Kong, when, to Ultra's surprise, Firenetics filed for bankruptcy after a long lawsuit with General Electric. Ultra Energy was insolvent.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} the company has indeed seen its ship-related {{workload}} increase slightly. Whilst Harland & Wolff has no involvement in any shipbuilding projects for the foreseeable future, the company is increasingly involved in overhaul, <b>re-fitting</b> and ship repair, {{as well as the}} construction and repair of off-shore equipment such as oil platforms. On 1 February 2011 it was announced that Harland & Wolff had won the contract to refurbish , effectively rekindling its nearly 150-year association with the White Star Line. Structural steel work on the ship began on 10 February 2011 and was completed in time for the 2012 Belfast Titanic Festival. In July 2012 Harland & Wolff was to carry out the dry docking and service of the Husky Oil SeaRose FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) vessel.|$|E
25|$|In 1590 Drake and Hawkins {{founded a}} charity for {{the relief of}} sick and elderly mariners. In 1592, they founded a {{hospital}} to care for mariners, and a second in 1594 in Chatham; the hospital was named for Hawkins. The charity continues today, and {{the terms of the}} Elizabethan charter have been broadened. Almshouse accommodation in High Street Chatham on the border with Rochester may be granted by the Governors to a needy or disabled man or woman who has served in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, WRNS, Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service, or who has been employed in the Royal Dockyards in the construction, repair, maintenance or <b>re-fitting</b> of RN vessels. Under the broader charter, persons who served in the Merchant Navy, the Army, or the Royal Air Force, or who saw active service in the Reserve Forces, may apply. The spouses or dependents of those named above may also be considered.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{successful}} use of modified N15 components to rebuild Nos.E448E457, the mechanically similar [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] proved disappointing when put into service from May 1925. The performance of those {{allocated to the}} Eastern section was indifferent, and failed to improve upon the double-headed ex-SECR 4-4-0s they were to replace. Reports of poor steaming and hot driving and tender wheel axleboxes were common from crewmen and shed fitters. After investigation, the problems were attributed to poor workmanship during construction as the North British Locomotive Company underquoted production costs to gain the contract. [...] Defects were found in boiler construction across the batch, and necessitated six replacement boilers, re-riveting, <b>re-fitting</b> of tubes and replacement of firebox stays. The hot driving wheel axleboxes were caused by the main frames being out of alignment. A 1926 report suggested that all affected locomotives {{should be taken to}} Eastleigh for repair. Once repaired, the [...] "Scotch Arthurs" [...] proved as capable {{as the rest of the}} class in service.|$|E
2500|$|The third SS Empress of China was a 21,860-ton vessel {{launched}} in 1913 from Stettin, Germany, as the SS Tirpitz. [...] The ship was purchased in 1921 by Canadian Pacific and curiously, this ship was immediately renamed the Empress of China. [...] Then next year, in 1922, {{the ship was}} renamed Empress of Australia after <b>re-fitting</b> at Clydebank. [...] The ship was ultimately scrapped in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|Captain the Honorable Robert Cavendish Spencer took {{command of}} Owen Glendower in August 1819. He {{brought with him}} nearly all the {{officers}} and 18 young gentlemen from his previous command, [...] Owen Glendower was nominally ready for sea, but Spencer found the reality less compelling. He therefore spent {{two and a half}} months re-rigging and <b>re-fitting.</b> He also discharged about a fifth of his crew and lost about the same proportion to sickness and desertion.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a picture}} of about 1717, {{it can be seen}} in a rural setting some miles outside the (much smaller) city of London, lined with trees on three sides (to act as windbreaks) and with the Russell family's mansion {{situated}} at the western end. Unlike the later docks, it was not built with cargo traffic in mind; it did not have walls, warehouses or other commercial facilities. Instead, it was promoted as being capable of accommodating ships [...] "without the trouble of shifting, mooring or unmooring any in the dock for taking in or out any other". It was essentially a <b>re-fitting</b> base where ships could be repaired and berthed in a sheltered anchorage. It was aided in this regard by its proximity to the dockyards at Deptford.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>re-fitting</b> {{with the}} Austro-Daimler engine it was {{delivered}} to the Royal Flying Corps on 30 November 1912, being issued to No. 4 Squadron in December that year. [...] The second Cody V flew in January 1913, and was delivered in February. [...] On 28 April 1913, the first prototype broke up in mid-air and the aircraft crashed, killing the pilot. [...] The resulting investigation discovered that the aircraft's structure, which incorporated many parts from the 1911 Circuit of Britain aircraft, had deteriorated badly and was in [...] "precarious" [...] condition {{by the time of}} the crash. [...] The second aircraft, which was awaiting repair of damage that had been received in an accident in March, was never flown again, and in November that year it was given to the Science Museum, London, where it is displayed today.|$|E
2500|$|The brigade {{received}} {{orders to}} return to Amirya for <b>re-fitting</b> and reached Fuka on 27 June. On 30 June the Brigade was ordered to hand over 50 per cent of its vehicles to the Eighth Army and the brigade was dispersed in July, for the defence of the Delta, then to perform guard duties. The brigade was reformed in August, minus the 2nd Field Regiment and travelled to Sahneh in Iran via Baghdad, returning to the command of the 31st Indian Armoured Division where it remained until late November, then moved to Shaibah, [...] from Basra. In January 1943, the cavalry regiments returned to India and the brigade was reconstituted as the 43rd Indian Infantry Brigade (Lorried) at Shaibah. The cavalry regiments were replaced by the 2nd Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles, 2nd Battalion, 8th Gurkha Rifles and the 2nd Battalion, 10th Gurkha Rifles.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{was working}} on <b>re-fitting</b> a houseboat, when he met drummer Phil Taylor. Taylor had {{recently}} joined Motörhead and introduced Clarke to Lemmy; {{it was not long}} before he was playing with them. In the early days Eddie rehearsed with Motörhead at Snobs Rehearsal Studios, part of a converted brewery on the corner of Kings Road and Lots Road, Chelsea, known as the [...] "Furniture Cave" [...] before going on the road. Motörhead became more popular and produced more and more UK chart successes. The threesome (Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor) are considered the classic Motörhead line-up and have the Motörhead, Overkill, Ace of Spades, Bomber, No Sleep 'til Hammersmith and Iron Fist albums plus a string of hit singles to their credit. He performed a lead vocal on five Motörhead songs: [...] "Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers" [...] (on which he traded vocals with Lemmy), [...] "I'm Your Witchdoctor" [...] (on which he duets vocals with Lemmy), [...] "Step Down" [...] and an alternative version of [...] "Stone Dead Forever" [...] (which later appeared on the Bomber Deluxe Edition), and [...] "Emergency" [...] one of the B-side tracks on The St. Valentine's Day Massacre EP, upon which they performed [...] "Please Don't Touch", with Girlschool, under the combined band names of HeadGirl.|$|E

6000|$|But whereas Ronsard's {{followers}} {{suppose that}} when AEneas had buried his father he set sail immediately for Italy (though the tempest drove {{him on the}} coast of Carthage), Segrais will by no means allow that supposition, but thinks it much more probable that he remained in Sicily till the midst of July or the beginning of August, at which time he places the first appearance of his hero on the sea, and there opens the action of the poem. From which beginning, to the death of Turnus, which concludes the action, there need not be supposed above ten months of intermediate time; for arriving at Carthage in the latter end of summer, staying there the winter following, departing thence in {{the very beginning of the}} spring, making a short abode in Sicily the second time, landing in Italy, and making the war, may be reasonably judged the business but of ten months. To this the Ronsardians reply that, having been for seven years before in quest of Italy, and having no more to do in Sicily than to inter his father--after that office was performed, what remained for him but without delay to pursue his first adventure? To which Segrais answers that the obsequies of his father, according to the rites of the Greeks and Romans, would detain him for many days; that a longer time must be taken up in the <b>re-fitting</b> of his ships after so tedious a voyage, and in refreshing his weather- beaten soldiers on a friendly coast. These indeed are but suppositions on both sides, yet those of Segrais seem better grounded; for the feast of Dido, when she entertained AEneas first, has the appearance of a summer's night, which seems already almost ended, when he begins his story. Therefore the love was made in autumn; the hunting followed properly, when the heats of that scorching country were declining. The winter was passed in jollity, as the season and their love required; and he left her in the latter end of winter, as is already proved. This opinion is fortified by the arrival of AEneas at the mouth of Tiber, which marks the season of the spring, that season being perfectly described by the singing of the birds saluting the dawn, and by the beauty of the place, which the poet seems to have painted expressly in the seventh AEneid:- ...|$|E
