The literacy campaign was successful, with near-universal literacy being achieved by the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{conquest of}} Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete. Roman rule lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest {{are the most}} widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era, because of the spirited, but {{ultimately}} unsuccessful, defence of their homelands by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices. Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales, east of the Gower Peninsula, {{where there is a}} legacy of <b>Romanisation.</b> The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent, is in south east Wales. Both Caerwent and Carmarthen, also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates. Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold, copper and lead, as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver. Roman economic development was concentrated in south-eastern Britain, and no significant industries located in Wales. This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Although Latin became the official language of Wales, the people tended to continue to speak in Brythonic. While <b>Romanisation</b> was far from complete, the upper classes of Wales began to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity, which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4thcentury, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313.|$|E

50|$|Hamsa {{may be a}} {{religious}} pun or allegory with a philosophical meaning. One such etymology suggests that the words 'aham' and 'sa' are joined to become 'hamsa'; aham is 'I' or 'me' and sa is 'he', together meaning 'I am he'. Here, 'I' refers to the jivatma or jivatama, the living soul, and 'he' the paramatma or paramatama or supreme soul (the alternative spellings are due to differing <b>Romanisations</b> of the Sanskrit words). This relationship reflects of Advaita philosophy, which advocates the oneness of jivatma and paramatma. The word aham is common to many Eastern religions. From aham is derived ahamkara or ego.|$|R
50|$|Korean surnames, when Cyrillized, may be spelled {{slightly}} {{differently from}} the <b>romanisations</b> used in the US; the resulting common pronunciations also differ, {{as can be seen}} in the table at right. Furthermore, Korean naming practices and Russian naming practices conflict in several important ways. While most members of the older generations of Sakhalin Koreans used Korean names, members of the younger generations favor their Russian names. However, with the increasing exposure to South Korean pop culture, some younger Koreans have named their children after characters in Korean television dramas. The use of patronymics is not widespread.|$|R
5000|$|Especially {{people from}} the Asian world face the problem that Westerners cannot write postal {{addresses}} in Asian scripts. Though work-arounds exist (such as writing the address using a romanization), these are error-prone and slow down the postal delivery, due to two reasons:(1) <b>Romanisations</b> of Chinese, Japanese, Thai etc. contains ambiguities, thus, a romanised address cannot be re-translated into the original language.(2) The postmen in the destination countries {{are not used to}} recognise addresses written in a foreign (Latin) alphabet. (The situation can be compared to a US-American mailman who has to decipher an address written in Chinese transcription.) ...|$|R
25|$|The ancient {{languages}} {{of these people}} became extinct, and their cultural influence highly reduced, after the repeated invasions of the Balkans by Celts, Huns, Goths, and Sarmatians, accompanied by persistent hellenization, <b>romanisation</b> and later slavicisation. Therefore, {{in the study of}} the toponomy of Dacia, one must take account of the fact that some place-names were taken by the Slavs from as yet unromanised Dacians. A number of Dacian words are preserved in ancient sources, amounting to about 1150 anthroponyms and 900 toponyms, and in Discorides some of the rich plant lore of the Dacians is preserved along with the names of 42 medicinal plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the principate lead to few new buildings, mostly temples for the imperial cult or to Roman deities, e.g. the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek. Although new temples to Greek deities still continued to be constructed, e.g. the Tychaion at Selge they tend to follow the canonical forms of the developing Roman imperial style of architecture or to maintain local non-Greek idiosyncrasies, like the temples in Petra or Palmyra. The increasing <b>romanisation</b> of the east entailed the end of Greek temple architecture, although work continued on the completion of unfinished large structures like the temple of Apollo at Didyma or the Olympieion at Athens into the later 2nd century AD.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March 1945 young king Norodom Sihanouk proclaimed an {{independent}} Kingdom of Kampuchea, following a formal request by the Japanese. Shortly thereafter the Japanese government nominally ratified {{the independence of}} Cambodia and established a consulate in Phnom Penh. On 13 March king Sihanouk changed the official name {{of the country in}} French from Cambodge to Kampuchea. The new government did away with the <b>romanisation</b> of the Khmer language that the French colonial administration was beginning to enforce and officially reinstated the Khmer script. This measure taken by the short-lived governmental authority would be popular and long-lasting, for since then no government in Cambodia has tried to romanise the Khmer language again.|$|E

Some surnames of Koryo-saram have a particle [...] "gai" [...] added to them, such as Kogai or Nogai. The origin of this is unclear.The introduction of international passports by newly independent CIS countries, resulted in further differences in pronunciation as Korean surnames had to be transliterated from Cyrillic into Latin. In addition to a surname, Koreans also use clan names (known as Bon-gwan in Korea {{and pronounced}} as пой among koryo saram) denoting the place of origin.|$|R
2500|$|Balhae {{was founded}} in 698 under the name 震, {{transcribed}} as Jin and Zhen in Korean and Chinese <b>romanisations.</b> Jin is the modern Revised Romanization of Korean , {{the same as the}} earlier Jin state. However, the kingdom's name was written as [...] in Chinese character, with the reconstructed Old Chinese pronunciation [...] and the Middle Chinese pronunciation dzyin; KingGo's state wrote its name as , with the Middle Chinese pronunciation tsyin. The former state's character referred to the 5th Earthly Branch of the Chinese zodiac, a division of the orbit of Jupiter identified with the dragon. This was associated with a bearing of 120° (between ESE and SE) but also with the two-hour period between 7 and 9am, leading it to be associated with dawn and the direction east.|$|R
25|$|The Romans unified {{the people}} of the coast and {{interior}} under a common power; Roman settlers in Malaca exploited the local natural resources and introduced Latin as the language of the ruling classes, establishing new manners and customs that gradually changed the culture of the native people. Malaca was integrated into the Roman Republic as part of Hispania Ulterior, but <b>Romanisation</b> seems to have progressed slowly, as indicated by the discovery of inscriptions dating to the 1st century AD written in the Phoenician alphabet. During this period the Municipium Malacitanum became a transit point on the Via Herculea, which revitalised the city both economically and culturally by connecting it with other developed enclaves in the interior of Hispania and with other ports of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
