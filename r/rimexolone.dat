50|$|<b>Rimexolone</b> is used {{to treat}} {{inflammation}} after eye surgery, to treat anterior uveitis, conjunctivitis and keratitis.|$|E
5000|$|Low-dosage steroidal eye-drops, such as prednisone, fluorometholone, {{loteprednol}} (Lotemax 0.5%) or <b>rimexolone.</b> Steroidal drops {{should be}} used with caution and the eye pressure should be regularly checked during treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rimexolone</b> is a {{glucocorticoid}} steroid used {{to treat}} inflammation in the eye. It is marketed as a 1% eye drop suspension under the trade name Vexol by Alcon Laboratories, but was discontinued in the US and other countries.|$|E
50|$|A {{small amount}} of <b>rimexolone</b> is absorbed into the {{systemic}} circulation. On hourly treatment with the eye drops for a week, blood serum concentrations peaked at 150 pg/ml on average, with many patients remaining below the detection threshold of 80 pg/ml. The elimination half-life from the circulation is estimated at one to two hours; the substance is mainly (over 80%) excreted via the faeces.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{synthetic}} route to <b>rimexolone,</b> a corticosteroid {{for treatment of}} ocular inflammation without significant elevation of intraocular pressure, was described. An investigation has been undertaken of the microbial transformation of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-dimethyl- 17 beta-(1 -oxopropyl) androsta- 1, 4 -dien- 3 -one by microorganisms known to hydroxylate conventional steroids, using Curvularia lunata AS 3. 4381 gave <b>rimexolone,</b> the product of 11 beta-hydroxylation, respectively. The target compound was characterized with reference substance <b>rimexolone</b> by TLC, HPLC, elemental analysis, MS, IR, and NMR. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|In July 2009, {{the patient}} {{underwent}} an uneventful repeat PKP OS. On postoperative day 7, the corneal epithelium was healed, {{and the patient}} was discharged on a tapering dose of topical corticosteroids (prednisolone eye drops eight times a day, ofloxacin eye drops {{four times a day}} for a week, dexpanthenol eye gel five times a day). BCVA was 09 / 10 OD and 1 / 20 OS. IOP was 17 mmHg OD and 16 mmHg OS. Follow-up examination was planned in 8 weeks. After 2 weeks, the patient was referred to our emergency clinic with elevation of the IOP OS. IOP was 19 mmHg OD and 31 mmHg OS. Under topical therapy, the IOP was normalized, and upon suspicion of steroid response, the patient was discharged with <b>rimexolone</b> eye drops four times a day, dexpanthenol five times a day and a fixed combination of brimonidine/timolol two times a day. BCVA was 9 / 10 OD and 4 / 10 OS.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:To {{demonstrate}} {{the effect of}} topical heparin combined with topical steroid on corneal neovascularization (CN) in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Four children (5 eyes) with new-onset progressive CN {{in at least one}} eye received topical <b>rimexolone</b> or dexamethasone in combination with heparin until complete regression of CN was obtained. The regression of CN was documented by slit-lamp or anterior segment photography. RESULTS:All 5 eyes showed complete regression of CN within 5 months. An anti-angiogenic effect was found as early as 1 week after starting topical combination treatment. No ocular and systemic side effects were detected and treatment was well tolerated by all children. In the 3 eyes with involvement of the optical axis, symmetrical visual acuity was obtained by amblyopia treatment. Recurrence of the CN was detectable in 2 eyes at 1 and 6 months, respectively, after ending combination therapy. Both eyes responded favorably to re-treatment. CONCLUSION:Combination of topical heparin and steroid leads to rapid regression and complete inactivity of CN. This therapeutic approach is promising, especially in children with limited therapeutic alternatives and a high risk for amblyopia...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of topical corticosteroids as ocular anti-inflammatory agents following cataract surgery is well-documented. They {{also help to}} prevent a number of complications associated with post-operative ocular inflammation, including corneal edema and cystoid macular edema. However, topical corticosteroids are associated with side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Indeed, corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension {{and the potential for}} steroid-induced glaucoma remain the leading drawbacks of topical corticosteroid therapy. Some individuals are known to experience a high degree of IOP elevation with low doses or short durations of treatment with topical corticosteroids. Careful monitoring of IOP in such individuals is essential. Few randomized, controlled studies are available on the comparative safety and {{efficacy of}} common topical corticosteroids in the treatment of post-operative ocular inflammation. Furthermore, the lack of consistent reporting criteria for clinically significant IOP increases across clinical studies makes meaningful comparisons among corticosteroids difficult. This review aims to examine data from available published studies, including studies in steroid responders, to determine whether topical corticosteroids are the same in terms of their effect on IOP. Early generation corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and prednisolone, are more likely to result in clinically significant increases in IOP. Newer corticosteroids, such as <b>rimexolone</b> and the retro-metabolically designed corticosteroid, loteprednol etabonate, offer similar anti-inflammatory efficacy to olde...|$|E
40|$|Background/aim To {{determine}} if overexpression of the glaucoma gene MYOC {{is involved in}} the development of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and if its promoter variants are associated with glaucoma in the Korean population. Methods Human trabecular meshwork cells were cultured in the presence of ophthalmic steroids such as fluorometholone, fluorometholone acetate, dexamethasone, prednisolone acetate and <b>rimexolone.</b> The cells were cultured at a hydrostatic pressure of 32 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure and induction of MYOC was evaluated by northern blot analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples obtained from 74 normal controls and 168 unrelated Korean patients with OAG, including primary OAG, normal tension glaucoma and steroid-induced glaucoma. A 461 base pair (bp) DNA fragment of the MYOC promoter region was amplified using PCR and its genotype was analysed by directly sequencing the product. Results The potencies of steroid eye drops in MYOC induction in vitro was the same regardless of their potential for elevating intraocular pressure in vivo. Hydrostatic pressure had no effect on MYOC induction. A dinucleotide repeat polymorphism and three single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, but no obvious differences in the genotype distribution and allele frequency of the variants between the control group and any type of OAG were observed. Conclusion Our data suggest that MYOC overexpression is not a cause or an effect of intraocular pressure elevation and that MYOC itself is not associated with OAG...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Topical {{corticosteroids}} {{are routinely}} used as postoperative ocular anti-inflammatory drugs; how-ever, adverse effects such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP) are observed with their use. While older corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and predniso-lone acetate offer good anti-inflammatory efficacy, clinically {{significant increases in}} IOP (C 10 mmHg) are often associated with their use. Loteprednol eta-bonate, a novel C- 20 ester-based corticosteroid, was retrometabolically designed to offer potent anti-inflammatory efficacy but with decreased impact on IOP. After exerting its therapeutic effects {{on the site of}} action, loteprednol etabonate is rapidly converted to inactive metabolites, resulting in fewer adverse effects. Randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0. 5 % for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in post-cataract patients with few patients, if any, exhibiting clinically signif-icant increases (C 10 mmHg) in IOP. Furthermore, safety studies demonstrated a minimal effect of loteprednol etabonate on IOP with long-term use or in steroid responders with a much lower propensity to increase IOP relative to prednisolone acetate or dexamethasone. The anti-inflammatory treatment effect of loteprednol etabonate appears to be similar to that of <b>rimexolone</b> and difluprednate with less impact on IOP compared to difluprednate, although confirmatory comparative studies are needed. The available clinical data suggest that loteprednol etabon-ate is an efficacious and safe corticosteroid for the treatment of postoperative inflammation...|$|E
