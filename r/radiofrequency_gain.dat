The <b>radiofrequency</b> <b>gain</b> and 1 dB compression {{point of the}} link are both simulated with a modelling approach and compared to measurements. The electrical model of the electro-optic transducer, a distributed feedback laser, is first presented. Taking into account the nonlinearities and noise sources, it is developed on the commercial electrical software Advanced Design System. Owing to this accurate model, {{the impact of the}} relaxation oscillation frequency is presented on the system nonlinearity characteristic as for example the input 1 dB compression point. The comparison of simulated results to measured ones confirms the accuracy of this model...|$|E
40|$|Shrinkage of the {{elongated}} {{anterior cruciate}} ligament (ACL) using <b>radiofrequency</b> (RF) energy <b>gains</b> more and more interest as an alternative method for ACL reconstruction. Although {{there have been a}} few clinical studies on the outcome and complications of RF shrinkage of the elongated ACL, there is a substantial lack of in vivo basic science studies to evaluate the mechanical and histologic changes of such treated tissue. Therfore the aim of the present study was to analyse the biological response of the thermal stimulated collagen tissue using histological and immunohistological techniques. Furthermore we wanted to clarify if the elongated and RF treated ACL reaches the histological and biomechanical properties of the native ACL and is comparable with the properties of an ACL graft after 6 month. 16 female merino sheep received a lift of the tibial ACL insertion site to simulate chronic ACL elongation. Two groups were divided. Group A obtained no further treatment, wereas in group B the elongated ACL was shrunken by RF energy. A descriptive analysis after RF treatment of the native ACL at time zero showed no more regular collagen pattern. Regions which were directly exposed to RF energy suffered complete cell destruction. It showed the typical outcome of a necrosis with karyorrhexis and karyopyknosis of fibroblasts as well as hyalinization of the collagen tissue. After 6 month group B showed a significant increased cellularity in comparison to the group A and the native ACL. In addition the vascular density of the subsynovial and intermediate region of the RF treated tissue was increased by trend compared to the native ACL. Nevertheless we were able to demonstrate a constant higher vascular density in the anterior regions of group B (which were in direct contact with the RF probe) in comparison to the native ACL. Furthermore the RF treated ACL (group B) could not reach the biomechanical properties of the native ACL after 6 month. It showed a significant lower ultimate load and stiffness and a significant increased AP-laxity compared to the native ACL. The histological analysis of group B demonstrated an intensive tissue repopulation and - reorganisation which could give a reasonable explanation for the biomechanical findings. The present study could demonstrate that the process of regeneration of the elongated and RF treated ACL is not terminated after 6 month in opposite to an ACL graft. Moreover the histomorphological as well as the biomechanical properties of the native ACL were not reached. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that strong caution is needed during the time of rehabilitation, considering the impaired ligamentous structure...|$|R
