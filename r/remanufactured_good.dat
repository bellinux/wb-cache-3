40|$|AbstractRemanufacturing {{represents}} a well-suited approach {{for sustainable development}} in environmental, economic and social dimensions. Product-service systems (PSS) {{are among the most}} important enabler for remanufacturing. Companies that remain owner of a product have an intrinsic motivation to design goods for longer lifecycles considering the possibility of remanufacturing the product or its parts after each use phase. In addition, as the end customer only uses the goods without having its ownership, the acceptance – and consequently the demand – for <b>remanufactured</b> <b>goods</b> is significantly improved. This paper presents guidelines for the definition of innovative business models for remanufacturing, utilizing both remanufacturing and PSS characteristics, and permitting the dissemination of knowledge needed for successful implementation within a company strategy and operations model. Focusing on industrial PSS, an illustrative application of the guidelines is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of interchangeable parts was without doubt the cornerstone to the industrialization era entry gate. Interchangeable parts {{is a simple}} but effective concept that fundamentally shaped the access to commodities that smooth our daily living, by enabling large scale manufacture of reliable and cheap products. Such concept was largely exploited on new product designs over particular industrial sectors only, but {{to a lesser extent}} on <b>remanufactured</b> <b>goods</b> from parts that originate from many different industries. This paper explores and develops further the link between the design of interchangeable parts and the remanufacturing strategy, aiming at developing standards for cross-sector product remanufacture. Such a strategy encompasses a number of economic and environmental benefits that accrue from a wider reuse of end-of-life products, i. e. manufacturing processes energy related savings, raw materials savings, lower GHG emissions and an overall decline on the quantity of waste generated...|$|R

This paper presents a theoretical model of remanufacturing where a duopoly of original manufacturers produce a component of a final good. The component needing to be replaced creates an aftermarket. An environmental regulation assessing a minimum level of remanufacturability is also introduced. The main results indicate that a social planner could use collusion of the firms on the level of remanufacturability as a substitute for environmental regulation.

40|$|We {{develop and}} analyze an {{economic}} model of remanufacturing to address two main research questions. First, we explore which market, cost, and product type conditions induce a profit-maximizing firm to be a remanufacturer, given a separate (secondary) <b>remanufactured</b> <b>goods</b> market. Such markets exist for consumer goods, where "newness" is a differentiating factor. Second, we describe what effect profitable remanufacturing {{has on the}} environment. Our stylized modeling framework for analyzing these issues incorporates three components: lease contracting, product design, and remanufacturing volume. To operationalize this framework, we model and solve for the optimal decisions of two firm types: a non-remanufacturer, which we call a traditional firm, and a remanufacturer, which we call a green firm. We describe conditions under which remanufacturing is (and is not) profitable, and demonstrate that under certain cost and market conditions remanufacturing has negative consequences for the environment. Our results have implications for firms and policy makers {{who would like to}} choose remanufacturing as a strategy to improve profitability and environmental performance, given the existence of conditions under which neither might occur...|$|R
40|$|Remanufacturing of {{returned}} products {{has been}} increasingly recognized in industries {{as an effective}} approach to face environmental responsibility, government regulations, and increased awareness of consumers. In this paper, we address a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) in which the manufacturer produces the brand-new products, {{as well as the}} <b>remanufactured</b> <b>goods</b> while the retailer sells these products to customers. We consider several different scenarios: the manufacturer and the retailer adopt a steady-state price or a dynamic price with reference quality effects in a centralized case; either, neither or both the manufacturer and the retailer price dynamically with reference quality effects, respectively, in a decentralized model. We solve the problem with the retailer recycling the sold copies and deduce the optimal pricing strategies while the manufacturer in charge of recovering the used items in such a CLSC. The result shows that dynamic pricing strategies are much more profitable for the supply chain and its members when compared with pricing statically; the dynamic pricing strategies with time-varying quality characterized by reference quality are more suited to a long-term and cooperative closed-loop supply chain. Moreover, the optimal recycling fraction relies on the recovery cost coefficient and proves to be uniform despite adopting a dynamic price and quality in all distinct cases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 6 R's of {{sustainability}} are implemented {{to the life}} cycle of a washing machine, refrigerator and air-conditioner in a Western Australian scenario. A detailed life cycle assessment of each white good was carried out and new scenarios 1, 2 and 3, increasing the combined reuse and remanufacturing rate to 80 %, 50 % and 30 % were implemented. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 will save 2487. 1, 2057. 5 and 1772. 2 tonnes of material from washing machines and 1594. 5, 1044. 7 and 739. 9 tonnes from refrigerators respectively. The mass saved implementing 100 % recycle rate to air-conditioners is 450. 1 tonnes. GHG emissions saved from remanufacturing a washing machine and refrigerator instead of producing a new model are 956. 2 and 1636. 3 kg CO 2 -e respectively. The embodied energy saved from remanufacturing and recycling washing machines for scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are 482. 7 x 10 ^ 6, 254. 0 x 10 ^ 6 and 101. 5 x 10 ^ 6 MJ and for refrigerators are 566. 3 x 10 ^ 6, 250. 8 x 10 ^ 6 and 42. 29 x 10 ^ 6 MJ respectively.

40|$|Remanufacturing {{is a form}} of {{recycling}} where used durable goods are refurbished to a condition comparable to new products. With reduced energy and resource consumption, <b>remanufactured</b> <b>goods</b> are produced {{at a fraction of the}} original cost and with lower emissions of pollution.

This paper presents a theoretical model of remanufacturing where a duopoly of original manufacturers produces a component of a …nal good. In this primary market, competition à la Bertrand with threat of entry keeps prices at the minimal production costs. The speci…c component needing to be replaced during the lifetime of the …nal good creates an aftermarket where remanufacturing activities substitute perfectly new good productions. Consumers generally prefer to purchase a replacement product remanufactured by the original manufacturers, but would consider the services of independent remanufacturers as an alternative. The market segmentation brings pro…t opportunities to the original manufacturers that can engender investments in remanufacturable original products. An environmental regulation that constrains a minimum level of remanufacturability supports an increase in the original product price. Therefore, if original manufacturers can reach new margins by increasing their remanufacturing activities, they would cooperate to the application of such a regulation. The main result coincides with the Porter Hypothesis which stipulates that industries respecting environmental regulations can see their pro…ts increase...|$|R
40|$|M. Phil. (Engineering Management) Abstract: Remanufacturing is {{gradually}} becoming a key practice as countries seek sustainable means {{to reduce their}} carbon footprint and achieve zero landfills in their society. However, remanufacturing {{is not without its}} challenges. This study seeks to determine the relevant key performance indicators, drivers of and barriers to remanufacturing, as well as ways to encourage remanufacturing, the benefits of remanufacturing and ways to mitigate the barriers that could hinder the development of remanufacturing in Nigeria. The data used in this research was derived from both primary and secondary sources. The secondary data was collected via detailed review of related literature. The primary data was collected through a questionnaire which was distributed to engineering professionals based in the manufacturing and heavy industry sectors. Ninety-eight (98) questionnaires were received from one hundred and twenty (120) sent out, representing an 82 per cent response rate. Findings from the research were analysed, using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. From the descriptive analysis it was found that government regulations, the availability of technical skilled workers, the availability of parts, general standards for remanufacturing, and customer awareness are revealed to be the respondents’ top choice of key performance indicators. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the barriers for remanufacturing are a lack of infrastructure to support remanufacturing, a lack of original equipment manufacturers’ participation, the threat of counterfeit products, unorganized remanufacturing sector, and the fear that <b>remanufactured</b> <b>goods</b> would be sold as new, among others. In addition, the drivers of remanufacturing were found to be the creation of job opportunities, achieving of low carbon footprints, reduction of greenhouse emissions, achieving zero landfill reduction, improving profitability and conservation of natural resources according to the respondents. The study further revealed that the benefits of remanufacturing to the Nigerian economy include the development of an industrial base, industrialisation to rural areas, boosting of export trade and the conservation of natural resources as important benefits of remanufacturing to the Nigerian economy. Likewise, regarding ways to encourage remanufacturing in Nigeria, it was revealed that the development of take-back schemes, implementing of landfill, bans of end-of-life products, a clear definition of remanufacturing, and non-stringent legislation by government on remanufacturing are very important to encourage remanufacturing in Nigeria. Finally, creating awareness, establishing buy-in when purchasing products, and setting up policies for sustainability standards were [...] ...|$|R

Chapter 2 : Transboundary movements of waste: In a stylized model of international trade, a monopolist in the North exports second-hand products to a representative firm in the South to be reused as intermediate goods, with potential trade gains. The degree of reusability of waste products is a crucial choice variable in the North. This is because with a lack of international vigilance, non-reusable waste can be mixed illegally with the reusable waste. I explore the driving forces for the movement of illegal waste, paying particular attention to the role of local waste regulations, such as the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive. Under mild conditions, it is shown that increased regulation stringency in the North leads its firm to reduce the degree of reusability of its products. As a result, the flow of non-reusable waste to the South increases, providing another channel for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. Chapter 3 : Is Democracy good for the environment? The role of private mitigation efforts: We study the question posed in the title in the context of open economies where trade and welfare depend on the extent to which regulation permits the environment to be used as an input in production, and where individuals may privately mitigate the consequences of pollution at a cost. Governments may also manage the openness of the economy to trade directly as well as indirectly via environmental regulation. In this framework, we compare the degree of regulatory stringency and the level of pollution that emerge in the equilibria of a set of political regimes that range from autocratic to fully competitive or democratic. The answer to the question is not straightforward in this investigation because many well-off-citizens in democratic countries may prefer the higher gross incomes that come with freer trade and unregulated production...|$|R
