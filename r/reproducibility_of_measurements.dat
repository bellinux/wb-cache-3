Methods: A custom designed system was constructed for the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> oxygen uptake from an anaesthetic breathing system using indirect calorimetry {{based on the}} Haldane transformation. In a series of 42 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery in the pre-cardiopulmonary bypass period, two reverse Fick measurements were made using bolus thermodilution and paired arterial and mixed venous blood sampling. Simultaneous <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> oxygen uptake by the Haldane-based method were made.

40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> the retardation values (change in polarisation) obtained with the scanning laser polarimeter {{in a series}} of normal subjects and glaucoma patients. To improve the analysis of the raw data by devising and evaluating a blood vessel removal algorithm.  METHODS—Scanning laser polarimetry was performed on 10  normal subjects and 10  glaucoma patients. A series of six images was obtained from each eye. The normal subjects were re-imaged 3  months after their initial assessment. The retardation values obtained from each eye were analysed using the authors' own methods, including the use of an algorithm to remove blood vessels from the polar profiles. The <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> these <b>measurements</b> and the performance of the blood vessel removal algorithm were assessed.  RESULTS—The "individual point" coefficient of variation was approximately 12. 5 % for normal subjects and 17. 0 % for glaucoma patients. The "integral" coefficient of variation for these groups was approximately 5. 5 % and 9. 5 % respectively. The <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measurements</b> did not improve with an increased number <b>of</b> <b>measurements.</b> There was no difference in the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measurements</b> in normal subjects over time. The blood vessel removal algorithm improved the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measurements</b> when the shape of the profile was assessed.  CONCLUSION—The intraoperator <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> retardation values obtained with the scanning laser polarimeter is satisfactory for its use as a clinical tool. The use of a blood vessel removal algorithm improves the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measurements</b> and also assists the clinician in the interpretation of the polar profiles.

A comparison was made between RECIST readings without dedicated application vs. readings using dedicated software (Myrian® XL-Onco, Intrasense, France) with specific functionalities such as 3 D elastic target matching and automated calculation of tumoral response. A retrospective database of 40 patients who underwent a CT scan follow up was used (thoracic/abdominal lesions). The reading panel was composed of two radiologists. Reading times, intra/inter-operator <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> and RECIST response misclassifications were evaluated.

Inter-observer agreement did not vary with the method of image acquisition of arterial angiograms, but was dependent {{on the quality of}} visualization of the stenosis: kappa = 0. 73 (0. 67 - 0. 79) for good quality angiograms vs. 0. 54 (0. 44 - 0. 64) for poor quality angiograms. Inter-observer agreement for assessment of plaque surface morphology was moderate (kappa 0. 4 - 0. 6) and did not vary with type of angiography or method of image acquisition.

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} a critical overview of {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} (LVH) and structural changes of carotid arteries as surrogate end points for antihypertensive treatments. LVH {{is known to be}} associated with a number of pathophysiologic alterations underlying cardiovascular risk. The quantification of left ventricular mass is feasible and well standardized by echocardiography, even if the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> is still limited. LVH has been clearly demonstrated to be an independent predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and recent data suggest that left ventricular geometric pattern and depressed myocardial function may represent additional risk factors. Although clinical trials have shown that an adequate blood pressure control can be associated with a significant reduction in left ventricular mass, the prognostic impact of LVH regression is still debated. Serial measurements of the carotid artery intima-media complex by B-mode ultrasound have been proposed as an accurate noninvasive approach for the evaluation of progression and regression of the atherosclerotic process over time. The methodology of measurement is not as well standardized as that of LVH, and the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> is too close to the magnitude of structural changes over time. In addition, sounder data are required concerning the pathophysiologic relationship between carotid lesions and clinical events...|$|E

The aim of the present research paper was to assess the inter- and intra-examiner <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of the interproximal {{alveolar bone}} loss on non-manipulated digital radiographs and after the application of image filters. Five Oral Radiologists measured the distance between the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar crest or to the deepest point of the bony defect on 12 interproximal digital radiographs of molars and bicuspids of a dry human skull. The digital manipulation and the linear measurements were obtained with the Trophy Windows software (Throphy®). For each image, six different versions were created: 1) non-manipulated; 2) bright-contrast adjustment; 3) negative; 4) negative with brightness-contrast adjustment; 5) pseudo-colored; 6) pseudo-colored with brightness-contrast adjustment. In order to prevent interpretation bias because of the repetition of measurements, the examiners measured the radiographs in a random sequence. The two-way ANOVA test at 5 % level of significance to compare the means of readings of the same operator with each filter indicated p 0. 05 for all filters. Based on the results, we concluded that linear measurements of interproximal alveolar bone loss on digital radiographs are highly reproducible among examiners.

40|$|Thanks to the {{evolution}} of game controllers (mainly the Kinect™ sensor and the Balance Board™), video games {{are becoming more and more}} popular in physical rehabilitation. Indeed the integration of serious games in rehabilitation has been tested for various pathologies (e. g. brain stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease.). Parallel to this clinical research, a lot of studies have been done in order to validate the use of these game controllers for simple biomechanical evaluation. Currently, it is thus possible to record the motions performed by the patients during serious gaming exercises for later analysis. Therefore, data collected during the exercises could be used for monitoring {{the evolution}} of the patients during long term rehabilitation. Before using the parameters extracted from the games to assess patients' evolution two important aspects must be verified: the <b>reproducibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and a possible effect of learning of the task to be performed.
