40|$|Radio {{interference}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} concerns in using the global positioning system (GPS) for civilian and military applications. Interference signals are produced not only through all electronic systems but also illegal jammers. Among different types of interferences, continuous wave (CW) interference has strong adverse impacts on the quality of the received signal. In this paper, we make more detailed analysis for CW interference effects on GPS signal quality. Based on the C/A code spectrum lines, the influence of CW interference on the acquisition performance of GPS receivers is further analysed. This influence is supported by simulation results using GPS software receiver. As the most important user parameter of GPS receivers, the mathematical expression of bit error probability is also derived in the presence of CW interference, and the expression is consistent with the Monte Carlo simulation results. The research on CW interference provides some theoretical gist and new thoughts on monitoring the <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> <b>environment</b> and improving the anti-jamming ability of GPS receivers...|$|E
40|$|As RFID {{technology}} has been widely adopted, it has been acknowledged that user-specific data, {{as well as a}} unique identifier, carried by RFID tags, can be con-veniently used. The typical user-specific data stored in an RFID tag is sensor data. There is also an industrial demand to include non-sensor data, such as sales records, repair history, etc., as well as sensor data. It is expected, therefore, that the future information system for networked RFID needs to incorporate heterogeneous user-specific data in an RFID tag in a consistent architecture. There are two fundamental challenges to handle such heterogeneous user-specific data in RFID tag. The first one is the establishment of a logical link between the application and the user-specific data in physical memory in a RFID tag. The other is the efficient retrieval of large user-specific data in RFID tag in practical <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> <b>environments.</b> An illustra-tive example of large user-specific data is the retrieval of some kind of logging data in an RFID tag memory. In this thesis, new functions named ”schema resolver ” and ”reader controller ” at middleware layer are introduced to meet these two challenges in a networked RFID system. The schema resolver provides the link between the objec...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to spread F, evidence for field-aligned electron density irregularities is commonly observed on Alouette 2 topside sounder ionograms recorded near perigee (500 km). This evidence {{is provided by}} distinctive signal returns from sounder-generated Z mode waves. At low latitudes these waves become guided in wave ducts caused by field-aligned electron density irregularities and give rise to strong long-duration echoes. At high latitudes, extending well into the polar cap, these Z mode waves (and stimulated electrostatic waves at the plasma frequency) produce a series of vertical bars on the ionogram display as the satellite traverses discrete field-aligned density structures. The <b>radio</b> frequency (RF) <b>noise</b> <b>environment</b> to be expected in the 400 to 500 km altitude region from low to high latitudes was examined by analyzing perigee Alouette 2 topside sounder data. All observed noise bands were scaled on nearly 200 topside sounder ionograms recorded near perigee at low, mid, and high latitude telemetry stations. The minimum and maximum frequencies of each noise band were entered into a data base or compuer analysis. The signals of primary interest in the perigee study {{were found to be}} sounder-generated...|$|R

It is likely that energetic electrons, 10 to 100 Kev, accelerated {{in association with the}} variation of sunspot magnetic fields, are the sources of the radio emissions. A model is considered to explain the relation of burst storms on <b>radio</b> <b>noise.</b> An analysis of the role of energetic electrons on the emissions of both noise continuum and type III burst storms is presented.

40|$|Field {{intensity}} of atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> on 2. 5 Mc/s was measured {{on board the}} "SOYA" along the course from Tokyo to Antarctica. Results of {{the analysis of the}} measurements are summarized as follows: 1) The daytime noise intensity which is predominant in the tropical region and near South Africa corresponds well to the meteorological situation. 2) Atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> intensity measured on board the "SOYA" agrees well with the values predicted on the "Noise Map" prepared by CRPL and with the result of measurement at the fixed stations (Singapore and Pretoria). 3) Characteristics of the atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> were examined in connection with the solar zenith angle and the latitude. Both the mode of diurnal variation and the relation between absorption and solar zenith angle very distinctly with the latitude. 4) Decrease in the intensity at midnight towards the south from about 32 °S is greater than that of the intensity calculated only from the distance (the so-called unabsorbed field intensity) and smaller than what was predicted on the CRPL 2 ̆ 7 s map. 5) Abnormal enhancement of the <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> was seen when the ship went under the pouring rain, while the noise fell down to zero level with a flash of lightning, and then it rose exponentially with the time constant of the order of 1 minute. These facts seem to suggest the mechanism how the atmospheric <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> originates in rain falls.

As the name implies, a riometer measures the [...] "opacity" [...] of the ionosphere to <b>radio</b> <b>noise</b> emanating from cosmic origin. In {{the absence of any}} ionospheric absorption, this <b>radio</b> <b>noise,</b> averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30-40 MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic synchrotron radiation and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.|$|R
