During her {{interview}} with Sue, Couric lists Lohan and her dog Sparky as failed Loser of the Year contenders. In a previous episode, Glee also mocked Lohan's daughter, Lindsay. Porter felt that the jibe diminished Couric's journalistic credibility, deeming the Lohans easy targets. However, Canning called Couric's cameo [...] "perhaps the funniest part of the episode", and de Moraes stated that the best line of the episode comes when Sue [...] "looks Katie Couric <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and says, 'I hate you, Diane Sawyer.' ...|$|E

She was chosen from two hundred actresses for {{the part of a}} government file clerk in Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious (1946) and completed filming in half an hour, but her scenes were cut from the final print. She told Radio Life magazine that year that after having struggled to remember her lines, [...] "Mr. Hitchcock looked me <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and asked 'You {{want to go back to}} radio?' I said yes". Her first onscreen appearance, also uncredited, was in the 1949 film On the Town, as one of two women whom the main characters (played by Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra) encounter while riding the subway.|$|E

"Oh, Huck, how kin you act so, {{when you}} know po' Mars Tom--" [...] Then he let off an awful scream, and flung {{his head and his}} arms back and let off another one, because there was a white glare just then, and he had raised up his face {{just in time to see}} Tom's, as white as snow, rise above the gunnel and look him <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> He thought it was Tom's ghost, you see.|$|E
60|$|Few {{women can}} {{sit in the front}} of a big box, on a crowded and full-swing opera night, without thrilling and dilating. There is an {{intoxication}} in being thus thrust forward, conspicuous and enhanced, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the vast crowd that lines the hollow shell of the auditorium. Thus even Josephine and Julia leaned their elbows and poised their heads regally, looking condescendingly down upon the watchful world. They were two poor women, having nothing to do with society. Half bohemians.|$|E

'Yes,' he said. 'Very good,' I answered, 'I will. You've got so and so.' He fell back as if shot. 'So and so!' he repeated, dazed. I went to the {{sideboard}} and poured him out a drink of such and such. 'Drink this,' I said. He drank it. 'Now,' I said, 'listen to what I say: You've got so and so. There's only one chance,' I said, 'you must limit your eating and drinking to such and such, you must sleep such and such, avoid every form of such and such--I'll give you a cordial, so many drops every so long, but mind you, unless you do so and so, it won't help you.'

6000|$|It took Lord Fawn a {{long time}} to write his letter, but at last he wrote it. The delay must not be taken as {{throwing}} any slur on his character as a correspondent or a man of business, for many irritating causes sprang up sufficient to justify him in pleading that it arose from circumstances beyond his own control. It is, moreover, felt by us all that the time which may fairly be taken in the performance of any task depends, not on the amount of work, but on the performance of it when done. A man is not expected to write a cheque for a couple of thousand pounds as readily as he would one for five,--unless he be a man to whom a couple of thousand pounds is a mere nothing. To Lord Fawn the writing of this letter was everything. He had told Lizzie, with much exactness, what he would put into it. He would again offer his hand,--acknowledging himself bound to do so by his former offer,--but would give reasons why she should not accept it. If anything should occur in the meantime which would, in his opinion, justify him in again repudiating her, he would of course take advantage of such circumstance. If asked himself what was his prevailing motive in all that he did or intended to do, he would have declared that it was above all things necessary that he should [...] "put himself <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the British public." ...|$|E
60|$|He had, indeed, {{put himself}} beyond {{protection}} by vicarious endurance of hammering when {{he promised to}} write to Lady Eustace, explaining his own conduct and giving reasons. Had anything turned up in Scotland Yard which would have justified him in saying,--or even in thinking,--that Lizzie had stolen her own diamonds, he would have sent word {{to her that he}} must abstain from any communication till that matter had been cleared up; but since the appearance of that mysterious paragraph in the newspapers, nothing had been heard of the robbery, and public opinion certainly seemed to be in favour of Lizzie's innocence. He did think that the Eustace faction was betraying him, as he could not but remember how eager Mr. Camperdown had been in asserting that the widow was keeping an enormous amount of property and claiming it as her own, whereas, in truth, she had not the slightest title to it. It was, in a great measure, in consequence of the assertions of the Eustace faction, almost in obedience to their advice, that he had resolved to break off the match; and now they turned upon him, and John Eustace absolutely {{went out of his way}} to write him a letter which was clearly meant to imply that he, Lord Fawn, was bound to marry the woman to whom he had once engaged himself! Lord Fawn felt that he was ill-used, and that a man might have to undergo a great deal of bad treatment who should strive to put himself <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the public.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Broken Heels" [...] was filmed in Los Angeles on 22 and 23 November 2009, as {{confirmed}} by Burke's official Twitter page. It was choreographed by Frank Gatson and JaQuel Knight, who have {{also worked with}} Beyoncé. The music video consists of Burke and several female dancers, who are dressed in [...] "gold leotards with huge football-style shoulder pads and heels." [...] It premiered on UK music video channel The Box 11 December 2009, playing hourly. It received positive reaction from Nick Levine of Digital Spy who noted that: [...] "It's essentially a massive tum-flashing, tush-shaking dance routine set {{in the middle of}} an American football pitch." [...] The video begins with Burke singing into a mirror in a locker room, with a team of female American football players getting ready behind. Interspersed are shots of male players doing the same. The next scene shows the two teams emerging from the stadium tunnels. Burke and the female team then begin a dance routine, which is occasionally interrupted to show shots of Burke in a green-lit tunnel. There is a continuity error in the video. When Alexandra is pictured in the locker room she is wearing #17 on her strip, however when she's outside on the pitch it has changed to #18 - these numbers do mimic the dates of release however, so there is a possibility that the shirt numbers are deliberately supposed to change. Burke said of the video in an interview with Now magazine, [...] "We have taken it up a notch [...] "Bad Boys". It was scary to go that side. We showed a bit of skin but it was fun. I was comfortable with it, though, it was done very tastefully. I wanted to make sure this video was different and I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a load of girls who are, in the press's eyes, perfect. I have some plus-sized girls in there. They are hot too. I had a big diva fit when they told me I was filming the [...] "Broken Heels" [...] video in England. I had a meeting with Simon and threw a right strop.

[...] and I was like [...] "Yes please" [...] and that was that." [...] Burke added that [...] "video is going to show people that no matter what your shape, colour, size, whatever you are, you are still beautiful." ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} 15 years since their {{diplomatic}} normalization China and South Korea (ROK) have improved their bilateral ties {{to such an}} extent that each represents for the other one of the largest, if not the largest, trade and investment partners. China is also perceived as playing an essential role in the ongoing Six-Party Talks over North Korean nuclear issues and other likely major issues on the Korean peninsula. Yet, there also exists a growing yet littlediscussed list of potential problems and issues underlying their otherwise prosperous relationship. Prime examples include the North Korean “refugees” in China, the history of Koguryo, and the longerterm “rise of China”. After identifying principal trends and major developments in China’s post-Cold War relationships with South Korea in particular and with the two Koreas in general this paper examines actual and likely future differences between China and South Korea on a panoply of peninsular and regional issues, including the evolving US-South Korean alliance relationship. Overall, in short, the current state of the Sino-South Korean relationship can be likened to standing <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> of the typhoon without knowing where the shelter is...|$|E
