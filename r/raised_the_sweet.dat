40|$|Several {{authors have}} found that flowers that are warmer than their {{surrounding}} environment have an advantage in attracting pollinators. Bumblebees will forage preferentially on warmer flowers, even if equal nutritional reward is available in cooler flowers. This <b>raises</b> <b>the</b> question of whether warmth and sucrose concentration are processed independently by bees, or whether sweetness detectors respond to higher sugar concentration as well as higher temperature. We find that bumblebees can use lower temperature as a cue to higher sucrose reward, showing that bees appear to process the two parameters strictly independently. Moreover, we demonstrate that sucrose concentration takes precedence over warmth, so that {{when there is a}} difference in sucrose concentration, bees will typically choose <b>the</b> <b>sweeter</b> feeder, even if <b>the</b> less <b>sweet</b> feeder is several degrees warmer...|$|R
