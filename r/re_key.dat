Recent advances in optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurement and analysis have resulted in vast improvements in the dating technique mad reliability of age determinations, particu-larly for OSL dating of quartz grains, and routine application {{to a wide variety}} of depositional envir-onments is now possible. Here we apply OSL methods to date a variety of deposits within Late Pleistocene conglomeratic alluvial sequences in NW Argentina. The ages obtained range from 39 t 83 ka and were determined from debris-flow- and fluvial-dominated deposits and lacustrine sequences in intramontane basins bounded by tectonically active mountain ranges with as much as 2 km of relief. With careful choice of facies and sample collection, OSL techniques can be used to date Late Pleistocene, predominately matrix-supported, cobble-conglomerate alluvial deposits.

40|$|Abstract. The {{plasma sheet}} {{plays a key}} role during mag-netic storms because it is the {{bottleneck}} through which large amounts of magnetic flux that have been eroded from the dayside magnetopause have to be returned to the dayside magnetosphere. Using about five years of Geotail data we studied the average properties of the near- and midtail central plasma sheet (CPS) in the 10 – 30 RE range during magnetic storms. The earthward flux transport rate is greatly enhanced during the storm main phase, but shows a significant earth-ward decrease. Hence, since the magnetic flux cannot be circulated at a sufficient rate, this leads to an average dipo-larization of the central plasma sheet. An increase of the spe-cific entropy of the CPS ion population by a factor of about two during the storm main phase provides evidence for non-adiabatic heating processes. The direction of flux transport during the main phase is consistent with the possible forma-tion of a near-Earth neutral line beyond ∼ 20 <b>RE.</b> <b>Key</b> words.

There {{is a need for}} security services to provide&# 13; group-oriented communication privacy and data integrity. It is important that members of the group&# 13; can establish a common secret key for encrypting group communication. A key tree approach has been&# 13; proposed by many authors to distribute group key {{in such a way that}} the <b>re</b> <b>keying</b> cost scales with the&# 13; logarithm of the group size for a join or leave request.

50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old lock pins with new lock pins. Locks are usually <b>re</b> <b>keyed</b> to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the lock has 5 pins. Different brand locks each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them.

There are several important characteristics which make this problem different from traditional secure group communication. They are: 1) distributed nature {{in which there}} is no centralized key server; 2) collaborative nature in which the group key is contributory (i. e., each group member will collaboratively contribute its part to the global group key); and 3) dynamic nature in which existing members may leave the group while new members may join. Instead of performing individual rekeying operations, i. e., recomputing the group key after every join or leave request, we are going to <b>re</b> <b>key</b> for a batch of join and leave operations.

METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with liver metastases undergoing RE were evaluated with multiphase CT, perfusion CT and (99 m) Tc-MAA SPECT. Arterial perfusion (AP) from perfusion CT, HU values from the arterial (aHU) and portal venous phase (pvHU) CT, and (99 m) Tc-MAA uptake ratio of metastases were determined. Morphologic response was evaluated after 4  months and available in 30 patients. One-year survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: We found significant differences between responders and non-responders for AP (P[*] 20  ml/ 100  ml/min had a significantly (P[*]=[*] 0. 01) higher 1 -year survival, whereas an aHU value > 55 HU did not discriminate survival (P[*]=[*] 0. 12). The Cox proportional hazard model revealed AP as the only significant (P[*]=[*] 0. 02) independent predictor of survival.

To {{assess the}} impact of the {{duration}} of epilepsy, the clusters of seizures and/or epileptic status, the type of epilepsy and seizures, and the mono-/ polytherapy on the quality of life (QOL) of Bulgarian patients with refractory epi-lepsy (RE). Seventy patients with RE were studied using a purposeful interview on the patients ’ disease course, as well as an exam of the patients ’ medical documen-tation. All study participants completed QOLIE- 89. The greater duration of epilepsy has a negative impact on the assessments of the change in health during the last year. Seizure clusters and/or epileptic status in the disease course are associated with lower assessments of the sexual relations. The type of epilepsy has an impact on: 1. Seizure worries – participants with generalized epilepsy have less worries; 2. The overall score of QOLIE- 89 – the patients with partial epilepsy make lower assessments. An impact of the seizure type on the subscale “Overall health ” has been demonstrated. The lowest scores are given by the patients having partial seizures with secondary generalization. The highest scores are given by the par-ticipants having generalized tonic-clonic seizures, generalized myoclonic seizures, and polymorphic seizures. The prescribed treatment as mono-/polytherapy has an impact on the assessments of the overall health the scores were higher in cases with polytherapy.

The development of the Internet, providing electronic and online reporting, allows {{for the improvement of}} corporate communication with shareholders and other stakeholders. It also raises many issues, which challenge regulators and the accounting profession. This paper examines the extent of online financial reporting by New Zealand companies and analyses the content of such reporting with the aim of identifying strengths and weaknesses. Many New Zealand listed companies make use of the web for the dissemination of their financial information, although such usage is relatively lower in comparison with other countries, suggesting that the use of such medium is likely to increase in the future. The quality of display and use of contemporary electronic features are found to be of comparable standard to those of companies in other countries. However, many companies are not utilising the opportunities of the electronic format by merely providing an electronic version of their paper based annual reports. Furthermore, the paper examines the advantages and issues in relation to providing financial information on the Internet. The advantages of online in comparison with hard copy financial reporting include: lower production and distribution costs, flexible access to information, ability to provide relevant information to users, and ability to provide real-time information. The issues associated with online reporting include: blurring the distinction between audited and unaudited information, access is limited to individuals with costly equipment and service and computer skills, and the possible introduction of errors in <b>re</b> <b>keying</b> information. Some of the issues pose a challenge to standard-setters and regulators such as whether all online financial reporting should comply with GAAP, whether all online financial reporting should be audited and if not a disclaimer should be provided, and whether there should be a compulsory filing system for financial reports on a regulator-controlled server to ensure access to the information and its integrity. The paper identifies a number of research opportunities. There is a need to reexamine many of the research issues addressed for hard copy financial reporting under the new reporting medium, such as content, timing and the determinants of voluntary online financial reporting. There are additional research issues that are unique to online reporting, such as, whether online financial reporting enhances the understanding of corporate reporting, and whether users find online reporting an acceptable substitute for hard copy financial reports. Online reporting is likely to extend to real-time financial reporting that provides further research opportunities...|$|R
