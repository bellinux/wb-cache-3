40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{data on the}} conductivity σ+(T), T → 0, on the metallic side of the metal–insulator transition in ideally <b>random</b> (<b>neutron</b> transmutation-doped) 70 Ge:Ga have shown that σ+(0) ∝ (N − Nc) μ with μ = ½, confirming earlier ultra-low-temperature results for Si:P. This value is inconsistent with theoretical predictions based on diffusive classical scaling models, {{but it can be}} understood by a quantum-directed percolative filamentary amplitude model in which electronic basis states exist which have a well-defined momentum parallel but not normal to the applied electric field. The model, which is based on a new kind of broken symmetry, also explains the anomalous sign reversal of the derivative of the temperature dependence in the critical regime...|$|R
40|$|The Monte Carlo method [...] which {{based on}} the game of chance [...] was named after the famous Casino of Monte Carlo in Monaco. It was {{developed}} in the early fourtieth of the last century. For solving the so-called <b>random</b> <b>neutron</b> transport problems, i. e. diffusion in fissile materials. Already at an early stage of these investigations, the direct simulation was refined with certain variance [...] reducing techniques. About the same time the methods and theories of structural safety and reliability have been developed, and it was until the late sixtieth and early seventieth, respectively, until Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) techniques have been introduced to this field. First for simulating random variables, and random processes, later on for random fields. It took more than another decade until variance reduction techniques were applied in this area as well. Efficient MCS procedures were considerably advanced through the availability of digital, high-speed computer. Currently the MCS procedure is applied to various aspects of analysis, design of structures, such as uncertainty, reliability, safety and other types of analyses. It proves to be the most versatile tool in structural analysis when taking into account uncertainties in load, material and geometrical parameters. Future developments of MCS techniques will encompass their use within user - friendly computer codes for analysis and design, mainly based on a modular basis for maintaining flexibility and parallel processing for reducing computational efforts...|$|R

The device performed a mechanical simulation of <b>random</b> diffusion of <b>neutrons.</b> As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.|$|R

Magnetic ordering appears to equilibrate on a time scale of hours as the temperature is reduced in small steps, but, remarkably, the time scale is nearly independent of temperature.

40|$|Neutron and proton {{resonances}} provide detailed level density information. Due to experimental limitations some {{fraction of}} the resonances are not observed, and this missing fraction must be determined. The standard correction for missing levels uses the experimental widths and the Porter-Thomas distribution. Analysis of the spacing distribution should yield equivalent information. A general expression for an imperfect spacing distribution (with a fraction of levels randomly missing) was obtained with the maximum entropy principle. This formulation was tested exten-sively with numerical data and then applied to proton and neutron resonance data sets. Since in Random Matrix Theory the widths and spacings are not correlated, this method complements the conventional approach that considers only the widths. The two analysis methods are compared.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Soil {{moisture}} in a crop's root zone must be regularly monitored to accurately predict crop water requirements. Most irrigation scheduling services currently use the neutron probe to monitor soil moisture. Unfortunately, {{there is a}} degree of variability associated with use of the neutron probe creating uncertainty in measurements of soil moisture. A {{review of the literature}} reveals there are three major types of error in estimates of average field moisture by the probe: instrument error, calibration error, and location error. Instrument error accounts for <b>random</b> <b>neutron</b> emission by the radioactive probe source. Calibration error is introduced by inaccuracies in the calibration curve. Location error is a result of estimating average soil moisture throughout a field using only point estimates. This study attempts to provide the neutron probe user with a quick and easy means to evaluate estimates of soil moisture by the probe and to identify sources of error. A computer program is developed that quickly and easily analyzes field calibration data to evaluate the error in neutron probe measurements. Field data from Colorado are analyzed as a numerical example of applying the mechanics of the computer model. Similar data from several California soils are analyzed using the model to show how the range of moisture content over which the probe is calibrated restricts accurate neutron probe measurements to the range of calibration data. The Colorado data are further analyzed to determine to what extent measurement errors occuring in the calibration process will contribute to calibration error in general. In most cases, neutron probe access tubes are placed at biased locations within a field and not randomly as is assumed in the model. A method is developed to correct estimates of average field moisture by taking this discrepancy into account. Given the variability of field moisture content, the number of access tubes that must be sampled to achieve a desired level of accuracy may be calculated using the definition of the student's "t" parameter and referring to specific confidence intervals...|$|R
50|$|The FERMIAC {{used this}} method to create {{two-dimensional}} neutron genealogies {{on a scale}} diagram of a nuclear device. A series of drums on the device were set according to the material being crossed and a random choice between fast and slow <b>neutrons.</b> <b>Random</b> numbers also determined the direction of travel and the distance until the next collision. Once the drums were set, the trolley was rolled across the diagram, drawing a path as it went. Any time a change in material was indicated on the diagram, the drum settings were adjusted accordingly before continuing.|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of the neutron-neutron energy {{correlations}} for coincident neutrons emitted in the spontaneous fission of ²⁵²Cf. The hypothesis that cooling of the fission fragments during the cascade evaporation of prompt neutrons affects the energies of successive neutrons in a cascade has been investigated by a comparison of the energy correlations of coincident neutrons from the same fragment with those of coincident neutrons from opposite fragments in the same fission. It is found that the energies of coincident neutrons are posftively correlated and that the correlation coefficient is greater for neutrons from opposite fragments than for neutrons from the same fragment. This provides a sensitive test of the nature of neutron emission in an evaporation cascade. The energy correlations of <b>random</b> (noncoincidental) <b>neutrons</b> have also been investigated and are found to show similar but smaller correlation trends. It is concluded that there is some evidence for the cascade cooling effect on the energies of prompt fission neutrons...|$|R
40|$|Neutron-rich {{radioactive}} ion beams {{available from}} the HRIBF allow a variety of exciting measurements around the Sn- 132 region, including Coulomb excitation, fusion-evaporation, and neutron transfer. The B(E 2; 0 (+) [...] > 2 (+)) value for first 2 (+) excited states of neutron-rich Te- 132,Te- 134,Te- 136 and Sn- 126,Sn- 128,Sn- 130,Sn- 132,Sn- 134 have been measured by Coulomb excitation in inverse kinematics.

40|$|To combat illicit use {{of nuclear}} and {{radioactive}} material and to take preventive action reliable measurement techniques are imperative for early detection of this material. Nuclear safeguards are an important tool to impede the illicit use of fissionable material. But only nuclear material is controlled by safeguards, radioisotope sources {{are not covered by}} the safeguards regime in general. Whereas in most western countries comprehensive regulations for the control of radioactive materials exist a lot of other countries have inadequate control and monitoring programs to prevent or even detect the theft of these materials. While radiation accidents caused by orphan sources may give an idea on the extent of such a risk, the injury caused by a well planed terrorist attack with radioactive or nuclear material may be even worse. Since the threat environment is very unpredictable mobile measuring systems are essential to detect and respond to malicious acts involving radioactive or nuclear material. For the detection and identification of radioactive and nuclear material Fraunhofer INT has built up a mobile measuring system integrated into a transportable container. A power generator on a trailer makes the system independent of local resources of electric power. This container as well as the power generator can be transported by land, air or sea. The system is equipped with various types of detectors for neutron and gamma radiation, some of the detectors are similar to those used in safeguards. The type of radiation and its activity level can be determined. In case of neutron emitting material it is possible to distinguish fissionable material from <b>random</b> <b>neutron</b> sources by means of coincidence counting. This system is completed by a measurement car, which is equipped with high efficient neutron detectors and a background subtracting gamma measurement system. With this system hidden radioactive material can also be revealed by a covered search. In case of a radiological dispersal device or an improvised nuclear device the danger zone may extend to several hundred meters. In this case the detectors and electronics are moved with a remote controlled manipulator vehicle near the suspicious object. The measured data are transferred via radio transmission to the container placed in a safe distance for evaluation and risk assessment. Depending on availability of telecommunication infrastructure, the measurement results can be communicated by telephone line, mobile phone or satellite. Based on the results the next action steps are decided by law enforcement authorities. The capabilities of these mobile detection systems have been demonstrated in field exercises. Details of on-site identification measurements and results will be presented...|$|R
40|$|We recall {{some of the}} {{sensitive}} points and stages in <b>random</b> walk of <b>neutron,</b> frequent solutions and their consequences on quality and duration of MC neutronic and photonic simulations. We present some unconventional approaches we developed to precisely meet the double paramount MC goal: maximal probing at minimal variance, whence minimum CPU time. Instead of the traditional point observation, enhanced probing is used to limit collected random scatter dispersion. Vector probing by shower (through ”nuclear reaction‑channel” space) and drizzle (improved sampling throughout space involving even the deepest parts, with region fragmentation allowed) drastically reduces the collected variance. By treating analogically close‑collision flux-at-a-point tallies, the unphysical pole discontinuity at-the-detecting-point is avoided - this allows the study of even within-detector collisions. For deep shielding treatment {{the use of the}} two-step Cascade Monte Carlo is recommended as it reproduces from physical considerations the mathematical approach. Making sure to distinguish volumetric versus local destructive effects, the latter requiring the use of "statistics of extreme values"...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Benchmark {{calculations}} {{are performed}} for neutron transport in a two material (binary) stochastic multiplying medium. Spatial, angular, and energy dependence are included. The problem considered {{is based on}} a fuel assembly of a common pressurized water nuclear reactor. The mean chord length through the assembly is determined and used as the planar geometry system length. According to assumed or calculated material distributions, this system length is populated with alternating fuel and moderator segments of <b>random</b> size. <b>Neutron</b> flux distributions are numerically computed using a discretized form of the Boltzmann transport equation employing diffusion synthetic acceleration. Average quantities (group fluxes and k-eigenvalue) and variances are calculated from an ensemble of realizations of the mixing statistics. The effects of varying two parameters in the fuel, two different boundary conditions, and three different sets of mixing statistics are assessed. A probability distribution function (PDF) of the k-eigenvalue is generated and compared with previous research. Atomic mix solutions are compared with these benchmark ensemble average flux and k-eigenvalue solutions. Mixing statistics with large standard deviations give the most widely varying ensemble solutions of the flux and k-eigenvalue. The shape of the k-eigenvalue PDF qualitatively agrees with previous work. Its overall shape is independent of variations in fuel cross-sections for the problems considered, but its width is impacted by these variations. Statistical distributions with smaller standard deviations alter the shape of this PDF toward a normal distribution. The atomic mix approximation yields large over-predictions of the ensemble average k-eigenvalue and under-predictions of the flux. Qualitatively correct flux shapes are obtained, however. These benchmark calculations indicate that a model which includes higher statistical moments of the mixing statistics is needed for accurate predictions of binary stochastic media k-eigenvalue problems. This is consistent with previous findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of neutron detectors makes {{extensive use of}} the predictions of detector response {{through the use of}} Monte Carlo techniques in conjunction with the point reactor model. Unfortunately, the point reactor model fails to accurately predict detector response in common applications. For this reason, the general Monte Carlo N-Particle code (MCNP) was modified to simulate the pulse streams that would be generated by a neutron detector and normally analyzed by a shift register. This modified code, MCNP - <b>Random</b> Exponentially Distributed <b>Neutron</b> Source (MCNP-REN), along with the Time Analysis Program (TAP) predict neutron detector response without using the point reactor model, making it unnecessary for the user {{to decide whether or not}} the assumptions of the point model are met for their application. MCNP-REN is capable of simulating standard neutron coincidence counting as well as neutron multiplicity counting. Measurements of MOX fresh fuel made using the Underwater Coincidence Counter (UWCC) as well as measurements of HEU reactor fuel using the active neutron Research Reactor Fuel Counter (RRFC) are compared with calculations. The method used in MCNP-REN is demonstrated to be fundamentally sound and shown to eliminate the need to use the point model for detector performance predictions...|$|R
