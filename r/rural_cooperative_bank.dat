40|$|The project {{provided}} {{assistance to}} the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Agrarian Reform and the Brazilian Organization of Cooperatives (OCB) in formulating proposals for restructuring rural savings and credit cooperatives and constituting an integrated cooperative credit system, {{as well as in}} assessing the viability of establishing a private <b>rural</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>bank.</b> The original work programme was substantially modified and the project duration was extended by one year in view of the delays encountered in approving the required modifications in cooperative bank legislation and in completing the preparatory work for the new bank. The FAO international consultant carried out between 1991 and 1993 three missions, while two national consultants in the specialized fields of bank legislation and bank organization/operations were contracted from September 1992 to February 1993. The first mission of the FAO international consultant in the period from June to September 1991 coincided with and contributed to the work of an Inter- Ministerial Task Force which reviewed the current cooperative legislation and the regulatory framework of the cooperative credit system. Both the project and the Task Force have recommended that the current repressive regulations of credit cooperatives be lifted. They further emphasized the need for strong primary credit cooperative societies and their integration in central cooperatives as an essential pre-condition {{for the establishment of a}} viable private cooperative bank. In particular, it is recommended to terminate the monopoly of the Banco do Brazil with regard to the administration of surplus financial resources of cooperatives and the intermediation on behalf of the cooperatives in the National Clearing System of Checks. The concurrence of the Central Bank with the proposed modifications to Resolution No. 1914 was obtained already at the end of March 1993, but final approval is still awaited from the National Monetary Council. A follow-up technical assistance project proposal for the consolidation of an integrated system of credit cooperatives has also been formulated and will be effectuated once the new bank has been established and as soon as financial resources have been obtained. The proposal focuses on such key issues as training, adaptation of the credit cooperatives to the new regulations and requirements of capital adequacy, and improving the internal management and control capabilities at the three operational levels of primary credit cooperative societies, central credit cooperatives and the new cooperative bank. In particular, management and staff training will be very important over the next years in order to gain and maintain the confidence of cooperative members and clients alike...|$|E

Findings from the research suggest that modern information technology serves to enhance both the efficiency and profitability of the rural credit institutions. Efficiency was significantly enhanced by the usage of moderate technology at the lower organisational level, e. g. stand-alone computers at the branch level, mobile phone usage at PACS (Primary Agricultural Credit Society) and field level. However, profitability appears to be associated with more advanced and sophisticated usage of information technology at branch or lower organisational level. Complementarities in human capital, training in IT skills of the bank staff, absorptive capacity of the customers and community, are of crucial importance for the efficiency of <b>rural</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>banks.</b> Evidence from this study also suggests that using investment in ICT as a measure of the usage and advancement level of information technology may not reveal the full story of {{the impact of}} ICT on the efficiency of organizations...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{research}} report {{is a case}} study of a <b>rural</b> agricultural <b>cooperative</b> <b>bank,</b> the People’s National <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Bank</b> (NPCB). The NPCB has its foundations in the early 1900 s and today operates 37 branches across the island of Jamaica. Notwithstanding its history, the NPCB has continued to suffer from issues related to overall profitability and therefore has undergone various transformations and amalgamations of branches over the years. This study involves a comparative analysis of branch performance based on branch-specific financial data. Best and worst practice banks are identified along with their key characteristics in order to pinpoint areas of operations that may benefit from improvement. It is suggested that the variance in the level of efficiency with which resources are employed and incomes earned are factors which affect the level of performance of individual branches. The findings of the research indicate large variations in branch expenses, incomes and lending rates and suggest the need for further examination of branches on a case-by-case basis in order to better facilitate improvements in their respective levels of efficiency...|$|R
