Zeithaml and Len Berry, in a systematic research program carried out between 1983 and 1988. The model identifies the principal dimensions (or components) of service quality; proposes a scale for measuring service quality (SERVQUAL) and suggests possible causes of service quality problems. The models developers originally identified ten dimensions of service quality, but after testing and retesting, some of the dimensions were found to be autocorrelated and the total number of dimensions was reduced to five, namely - <b>reliability,</b> <b>assurance,</b> tangibles, empathy and responsiveness. These five dimensions are thought to represent the dimensions of service quality across a range of industries and settings.

50|$|Dimensional instability: A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} that the five dimensions of service quality implicit in the model (<b>reliability,</b> <b>assurance,</b> tangibles, empathy and responsiveness) do not hold up when the research is replicated in different countries, different industries, in different market segments or even at different time periods. Some studies report that the SERVQUAL items do not always load onto the same factors. In some empirical research, the items load onto fewer dimensions, while other studies report that the items load onto more than five dimensions of quality. In statistical terms, the robustness of the factor loadings is known as a model's dimensional stability. Across a wide range of empirical studies, the factors implicit in the SERVQUAL instrument {{have been shown to be}} unstable. Problems associated with the stability of the factor loadings may be attributed, at least in part, to the requirement that each new SERVQUAL investigation needed to make context-sensitive modifications to the instrument in order to accommodate the unique aspects of the focal service setting or problem. However, it has also been hypothesised that the dimensions of service quality represented by the SERVQUAL research instrument fail to capture the true dimensionality of the service quality construct and that there may not be a universal set of service quality dimensions that are relevant across all service industries.|$|E

Due to the limited/absent reliability data and engineering knowledge available at the system level and the complex system structure, system-level <b>reliability</b> <b>assurance</b> is challenging. To meet with these challenges, the dissertation proposes a generic, flexible and recursive multi-level information aggregation framework by systematically utilizing multi-level reliability information throughout a system structure to improve {{the performance of a}} variety of system <b>reliability</b> <b>assurance</b> tasks. Specifically, the aggregation approach is first present to aggregate complex reliability data structure (e. g., failure time data with covariates and different censoring) with less distribution assumptions to improve accuracy of system-level reliability modeling. The system structure is mainly restricted to the hierarchical series-and-parallel system with independent intra-level components and/or sub-systems. Then, the aggregation approach is extended to accommodate multi-state hierarchical system by considering both probabilistic inter-level failure relationships and cascading intra-level failure dependency. Last, the aggregation approach is incorporated into the design of system-level reliability demonstration testing to achieve the potential sample size reduction. Different demonstration testing strategies with and without information aggregation are comprehensively compared with closed-form conditions obtained.
