5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> {{no difference in}} the prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E

5|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> a {{tentative}} benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia. Nidotherapy or efforts {{to change the}} environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, {{there is not enough}} evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness. Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area. There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, {{based on the premise that}} inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs. This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> medullary bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E
