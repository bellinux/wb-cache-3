Iron removal {{is carried out}} in the jarosite conversion circuit which consists of ten continuous stirred tank reactors in series. In this study, the first five tanks of the jarosite conversion circuit were piloted and process identification experiments were carried out. Step changes in the flows of the <b>raw</b> <b>acid,</b> spent acid, jarosite slurry and zinc ferrite slurry streams were performed. The goal of these experiments was to collect transient response data which could be used to validate a dynamic conversion circuit model. The process was found to be most sensitive to changes in the flow of the <b>raw</b> <b>acid</b> stream. The zinc ferrite dissolution rate constant calculated from the experimental data agrees with literature values. Using a jarosite precipitation rate expression from the literature, it was found that jarosite precipitation is negligible in the first reactor but cannot be ignored in the second tank. The dynamic model provides a good representation of the first two tanks of the jarosite conversion circuit and can be used for both process control and optimization studies on a full-scale facility...|$|E

40|$|International audienceConcd. {{phosphoric acid}} issued from the "wet process" {{contains}} at least 19 different contaminants, among which are metal elements, {{that must be}} removed to obtain purified acid valuable in many applications. Nanofiltration of concd. inorg. acids is an emerging application for NF {{that could be used}} for purifn. of raw phosphoric acid. Nevertheless, an in-depth study of transfer mechanisms is required in order to properly understand the obsd. retentions of metal species during NF of raw phosphoric acid and to be able to propose a better management of the process for further purifn. NF mechanisms concerning metal ions in dild. aq. solns. are extensively studied, but up to now limited literature data deal with concd. acids. This paper is a contribution to a better understanding of transfer of low amt. of metal species in concd. phosphoric acid, the concn. of which can be as high as 5. 9 mol L- 1. The study focuses on the transfer of iron that is the main metal contaminant of the <b>raw</b> <b>acid.</b> To achieve this goal, model solns. without and with iron chloride (18. 6 × 10 - 3 mol L- 1 FeCl 3) in H 3 PO 4 (0. 12 - 1. 2 - 5. 9 mol L- 1) are filtered in a stirred dead-end cell using a MPF 34 membrane. Retentions of phosphoric acid, that can be in neutral (H 3 PO 4) and charged (H 2 PO 4 -) form, is discussed. Dealing with iron-phosphate chelates, Fe(H 2 PO 4) 4 - is the predominant one whereas two cations can sometimes exist: Fe(HPO 4) + and Fe(H 2 PO 4) 2 +. The divalent cation is in significant amt. only in 0. 12 mol L- 1 acid concn. medium. Retentions of iron chelates by the NF membrane are detd. from both the mass balance of iron and their dissocn. consts. For 5. 9 and 1. 2 mol L- 1 media, retentions decrease in the following order: Fe(H 2 PO 4) 4 - 3 PO 42 PO 4 -+. Cl-.

Soil DNA was extracted at 0, 2 and 8 weeks and the V 3 region of the 16 S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced using paired-end Illumina bar-coded sequencing. The results show that bacterial diversity was not affected by either type of MWCNT. However, overall soil bacterial community composition, as illustrated by NMDS, was affected only by fMWCNT at high concentrations. This effect, detectable at 2 weeks, remained equally strong by 8 weeks. In the case of fMWCNTs, overall changes in relative abundance of the dominant phyla were also found. The stronger effect of fMWCNTs {{could be explained by}} their intrinsically acidic nature, as the soil pH was lower at higher concentrations of fMWCNTs.
