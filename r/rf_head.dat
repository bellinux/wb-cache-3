Face-to-face interviews were conducted on commercial fishermen (CF), recreational fishermen (<b>RF),</b> <b>heads</b> of fishery cooperatives, owners of fishing equipment shops and owners of SCUBA diving centers by using specifically designed separate questionnaire forms. Study was conducted in Altınoluk, Güre ve Küçükkuyu in the northern coastal towns of Edremit Bay.

RF in Altınoluk were considerably highly satisfied with RF in Güre that two thirds of the RF were absolutely satisfied from ARs whereas, RF in Küçükkuyu had lower levels of AR project satisfaction. As in the case of CF, the majority of RF in three towns was agreed that ARs are not managed well. Fishing experiment has also showed that there were statistically significant differences between mean CPUE values in ARZ and Non-ARZ (ANOVA; p< 0, 05).

This paper presents detailed engineering information on the electromechanical design and construction of a MR-compatible RRFC system for human head imaging at 2 T. A custom-made (bladeless) pneumatic Tesla turbine was used to rotate the RF coil at a constant velocity, while an infrared optical encoder measured the selected frequency of rotation.

40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{image quality}} is {{strongly}} {{dependent on the}} homogeneity of the main magnetic field, B 0. Inhomogeneities in this magnetic field lead to image artifacts such as: blurring, signal loss, and gross distortions of the imaged anatomy of the brain, degrading the images effectiveness to provide diagnostic information. A new radio-frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>head</b> coil design with integrated direct-current (DC) shim coils to provide localized B 0 shimming of the brain and simultaneously provide parallel excitation of reception is presented in this thesis. This design optimizes both the RF and DC shim coils proximity to the subject thereby maximizing both the signal-to-noise ratio and the shimming efficiency. This coil architecture is termed iPRES (integrated parallel receive, excitation and shimming). An existing 32 channel receive-only head coil array was modified into an iPRES coil architecture. The coils of the array were modified using RF components to enable the simultaneous flow of both RF and DC currents on the same structure. The RF and DC currents provide concurrent signal reception and localized B 0 shimming to the brain, respectively. In this thesis, the techniques, measurements and quality-metrics used to facilitate the iPRES coil array modification will be discussed. The localized B 0 shimming performance is evaluated in the frontal region of the brain which suffers from large susceptibility artifacts at the air/tissue boundary of the brain and the sinus. Axial B 0 maps and echo-planar images (EPI) are acquired in vivo with optimized DC shim currents demonstrating a reduction in B 0 inhomogeneities in the frontal lobe resulting in improved image EPI image quality. The coils quality factor and signal-to-noise ratio did not suffer {{as a result of the}} coil modification. The shimming performance and RF quality metrics are compared to standard whole-body spherical harmonic shimming and are discussed at length in the following chapters. Finally, initial phantom results from the next-generation iPRES coil array will be presented. This architecture again uses an existing <b>RF</b> <b>head</b> coil array to simultaneously drive RF currents for reception and DC currents for local shimming. However, the shimming is further enhanced by providing additional RF-isolated shim coils which increases the shimming degrees of freedom.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{is one of}} the most sophisticated technologies to produce detailed images of the human body's organs and structures. There were many items of pioneering work in MRI over the last few decades. However, many challenges still remain. This dissertation includes two studies concerning the challenges: the fully automatic matched / tuned <b>RF</b> <b>head</b> coil design and RF coil design with improved B 1 field uniformity. Both have been being considered as critical problems at ultra-high field (7 T and beyond) MRI systems. The first study aims to build a real-time, high-speed, electrically controlled, and fully stand-alone system of the impedance matched / frequency tuned RF coil that is applicable and compatible to an existing MRI system. To achieve this project, subjects including the basic background of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) physics, MRI systems, RF/analog circuit theory. have been studied and presented in this dissertation. The 8 -channel <b>RF</b> <b>head</b> coil was successfully built and tested. The fully automatic tuning and matching RF coil offers fast operation (less than 550 ms per each channel), accurate impedance matching / frequency tuning (less than - 20 dB in the reflected coefficient, S 11, at the Larmor frequency) resulting in the high power efficiency (4 %~ 21 % improved at each channel), and higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in MR images (about 3 % in the whole object region). In the second study, the double trapezoidal-like shape along the length of the microstrip resonator is proposed to obtain the gradual impedance variation and flatten the near field distributions. The conventional and proposed 8 -channel volume coils have been built and investigated with a phantom in 7 T MRI scanner. The results show successful flat field distributions with about 35 % increased local transmission magnetic field strength at the ends of the RF coil as well as about 13 % improvement at its center. The quality factor ratio between unloaded and loaded is also increased about 45 % (from 1. 46 to 2. 13) compared to the conventional structure.

The purpose of this study (approved by NHS Research Ethics Committee, Reference 14 /NW/ 0332) was to evaluate the potential of diffusion tensor and kurtosis imaging for detecting differences in measures of regional white matter integrity in adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (NDE) in comparison with healthy controls. Diffusion Kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that can evaluate the abnormalities in white matter integrity, assuming a non-Gaussian distribution (Jensen at al. 2005).

40|$|Parallel {{transmission}} (pTx) is {{a promising}} improvement to coil design {{that has been}} demonstrated to mitigate B 1 * inhomogeneity, manifest as center brightening, for high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Parallel transmission achieves spatially-tailored pulses through multiple radiofrequency (RF) excitation coils that can be activated independently. In this work, simulations of magnetic fields in numerical phantoms using an FDTD solver are used to estimate the excitation profiles for an 8 -channel <b>RF</b> <b>head</b> coil. Each channel is driven individually {{in the presence of}} a dielectric load, and the excitation profiles for all channels are combined post-processing into a B 1 + profile of the birdcage (BC) mode. The B 1 profile is calculated for a dielectric sphere phantom with material properties of white matter at main magnetic field strengths of 3 T and 7 T to demonstrate center brightening associated with head imaging at high magnetic field strengths. Measurements of a circular ROI centered in the image show more B 1 + inhomogeneity at 7 T than at 3 T. The B 1 * profile is then simulated for a numerical head phantom with spatially segmented tissue compartments at 7 T. Comparison of the simulated and in vivo B 1 * profiles at 7 T shows agreement in the B 1 inhomogeneity. The results provide confidence in numerical simulation as a means to estimate magnetic fields for human imaging. This work will allow further numerical simulations to model the propagation of electric fields within the body, ultimately to provide an estimate of heat deposition in tissue, quantified by the specific absorption rate (SAR), which is a limiting factor of the use of high-field MRI in the clinical setting. by Jessica A.

40|$|Accelerated data {{acquisition}} with simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging for functional MRI studies leads to interacting and opposing effects {{that influence the}} sensitivity to blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes. Image {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) is decreased with higher SMS acceleration factors and shorter repetition times (TR) due to g-factor noise penalties and saturation of longitudinal magnetization. However, the lower image SNR is counteracted by greater statistical power from more samples per unit time and a higher temporal Nyquist frequency that allows for better removal of spurious non-BOLD high frequency signal content. This study investigated the dependence of the BOLD sensitivity on these main driving factors and their interaction, and provides a framework for evaluating optimal acceleration of SMS-EPI sequences. fMRI data from a scenes/objects visualization task was acquired in 10 healthy volunteers at a standard neuroscience resolution of 3 mm on a 3 T MRI scanner. SMS factors 1, 2, 4, and 8 were used, spanning TRs of 2800 ms to 350 ms. Two data processing methods were used to equalize the number of samples over the SMS factors. BOLD sensitivity was assessed using g-factors maps, temporal SNR (tSNR), and t-score metrics. tSNR results show a dependence on SMS factor that is highly non-uniform over the brain, with outcomes driven by g-factor noise amplification and the presence of high frequency noise. The t-score metrics also show a high degree of spatial dependence: the lower g-factor noise area of V 1 shows significant improvements at higher SMS factors; the moderate-level g-factor noise area of the parahippocampal place area shows only a trend of improvement; and the high g-factor noise area of the ventral-medial pre-frontal cortex shows a trend of declining t-scores at higher SMS factors. This spatial variability suggests that the optimal SMS factor for fMRI studies is region dependent. For task fMRI studies done with similar parameters as were used here (3 T scanner, 32 -channel <b>RF</b> <b>head</b> coil, whole brain coverage at 3 mm isotropic resolution), we recommend SMS accelerations of 4 x (conservative) to 8 x (aggressive) for most studies and a more conservative acceleration of 2 x for studies interested in anterior midline regions...|$|E

In 1977 the Naval Sea Systems Command made funds available to update the AN/SKQ- 3 system by utilizing the RF assembly similar to that used in PUTTS. This new RF assembly provided dual antennas for (1) a wide angle for verticle launch and initial acquisition; (2) narrow beam high gain for long range tracking. The RF unit also included frequency scan with automatic lock when a signal was received, and sector search. In 1978 funding was received from Australia and Iran to procure additional PUTTS. These units (PUTTS III) were updated to handle faster intercept rates as well as improved range tracking and adapt the new RF features from the SKQ- 3 Mod. Added to this were the capability to handle both PAM and PCM data with light weight hardware. These systems were completed and the Australian unit system was delivered after acceptance tests with U.

40|$|Inter-cell {{interference}} (ICI) {{is a key}} {{limiting factor}} to the radio frequency (RF) energy performance of a multi-cell multi-user radio access network (RAN). The channel quality of the cell edge users is greatly impaired by ICI owing {{to the fact that}} cell edge users are furthest away from their serving base stations (BSs) and closest to the interfering BSs. Consequently the BS is compelled to allocate more physical resource blocks [PRBs (In LTE a PRB spans 12 sub-carriers each with a bandwidth of 15 kHz over a 0. 5 ms time slot) ] to the cell edge users in order to meet their quality-of-service (QoS) targets. The study proposes a novel ICI management technique that mitigates the effects of ICI through a sequential game play between cells in the E-UTRAN [Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) terrestrial radio access network] based on the instantaneous cell offered load. The proposed technique is shown to produce greater user channel quality improvements of 4 dB greater than the state-of-the-art ICI management techniques. The channel quality improvements result in a utilisation of less PRBs, <b>RF</b> and radio <b>head</b> energy which translate to energy reduction gains of 34 and 45 at low- and high-offered loads, respectively.

Knowing the degree of muscular activation during the performance of these functional tasks is important for physiotherapists, {{in order to find}} out which can be used in each moment (on dry land or in water). AIM: The {{purpose of the present study}} was to analyze the neuromuscular responses during the performance of a chair rising (CR) exercise in aquatic and dry land environments at the same cadences. METHODS: 10 healthy subjects (five males and five females (mean ± SD) : age, 22. 0 ± 3. 1 year; height, 172. 8 ± 9. 0 cm; weight, 63. 9 ± 17. 2 kg) were recruited for study. The procedure started with using a telemetry EMG system from the following muscles on the right side: the quadriceps – vastus medialis (VM), the quadriceps –rectus femoris (<b>RF),</b> the long <b>head</b> of the biceps femoris (BF), the tibialis anterior (TA), the gastrocnemius medialis (GM), the soleus (SOL), the rectus abdominis (RA) and the erector spinae (ES). After the MVC tests the subjects performed one set of five repetitions for the CR (47 cm) exercise on dry land with the right cadence (20 beats per minute). After the dry land procedure, the subjects performed the same task in the water inside a pool with a depth of 100 cm. The raw electromyography signal was recorded with a 1000 Hz sampling frequency. Filtering of the raw EMGs was performed with lowZ and highZpass filters. Average EMG data were normalized to the greatest 1 Zs average EMG during MVC from each muscle. RESULTS: % MVC was different for all muscles during the (CR) exercise chair rising in water or dry land. Were significance higher on dry land than in water normalized signals from VM (17. 3 %), RF (8, 8 %), BF (4, 3 %), TA (13, 9 %), GM (3, 4 %), (SOL (6, 2 %). However, were higher in water than on dry land normalized signals from RA (Z 26, 6 %) and ES muscles (Z 22, 6 %). CONCLUSION: Muscle activity tends to be lower in waterZbased compared to landZbased activity; however core muscles are showed higher activity. Findings have showed that a (CR) chair rising exercise in aquatic and dry land environments at the same cadences present different patterns of neuromuscular activity. This should be considered in the clinical and research implications. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|R
40|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), {{approximately}} 50 {{million people}} in the world have active epilepsy. Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder after migraine, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. Epilepsy disorder affects men and women of all ages, races and social classes. There is an extensive neuroimaging literature describing patients with chronic epilepsy. However, few studies have investigated brain structural changes in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (NDE) using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The main goal of this thesis was to determine {{the nature and extent of}} brain structural and functional differences in patients with NDE using different MRI techniques compared with healthy controls. The first study was to determine the morphometric changes in patients with NDE compared to healthy controls using quantitative MRI analysis. The second study was to identify functional connectivity differences (in the whole brain and regions of interest) in patients with NDE and healthy controls using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). All study participants were recruited from the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool. All had been diagnosed with focal epilepsy by a consultant neurologist and recruited for MRI scanning within 12 months of diagnosis. Twenty-seven patients with NDE were recruited (14 male, 13 female, with mean age (M) = 33. 2) and 32 healthy matched controls (14 male, 18 female, M= 33. 07). Control and NDE study participants were matched for age, handedness and gender. All participants were scanned using a Siemens 3 T Trio whole-body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with eight-channel radiofrequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>head</b> coil together with foam padding to comfortably restrict head motion at the Magnetic Resonance and Image Analysis Research Centre (MARIARC), University of Liverpool. Various MRI sequences were conducted including: 3 D MPRAGE T 1 -weighted anatomical data, and RS-fMRI In the first study, shape, surface based, and voxel based morphometry analysis were applied, and the results suggested differences to the morphology of the brain stem and both the right and left thalami in patients with NDE. The independent component analysis of RS-fMRI showed abnormal different functional connectivity in visual and attention networks in patients with NDE relative to healthy controls while ROI-ROI demonstrated increased functional connectivity between the subcallosal cortex and both thalami in NDE patients. This is the first extensive programme of research to employ various analysis techniques and advanced MRI sequences to study structural and functional differences in patients with NDE compared to healthy controls. The results of this thesis show that structural and functional differences occur in both thalami in patients with NDE. These findings suggest that the thalamus plays a very important role in epilepsy pathophysiology. The results of this thesis offer further understanding regarding the role of structural and functional differences in NDE. They highlight the need for future quantitative MRI analysis studies of NDE to help patients avoid the chronic stage of the disorder and improve their quality of life...|$|E
40|$|As {{the signal}} to noise ratio (SNR) in {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) improves with increasing static magnetic field strength, there is a strong incentive to develop technology to acquire images at higher fields. While magnet technology has made it possible to generate static magnetic fields of 10 T and more, limitations of the radio frequency (RF) hardware prevent the acquisition of high quality images over full regions of interest in clinical applications. Electromagnetic analysis and the design of high frequency RF coils for magnetic resonance are presented in this thesis to attempt to mitigate the limitations of the RF hardware. Analytical and numerical methods are used in this work to analyze the field and frequency behaviors/limits for various RF volume coils in MRI. As the coils size approach wavelength of operation dimensions, the performance of conventional lumped element design and traditional excitation strategies for these coils, encounter several problems. Field and frequency limits for the traditional RF volume coils are studied to obtain a better understanding of high frequency RF coil designs. Numerical modeling of the excised, fixed human head at the extreme field strength of 11 T is made, which helps to understand the underlying mechanisms for the severe distortions in the MR images in 11 T MRI and confirms experimental observations. Results show that the rotating transverse magnetic field (B 1) exhibits good homogeneity in air, but strong in-homogeneity with biological loads at 11 T. The simulated signal intensity (SI) distribution within the human head confirms that distortions in the experimental images are mainly caused by the field/tissue interactions [...] To rapidly simulate RF field behaviour in the human head for MRI applications, Dyadic Greens function (DGF) /Method of Moments (DGF/MOM) - based solutions of the electromagnetic field (EMFs) inside a head-sized, stratified sphere are presented. Operating profiles are studied with various <b>RF</b> <b>head</b> coils loaded with various head models/phantoms. The RF field behaviour and tissue/field interactions are also obtained by case studies at different frequencies for different coils. New methodologies and innovations on high frequency RF coil design are next investigated. An inverse method with pre-emphasized B 1 field is proposed herein, and the method of pre-emphasizing the target field with the consideration of the dielectric materials proved to be encouraging in preliminary designs. The results demonstrate that inverse-method designed coils with pre-emphases of target fields can help in decreasing the notorious bright regions caused by wavelength effects in the human head images at 4 T. An 8 -element phased array head coil operating at 4 T is designed based on a combined idea from reciprocity theorem and inverse method. Using this new method, either circularly or linearly polarized head coils can be designed. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the design concept, which shows that improved B 1 field homogeneity is achievable. Another new method in ameliorating image distortion at 11 T (470 MHz) MR brain imaging applications uses a shielded 4 -element transcieve phased array coil and involves performing 2 separate scans of the same slice with each scan using different excitations during transmission. That is, parallel transmission phase cycling. By optimizing the amplitudes and phases for each set of the scan, signal distortion that is antipodal from one another can be obtained and by combining both images together, image distortion can be alleviated several fold. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility of the concept where transmission phase cycling of parallel imaging elements with different excitation pulse reconstruction is theoretically achievable. The strategy of improving the transmitting B 1 field homogeneity through active control of source profiles is studied. This method tailors the RF amplitudes and phases applied individually to the rungs of a resonator with the use of an optimization scheme. Numerical simulations are used in an attempt to find optimal source profiles for high frequency RF coils. The simulation results demonstrate the strength of the optimal source profiles for different targets in high field RF coil or phased array designs...|$|E
