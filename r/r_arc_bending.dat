40|$|The onset and {{rotation}} {{frequency of}} a helical instability {{in a metal}} halide lamp is studied for gravity conditions varying from microgravity to 1. 8 g during parabolic flights and at microgravity in the International Space Station. The results show that gravity-induced convection seriously alters the onset and behavior of the instability. Hypergravity and low lamp power increase the rotation frequency of the instability, which seems independent of the arc pressure. At microgravity conditions, only <b>arc</b> <b>bending</b> and no rotation has been observed. The <b>arc</b> <b>bending</b> increases with lamp power, allowing one to monitor the driving and damping forces of the instability...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} sharp bend design for the InP-based {{photonic}} membrane, which shows low loss and high tolerance. The traditional <b>arc</b> <b>bends</b> on InP membranes face high loss when the bending radii reduce below 2 µm. And their performance deteriorates even more dramatically at the presence of waveguide footings. The proposed design has advantages of low loss, high compactness, wide spectral response and ease of fabrication. It is also verified {{to be much more}} resilient to design and fabrication variations, such as waveguide footings. The sharp bend is fabricated together with traditional <b>arc</b> <b>bends.</b> Experimental results confirm its potential as a basic building block for InP photonic membrane platforms...|$|R

40|$|In this work, the Polar UVI {{data set}} by Kullen et al. (2002) of 74 polar arcs is reinvestigated, {{focusing}} on <b>bending</b> <b>arcs.</b> <b>Bending</b> <b>arcs</b> are typically faint and form (depending on interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) By direction) on the dawnside or duskside oval {{with the tip}} of the arc splitting off the dayside oval. The tip subsequently moves into the polar cap in the antisunward direction, while the arc's nightside end remains attached to the oval, eventually becoming hook-shaped. Our investigation shows that <b>bending</b> <b>arcs</b> appear on the opposite oval side from and farther sunward than most regular polar arcs. They form during By-dominated IMF conditions: typically, the IMF clock angle increases from 60 to 90 ° about 20 ?min before the arc forms. Antisunward plasma flows from the oval into the polar cap just poleward of <b>bending</b> <b>arcs</b> are seen in Super Dual Auroral Radar Network data, indicating dayside reconnection. For regular polar arcs, recently reported characteristics are confirmed in contrast to <b>bending</b> <b>arcs.</b> This includes plasma flows along the nightside oval that originate close to the initial arc location and a significant delay in the correlation between IMF By and initial arc location. In our data set, the highest correlations are found with IMF By appearing at least 1 – 2 ?h before arc formation. In summary, <b>bending</b> <b>arcs</b> are distinctly different from regular arcs and cannot be explained by existing polar arc models. Instead, these results are consistent with the formation mechanism described in Carter et al. (2015), suggesting that <b>bending</b> <b>arcs</b> are caused by dayside reconnection...|$|R

40|$|The {{vacuum system}} for a {{proposed}} 2. 5 GeV, 10 {Mu}A recirculating linac synchrotron light source [1] is readily achievable with conventional vacuum hardware and established fabrication processes. Some of the difficult technical challenges associated with synchrotron light source storage rings are sidestepped by the relatively low beam current and short beam lifetime requirements of a re-circulating linac. This minimal lifetime requirement leads directly to relatively high limits on the background gas pressure {{through much of the}} facility. The 10 {Mu}A average beam current produces very little synchrotron radiation induced gas desorption and thus the need for an ante-chamber in the vacuum chamber is eliminated.
