2500|$|The {{reaction}} to a <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> of a well-tensioned wire spoked wheel, such as by a rider sitting on a bicycle, is that the wheel flattens slightly near the ground contact area. The rest of the wheel remains approximately circular. The tension of all the spokes does not increase significantly. Instead, only the spokes directly under the hub decrease their tension. The issue of how best to describe this situation is debated. Some authors conclude from this that the hub [...] "stands" [...] on those spokes immediately below it that experience a reduction in tension, even though the spokes below the hub exert no upward force on the hub and can be replaced by chains without much changing the physics of the wheel. Other authors conclude that the hub [...] "hangs" [...] from those spokes above it that exert an upward force on the hub, and that have higher tension than the spokes below the hub, which pull down on the hub.|$|E
50|$|An {{axial ball}} bearing uses {{side-by-side}} races. An axial load is transmitted directly through the bearing, while a <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> is poorly supported and tends to separate the races,so that a larger <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> is likely to damage the bearing.|$|E
40|$|A {{circular}} arch with in-plane <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> uniformly distributed around the arch axis is primarily sub-jected to uniform compression. Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the uniformly distributed loads are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to uniformly distributed directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while uniformly distributed directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling. These uniform <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> may act at a load height, such as at the top surface of the cross-section. In this case, the <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> produce an additional torsional moment during buckling which affects the flexural-torsional buckling of the arch. This paper uses both virtual work and static equilibrium approaches to study the elastic flexural-torsional buckling, effects of the load height on the buckling of {{circular arch}}es under uniform compression (that is, produced by uniformly distributed dead or by directed <b>radial</b> <b>loads),</b> and closed form solutions for the buckling loads are developed. 1...|$|R

2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external <b>radial</b> <b>loads</b> and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to <b>radial</b> <b>loads,</b> which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under <b>radial</b> <b>loads.</b> This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|R

50|$|Common roller {{bearings}} use cylinders of slightly greater length than diameter. Roller bearings typically have higher <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> capacity than ball bearings, but a lower capacity and higher friction under axial loads.

5000|$|An {{angular contact}} ball bearing uses axially {{asymmetric}} races. An axial load passes {{in a straight}} line through the bearing, whereas a <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> takes an oblique path that tends to want to separate the races axially. So the angle of contact on the inner race is the same as that on the outer race. Angular contact bearings better support [...] "combined loads" [...] (loading in both the radial and axial directions) and the contact angle of the bearing should be matched to the relative proportions of each. The larger the contact angle (typically in the range 10 to 45 degrees), the higher the axial load supported, but the lower the <b>radial</b> <b>load.</b> In high speed applications, such as turbines, jet engines, and dentistry equipment, the centrifugal forces generated by the balls changes the contact angle at the inner and outer race. Ceramics such as silicon nitride are now regularly used in such applications due to their low density (40% of steel). These materials significantly reduce centrifugal force and function well in high temperature environments. They also tend to wear in a similar way to bearing steel—rather than cracking or shattering like glass or porcelain.|$|E

5000|$|In a slot-fill radial bearing, {{the inner}} and outer races are notched on one face so that when the notches are aligned, balls can be slipped in the {{resulting}} slot to assemble the bearing. A slot-fill bearing has the advantage that more balls can be assembled (even allowing a full complement design), resulting in a higher <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> capacity than a Conrad bearing of the same dimensions and material type.

50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the <b>radial</b> <b>load.</b> The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E

50|$|The exposed drum shafts {{are used}} to install and fix the drum motor into the {{conveyor}} frame and do not rotate. The shaft can be a single “through” shaft where the motor and gearbox are assembled on, and fixed to, the shaft with keys or pins. However, this type of drum motor design has a limited maximum <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> due to the bending stresses caused by the normal belt tension of a conveyor and is therefore used mainly for small light duty conveyors and loads. For heavier loads the most common design is to use two separate shafts, one fixed to the motor housing and one fixed to the gearbox housing where the mass of metal from the motor and gearbox significantly increases {{the strength of the}} drum motor allowing much higher payloads and longer conveyor applications. Typically one shaft is short (stub shaft) with a consistent length and the other increases in length according to the drum shell or belt width. Over certain widths, the shaft can be further reinforced to prevent bending under high belt tension.|$|E
5000|$|The {{paradigm}} {{precedent for}} MonoMetro {{is that of}} the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, but the technology of MonoMetro is quite different. The trains are suspended from six-wheeled bogies (or trucks America) running along a narrow gauge pair of rails; MonoMetro is thus a railway and not a monorail. The rails have a concave cross section and the wheels a corresponding convex profile. The vehicle load hangs centrally from a pivoting joint located at the intersecting <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> lines of the wheels. According to the patent [...] "this configuration moves the pivot point away from the wheel-track contact point (as in the Wuppertal Schwebebahn) to the point of intersection of the radial loads through the wheels. There is no torque acting on the bogie frame causing loss of contact with the track raceway as would happen if the load and bogie assembly were rigidly connected". The patent compares this to monorail technology that instead require a much heavier guideway and heavier bogies to overcome torsional forces and also need complex superelevation to provide passenger comfort on corners. The patent says propulsion will be provided by linear induction motors.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe lateral-torsional {{stability}} of circular arches subjected to radial and follower distributed loading is treated herein. Three loading cases are studied, including the <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> with constant direction, the <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> directed towards the arch centre, and the follower <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> (hydrostatic load), as treated by Nikolai in 1918. For the three cases, the buckling loads are first {{obtained from a}} static analysis. As {{the case of the}} follower <b>radial</b> <b>load</b> (hydrostatic load) is a non-conservative problem, the dynamic approach is also used to calculate the instability load. The governing equations for out-of-plane vibrations of circular arches under radial loading are then derived, both with and without Wagner's effect. Flutter instabilities may appear for sufficiently large values of opening angle, but flutter cannot occur before divergence for the parameters of interest (civil engineering applications). Therefore, it is concluded that the static approach necessarily leads to the same result as the dynamic approach, even in the non-conservative case...|$|E

A new <b>radial</b> stroke <b>loading</b> curve of the cropping hammer based on the cycloid form is proposed and the dynamic model of <b>radial</b> stroke <b>loading</b> mechanism is built. With the aim of obtaining the equivalent stiffness of the bar with V-shaped notch, which is a key parameter affecting the dynamic characteristic of <b>radial</b> stroke <b>loading</b> mechanism, the analytic model of the bar is built and the simulation experiments are designed by means of the orthogonal test method. The analytical results show that the diameter of the bar has the significant influence on the equivalent stiffness of the bar. Furthermore, the equivalent stiffness of the bar with V-shaped notch can be directly calculated according to the equivalent stiffness of smooth bar when h/d 0. 15. By using the cycloid stroke curve, the cropping experimental results for 45 steel bars and 20 steel bars show that the radial impact and vibration of the cropping system are decreased and the bar cross-section qualities have been significantly improved...|$|R
