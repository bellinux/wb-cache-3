5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the <b>Revising</b> Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the <b>Revising</b> Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E

40|$|<b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF (optimal linear {{discriminant}} function by integer programming) is a linear {{discriminant function}} to minimize the number of misclassifications (NM) of training samples by integer programming (IP). However, IP requires large computation (CPU) time. In this paper, it is proposed how to reduce CPU time by using linear programming (LP). In the first phase, <b>Revised</b> LP-OLDF is applied to all cases, and all cases are categorized into two groups: those that are classified correctly or {{those that are not}} classified by support vectors (SVs). In the second phase, <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF is applied to the misclassified cases by SVs. This method is called <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF. In this research, it is evaluated whether NM of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF is good estimate of the minimum number of misclassifications (MNM) by <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. Four kinds of the real data—Iris data, Swiss bank note data, student data, and CPD data—are used as training samples. Four kinds of 20, 000 re-sampling cases generated from these data are used as the evaluation samples. There are a total of 149 models of all combinations of independent variables by these data. NMs and CPU times of the 149 models are compared with <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF and <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. The following results are obtained: 1) <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF significantly improves CPU time. 2) In the case of training samples, all 149 NMs of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF are equal to the MNM of <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. 3) In the case of evaluation samples, most NMs of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF are equal to NM of <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. 4) Generalization abilities of both discriminant functions are concluded to be high, because the difference between the error rates of training and evaluation samples are almost within 2 %.   Therefore, <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF is recommended for the analysis of big data instead of <b>Revised</b> IP-OLDF. Next, <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF is compared with LDF and logistic regression by 100 -fold cross validation using 100 re-sampling samples. Means of error rates of <b>Revised</b> IPLP-OLDF are remarkable fewer than those of LDF and logistic regression. </p...|$|R
