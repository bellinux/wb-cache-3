5000|$|A player's {{handedness}} {{is determined}} by which side of their body they hold their stick. A player who shoots left (alternatively called a left-handed shot) holds the stick such that the blade is (normally) {{to the left of}} their body, with the left <b>hand</b> on the <b>bottom</b> and the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> on top; a player who shoots right (a right-handed shot) holds the stick such that the blade is to their right, with the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> at the <b>bottom</b> and left <b>hand</b> on top. The <b>bottom</b> <b>hand</b> delivers most of the power while the top hand is responsible for control and stickhandling, as well as the [...] "whip" [...] of your shots. Of the 852 players who skated in the 2007-08 NHL regular season, 554 of 852 (65%) shoot left. Many natural <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> players shoot left and vice versa. This {{is due to the fact}} that if someone is naturally <b>right</b> <b>handed,</b> they may shoot left because the top <b>hand</b> (<b>right</b> <b>hand</b> on a lefty stick) controls most of the stick's action.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to have the third with a sus chord, the third being generally voiced above the fourth (i.e. as a tenth), though this is not absolutely necessary. An example of having the third with a sus chord {{would be to have}} the root doubled below middle C (C4), using G2 and G3, played with the left hand, and using the <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> (from the <b>bottom</b> up) middle C (suspended 4th), F, A, and B (the third).|$|R

The 2-centavos and 4-centavos were used again and also a 6-centavos violet « Magellan », 8-centavos brown « López de Legazpi » and 10-centavos blue « Henry Ware Lawton ». 50,000 of the 2 and 4-centavos and 25,000 of the 6, 8, and 10-centavos were issued in sheets of 100. Again the <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> selvage removed for all <b>right</b> <b>handed</b> sheets.

50|$|The term {{free point}} {{is used to}} {{describe}} the delineating point between the stuck pipe and the free pipe in a pipe string. Every joint of pipe above the free point is free, meaning it can rotate freely and be moved {{in and out of the}} hole, provided it was not attached to the remaining joints of stuck pipe below the free point. A good way to visualize this is to hold a piece of string with your left <b>hand.</b> With your <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> grab the <b>bottom</b> third of that string. The 2/3rds of the string above your <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> would be considered free, since you can move the string however you may like. The section of string inside and below your <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> is stuck, since no matter what you do to the free string it will not affect the string in or below your <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
