5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common <b>redpoll</b> and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E
25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary <b>redpoll,</b> common <b>redpoll,</b> snow bunting, and Lapland longspur. The snow goose, common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl {{that live in the}} region.|$|E
5000|$|Genus Carduelis - linnets, <b>redpolls,</b> goldfinches, greenfinches, some siskins ...|$|R
50|$|Indigenous birds include coots, moorhens, red kites, and buzzards. Winter {{visitors}} include lesser <b>redpolls</b> and bramblings.|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} diverse habitats, {{including}} open water, alder carr woodland and tall fen. There {{is a large}} rookery high in the trees, {{and there are other}} birds such as siskins, chaffinches and <b>redpolls.</b>|$|R
25|$|Colliers' Wood is a 14 hectare {{community}} woodland, {{part of the}} Greenwood Community Forest, {{created in}} 1996/97 to reclaim some of the woodland and fields destroyed by the mining developments. Over 17,500 trees and hedgerows were planted, and two ponds created. The footpath is made from reclaimed shale. Habitats cater {{to a wide variety}} of birds, including mute swans, goldfinches, lesser <b>redpoll,</b> skylarks, and willow warblers.|$|E
500|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities. A black-winged stilt, which acquired the nickname [...] "Sammy", arrived in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005. Other rarities in recent years include a Baird's sandpiper, a broad-billed sandpiper, a thrush nightingale and an Arctic <b>redpoll,</b> all in 2004, a stilt sandpiper in 2005, and a black-winged pratincole and a black-headed wagtail in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Central Marsh and Pool is {{a diverse}} {{area where the}} main flora is common reed, reed sweetgrass, sedges, bulrushes and teasel. Willow trees are {{particularly}} important in this habitat as they have over 250 species of insect associated with them. [...] Alder trees support birds such as <b>redpoll,</b> siskin and various tit species. [...] Beyond Central Marsh lies West Marsh Pool, a small area of water surrounded by reedbed, where a number of dragonfly pools have been dug. [...] Plants which thrive in damp areas, such as marsh marigold and meadowsweet, flourish here.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} wet woodland, grazing marsh, ponds and dykes. There are birds such as sparrowhawks, woodcocks, <b>redpolls,</b> siskins {{and the three}} species of woodpecker. Flora include opposite-leaved golden-saxifrage, bog pimpernel and the nationally scarce marsh fern.|$|R
5000|$|The bird is {{variable}} in plumage, with adults resembling very dark <b>redpolls.</b> The foreparts are sooty and the forehead is red; juveniles have buff-brown heads. The call is a rapid, shrill [...] "titihihihihihi", resembling {{that of a}} Linnet.|$|R
50|$|Over 100 {{species of}} birds have been {{recorded}} on the mountain, including pheasants, hawks and eagles, doves, cuckoos and owls, woodpeckers, tits, larks, warblers, nuthatches, thrushes, redstart, flycatchers, <b>redpolls,</b> finches, and buntings. Rare species have included Przevalski's redstart, Güldenstädt's redstart, and Pallas's rosefinch.|$|R
500|$|Large {{numbers of}} ducks winter on the reserve, {{including}} many Eurasian wigeons, Eurasian teals, mallards and gadwalls, and smaller counts of goldeneyes and northern pintails. Offshore, {{there may be}} large [...] "rafts" [...] of common scoters, and smaller numbers of common eiders, long-tailed ducks, velvet scoters and red-throated divers. Brent geese feed on sea lettuce and other green algae, and hundreds of European golden plovers may roost on the reserve at high tide. In the evenings, large flocks of pink-footed geese fly over Titchwell {{on their way to}} roost, and barn owls and hen harriers quarter the marshes. This is the season for flocks of lesser redpolls, sometimes accompanied by a rarer common <b>redpoll,</b> and snow buntings are to be found on the beach.|$|E
500|$|The South Exmoor SSSI is smaller, {{covering}} [...] {{and including}} the River Barle and its tributaries with submerged plants such as alternate water-milfoil (Myriophyllum alterniflorum). There are small areas of semi-natural woodland within the site, including some which are ancient. The most abundant tree species is sessile oak (Quercus petraea), the shrub layer is very sparse and the ground flora includes bracken, bilberry {{and a variety of}} mosses. The heaths have strong breeding populations of birds, including whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) and European stonechat (Saxicola rubicola). Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) are common near stone boundary walls and other stony places. Grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia) breed in scrub and tall heath. Trees on the moorland edges provide nesting sites for Lesser <b>redpoll</b> (Acanthis cabaret), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic <b>redpoll</b> and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
50|$|The <b>redpolls</b> (in Britain also {{historically}} {{known as}} redpoles) are {{a group of}} small passerine birds in the finch family Fringillidae which have characteristic red markings on their heads. They are placed in the genus Acanthis. The genus name Acanthis is from the Ancient Greek akanthis, a name for a small now-unidentifiable bird.|$|R
50|$|He {{has written}} 27 {{different}} books on birds, including Rare Birds in Britain 1800-1990 {{and a number}} of volumes in his Rare Birds and Scarce Migrants of... series as well as producing a large number of identification papers (such as those on white wagtails, <b>redpolls,</b> Hume's yellow-browed warbler, etc.) and was instrumental in launching the Bird Information Service and its associated magazine and Birdlines.|$|R
5000|$|The true finches {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerine {{birds in the}} family Fringillidae. Finches have stout conical bills adapted for eating seeds and often have colourful plumage. They occupy a great range of habitats where they are usually resident and do not migrate. They have a worldwide distribution except for Australia and the polar regions. The family includes species known as siskins, canaries, <b>redpolls,</b> serins, grosbeaks and euphonias.|$|R
2500|$|The fauna {{to be met}} on {{the trail}} is {{relatively}} poor {{due to the fact}} that the region was long ago penetrated by human beings. Bears, volves, once numerous, especially in the pass areas, are extinct. Badgers, mouflons occur relatively rarely, especially in the topmost regions along the trail. One representative of alpine fauna is the mountain shrew. The world of birds is much richer, comprising among others black grouse, Tengmalm's owl, alpine accentor, water pipit, common <b>redpoll,</b> Western Capercaillie. [...] Numerous nonvertebrates also occur in the alpine zone.|$|E
2500|$|No {{fewer than}} 287 {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} on the island. In spring (May through mid-June) and fall (August through October), many rare birds, including Siberian vagrants, may be spotted on the island. [...] The cliffs of Saint Paul, Saint George and Otter Island support large numbers of breeding seabirds, including critical nesting habitat for the very range-restricted red-legged kittiwake. [...] The auk family is well represented here, with horned and tufted puffin, thick-billed and common murre, parakeet, crested and least auklets and ancient murrelet occurring as breeders, and several other species occurring as vagrants or seasonal visitors. [...] Breeding ducks include long-tailed duck, northern pintail, and green-winged teal. [...] Breeding shorebirds include semipalmated plover, the Pribilof subspecies of rock sandpiper, least sandpiper and red-necked phalarope. [...] Breeding landbirds are few, but include insular subspecies of gray-crowned rosy finch and Pacific wren, snow bunting, Lapland longspur, and the occasional hoary or common <b>redpoll,</b> or common raven. [...] Saint Paul Island Tours (part of the TDX Corp.) runs a natural history tourist program to the island of Saint Paul from May through early October, offering interested visitors the chance to explore the avifauna of the island.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Redpoll</b> {{laughed at}} his own joke, but Peter didn't see the joke at all. [...] "Is it so very far?" [...] he asked innocently; then added, [...] "I'd dearly love to go." ...|$|E
50|$|The site is {{associated}} with a range of rare fauna, including woodlark and the silverstudded blue butterfly (Plebejus argus), both of which breed in the heathland area. The site is also home to the Devon carpet moth (Lampropteryx otregiata), which may be found only on this site within the whole of Berkshire; also the snipe and jack snipe visit the pools in winter, whilst siskins and <b>redpolls</b> have been recorded feeding in the alders.|$|R
50|$|All <b>redpolls</b> are {{northern}} breeding woodland species, {{associated with}} birch trees (although there are introduced {{populations in the}} southern hemisphere, in New Zealand and nearby Subantarctic Islands). They are small birds, brown or grey-brown above and with a red forehead patch. The adult male's breast is washed in red, but in females and young birds the buff breast and white belly are streaked with brown. The bill is small and yellow. Some birds, particularly young ones, are difficult to assign to species.|$|R
50|$|Coal tits {{will form}} small flocks in winter with other tits. This species resembles other tits in acrobatic skill and restless activity, though it more {{frequently}} pitches on a trunk, and in little hops resembles a treecreeper (Certhia). Its food {{is similar to}} that of the others; it is keen on beechmast, picks out the seeds from fir (Abies) and larch (Larix) cones, and joins Carduelis <b>redpolls</b> and siskins in alders (Alnus) and birches (Betula). It will also visit gardens to feed on a variety of foods put out, particularly sunflower seeds.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Redpoll</b> laughed {{harder than}} ever. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "it is. I am afraid {{you would be}} a very old and very gray Rabbit by the time you got there. I guess the next thing is for you to make the {{acquaintance}} of some of us who get down here once in awhile." ...|$|E

Anthus obscurus [...] Rock Pipit. [...] 4. Linota rufescens [...] Lesser <b>Redpoll</b> (closely allied races in [...] N. Asia and N. America). [...] 5. Loxia pityopsittacus [...] Parrot Crossbill (a closely allied form [...] in N. Asia).|$|E
6000|$|<b>Redpoll</b> called {{softly and}} {{almost at once}} was joined by another red-capped bird but without the pink breast, and with sides more heavily streaked. [...] "This is Mrs. Redpoll," [...] {{announced}} her lively little mate. Then {{he turned to her}} and added, [...] "I've just been telling Peter Rabbit that as long as he cannot visit our beautiful Far North he must become acquainted with those of us who come down here in the winter. I'm sure he'll find us very friendly folks." ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{avifauna}} of the Thule {{district was}} studied during three breeding season visits in 1983 - 85. The {{results are presented}} here, supplemented by data from four late summer expeditions made in 1983 - 86 by M. Lea, A. Erskine and W. Higgs. Counting the two <b>redpolls</b> as one, 47 species have been recorded from the Thule district, 17 of them seabirds, 10 shorebirds and 7 waterfowl. There are at least 21 species with established breeding populations. Status changes are demonstrated for three species, and three Nearctic species are recorded here for the Thule district for the first time...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{white-tailed deer}} {{consider}} birch a [...] "secondary-choice food", {{it is an}} important dietary component. In Minnesota, white-tailed deer eat considerable amounts of paper birch leaves in the fall. Snowshoe hares browse paper birch seedlings. Porcupines feed on the inner bark of the tree and beavers will also feed on the tree. The seeds of paper birch {{are an important part of}} the diet of many birds and small mammals including chickadees, <b>redpolls,</b> voles, and ruffed grouse. Yellow bellied sapsuckers drill holes in the bark of paper birch to get at the sap, this is one of their favorite trees for feeding on.|$|R
50|$|Their {{seasonal}} {{distribution is}} also {{marked by the}} fact that they follow an anomalous migration pattern. Every few years they migrate southwards in larger numbers and the overwintering populations in the Iberian Peninsula are greatly augmented. This event has been the object of diverse theories, one theory suggests that it occurs in the years when Norway Spruce produces abundant fruit in the centre and north of Europe, causing populations to increase. An alternative theory is that greater migration occurs when the preferred food of alder or birch seed fails. This species will form large flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with <b>redpolls.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>Redpoll</b> laughed {{his usual}} happy laugh. [...] "Hardly, Peter," [...] replied he. [...] "We like {{the seeds of}} the birches and the alders, and we eat {{the seeds of the}} {{evergreen}} trees when we get them. Sometimes we find them in cones Snipper the Crossbill has opened but hasn't picked all the seeds out of. Sometimes he drops some for us. Oh, we always manage to get plenty to eat. There are some of our relatives over there and we must join them. We'll see you again, Peter." ...|$|E
60|$|In March, 1869, Mr. J. Jenner Weir communicated a {{valuable}} {{series of observations}} made during many years, but more especially in the two preceding summers, in his aviary, containing the following birds of more or less insectivorous habits:--Robin, Yellow-Hammer, Reed-bunting, Bullfinch, Chaffinch, Crossbill, Thrush, Tree-Pipit, Siskin, and <b>Redpoll.</b> He found that hairy caterpillars were uniformly rejected; five distinct species were quite unnoticed by all his birds, and were allowed to crawl about the aviary for days with impunity. The spiny caterpillars of the Tortoiseshell and Peacock butterflies were equally rejected; but in both these cases Mr. Weir thinks it is the taste, not the hairs or spines, that are disagreeable, because some very young caterpillars of a hairy species were rejected although no hairs were developed, and the smooth pupæ of the above-named butterflies were refused as persistently as the spined larvæ. In these cases, then, both hairs and spines {{would seem to be}} mere signs of uneatableness.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationships}} among the redpolls are unresolved. The lesser <b>redpoll</b> co-occurs with the mealy <b>redpoll</b> (subspecies flammea of the common <b>redpoll)</b> in southern Norway, apparently without significant interbreeding though sympatry was established too recently to draw firm conclusions.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is similar}} in size and shape to a linnet, at 13 to 13.5 cm long. It lacks the red head patch and breast shown by the linnet and the <b>redpolls.</b> It is brown {{streaked}} with black above, and a pink rump. The underparts are buff to whitish, streaked with brown. The conical bill is yellow in winter and grey in summer. The call is a distinctive twit, from which its name derives, and the song contains fast trills and twitters. [...] Twites can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches on coasts and salt marshes. They feed mainly on seeds.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of bird species were at one time {{assigned}} to the genus but it became clear from phylogenetic studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences that the genus was polyphyletic. The polyphyletic nature of the genus was confirmed by Dario Zuccon and coworkers in a comprehensive study of the finch family published in 2012. The authors suggested splitting the genus into several monophyletic clades, a proposal that was accepted by the International Ornithologists' Union. The siskins and goldfinches from the Americas formed a distinct clade and were moved to the resurrected genus Spinus, the greenfinches were moved to the genus Chloris, the twite and linnets formed another clade and were moved to the genus Linaria and finally the <b>redpolls</b> were moved to the genus Acanthis.|$|R
5000|$|As with Charles Darwin, a youth spent {{shooting}} {{game birds}} - black or red grouse, common pheasant, partridge - {{led to a}} more general interest. Unlike Darwin, however, Newton's interest stayed with birds, {{some of which were}} rare even in those days. They included the great bustard (Otis tarda), Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus), ravens, buzzards (Buteo sp.), <b>redpolls,</b> wrynecks (Jynx), which are small woodpeckers that specialise in feeding on ants. [...] "The vast warrens of the 'Breck', the woods and water-meadows of the valley of the Little Ouse, and the neighbouring Fenland made an ideal training-ground for a naturalist". This enthusiasm he shared with his younger brother Edward: the two carried out bird observation when they were together and corresponded whenever they were apart.|$|R
