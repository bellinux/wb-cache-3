2500|$|The {{time that}} *z, a voiced apical {{alveolar}} fricative, represented in runic writing by the algiz rune, changed to ʀ, an apical post-alveolar approximant, is debated.

There is, however, no trace {{of that in the}} Elder Futhark runic inscriptions, so it can be safely assumed that the quality of this consonant must have changed before the devoicing, or the phoneme would not have been marked with a rune different from the sowilō rune used for s.
