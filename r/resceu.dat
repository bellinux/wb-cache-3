40|$|It {{is assumed}} that during inflation, all energy was {{contained}} in a slow-rolling inflaton field ϕ. The particles constituting the Universe are created due to interactions with the field ϕ coherently oscillating after inflation. The leading channel of the particle production would be the non-perturbative regime of parametric resonance, preheating. Some of the recent developments {{in the theory of}} preheating are briefly reviewed. As a prototype we use the model λ 4 ϕ^ 4 + m^ 2 2 ϕ^ 2 + g^ 2 2 ϕ^ 2 χ^ 2 in an expanding universe. In different domains of parameters the character of preheating (ϕ→χ) or (ϕ→δϕ) is different, ranging from regular Lamé to stochastic parametric resonances. Fortunately, in many important cases simple analytic resonant solutions are found. Eventually, a picture which unifies the different regimes emerges. Comment: 8 pages, in: 3 rd <b>RESCEU</b> Symp.

40|$|We discuss {{effects of}} cosmological moduli fields on the cosmic {{microwave}} background (CMB). If a modulus field ϕ once dominates the universe, the CMB we observe today is from the decay of ϕ and its anisotropy is affected by the primordial fluctuation in the amplitude of the modulus field. As a result, constraints on the inflaton potential from the CMB anisotropy can be relaxed. In addition, with the cosmological moduli fields, correlated mixture of adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations may be generated, which results in enhanced CMB angular power spectrum at higher multipoles relative to that of lower ones. Such an enhancement can be an evidence of late time entropy production due to the cosmological moduli fields, and may be observed at on-going and future experiments.

We show that such a halo, with temperature ∼ 1 and column density ∼ O(10 ^ 21) cm^- 2, is a possible source for the excess low-energy component in the X-ray background. The halo should also generate temperature anisotropies in the microwave background via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. Assuming an isothermal spherical halo with the above temperature and density, the amplitude of the induced quadrupole turns out to be comparable to the COBE data without violating the upper limit on the y-parameter.

40|$|We discuss two {{important}} modifications of inflationary paradigm. Until very recently {{we believed that}} inflation automatically leads to flatness of the universe, Omega = 1. We also thought that post-inflationary phase transitions in GUTs may occur only after thermalization, which made {{it very difficult to}} have baryogenesis in GUTs and to obtain superheavy topological defects after inflation. We will describe a very simple version of chaotic inflation which leads to a division of the universe into infinitely many open universes with all possible values of Omega from 1 to 0. We will show also that in many inflationary models quantum fluctuations of scalar and vector fields produced during reheating are much greater than they would be in a state of thermal equilibrium. This leads to cosmological phase transitions of a new type, which may result in an efficient GUT baryogenesis, in a copious production of topological defects and in a secondary stage of inflation after reheating.

40|$|Mounting {{observational}} data {{confirm that}} about 73 % {{of the energy}} density con-sists of dark energy {{which is responsible for}} the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. We present observational evidences and dark energy projects. We then review various theoretical ideas that have been proposed to explain the origin of dark energy; they contain the cosmological constant, modified matter models, modified gravity models and the inhomogeneous model. The cosmological constant suffers from two major problems: one regarding fine-tuning and the other regarding coincidence. To solve them there arose modified matter models such as quintessence, k-essence, coupled dark energy, and unified dark energy. We compare those mod-els by presenting attractive aspects, new rising problems and possible solutions. Furthermore we review modified gravity models that lead to late-time accelerated expansion without invoking a new form of dark energy; they contain f(R) gravity and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. We also discuss observational constraints on those models and on future modified gravity theories. Finally we review the inhomogeneous Lemâıtre-Tolman-Bondi model that drops an assumption of the spa-tial homogeneity of the Universe.

40|$|Based on a thoeretical {{model in}} which scalar fields play crucial roles, we propose a {{mechanism}} to better understand a cosmological constant expected to be small (nearly comparable with the critical density) but nonzero as suggested strongly by the recent observations. We emphasize that a step further is needed beyond the simplest scenario of a decaying cosmological constant, according to which the effective Λ is not a true constant but decays like t^- 2, thus explaining why any effect of Λ which {{is assumed to be}} of the Planckian order of magnitude in the earliest Universe is at most 120 orders smaller today (t∼ 10 ^ 60 in units of the Planck time), without any extreme fine-tuning of the parameters. In addition to the overall smooth fall-off ∼ t^- 2, the total energy density, the sum of the contributions from the ordinary matter and the scalar fields, must show some leveling-off behavior, hence mimicking a truly constant Λ to fit the observations. We find that the desired behavior can be obtained by introducing two scalar fields interacting with each other in a specific manner. Many aspects of this model are discussed in detail, including the real origin of the whole mechanism, and how the parameters and the initial conditions of the theory can be determined by the cosomological parameters at the present epoch as well as the past history of the Universe.

40|$|Since Italy’s {{entry into}} the ERM in 1978, the {{strategic}} goal of the country’s center-left elites has been to firmly anchor Italy’s unstable and weak political economy within “Europe. ” Pursuing this goal has been a balancing act: molding an external constraint in Brussels to make it domestically “manageable”; forcing compliance at home through structural and institutional reform. Admission into the EMU with {{the first group of}} countries in 1998 was an emblematic sign of success: Italy was able to become a “pupil” of the top league of Europe. But it remained an (increasingly) bad pupil, especially under Berlusconi. When the crisis hit in 2008, Italy’s political economy quickly became a shambles again. The risk of being downgraded to a “program country” under Troika surveillance loomed on the horizon. As in the early 1990 s, a technocratic government, led this time by Monti, adopted a harsh reform package and tied the country’s hands with a much stricter external constraint: the Fiscal Compact. In 2014, Italy exited the EU’s EDP and MIP procedures: back to the classroom. Under Letta and, more openly, under Renzi, Italy has also become more assertive, in an attempt to re-mold the external constraint in a more favorable direction. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the country’s political economy will be able to fully overcome the crisis and sustain the European political ambitions of the Renzi government.
