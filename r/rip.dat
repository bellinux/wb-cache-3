40|$|AbstractRibosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (<b>RIPs)</b> display adenine polynucleotide glycosylase {{activity on}} different nucleic acid substrates, {{which at the}} ribosomal level {{is responsible for the}} arrest of protein synthesis. Some type 2 <b>RIPs,</b> namely ricin and related proteins, are extremely toxic to mammalian cells and animals whilst other type 2 <b>RIPs</b> (non-toxic type 2 <b>RIPs)</b> display three to four logs less toxicity. We studied whether a correlation exists between toxicity on cells and enzymatic activity on nucleic acids. All type 2 <b>RIPs</b> differ in their depurinating activity on the different substrates with differences of up to one to two logs. The toxicity of type 2 <b>RIPs</b> is independent of their enzymatic activity on nucleic acids or on ribosomes...|$|R

The depurinating activity of <b>RIPs</b> on E. coli ribosomes was also evaluated. Only six type 1 <b>RIPs</b> inhibited endogenous mRNA-directed translational activity of E. coli lysates, with submicromolar 50 % inhibitory concentrations.

40|$|Growth of Pinus radiata D. Don was {{examined}} after a harvesting and tillage trial at Taringatura in the South Island of New Zealand; in that experiment forest soils had {{been subjected to}} various intensities of traffic by a range of harvesting machinery, followed by <b>ripping</b> of the soil. Harvesting traffic disturbed but did not compact the soil. Soil penetration resistance was markedly decreased by <b>ripping</b> but not significantly affected by traffic intensity. <b>Ripping</b> increased and traffic reduced the stem volume of P. radiata. Most notably, there was an interaction between <b>ripping</b> and traffic: stem volume increased {{with the number of}} passes of harvesting machines on <b>ripped</b> soils but decreased with the number of passes on non-ripped soils. This was explained by traffic reducing the competitive weeds in the <b>ripped</b> treatments...|$|R

40|$|Survival {{and growth}} of Pinus radiata on a low-quality texture-contrast soil in {{north-eastern}} Tasmania were compared {{over a five-year period}} following five different cultivation treatments: no cultivation, <b>ripping,</b> mounding, <b>ripping</b> + mounding or spot cultivation. Soil penetration resistance after two years, and root abundance after 4. 5 years, were also measured. After five years, {{there were no significant differences}} in survival between treatments. <b>Ripping</b> + mounding produced the best height growth after five years, followed by mounding, <b>ripping,</b> spot cultivation and lastly no cultivation. However, only mounding and <b>ripping</b> + mounding produced significantly greater height growth compared to no cultivation. Comparisons of plot mean basal area (m 2) and volume per hectare (m 3 ha- 1) showed trends similar to mean height after five years, with <b>ripping</b> + mounding producing the highest basal area and volume. However, only the differences between <b>ripping</b> + mounding and no cultivation were significant. Soil penetration resistance, measured after two years, was significantly lower at depths < 45 cm following either <b>ripping</b> + mounding or spot cultivation compared to no cultivation. Root abundance after 4. 5 years was significantly higher following <b>ripping</b> + mounding compared to the other four treatments. Growth was therefore consistently superior following <b>ripping</b> + mounding when compared to the other treatments, although the results indicate that any type of cultivation is preferable to no cultivation at all. On highly erodible soils, such as those at the trial site, spot cultivation might be preferable to continuous cultivation (<b>ripping</b> and/or mounding) in order to minimise the risk of erosion and subsequent pollution of waterways by suspended sediments...|$|R

Catching the Joker in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the Joker in a rage; the Joker nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. <b>Rip</b> removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until <b>Rip</b> reveals that the Joker is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. <b>Rip</b> did this to demonstrate to Booster that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E

40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (<b>RIPs)</b> are cytotoxic N-glycosidases {{identified in}} plants, fungi, and bacteria. <b>RIPs</b> inhibit protein synthesis {{by virtue of}} their enzymatic activity, selec-tively cleaving a specific adenine residue from a highly conserved, surface-exposed, stem-loop (S/R loop) structure in the 28 S rRNA of ribosomes. Some <b>RIPs</b> also exhibit a number of other enzymatic activities such as RNase, DNase, phospholipase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD). <b>RIPs</b> are considered to be plant defense-related proteins as they are able to inhibit the multipli-cation and growth of several pathogenic virus, fungi, and bacteria either alone or in conjugation with other defense-related proteins. The mechanism of inhibitory activity of <b>RIPs</b> against fun-gal pathogens seems to be by directly inhibiting fungal growth rather than depurinating host plant ribosomes and causing cell death as previously envisaged. This chapter describes the protocol used to isolate and purify <b>RIPs</b> from plant tissues. Key Words: Antimicrobial activity; depurination; plant defense; ribosome-inactivating protein...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{ribosome}} inactivating proteins (<b>RIPs)</b> are a {{group of}} proteins {{that are able to}} inactivate eukaryotic protein synthesis by attacking the 28 S ribosomal RNA. Recent studies have shown that some <b>RIPs</b> possess strong anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. In this study, several common plant <b>RIPs</b> including agrostin, gelonin, luffin, α-momorcharin, β-momorcharin, saporin and trichosanthin were examined for the ability to interfere with HIV- 1 replication in a variety of mechanistic assays in vitro. These assays included the CD 4 /gp 120 interaction assay, HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) assay, HIV- 1 protease assay and HIV- 1 integrase assay. At the concentration of 100 nM, all <b>RIPs</b> appeared to enhance the CD 4 /gp 120 interaction by about 50 %. These <b>RIPs</b> exhibited a very weak suppressive effect on HIV- 1 RT and on HIV- 1 protease. In contrast, with the exception of agrostin, all the <b>RIPs</b> tested could strongly inhibit HIV- 1 integrase, the extent of inhibition ranging from 26. 1 to 96. 3 % in an ELISA-based assay. Two <b>RIPs,</b> saporin and luffin, which licited over 90 % inhibition in the ELISA-based assay, were further characterized in a radiometric assay. Both of these two <b>RIPs</b> evoked a strong dose-dependent inhibition in the 3 ′-end processing and strand-transfer activities of integrase. The results from this study suggest that the anti-HIV property of <b>RIPs</b> may be due to inhibition of HIV- 1 integrase...|$|R
