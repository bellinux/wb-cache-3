25|$|In the United States, {{national}} {{efforts have}} been made since 1982 for the recovery plan of grizzly bears. A lot of the efforts made have been through different organizations efforts {{to educate the public}} on grizzly bear safety, habits of grizzly bears and different ways to reduce human-bear conflict. The Interagency Grizzly Bear Recovery Committee is one of many organizations committed to the recovery of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. There are five recovery zones for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states including the North Cascades ecosystem in Washington state. The National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife initiated the process of an environmental impact statement that started in the fall of 2014 to begin the recovery process of grizzly bears to the North Cascades region.

40|$|Abstract. The {{focus of}} {{geographic}} and other ontologies of urban devel-opment {{has been to}} represent locations with object attributes or objects with locational attributes. Urban information systems should also repre-sent decisions, which have or could have locational attributes. Develop-ment processes are critically influenced by expectations about declared intentions manifest through plans and <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions.</b> This paper provides an ontology <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> situations characterized by actors par-ticipating, intentions expressed, and alternatives considered. We argue that these elements are closely tied to and interdependent with other aspects of urban ontologies, which typically focus on physical objects of development.

500|$|On August 28, 2014, Stanislaus Forest {{supervisor}} Susan Skalski {{signed a}} <b>Record</b> <b>of</b> <b>Decision</b> approving the Rim Fire Recovery Project. The plan allowed logging within {{an area of}} , including interior portions of the burned area and along roadways. Its goals were to: [...] "Salvage dead trees to capture economic value; remove roadside hazard trees to protect public and worker safety; reduce fuels for future forest resiliency; improve roads for hydrologic function; and, enhance wildlife habitat. A portion of the money captured from the salvage logging was ear-marked for additional projects following the fire." [...] The plan attempted to balance competing interests. Instead of the 660 million board feet initially proposed for logging, the final plan included salvage logging of 210 million board feet. The plan left small areas untouched as snag habitat for Black-Backed Woodpeckers and other snag-dependent wildlife. Instead of building permanent new roads, the plan eliminated permanent new road construction and reduced the mileage of temporary roads {{as part of the}} salvage logging plan. The Forest Service said that the final plan reflected a collaboration between the timber industry and various environmental groups, who had joined together in an attempt to find consensus on the recovery process. Skalski cited that collaborative agreement as being influential in her decision to significantly reduce the amount of salvage material. Forestry officials praised the plan, but some environmental groups denounced it.|$|E
