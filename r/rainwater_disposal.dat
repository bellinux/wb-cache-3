It has 3 different accesses {{to the top and}} a significant elevation with a <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> system. Everything seems to indicate that this area were the homes of noble people.|$|E
50|$|The shrine was deconsecrated in 1993, {{and passed}} into the {{ownership}} of the Historic Chapels Trust a secular charity, in 2000. in a poor state and without an endowment. A £100,000 grant awarded by English Heritage assisted with urgent rescue repairs, completed in April 2008, dealing with the leaking copper roof and improving the <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> system. A larger sum {{will be needed to}} convert the building into a community centre and current fund-raising is focussed on re-installing electrical supplies, rendered unsafe by water ingress, and modern facilities. The Historic Chapels Trust is actively seeking partners to use the space for events once repairs are complete.|$|E
50|$|The hall is a modest, symmetrical, {{single storey}} timber building, low- set on timber stumps, clad in weatherboards, with a hipped roof of {{corrugated}} metal sheeting and eaves lined with timber battens. Its front verandah has a skillion roof with central gable supported on pairs of posts demarcating the entrance, and a cross-braced balustrade. Openings are symmetrically positioned {{around the building}} with: double-hung sash windows on the front elevation {{either side of a}} pair of panelled entrance doors; 6 windows to each side elevation - 4 pairs of casement windows between double-hung sash windows at each end; and 2 pairs of panelled doors at the rear. The <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> system comprises slotted quad gutter and PVC downpipes.|$|E
40|$|Master's {{thesis is}} about multi-residential building, located in Kaunas, {{designed}} for collecting <b>rainwater,</b> wastewater <b>disposal</b> and water supply systems. The building has 9 floors and basement. There is a pantry, water metering unit and heating {{station in the}} basement. The aim of thesis – to investigate the most effective method of collecting rainwater, {{to find out how}} much rainwater can be collected from the roof and from the vertical facades, in accordance with existing normative documents design investigated systems. The building has designed recycling rainwater recovery system. This system collects rainwater from the roof and from the vertical facade. Collected water is used for toilet flushing. This system covering up to 95 % of water used for flushing toilet cisterns. During the years from the roof of the building with an area of 460 m 2 can be collected about 300 m 2 of water. Either during the years from the building's facade, with an area of 1346 m 2 can be collected up to 424 m 2 of rain water. These systems can save 1295 € annually. The building has designed cold, rain and hot water supply systems. Cold water inlet provides multi water meter. Horizontal cold and hot water pipes are laid in the floor structure. Household waste water discharged wastewater stands and marriages in urban sewage networks. Rain water from the roof and facade, is leaking into the collection tank. Rain water from site is collected with two wells an leaked into city raiwater networks. Secondary rainwater utilization system installation price is set up in local estimate...|$|R
40|$|A 6 ? 6 ha (66 000 m 2) {{regeneration}} site, {{commonly referred}} to as Luneside East, is to be turned from a run down, economically under-achieving area of Lancaster, UK, into a new, distinctive, vibrant, sustainable quarter of the city. As a result several aspects of water planning for 350 new homes and 8000 m 2 of workspace needed to be considered before any infrastructure investment was undertaken. This included assessment of the future capacity requirements(i. e. inflows and outflows) for water infrastructure (i. e. mains water supply, wastewater <b>disposal,</b> <b>rainwater</b> storage and stormwater disposal) much of which will be located underground. This paper looks at the implications of various water management strategies on the Luneside East site (e. g. water-efficient appliances, greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting) in line with current policy measures that focus on technology changes alone (e. g. the code for sustainable homes). Based on these findings this paper outlines some basic implications for technological resilience discussed in the context of four ‘world views’ that is, the urban futures scenarios considered in this special issue. Conclusions are drawn as to how far this can take engineers, planners and developers in understanding and planning for resilient water infrastructure within a development like Luneside East...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the CHANGES-project, maintenance practices in the Mechelen urban region are studied based on eleven case studies. The CHANGES-project is a European research project within {{the framework}} of the JPI Cultural Heritage. For the Flemish partners, the project's main aims are amongst others to identify maintenance practices and to study their efficacy and the technical quality of executed interventions. This paper focuses on developing a method of analysis for evaluating the reliability of historic buildings' <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> systems. The aspects that determine the reliability of a historic building's <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> system were identified based on a case study. The analysis does not consider the importance of the sustainability of the conservation process itself, which together with the <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> system's reliability defines its quality. The developed method is validated within the CHANGES-project through its application on a larger set of case studies. The reliability monitoring approach, described in this paper for one case, will allow to understand and evaluate the efficacy of maintenance practices. Furthermore, it analyses the functioning of the historic houses' <b>rainwater</b> <b>disposal</b> system at a conceptual level, which is an added value for the implementation of preventive conservation systems, for future research on the quality of interventions, and for the development of tools and practical implementation of quality management systems in heritage preservation. status: publishe...|$|E
