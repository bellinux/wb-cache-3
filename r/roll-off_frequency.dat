40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{study of the}} response of a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x thin-film microbridge to millimeter wave radiation. The dependencies of the microwave response spectrum on the bias voltage and operating temperature have been measured on samples made from YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x films with different thicknesses. Once the bias voltage exceeds the value corresponding to the first maximum of differential resistance, {{the value of the}} - 3 dB <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency</b> of the microbridge response is drastically reduced. On the other hand, at temperatures close to T-c the <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency</b> rises to about 20 GHz. For high resistivity YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x films with relatively low upper critical magnetic fields the - 3 dB <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency</b> is about 7 GHz even at temperatures much smaller than T-c. To explain the results obtained we consider the presence of two additive mechanisms that contribute to the YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x thin-film microbridge response to microwave radiation: vibration of magnetic vortices and heating of electrons and phonons. The competition between these two mechanisms defines the bias voltage and temperature dependencies of the - 3 dB <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency</b> as well as the recently reported dependence of the intermediate frequency bandwidth of YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x hot-electron bolometer mixers on the local oscillator frequency.

The remnant's X-ray morphology {{does not change}} significantly across the energy range from 3 to 20 keV. A combined fit between NuSTAR and Chandra shows that the spectrum steepens with energy. The spectral shape can be well fitted with synchrotron emission from a power-law electron energy distribution with an exponential cutoff with no additional features. It can also be described by a purely phenomenological model such as a broken power law or a power law with an exponential cutoff, though these descriptions lack physical motivation. Using a fixed radio flux at 1 GHz of 1. 17 Jy for the synchrotron model, we get a column density of N_H = (7. 23 ± 0. 07) × 10 ^(22) cm^(– 2), a spectral index of α = 0. 633 ± 0. 003, and a <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency</b> of ν_(rolloff) = (3. 07 ± 0. 18) × 10 ^(17) Hz.

40|$|This program {{demonstrated}} the technical feasibility of constructing large-stroke magnetic suspensions that {{can meet the}} active vibration isolation requirements of Space Station. These requirements include: (1) strokes over 1 cm in all directions, (2) actuator bandwidths over 100 Hz, (3) isolator roll-off frequencies below 10 (exp - 2) Hertz, and (4) force capability over 1 Newton in all axes. The 100 Hz actuator bandwidth allows the suspension to reject any direct force disturbances that act on the microgravity experiment, for example forces created by cable connections. The low isolator <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency</b> and large stroke allow the magnetic suspension to isolate the microgravity experiment from Space Station vibrations above the <b>roll-off</b> <b>frequency.</b> The capability to meet these requirements was demonstrated by designing, constructing and testing a six-degree-of-freedom, prototype magnetic suspension system that featured high-performance, Lorentz-force actuators and full multi-input, multi-output control. This prototype suspension is designed to isolate large orbiter locker experiments under typical spacecraft constraints of size, weight, and power. Suspension in the full six-degrees-of-freedom was successfully demonstrated in this program while using a gravity-force unload mechanism to simulate a space environment.

The experimental results, which are in close agreement with simulation results, for short and open circuited matching stubs, and band-pass and band-stop filters, clearly show improvements in terms of loss and in the characteristics of the frequency response. Also, in order to make some qualitative assessment of the variation in performance with elevation, results for elevations of 6 μm and 13 μm are compared.

We first measure the dc characteristics and optical spectra of an injection-locked laser to define its locking range and linewidth enhancement factor.
