5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The study {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the loss that the fruit suffer during the storage period in both traditional and <b>refrigerating</b> <b>storage,</b> at the Fruit Research Station Cluj-Napoca, Romania. There were gathered biochemical data for four winter maturation apple varieties: Jonathan, Golden Delicious, Starkrimson and Wagener Premiat, during the months of October (at storage), December and March. The determined biochemical aspects were water, total sugar, and ascorbic acid. The <b>refrigerating</b> <b>storage</b> was better in comparison with the traditional storage, confirmed by biochemical composition. The lowest dehydration was for the apples stored in the <b>refrigerating</b> room. By <b>storage</b> method and apples varieties comparison, the lowest water loss was shown by Wagener Premiat varieties and the highest by Jonathan in <b>refrigerating</b> <b>storage</b> in comparison with traditional storage. Wagener Premiat varieties showed the best qualities even for total sugar and ascorbic acid in comparison with the others apples varieties studied.

25|$|Reading Terminal Market (pronounced RED-ing /ˈrɛdɪŋ/) is an {{enclosed}} public market located at 12th and Arch Streets in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It opened originally in 1893 under the elevated train shed of the Reading Railroad Company {{after the city}} of Philadelphia advocated to move public markets from the streets into indoor facilities for both safety and sanitary reasons.The Reading Railroad Company owned and operated the market space until 1976 when the company liquidated, leaving the market without its parent company and foot traffic from the train. Presently, it still occupies the ground floor and basement levels of the Reading Terminal's former train shed which {{is now part of}} the Philadelphia Convention Center. Vendor stalls occupy the ground floor with entrances on Filbert Street to the South, Twelfth Street to the West, and Arch Street to the North. The stalls are arranged in a grid pattern with an open area in the center with tables and seating. Over one hundred merchants offer fresh produce, meats, fish, artisan cheese, groceries, ice cream, flowers, grilled cheese, baked goods, crafts, books, clothing, and specialty and ethnic foods. Two of the vendors are descendants of original merchants from the initial opening in the late 1800s. The basement floor of the market holds the state-of-the-art <b>refrigerated</b> <b>storage</b> area for vendor use. Currently, the market is open {{every day of the week}} although the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants (a small but significant minority) generally do not operate Sunday through Tuesday.|$|E

Dynamics of water activity and the total microbial count of meat samples during storage at 4 degree C was determined in addition of NaCl and polyphosphates contents. Minimal water activity required for growth of some saprophytic and pathogenic bacterial strains under laboratory conditions was destined by using different type of humectants. The price of lowering water activity of the laboratory media was theoretically discussed, also impact of prolonging food shelf-life on import - export by using the references of the statistical data of international trade was estimated.
