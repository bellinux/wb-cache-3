5|$|Doubles: Adding {{a number}} to itself {{is related to}} {{counting}} by two and to multiplication. Doubles facts form a backbone for many related facts, and students find them <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to grasp.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{transitions}} {{are rather}} sharp (~10meV) and strong. Consequently, it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to selectively excite nanotubes having certain (n,m) indices, {{as well as}} to detect optical signals from individual nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} system featured triple-cone synchromeshing on {{first and second}} gears to handle rapid starts, whilst remaining <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> for the driver to engage and providing positive feel.|$|E
50|$|Among all the {{molecular}} symmetries, diatomic molecules show some distinct features {{and they are}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> to analyze.|$|R
25|$|The 1930s Great Depression {{contracted}} {{economic activity}} {{and the people of}} Carlingford struggled on. Owners of farms had <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> access to food than labourers.|$|R
50|$|Constructing Flash {{websites}} using Adobe tools is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> {{than with}} integrated development environments for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript; however, many of Adobe's tools are expensive and proprietary software.|$|R
5|$|The rhyme is {{a single}} stanza in trochaic metre, which is common in nursery rhymes and <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> for younger {{children}} to master. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 4439 and variations have been collected across Great Britain and North America.|$|E
5|$|There are 25 {{main routes}} {{to the summit}} with {{alternates}} of those main routes. They range in difficulty from the <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> non-technical South Spur (South Climb) route to the extremely challenging and dangerous Victory Ridge, Rusk Glacier Headwall, and Wilson Glacier Headwall routes up Roosevelt Cliff.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
50|$|Cockpits can be {{of several}} designs. They can be large or small. A large keyhole cockpit can give the {{advantages}} of both, and combine firm contact between paddler and boat, while offering <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> access.|$|R
30|$|This {{form of the}} {{advection}} {{equation is}} linear and is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> to deal with (LeVeque 2004). In solving this kind of hyperbolic PDEs, different capturing schemes have been developed which can be classified as classical or traditional and modern techniques.|$|R
2500|$|The {{kitchen is}} {{typically}} {{situated in the}} southern end of the courtyard, the hearth is identified with sexual organs. The kitchen is usually the simplest structure in a Balinese compound. A kitchen usually employs a gable roof which is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> than hip roof construction.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere in the massif, the Montenvers Railway connects Chamonix to Montenvers {{near the}} foot of the Mer de Glace, whilst the Téléphérique du Lognan connects Argentière with Aiguille des Grands Montets, where Les Grand Montets is an {{important}} winter skiing area in the region. At , the summit station also provides <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> access for climbers to the northeastern peaks of the range, including short introductory rock scrambles and a simple ice-face route on the NW face of the Petite Aiguille Verte.|$|E
5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI {{had not been able}} to achieve up to this point.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are <b>relatively</b> <b>easy,</b> logical, and straightforward.|$|E
50|$|During the Second World War, Kalay was an {{important}} regrouping point for the British during their retreat from Burma in 1942 because of the <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> access to India along the Manipur River (the alternative was to march through malarial forests from Kalewa to Tamu).|$|R
5000|$|The {{kitchen is}} {{typically}} {{situated in the}} southern end of the courtyard, the hearth is identified with sexual organs. The kitchen is usually the simplest structure in a Balinese compound. A kitchen usually employs a gable roof which is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> than hip roof construction.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{enforcing}} equal remuneration of identical characteristics {{seems to have}} been <b>relatively</b> <b>easier,</b> especially {{at the top of the}} wage distribution, where competitive forces were very likely working in the same direction, with employers competing for the most skilled individuals of both genders.|$|R
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, Vanille was {{originally}} {{going to be}} the main character, but after the game was shown off with Lightning in the central role, the decision was scrapped. In an interview with Siliconera, Vanille's English voice actor stated that she found it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> connecting with the character because of the similarities in their basic personalities. Vanille is voiced by Georgia van Cuylenburg in English, and by Yukari Fukui in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis can be {{separated}} from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be confused with P.robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P.robustus versus dichotomous in P.acicularis) {{and the lack of}} a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P.acicularis make it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to distinguish between the two.|$|E
30|$|Factor 3 : The {{concepts}} about {{contradictions in}} TRIZ are <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> {{to be understood}} for the engineers in China. And there is a systematic process and knowledge to solve contradictions in TRIZ. Many cases in different domains are analogies for engineers to solve their own contradictions (Tan, 2007).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} semi-proving method for verifying {{necessary}} conditions for program correctness. Our approach {{is based on}} the integration of global symbolic evaluation and metamorphic testing. It is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> than conventional program proving, and helps to alleviate the problem that software testing cannot show the absence of faults. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The Inclusion-Exclusion(I. E.) {{principle}} {{is an important}} counting concept in combi-natorics. It is also very important {{in the study of}} the distribution of prime numbers. In this paper, we introduce an equivalent- and in some cases a <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> to apply- form of the concept. We also provide some applications. ...|$|R
5|$|Rehearsals {{with the}} full Spider set were staged in Rotterdam's Ahoy Stadium {{starting}} on 18 May before moving to De Kuip stadium for the dress rehearsals (27 and 28 May). Due to <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> access to the venues during rehearsals, fans knew what the set list for the show would be before the tour even opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, {{as it is}} <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly {{over the last few}} decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.|$|E
5|$|The total {{fertility}} rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman. Adoption in the United States is common and <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> {{from a legal}} point of view (compared to other Western countries). In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for {{nearly half of the}} total number of adoptions worldwide. Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.|$|E
40|$|As {{the nature}} of the culture {{ecosystem}} differs, the applicability of the undermen tioned guidelines may also vary. In the enclosed water culture ecosystem, disease prevent ion is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> than that of the open sea culture ecosystems in cages and pens wherein control over the ecosystem can be only minimal or precticallynil...|$|R
50|$|If energy A is <b>{{relatively}}</b> <b>easier</b> {{to convert}} to energy B but energy B is relatively harder {{to convert to}} energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being {{higher than that of}} B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).|$|R
50|$|The binding ligand affinities for the {{different}} transporters is skewed somewhat {{in favor of the}} DAT; there may be some bias in the data. The reason for this could be that WIN35428 is <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> to displace from the DAT versus paroxetine from the SERT, because of the higher binding constant of the former compound.|$|R
5|$|These {{properties}} make it <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> {{to distinguish}} a light metal like sodium from a heavy metal like tungsten, but the differences become less clear at the boundaries. Light structural metals like beryllium, scandium, and titanium {{have some of}} the characteristics of heavy metals, such as higher melting points; post-transition heavy metals like zinc, cadmium, and lead {{have some of the}} characteristics of light metals, such as being relatively soft, having lower melting points, and forming mainly colourless complexes.|$|E
5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with {{a small fraction of}} heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are <b>relatively</b> <b>easy</b> to measure. The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, {{eliciting}} a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting <b>relatively</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|E
30|$|The other {{differential}} diagnosis of deep-seated lipomas includes nerve sheath tumour, giant cell tumour of tendon sheath, haemangioma and haematoma. These are <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> in correlation with the clinical history (age, onset, etc.), based on imaging features, and associated findings like anatomical site and vascularity; phleboliths and serial change on imaging follow-up often give additional clues.|$|R
50|$|A {{value-added}} tax, {{like the}} GST, also has several features {{that make it}} attractive. A tax on consumption, not income, the tax system inherently encourages savings and investments instead of consumption. The tax also has a self-policing mechanism that discourages evasion, unlike a retail sales tax system or an income tax system, which would be <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> to evade.|$|R
50|$|A naturalistic planned {{language}} is a constructed language specifically devised to reproduce the commonalities in morphology and vocabulary {{from a group of}} closely related languages, usually with the idea that such a language will be <b>relatively</b> <b>easier</b> to use passively -- in many cases, without prior study -- by speakers of one or more languages in the group.|$|R
