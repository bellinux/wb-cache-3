5000|$|The <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and {{ill health}} at work {{has long been a}} legal {{requirement}} in the UK. The information enables the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and local government authorities [...] "to identify where and how risks arise, and to investigate serious accidents".|$|E
50|$|Investigations are {{thorough}} but {{are strictly}} limited to establishing cause, promoting awareness of risks and preventing recurrence. <b>Reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> to the MAIB is mandatory for all commercially operated vessels in UK waters {{and for all}} UK registered vessels worldwide. The MAIB receives between 1500 and 2000 incident reports annually of which 40 to 50 become full investigations with published reports. The choice of which accidents are investigated is {{made on the basis}} of the scope of the safety lessons which may be learned as a result of the investigation. The reports which are without prejudice, do not apportion blame and do not establish liability.|$|E
50|$|Cycling {{suffers from}} a {{perception}} that it is unsafe. This perception is not always backed by hard numbers, because of under <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and lack of bicycle use data (amount of cycling, kilometers cycled) which {{make it hard to}} assess the risk and monitor changes in risks.In the UK, fatality rates per mile or kilometre are slightly less than those for walking. In the US, bicycling fatality rates are less than 2/3 of those walking the same distance. However, in the UK for example the fatality and serious injury rates per hour of travel are just over double for cycling than those for walking. Thus if a person is, for example, about to undertake a ten kilometre journey to a given destination it may on average be safer to undertake this journey by bicycle than on foot. However, if a person is intending, for example, to undertake an hour's exercise {{it is likely to be}} considerably more dangerous to take that exercise by cycling rather than by walking.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the politics of accident reporting on North Sea oil installations. In {{the context of an}} all-pervasive safety culture and performance assessment system, offshore workers restricted the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents.</b> Other studies suggest that workers often respond to increased monitoring by engaging in defensive practices that manipulate performance information. Accordingly, a central contention of this article is that performance assessment frequently creates employee performances.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a short Spanish-language version of the General Well-Being Questionnaire (GWBQ; Cox & Gotts, 1987), based on the 12 items of its Worn Out scale. Research has shown the English-version Worn Out scale to be sensitive to aspects of the design and management of work. This study aimed to test its crosscultural consistency in a Spanish-language workplace context. The data were collected from a sample of 229 workers in Valencia (Spain). Confirmatory Factor Analyses showed the factorial validity, reliability, and concurrent validity of the new Spanish version to be adequate. The sensitivity of the new measure to safety behavior and the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> was also assessed and shown to be good. The new questionnaire extends the usefulness of the parent questionnaire to occupational health psychology research in the Spanish language by offering a short assessment tool appropriate for workplace studies.

40|$|Although {{the problem}} of {{accident}} under-reporting is increasingly recognized in the literature, less is known regarding work environment variables that predict the severity of such under-reporting. Data on perceived job insecurity and on the numbers of both accidents that were experienced and accidents that were actually reported {{over a period of}} one year were obtained from 786 employees in 24 US organizations and 563 employees in 20 Italian organizations in sectors where safety is highly relevant. Analysis of these data suggested that not only is job insecurity related to the likelihood of experiencing an accident, but also perceptions of job insecurity may serve to inhibit the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> to appropriate company officials. Overall, the rate of accidents was lower in Italy than the United States. Moreover, in both countries, when job insecurity was low, there was little difference between the total number of experienced accidents and the number that employees reported. However, as job insecurity increased, the under-reporting of accidents increased. The implications of these results are discussed in light of the globally increasing prevalence of job insecurity in today's workplace...|$|E
40|$|In Sweden, {{accident}} statistics reveal little, if any, evidence of improvement {{in health and}} safety on construction sites. Accident statistics, which adopt a reactive approach, must not be looked upon as merely numbers and figures. They {{must be able to}} reveal the underlying factors contributing to the accidents. This paper aims to examine construction safety performance based on accidents data from 2000 - 10. Additionally, the impact of rules and regulations implemented prior to 2010 on accident trends are discussed. The findings indicate that while accident frequency seems to be declining, the fatalities recorded remain high with an average of 10 fatalities per year, instilling fear among workers for their safety at work. Analysis of the causes of accidents reveals a high level of repetitions of the same or similar accidents, especially with regard to ‘loss of control’. Changes need to be made to the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents.</b> What is required is to determine the appropriate mitigation strategies, by using analysis of accident reports, to prevent future accidents. Since every accident {{is a reflection of the}} quality of management, it is important for companies to recognise that there is no single reliable measure of health and safety performance but rather a combination of both reactive and proactive measures...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the issue <b>of</b> late <b>reports</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> {{at work in}} an agricultural environment and attempts {{to answer the question}} whether a delay in reporting such an agricultural accident has any influence on the right to claim single indemnity for an accident at work. The first part of the paper determines the conditions that must be satisfied in order for the accident to be considered as reported without delay. Further in the paper, legal consequences <b>of</b> a late <b>report</b> <b>of</b> an <b>accident</b> at work, and the possible limitation of the right to claim compensation are presented. Farmers are often late to notify the insurer about an accident, despite the requirement that such an agricultural accident at work should be reported not later that 6 months following its occurrence. However, there are no legal sanctions if this date is not met. Therefore in practice, a late report does not result in any direct legal consequences, and a late claim is rejected on grounds o f unnecessary delay only if late reporting has impaired the possibility of ascertaining the actual circumstances <b>of</b> the <b>accident.</b> As can be deduced from the statistics <b>of</b> <b>reported</b> agricultural <b>accidents,</b> the current regulations in Poland, although introduced to discipline potential claimants, seem unsatisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} waterborne transportation in the Gulf of Finland, {{the risk of}} a hazardous accident increases and therefore manifold preventive actions are needed. As a main legislative authority in the maritime community, The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set down plenary laws and recommendations which are e. g., utilised in the safe operations in ships and pollution prevention. One of these compulsory requirements, the ISM Code, requires proactive attitude both from the top management and operational workers in the shipping companies. In this study, a crosssectional approach was taken to analyse whether the ISM Code has actively enhanced maritime safety in the Gulf of Finland. The analysis included; 1) performance of the ISM Code in Finnish shipping companies, 2) statistical measurements of maritime safety, 3) influence of corporate top management to the safety culture and 4) comparing safety management practices in shipping companies and port operations of Finnish maritime and port authorities. The main results found were that maritime safety culture has developed in the right direction after the launch of the ISM Code in the 1990 ´s. However, this study does not exclusively prove that the improvements are the consequence of the ISM Code. Accident prone ships can be recognized due to their behaviour and there is a lesson to learn from the safety culture of some high standard safety disciplines such as, air traffic. In addition, the <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> and nearmisses should be more widely used in shipping industry. In conclusion, there is still much to be improved in the maritime safety culture of the Finnish Shipping industry, e. g., a “no blame culture” needs to be adopted...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the accident reporting {{procedures in the}} maritime transportation sector. A parallel study, corresponding to this study, revealed {{a vast amount of}} underreporting by several western flag states. This is resulting in a poor situational awareness, making it difficult to implement sufficient measures and derive a wanted safety level. <b>Reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> is globally regulated by IMO and made mandatory by the flag states‟ regulations. The Norwegian flag state, regulating the procedures for all Norwegian flagged vessels and for all vessels in Norwegian waters has been the main focus in this paper. Reporting of an accident can be visualized as a chain of actors which information has to pass through. Underreporting occurs if the links between the actors are broken. The chain starts in one end with the ship‟s crew and master, being the first to detect any accident. The information is then passed on to the ship owner, who in turn forwards a report to the respective flag state. Alternatively, an accident can be detected by Vessel Traffic Services or by Rescue Coordination Centers. Input for this study was gained through interviewing the actors in the reporting chain and through a literature study of the legislation regulating the procedures. Further, a comparative threshold analysis was carried out to measure the differences in the threshold for reporting an incident for the aviation industry in comparison with the maritime industry. The results indicated that the links in the reporting chain is vulnerable to breaches. The Norwegian legislation seems to be somewhat ineffective with respect to actors placed under a mandatory reporting scheme. The Norwegian legislation is not efficient enough to protect the findings from investigation to be used in other contexts than what it is intended for, meaning that investigation reports are misused as evidences in court. The ship owners appear to be little motivated because they receive little relevant feedback. The seafarers also seem to be withholding reports to their ship owners due to their fear of being punished or fired. Compared to the aviation industry, the maritime transportation sector is characterized by a poor safety culture, meaning that the sector shows little interest in sharing and receiving lessons learned by experience. Much can be transferred from the aviation industry or from other flag states, like the United Kingdom. Reporting performance may be increased by improving regulations, motivation and safety culture. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} based on the results {{obtained}} from two questionnaire studies carried out during 1999 and 2007. The aim of the studies is to increase our knowledge about the attitudes and approach of the police to traffic safety work and how these attitudes have changed with time. In the first study 729 randomly chosen police officers completed the questionnaire and in the second 1, 022. The results show that the basic attitude among the police towards traffic surveillance has become more positive. The attitudes towards the directives from the governing bodies and their ability to participate in decision making have improved slightly from the first measurement to the second measurement. However, it is characteristic that a fairly large proportion still is dissatisfied with the same. The attitude of the police towards their own <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents</b> has not changed appreciably at all. On the other hand, the understanding that a certain amount of statistics shall be reported is slightly greater in 2007 than in 1999. The attitudes towards automatic surveillance have strongly improved although a well-visible policeman is still advocated. The need to reinforce the surveillance of professional traffic is considered to be greater in 2007 than in 1999. According to the police, the attitude amongst the public towards speeding offences has become more negative than it was before. Nevertheless, a relatively high proportion still believes that it is a relatively minor offence. In 2006, the tolerance level for speeding offences was lowered {{at the same time as}} the fines for traffic offences were raised markedly. The results of the questionnaire show that the police are neutral towards whether or not these measures will influence the public's acceptance of the traffic safety work, which could indicate that they have not yet defined their attitude regarding the question. More than half of all police officers in 2007 do not believe that the public are aware of the possibility of having a time for consideration with respect to the acceptance of a fine for a breach of regulations. Finally the results show that in 2007, more controls were carried out than before. The most important conclusions that can be drawn from these results are that the police have developed a more positive attitude towards the traffic safety work and that, at the same time, more traffic controls are being carried out. But there are also many who still do not feel that they are able to influence their work. Furthermore, many are dissatisfied with the governing body's directives regarding traffic safety work. Such a dissatisfaction can influence the psycho-social work environment and the motivation for carrying out good work, but concretely the results show that such a dissatisfaction influences, both directly and indirectly, how many traffic controls one carries out...|$|E

40|$|Cette étude fournit une synthèse des travaux effectués par des économistes sur le thème de la santé et de la sécurité du travail. Ces derniers ont surtout essayé d'évaluer les effets des différentes politiques adoptées par les gouvernements en tant au 'assureur et promoteur de la santé et sécurité au travail.

À la lumière d'une comparaison internationale de la générosité de ces deux régimes d'assurance, des solutions de rechange sont proposées {{permettant de}} réduire l'incitation à la substitution. This paper provides {{a summary of}} the research performed by North American Economists on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH). Most of this work is concerned with the evaluation of the different policies adopted by govemments in this area. North American govemments play two fundamental roles with respect to OSH. First, they act as insurers through the existence of public workers' compensation board (WCB) that insure accident victims and second, they promote safety in the workplace through the experience rating of the insurance premium paid by employers to WCBs and through safety regulation. So far, the empirical evidence shows that experience rating has had a minor impact on the incidence of workplace accidents, while regulation has had an effect on certain types of accidents and on firms directly affected by the regulation (for instance, firms that have been inspected). Furthermore, most studies on the subject show that an increase in the generosity of WCBs is associated with an increase in the duration and <b>reporting</b> <b>of</b> <b>accidents.</b> In addition, this paper attempts to shed light on the issue of substitution between workers' compensation (WC) and unemployment insurance (UI). Indeed, given that, in Canada, WC is more generous than UI, laid-off workers may be tempted, among other things, to report a false accident to benefit from WC instead of UI. This issue has been largely ignored in the literature and opens the way for a more thorough discussion on the adequacy of the actual insurance regimes. With this respect, the paper fïrst summarizes the study of Fortin and Lanoie (1992) on this subject. This study has shown that a reduction in the generosity of UI is associated with an increase in the average duration of workplace accidents in Quebec. Then, an international comparison of the generosity of the WC and the UI Systems in different industrialized countries is presented and discussed. This comparison shows that Canada has one of the largest gap between the generosity of the two insurance regimes. The next section describes four different scenarios {{in order to reduce the}} substitution between WC and UI. These scenarios are: 1) the harmonization and the merging of the two compensation Systems into a unique insurance regime; 2) an increase in the generosity of UI; 3) a reduction of the generosity of WC and 4) a better control of the access to the WC regime. Finally, the paper recommends that the generosity of the WC regimes be reduced in Canada...|$|E
