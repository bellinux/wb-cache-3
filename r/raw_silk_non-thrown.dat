The cohesion is {{an important}} property of <b>raw</b> <b>silk.</b> The cohesion of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> is measured with the Duplan tester and <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> cohesion automatic tester, respectively. The correlations between the cohesive times given by the Duplan tester and the diameter variations of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> after different times of abrasion are analyzed using grey relational analysis. The results shows that the diameter variation between ten-time abrasion and one-time abrasion has the highest correlation with the cohesive times, which shows good application prospects for the <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> cohesion automatic tester when a ten-time abrasion is adopted...|$|R

40|$|Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> {{was never}} {{renowned for its}} high quality, yet it {{attracted}} {{the interest of the}} European trading companies from the seventeenth century. This thesis explores the English East India Company’s silk manufacturing activities in Bengal and the Company’s trade in Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. The Company’s interest in Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was driven both by economic and political factors – profit maximization and mercantilist ideas about governance. The English East India Company considered Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> to be an item with potential high returns as the British silk weaving industry required supplies of raw material unavailable domestically. However, the quality of the Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was low and it could not be easily used in British weaving. Britain thus relied on the importation of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> from Italy, Turkey and the Mediterranean region. The English East India Company saw an opportunity to replace these supplies with silk imported from Bengal. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> produced in Bengal, the Company decided to adopt the Piedmontese system of silk reeling – the most advanced reeling system in Europe. The thesis shows that this new system of reeling was profitable. Yet, the quality of the Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> did not improve as much as expected: a large part of the silk produced was of substandard quality. My thesis argues that the primary reason why substandard <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was produced was the inadequate institutional framework of production which facilitated principal-agent problems...|$|R

While, the European market decreased, the Asian market has mainly developed fresh cocoons and <b>raw</b> <b>silk,</b> while the European market became more interested of clothes. Silk consumption declined because of consumer’s preference for synthetic fibres, except traditional consumers from Asia.   China is the main producer and exporter of fresh and dry cocoons, while <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> is produced and exported by China, Brazil and Italy and imported by India, Japan and Italy.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} silk and its degradation properties, we have monitored the structure of silk using scanning electron microscopy and frozen sections. <b>Raw</b> <b>silk</b> and degummed <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> were immersed in four types of degradation solutions for 156 d to observe their degradation properties. The subcutaneous implants in rats were removed after 7, 14, 56, 84, 129, and 145 d for frozen sectioning and subsequent staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H. E.), DAPI, Beta-actin and Collagen I immunofluorescence staining. The in vitro weight loss ratio of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> and degummed <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> in water, PBS, DMEM and DMEM containing 10 % FBS (F-DMEM) were, respectively, 14 %/ 11 %, 12. 5 %/ 12. 9 %, 11. 1 %/ 14. 3 %, 8. 8 %/ 11. 6 %. Silk began to degrade after 7 d subcutaneous implantation and after 145 d non-degraded silk was still observed. These findings suggest the immunogenicity of fibroin and sericin had no essential difference. In the process of in vitro degradation of silk, {{the role of the}} enzyme is not significant. The in vivo degradation of silk is related to phagocytotic activity and fibroblasts may be involved in this process to secrete collagen.

The experimental apparatus consisted of two electrodes, fiber material and purified water. Fiber materials such as <b>raw</b> <b>silk,</b> nylon and polyester were tested in measuring the output voltage generated between two electrodes. The apparatus utilizing the <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> produced an appreciably high output voltage. After it was irradiated with intense flux of reactor neutrinos, its output voltage became higher than that of the non-irradiated one. The experimental results suggest that the voltage appears as the interaction between the natural neutrinos and the purified water: <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> induces non vector-axial interaction.
