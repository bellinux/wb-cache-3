Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security.

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the law.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{policies}} in Chongqing ultimately {{made him a}} prominent figure among neo-Maoists and leftists, and {{a representative of the}} conservative wing of the Communist Party. Although Bo did not favor the discontinuation of market economics or a return to Mao-era policies, he was seen to advocate a strong role for the state in peoples' lives. Bo's anti-corruption campaign, in particular, earned him a reputation for heavy-handedness and authoritarian methods in crime and punishment. Bo's policies put him in opposition to the more liberal and reform-oriented faction, particularly Premier Wen Jiabao and Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, who favored the strengthening of <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> a continuation of political reform. To observers, Bo and Wang's verbal jousting over the future direction of development marked an increasing polarization of Chinese politics into leftist and reformer camps.|$|E

He also spent time as the Vice-President of the Society of Genealogists, Honorary President of the Council for the Protection of Rural England and Honorary President of the Glasgow University Dialectic Society. From 1950 he acted as an administrator and fund-raiser for Cumberland Lodge. After being made aware of the Le Court charity for invalid ex-servicemen by Geoffrey Cheshire Denning became the chairman of the organisation in 1952. In 1953 he was elected President of Birkbeck College, University of London and on 18 March presented the 1952 Haldane Memorial Lecture {{on the subject of the}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> the welfare state. In 1964 he was made President of the English Association in recognition of his contributions to English prose. He became Chairman of the Historical Manuscripts Commission in 1962, resigning in December 1982.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, President Mutharika {{split with}} the United Democratic Front and began his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which has {{attracted}} reform-minded officials from other parties and won elections {{across the country}} in 2006. In 2008, President Mutharika had implemented reforms to address the country's major corruption problem, with at least five senior UDF party members facing criminal charges. In 2012, Malawi was ranked 7th of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, an index that measures several variables to provide a comprehensive view of the governance of African countries. Although the country's governance score was higher than the continental average, it was lower than the regional average for southern Africa. Its highest scores were for safety and <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> its lowest scores were for sustainable economic opportunity, with a ranking of 47th on the continent for educational opportunities. Malawi's governance score had improved between 2000 and 2011. Malawi held its most recent elections in May 2014, with challenger Arthur Peter Mutharika defeating incumbent President Joyce Banda.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's discretion under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the discretion was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the discretion had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion was contrary to the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> all powers had legal limits.|$|E

5|$|One {{matter in}} which he {{invested}} much effort was the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In Peru, power struggles between conquistadors and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by Gonzalo Pizarro rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1546. The Emperor sent Pedro de la Gasca, a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> <b>and</b> he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize the political situation the encomenderos started pushing {{not only for the}} repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked hard to convince the king {{that it would be a}} bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision on the issue of the encomiendas.|$|E

40|$|Trying {{criminal}} cases is hard. The problem faced {{by a judge}} in court can be phrased in a deceptively simple way though, as follows: in order {{to come to a}} verdict, a judge has to apply the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to the facts of the case. In a naïve and often criticized model of legal decision making (reminding of the bouche de la loi view on judges), the verdict is determined by applying the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> that match the case facts. This naïve model of legal decision making can be referred to as the subsumption model. A problem with the subsumption model is that neither the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> nor the case facts are available to the legal decision maker in a sufficiently well-structured form to make the processes of matching and applying a trivial matter. First, there is the problem of determining what the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> the case facts are. Neither the rules nor the facts are presented to the judge in a precise and unambiguous way. A judge has to interpret the available information about the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> the case facts. Second, even if the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> the case facts would be determined, the processes of matching and applying can be problematic. It can for instance be undetermined whether some case fact falls under a particular rule's condition. Additional classificatory rules are then needed. In general, it can be the case that applying the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> leads to conflicting verdicts about the case at hand, or to no verdict at all. In the latter situation, it is to the judge's discretion to fill the gap, in the former, he has to resolve the conflict...|$|R
