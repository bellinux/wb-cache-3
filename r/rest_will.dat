25|$|Hence, {{with respect}} to an {{inertial}} frame, an object or body accelerates only when a physical force is applied, and (following Newton's first law of motion), {{in the absence of}} a net force, a body at <b>rest</b> <b>will</b> remain at rest and a body in motion will continue to move uniformlythat is, in a straight line and at constant speed.

25|$|Assuming the {{standardized}} value for g and ignoring air resistance, {{this means that}} an object falling freely near the Earth's surface increases its velocity by 9.80665m/s (32.1740ft/s or 22mph) for each second of its descent. Thus, an object starting from <b>rest</b> <b>will</b> attain a velocity of 9.80665m/s (32.1740ft/s) after one second, approximately 19.62m/s (64.4ft/s) after two seconds, and so on, adding 9.80665m/s (32.1740ft/s) to each resulting velocity.

He sent lettres to rabbis and scholars in his native land, reputed to be liberal. Eventually he received two that he found sufficiently lenient. One was from Moses Kunitz, a rabbinic judge from Óbuda, who composed a short, hesitant responsa in which he allowed the Sephardic pronunciation and the use of music instruments. He circumspectly commented that since it already was customary to have gentiles remove the plates and candles from tables on the Sabbath, having a non-Jew operate the organ on days of <b>rest</b> <b>will</b> not breach the Law.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{international}} vocabulary, {{much of it}} Latin or Greek in origin, is {{of course}} used as well, but frequently {{for a family of}} related words only the root will be borrowed directly, and the <b>rest</b> <b>will</b> be derived from it using Esperanto means of word formation. For example, the computer term 'bit' was borrowed directly as bito, but 'byte' was then derived by compounding bito with the numeral ok (eight), for the uniquely Esperanto word bitoko ('an octet of bits'). Although not a familiar form to speakers of European languages, the transparency of its formation is helpful to those who do not have this advantage. Moreover, even bito has the synonym duumo, based on du (two) and -um- (the affix with undefined meaning).|$|E
25|$|A north/south Rail Baltica {{line from}} Tallinn to Kaunas is {{planned to be}} {{constructed}} starting in 2019 and in service by 2026. The line would connect Tallinn and Kaunas via Pärnu, Riga and Panevėžys, while also providing connections to airports and railway terminals. The railway {{will be the first}} high-speed, 1435mm standard gauge railway in the Baltics. From Kaunas, it will be connected to the already existing high-speed network in Poland. Project speeds are 240km/h for passenger trains and 120km/h for freight traffic. About 80% of construction costs (totalling ca. 5 billion €) will be covered by the European Union, the <b>rest</b> <b>will</b> be paid jointly by the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian governments. Indirectly the railway may also link Helsinki, as there are plans for a Tallinn-Helsinki railway tunnel.|$|E

In 2014, the university assumed ownership of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the oldest private art museum in Washington D.C. and independent college of art and design. The college of art and design became The Corcoran School of the Arts and Design under the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. The National Gallery of Art will acquire many of the 17,000 pieces of art from the Corcoran and the <b>rest</b> <b>will</b> be donated to other museums around the country. In May 2014, GW opened the Milken Institute School of Public Health, a nine-story building that received LEED certification for sustainability features including a green roof, rainwater collection system and special heating and air conditioning technologies that helps mass air displacement. The Textile Museum reopened to the public in March 2015 after the institution merged with the university in 2011 and closed it for renovations two years later.|$|E
