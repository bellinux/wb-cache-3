40|$|The {{obtained}} analytical dependences {{for determining}} the basic parameters of the surface roughness during abrasive polishing are presented with modeling the cutting grains {{in the form of}} a sphere and considering the ordered arrangement of grains. It is shown that with a decrease in the thickness of the cut, the ratio of the altitude parameters of the surface roughness max Ra R / increases, reaching values of 20 [...] . 30 and more. This is consistent with the experimental data obtained by abrasive polishing. Consequently, the modeling of abrasive grains {{in the form of a}} sphere is more in line with the actual conditions for the formation of surface roughness in both abrasive polishing and grinding. Calculations established that the process of abrasive polishing proceeds under conditions corresponding to the transition from the cutting process to the process of friction of the grain with the material being processed. It is also shown that with the reduction of the ratio max Ra R / to 4 [...] . 6 (corresponding to the grinding conditions), the process of metal removal and the formation of surface roughness occurs in a stable cutting process. This establishes a close relationship of the relationship max Ra R / with the ratio of the thickness of the cut and the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rounding</b> of the cutting edge of the abrasive grain. It has been experimentally established that when the ball is smoothed out, the ratio max Ra R / = 14. 2, and Ra = 0. 1 mkm.

The electrons in radio frequency system are accelerated by the {{synchrotron radiation}} superconducting cavity. Tensile or compressive loads along the axial direction may be applied on this thin-walled shell cavity for compensating the frequency shift due to the variations of surrounding condition.

The numerical results reveal the local electric field enhancement {{in the vicinity}} of the apex of fan-shaped waveguide. Classical electromagnetic theory predicts that the field enhancement and confinement abilities increase with decreasing <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rounded</b> corner (r) and gap (g), and show singularity for infinitesimal r and g. For practical parameters with r=g= 10 nm, the mode area of opposing apex-to-apex fan-shaped waveguides can be as small as 4 × 10 ^- 3 A_ 0 (A_ 0 =λ^ 2 / 4), far beyond the diffraction limit. This way of breaking diffraction limit with no loss outperforms plasmonic waveguides, where light confinement is realized at the cost of huge intrinsic loss in the metal. Furthermore, we propose a structure with dielectric bow-tie antenna on a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, whose field enhancement increases by one order. The lossless dielectric corner and gap structures offer an alternative method to enhance the light-matter interaction without metal nano-structure, and will find applications in quantum electrodynamics, sensors and nano-particle trapping.

For instance, a supercharge that squares to zero exists, if the canonical bundle of the Hermitian manifold M admits a nowhere vanishing, holomorphic section. This requirement can be slightly relaxed if M is a torus bundle over a Riemann surface, in which case we obtain a supercharge that squares to a complex Killing vector.

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} {{and high}} precision optical interferometry allow {{to analyze the}} processes {{that are in the}} core of our present understanding of faceted crystal growth. Some of these processes will be reviewed. Recent experiments suggest that the Gibbs-Thomson Law (GTL) may not be applicable to the weakly fluctuating strongly polygonized steps, with low kink density. Propagation rate of a straight short step segment changes with the segment length much steeper than predicted by GTL. If the step fluctuations are still well developed, the typical transition length may be determined just by the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rounded</b> comers <b>of</b> the polygonized step. If fluctuations do not have enough time to develop, the kinetic effects may be essential. Indeed, 'communications' between comers of a short straight step segment may occur and, thus, the GTL may be implemented only via kink exchange. E. g., dissolutions of this short segment at macroscopic equilibrium occurs as follows: The kinks are split from one comer as a result of fluctuations, and annihilate with kinks of the opposite sign generated by another comer. Similarly, an exchange via chain of kinks on a rough step is the mechanism to implement the GT Law. If there is a supersaturation with respect to a large crystal, the kinks not only diffuse along the step, but move back the generating comers. This 'wind' prevents communication between the comers and places upper limit supersaturation only below which GTL is applicable. Steps replace kinks in the 3 D case, though, of course, another dimensionality brings about another physics. Another specific problem to think about is if fluctuations are always fast enough to provide enough kinks for linear dependence of step rate on supersaturation. Increasing azimuthal polygonization of growth hillocks is a sign of insufficient fluctuation rate. Morphological stability of vicinal faces is usually considered on the basis of mutually parallel steps. Azimuthal anisotropy and interlacing of step bunches inducing the well known bunch splitting is another challenge. Among other challenging problems are: existence of surface diffusion on the crystal/so 1 ution interface, step interaction in solutions, achievement of step flow modes from liquids, impurity effects. New phenomena essential in biomacromolecular crystallization is another interesting area...|$|R

A number of backward-tilted hairpin vortices are found to be generated downstream of the jet exit and to develop until they finally disappear prior to the flow separation.

40|$|International audienceIn nanoindentation, {{especially}} {{at very low}} indenter displacements, the indenter/material contact area must be defined {{in the best possible}} way in order to accurately determine the mechanical properties of the material. One of the best methodologies for the computation of the contact area has been proposed by Oliver and Pharr [W. C. Oliver, G. M. Pharr, J. Mater. Res. 7 (1992) 1564], which involves a complex phenomenological area function. Unfortunately, this formulation is only valid when the continuous stiffness measurement mode is employed. For other conditions of indentation, different contact area functions, which take into account the effective truncation length or the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rounded</b> indenter tip, as well as some fitting parameters, have been proposed. However, most of these functions require a calibration procedure due to the presence of such parameters. To avoid such a calibration, in the present communication a contact area function only related to the truncation length representative of the indenter tip defect, which can be previously estimated with high resolution microscopy, has been proposed. This model allows the determination of consistent indentation data from indenter displacements of only few nanometers in depth. When this proposed contact area function is applied to the mechanical characterization of a TiHfCN film of 2. 6 μm in thickness deposited onto a tool steel substrate, the direct determination of the hardness and elastic modulus of the film leads to values of 35. 5 ± 2 GPa and 490 ± 50 GPa, respectively...|$|R

The propagation loss between transmitter and receiver is heavily dependent on the terrain features. Hence, this thesis examines and improves the CRC propagation loss prediction in two main aspects. [...] One is to create a higher resolution and more accurate digital terrain data base based on the CRC data base. The developed procedure is as follows. For a given area of interest first the complete quadratic two-dimensional interpolation for elevations and the weighted vote method for surface codes are applied to augment the CRC data base from 500 meters spacing to 100 meters spacing. If the contour from the augmented data base is not checked with the topographic map, then the data of missed critical terrain features are taken directly from the topographic map and are used to correct the augmented data base. In this step, the triangular interpolation scheme is introduced to modify the elevations, and the weighted vote method is used to modify the surface codes. There are eight surface codes which indicate tree, bare ground, fresh water, suburban, marsh, seawater, urban core and unknown type. As the result of the modified data base, the evaluations of diffraction, reflection, tropospheric scattering, urban, and season losses are more accurate. Thus, the total propagation loss prediction is greatly improved. [...] As another major work in this thesis, the modified diffraction loss prediction model is proposed. It involves: (a) for the implementation of the de Assis method, the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>rounded</b> obstacles' crest is determined by least-squares parabolic fitting; (b) the Deygout correction factor is first applied to deal with multiple rounded obstacles which are close to each other; (c) based on the availability of much more detailed information from the modified data base, all the defineable obstacles in a path profile are taken into account in the diffration loss prediction.
