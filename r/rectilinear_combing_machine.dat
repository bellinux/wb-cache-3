5000|$|Efforts {{were made}} by Bradford to study the {{mechanism}} of noble combing but they failed to produce tangible results. The Noble and French combs are now well understood technology thanks to work by CSIRO. After 1994, Sokolov has endeavored to improve combing performance in the <b>rectilinear</b> <b>comb.</b> Combing technology continues to develop: Sokolov and Kirby developed a theory for combing model, simulation software for combing and drive design in 1982. Current technology used in providing comb drive by introducing innovation on cam performance to deliver textile fiber needs and separate mechanical performance of the comb was developed by Sokolov. [...] The cam technology was an advance on century-old technology of cams by producing a subspecies of new cam design.|$|R

50|$|The Noble comb is {{no longer}} used in worsted system as {{technology}} is inefficient. Noble combing may have uses for woollen system, or long fibers 250 mm+. The predominant technology for all fibers is the French comb system. A cotton comber is scaled and simplified mechanically version of a <b>rectilinear</b> <b>comb</b> relative to a mean fiber length (similar to Naismith comber). This scaled version of wool comb {{can be seen in}} stroke of the components used in a cotton comber. The scaled down has the purpose of accommodating fiber length and fiber physics requirements.

5000|$|Alexis de Tocqueville, {{described}} Redhill Street Mill in 1835 as [...] "... a {{place where}} some 1500 workers, labouring 69 hours a week, with an average wage of 11 shillings, and where three-quarters of the workers are women and children". During the Cotton Famine, the company obtained rights to Heilmann's <b>combing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{support of}} the flannel emphasis, in 1865 Coldharbour Mill moved over to {{producing}} worsted yarn rather than woollen yarn. This necessitated {{the need for more}} power to drive new <b>combing</b> <b>machines.</b> (Worsted yarn is made from sheep with long hair fleeces and the wool has to be combed to ensure that all the fibres are parallel.) ...|$|R
50|$|The wool <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was invented}} by Edmund Cartwright, the {{inventor}} of the power loom, in Doncaster. It was patented on 1790. This machine was used to arrange and lay parallel by length the fibers of wool, prior to further treatment. The machine was important in the mechanization of the textile industry. The machine was refined by many later inventors.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{competing}} combing technologies: the Noble (1853) comb (variants Lister, Heilman (1846) and Holden) and the French comb. The Noble comb technology is inefficient, hence most combing {{in the world}} is carried out on the French system. The French system is superior as it combs the entire length of a fiber. Noble combs suffer from the problem that they will not comb 2 mm of a fiber's length. The 2 mm is the distance between counter-rotating pins. The French system is a <b>rectilinear</b> <b>combing</b> system as opposed to earlier woollen systems developed in England. Although the Heilman and Noble comb was an original circular design (also developed in min and 18-19th-century England) as it happens in modern history, English mills didn't share technology - resulting in development of superior technology on continental Europe in the mid-19th century, as in France.|$|R
25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb. The Noble comb {{was the most popular}} as it would comb long, medium and fairly short staple wool, but the slivers needed special preparation in a punching machine beforehand.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of automatic machinery, there was little difficulty in attaining a straight fibre, as long wool was always used, and the sliver was made up by hand, using combs. The introduction of Richard Arkwright's water frame in 1771, and the later introduction of cap and mule spinning machines, required perfectly prepared slivers. Many manufactories used one or more preparatory <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> (called gill-boxes) before worsting, to ensure straight fibres and to distribute the lubricant evenly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>rectilinear</b> <b>comb</b> uses a {{circular}} comb {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a clamping mechanism. The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular combing short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|R
25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|R
30|$|According to Adanur (2001), the open-end is {{a process}} notably {{employed}} to produce denim yarn. The open-end yarns are cheap and rustic for not passing through machines that add a sophisticated finishing, such as textile laminating and <b>combing</b> <b>machines,</b> differing, for example, from the ring spinning process where a set of parallelized fibers is well twisted so there is high cohesion and strength. Additionally, in open-end spinning, the individual fibers are not uniformly arranged in the produced yarn as in the spinning ring produced yarn. In an open-end spinning yarn most of the fibers are parallel, but with some intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main cable (Fabriclink â€“ Fabric University 2012).|$|R

The difficulty of harvesting berries from plants that differ greatly in shape and size requires a large expenditure of labour which leads to high production costs. However, besides the need to increase the availability of berries, in order to reduce costs it is necessary to use proper harvesting systems that are respectful of plants and fruit, but which are most of all capable of facilitating harvesting.

5000|$|In the 1940s {{after the}} {{imperative}} of wartime production had passed, Michell set about modernising the company's operations. State-of-the-art British <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> were imported, utilising both the traditional Noble type {{and the more}} efficient French type.

The quality of tops was also improved by this method, producing wool suitable for the manufacture of fine clothing. [...] In 1947, Michell pioneered an incentive wage scheme at the company's Hindmarsh and Fremantle processing facilities, whereby the typical worker could earn an average of 27% above the award wage for production beyond standard output levels.|$|R
50|$|Elmore {{seems to}} have been {{associated}} with The Clique, a group of young artists who saw themselves as followers of Hogarth and David Wilkie. According to his friend William Powell Frith he was member of the group, but since it was most active while he was in continental Europe, his involvement was probably short-lived. Most of Elmore's later works were historical narrative paintings. Religious Controversy and The Novice were implicitly anti-Catholic in character. Other paintings set episodes from Shakespeare, or the history of the French Revolution. They often contained subtle explorations of the process of creation, most importantly his two paintings about technological innovation, The Invention of the Stocking Loom (1847, Nottingham Castle Museum) and The Invention of the <b>Combing</b> <b>Machine</b> (1862, Cartwright Hall, Bradford). Both portray the process of industrialisation by depicting picturesque pre-industrial handicrafts. The inventor is supposed to be pondering these manual skills while he forms in his mind a mechanism to replace them.|$|R

25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the <b>combing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R

50|$|In general, combing is done {{to filter}} or sieve out any short length fibers (for example, fibers shorter than 21 mm). Combing or carding is a primary process, {{followed}} by the gilling process, which removes hooks and involves three separate <b>machines.</b> <b>Combing</b> is then followed by two gillings to remove irregularity in the sliver and randomize fiber ends. This post-combing process is required if spinning is to follow. It is known that a sliver can be spun to a yarn of only 21 fibers with a suitable average length of 150 mm.|$|R

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
