The connection between the insula and the brainstem differed between PWS and fluent speakers only during the falling tone. These results indicated the neural control for the <b>rising</b> tone <b>and</b> the <b>falling</b> tone are affected in PWS. Moreover, whilst both <b>rising</b> <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> tones were affected in PWS, falling-tone control appeared to be affected more...|$|R

40|$|The <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> {{during one}} cycle of sewing operation, in the {{equilibrium}} needle temperature was discussed. At a constant sewing velocity, {{the higher the}} needle temperature was, the bigger the amount of <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> during one cycle in an equilibrium needle temperature was. As the sewing velocity rose, the needle temperature increased, but the amount of <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> during one cycle of sewing operation in the equilibrium needle temperature decreased. The reason was that the fall time decreased with high sewing velocity, and before the needle is cooled enough, the next sewing operation cycle began. In this experiment, {{it is estimated that}} at a sewing velocity above about 500 rpm, the <b>rise</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> during one cycle of sewing operation in the equilibrium needle temperature is not observed...|$|R
