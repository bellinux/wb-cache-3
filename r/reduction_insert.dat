40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{retrospectively}} evaluate the safety, feasibility, and midterm clinical outcome of the use of three types of <b>reduction</b> stents <b>inserted</b> to manage transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) -induced hepatic encephalopathy refractory to medical treatment. CONCLUSION: The use of a covered reduction stent-graft results in a greater increase in portosystemic gradient immediately after reduction than does use of a bare reduction stent. Relief of TIPS-induced hepatic encephalopathy tends to be greater in patients with reduction stent-grafts than in those with bare reduction stents. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Comparative fishing {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in November 2008 on the euro-cutter MFV TH- 7 “Adriana Maria” on fishing grounds in the North Sea to investigate the effect of By-catch <b>Reduction</b> Panels <b>inserted</b> in a twin-trawl. In a total of 17 experimental hauls two nets were fished simultaneously, a conventional net on the starboard side and a net with a By-catch <b>Reduction</b> Panel <b>inserted</b> in the top sheet on the port side. The codend meshsize used was 80 mm. The main target species is plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.). The By-catch Reduction Panel (BRP) tested was a square mesh panel with: 25 bars across and 22 bars deep of mesh size 150 mm, euroline™ single braid of 5 mm thickness. The panel was built in surrounding 80 mm netting and joined to 38 meshes in width and 19 meshes in depth in the port net of the twin-trawl, 12 meshes deep {{in front of the}} joining round of the codend. The panel reduced the by-catch of juvenile plaice by some 20 % compared to the conventional net, but there may be a loss of marketable plaice. However, commercial losses were not confirmed by the skipper when regarding earnings over a longer period. When plaice discards are expressed as a fraction of total catch the differences were not found to be significant...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPain during {{injection}} {{of a medical}} needle is greatly influenced by the surface roughness and geometry of its cutting edges. An ion- plasma sputtering treatment is a promising candidate as a clean and precise polishing method for the painless needles. In this paper, the mechanism of the <b>reduction</b> of <b>inserting</b> force of the plasma-treated needles is investigated by microscopically observing artificial skins and needles during insertion. It {{was found that the}} time distribution of insertion force was influenced by the roughness at the cutting edges. Plasma-treated needles resulted in force reduction by approximate half in comparison of untreated ones. Furthermore, the microscopic observation found that the sharp dropping of force was occurring at the corners between cutting faces. Using the plasma-treated needle, the sharp dropping was significantly decreased. The plasma-etching treatment will lead to a clean finishing process for painless medical needles...|$|R

40|$|Clock-gating and power-gating {{have proven}} to be very {{effective}} solutions for reducing dynamic and static power, respectively. The two techniques may be coupled {{in such a way that}} the clock-gating information can be used to drive the control signal of the power-gating circuitry, thus providing additional leakage minimization conditions w. r. t. those manually inserted by the designer. This conceptual integration, however, poses several challenges when moved to industrial design flows. Although both clock and power-gating are supported by most commercial synthesis tools, their combined implementation requires some flexibility in the back-end tools that is not currently available. This paper presents a layout-oriented synthesis flow which integrates the two techniques and that relies on leading-edge, commercial EDA tools. Starting from a gated-clock netlist, we partition the circuit in a number of clusters that are implicitly determined by the groups of cells that are clock-gated by the same register. Using a row-based granularity, we achieve runtime leakage <b>reduction</b> by <b>inserting</b> dedicated sleep transistors for each cluster.

30|$|Open {{reduction}} with {{lag screws}} did not yield better functional results than closed <b>reduction</b> with transversally <b>inserted</b> K-wires in extra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanx. Also patients experience a similar functional recovery {{and time to}} return to work was comparable (Level II, [19]). Open reduction with interosseous loop wire fixation yields better TAM scores than closed reduction with transarticular K-wire fixation (across the MCP joint) in closed or type I open fractures of the proximal phalanx in industrial workers; however, time {{to return to work}} was similar (Level IV, [20]). Al-Qattan [24] found a better active range of motion in industrial workers treated with extra-articular K-wire pinning (with open or closed reduction) when compared to CRIF with transarticular K-wire pinning for type I open extra-articular fractures of the proximal phalanx (Level IV).|$|R
30|$|In {{a recent}} work [29] which {{considers}} a single-antenna OFDM system, signaling overhead associated with PAPR reduction is eliminated {{by means of}} inserting pilot tones in each OFDM symbol. The receiver obtains the phase rotations applied in the PAPR <b>reduction</b> from the <b>inserted</b> pilots. While applying a similar concept from [29] in our first three methods, we aim {{to reduce the cost}} of pilot tones at each OFDM symbol. We propose to use the pilots inserted for channel estimation and tracking according to the standard specification, thus eliminating requirement of additional pilots at each multiple access (MA) symbol, i.e., either OFDMA or SC-FDMA symbol. This leads to the use of PAPR optimization intervals with multiple symbol durations for the first three methods. Another difference from [29] is that we consider MIMO carrier-aggregated systems which have their own characteristics and constraints.|$|R
30|$|Earlier studies {{evaluated}} {{the outcome of}} distal fibular fractures treated with intramedullary screws [24, 25, 31]. Bankston et al. [24] used open <b>reduction</b> techniques and <b>inserted</b> 4.2 -mm fully threaded screws in compression mode. Cerclage wires were used at the surgeons’ discretion for improved stability at the fracture site. Ray et al. [25] specified that the fracture pattern must be transverse and short oblique or minimally comminuted, otherwise {{it is not possible}} to maintain fibular length with intramedullary screws. They used closed reduction techniques under image guidance with occasional percutaneous use of a towel clip. An advantage of this method is that patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. Lee et al. [31] used newer cannulated, headless, variable-pitch screws following open reduction. For comminuted fractures, they recommended the use of cerclage wires or sutures. They reported that the compressive force exerted by headless variable-pitch screws allows enough stability to resist proximal migration and rotation at the fracture site. This may explain why their series gave the maximum union rate, greatest functional outcome and lowest complication rate of the reviewed studies.|$|R
40|$|A heavily used {{competitive}} tactic in {{the grocery}} business is the weekly advertising of price <b>reductions</b> in newspaper <b>inserts</b> and store fliers. Store managers commonly believe that advertisements of price reductions and loss leaders help to build store traffic by diverting customers from competing stores, thereby increasing store volume and profitability. It is therefore not surprising that grocery retail planners across competing stores expend considerable thought on what items to advertise each week and at what levels of prominence. What is surprising, however, is that we marketing scientists do not {{know much about the}} manner and extent to which feature advertising in a competitive environment influences where and how customers shop. The marketing science literature has not even been able to establish that feature advertising has a substantial impact on store choice, let alone the more operational question of which categories are better at drawing consumers away from one store and into a competing store. In this paper we employ a stochastic choice modeling framework to propose and empirically estimate a disaggregate, consumer-level model of the effects of feature advertising on store choice. We use this model to understand which categories are more influential drivers of store traffic and better at diverting consumers from competing stores. ...|$|R
40|$|Cryptographic {{techniques}} {{are essential for}} the security of communication in modern society. As more and more business processes are performed via the Internet, the need for efficient cryptographic solutions will further increase in the future. Today, nearly all cryptographic schemes used in practice are based on the two problems of factoring large integers and solving discrete logarithms. However, schemes based on these problems will become insecure when large enough quantum computers are built. The reason for this is Shor's algorithm, which solves number theoretic problems such as integer factorization and discrete logarithms in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Therefore one needs alternatives to those classical public key schemes. Besides lattice, code and hash based cryptosystems, multivariate cryptography seems to be a candidate for this. Additional to their (believed) resistance against quantum computer attacks, multivariate schemes are very fast and require only modest computational resources, which makes them attractive for the use on low cost devices such as RFID chips and smart cards. However, there remain some open problems to be solved, such as the unclear parameter choice of multivariate schemes, the large key sizes and the lack of more advanced multivariate schemes like signatures with special properties and key exchange protocols. In this dissertation we address two of these open questions in the area of multivariate cryptography. In the first part we consider the question of the parameter choice of multivariate schemes. We start with the security model of Lenstra and Verheul, which, on the basis of certain assumptions like the development of the computing environment and the budget of an attacker, proposes security levels for now and the near future. Based on this model we study the known attacks against multivariate schemes in general and the Rainbow signature scheme in particular and use this analysis to propose secure parameter sets for these schemes for the years 2012 - 2050. In the second part of this dissertation we present an approach to reduce the public key size of certain multivariate signature schemes such as UOV and Rainbow. We achieve the <b>reduction</b> by <b>inserting</b> a structured matrix into the coefficient matrix of the public key, which enables us to store the public key in an efficient way. We propose several improved versions of UOV and Rainbow which reduce the size of the public key by factors of 8 and 3 respectively. Using the results of the first part, we show that using structured public keys does not weaken the security of the underlying schemes against known attacks. Furthermore we show how the structure of the public key can be used to speed up the verification process of the schemes. Hereby we get a speed up of factors of 6 for UOV and 2 for Rainbow. Finally we show how to apply our techniques to the QUAD stream cipher. By doing so we can increase the data throughput of QUAD by a factor of 7...|$|R
40|$|Raku {{has progressed}} gloriously over these years {{influencing}} many potters through its traditional and conventional firing methods. Raku is significant {{in a way}} which involves simplicity, spontaneity that we can say is endless. Raku is an essence of ceramic that presents a laid back firing method that produces variety of unexpected effects that will surprise due to the simplest firing method that the firing it was conducted. It had lead the researcher to modify the firing methods from producing spontaneous glaze effect to obtaining a planned glaze effect, and achieving a standardized one. This research involves a range of ceramic process including Raku kiln, glazing and firing experiments. Intended for this research, a Raku kiln was built to cater glaze firing experiments for small test pieces. Raku conventional reduction methods were innovated to obtain a reduction atmosphere that would be able to alter the glaze to a standardized effect for all test pieces. The main issue of Raku is the random glaze effect produced from it reduction methods. This issue has been made as this research's motivation due to the realized potential of Raku that was suitable for this research. 10 experiments were conducted for this research using 2 Raku kilns to acquire the required glaze effect hence the proper reduction atmosphere that would be the foundation of the glaze effect transformation. The reduction atmosphere was created through an innovative post firing <b>reduction</b> method of <b>inserting</b> combustible material into the kiln and the kiln was sealed while producing smoke. The smoke appearance during reduction process was the main factor that could modify the glaze effect if all the involving factors such as the firing temperature, amount of combustible material used and the reduction temperature atmosphere are a suitable combination. Therefore this research gives us anticipation that through an altered method of post firing reduction, we can achieve a planned standardized effect for Raku glaze...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) In {{the past}} two decades the refrigeration, {{air-conditioning}} and heat pump industries began the conversion from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants to hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and to natural refrigerants. This changeover not only involves redesigning, re-optimizing and re-testing all new original equipment but also involves retrofitting many large existing systems. Combining this process with the goal of developing more accurate design methods and more energy-efficient cycles, heat transfer and, specifically, heat transfer enhancement, has become a very active research field and will probably continue to boom in the next decades as the HCFCs are also phased out of use. The most prominent alternative refrigerants are R 134 a and R 407 C to replace the present market dominating refrigerant R 22. Many heat transfer enhanced techniques have simultaneously been developed for the improvement of energy consumption, material saving, size reduction and pumping power <b>reduction.</b> Helical wire <b>inserts</b> in tubes are a typical technique that offers a higher heat transfer increase and, at the same time, only a mild pressure drop penalty. This study investigates the heat transfer characteristics of a horizontal tube-in-tube heat exchanger with a helical wire inserted in the inner tube. The influence of the pitch (or helix angle) of such geometry on the heat transfer performance and pressure drop during condensation (having all other geometric parameters the same) was investigated experimentally. Firstly, three refrigerants were tested in three helical wire-inserted tubes with different pitches of 5, 7. 77 and 11 mm. The local and average heat transfer coefficients, and semi-local and average pressure drops were studied systematically. The experimental results were compared not only with the referenced experimental data of the smooth tubes, but also with the results of micro-fin tubes. The heat transfer enhancement factors, pressure drop loss penalty factors and overall efficiencies of the tested condensers with helical wire-inserted geometry were calculated. The tube with a helical wire pitch of 5 mm inserts was found to have the highest enhancement factor and overall efficiency. Secondly, the heat transfer enhancement mechanism was studied and explained. It was found that the extension of the annular flow regime contributed mainly to this enhancement. The transitional qualities from annular flow to intermittent flow were derived and incorporated in a flow regime map. Thirdly, heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop correlations for this special heat transfer enhancement geometry were deduced, and they predicted the experiment data to within 80 % and 78 % respectively, within a deviation of  20 %. Finally, the water flowing through helical wire-inserted tubes (glass) was demonstrated, providing a visual understanding of the heat transfer enhancement mechanism. Prof. J. P. Meyer Prof. L.
