5|$|With Tychus {{acting as}} the middleman, the Raiders embark {{on a series of}} {{missions}} to find the remaining pieces of the Xel'Naga artifact, which they sell to the enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution. Along the way, they meet with Gabriel Tosh, a rogue Dominion psychic assassin known as a Spectre, and Ariel Hanson, a <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> the Zerg and leader of a small farming colony. The Raiders perform missions to help Tosh procure the raw materials to train new Spectres as well as to aid Hanson as she attempts to secure her colonists who are caught between the Zerg infesting their planets and the Protoss attempting to eradicate the infestation. Horner also arranges a series of missions to undermine Mengsk, recovering intelligence information about his war crimes and broadcasting them across the Dominion. Finally, Zeratul sneaks aboard the Hyperion to deliver a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg-Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out Humanity and the Protoss. The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Gelfand is {{considered}} a pioneering <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> the concept of tightness-looseness. She is credited with defining the tightness-looseness classification system, which assesses how much a culture adheres to social norms and tolerates deviance. Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. Gelfand found that a history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. Her {{research has shown that}} tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.|$|E
25|$|Between 1950 and 1970 appears a rebirth in {{folk music}} leading by {{groups such as}} Los de Ramón, Los Cuatro Huasos and Los Huasos Quincheros, among others with composers such as Raúl de Ramón, Violeta Parra and others. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the Parra family with the Nueva canción Chilena, which was {{associated}} with political activists and reformers such as Víctor Jara, Inti-Illimani, and Quilapayún. Other important folk singer and <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> folklore and Chilean ethnography, is Margot Loyola. Also many Chilean rock bands like Los Jaivas, Los Prisioneros, La Ley, and Los Tres have reached international success. In February, annual music festivals are held in Viña del Mar.|$|E
25|$|As other church parties {{experienced}} {{decline in}} the 21st century, Evangelicalism has seen a rise in influence and popularity within the Church of England. According to Peter Brierley, a <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> church statistics, 40 percent of Anglicans attended evangelical parishes. As of 2016, 70 percent of ordinands were reported to be evangelical, and 18 out of 42 dioceses had evangelical bishops. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury since 2013, is evangelical with connections to Holy Trinity Brompton in London. Evangelical growth {{in recent years has}} been aided by aggressive church planting and urban evangelization. However, some liberals within the church have criticized the growing influence of Evangelicalism as a threat to the inclusive, broad church values of the Church of England.|$|E

The following morning, a young woman is killed by a Washington Metro train in {{what seems to be}} suicide. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck) is distraught to hear that the woman was Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer), a lead <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a private defense contractor with controversial operations involving mercenaries. Collins tells his former college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide.|$|E

In a review in the New Zealand Listener, David Larsen observes: [...] "Step by step, you see him thinking his way into full-fledged environmentalism: not because he's a natural zealot, but because he's an intellectually honest man brought face to face with evidence that our current economic and energy policies are digging our grandchildren's graves." ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Craig (Lucy Benjamin) is {{the head}} of the {{graphics}} team in series one. Moffat was impressed with Benjamin's performance, and expanded her character for the second series. However she had committed herself to roles in the LWT sitcom Close to Home and Jupiter Moon, so the character was replaced by Sam. The character returns in the opening episode of series four as <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> the Saturday morning show Crazy Stuff. She arranges for Lynda and Spike to be reunited on live television, but the subsequent complaints about the violence (face slapping) results in Julie's firing. After giving Lynda some home truths, Julie replaces Kenny as the assistant editor for the final two series. She is a flirt, and, according to Lynda, was the [...] "official pin-up at the last prison riot." ...|$|E

500|$|Edwards {{authored}} {{two of the}} volumes. Crises & Commitments (1992)—written with Gregory Pemberton—analysed {{the political}} and diplomatic history of Australia's involvement in the three conflicts up to 1965, while A Nation at War (1997) covered the political, diplomatic and social history of Australia's Vietnam War from 1965 to 1975. Crises & Commitments received a somewhat contentious reception. John Murphy criticised the volume for {{what he saw as}} an overemphasis on the diplomatic and for skirting the social controversies of the Vietnam era. Murphy also questioned the need for an official history. Pemberton, a senior <b>researcher</b> <b>on</b> the history who drafted several of the earlier chapters before leaving the project acrimoniously in 1990, took issue with the book as well, arguing that his input [...] "had been censored and sanitised in the final product". Edwards acknowledged substantial rewrites to Pemberton's drafts in the foreword to Crises & Commitments, but the extent of and reasoning for the changes were not made clear. A Nation at War experienced a warmer reception, winning the Foundation of Australian Literary Studies Award and H. T. Priestley Medal. In spite of Murphy's doubts, the official history series was also [...] "praised [...] its detached and scholarly analysis of complex events", according to the Oxford Companion to Australian Military History.|$|E
