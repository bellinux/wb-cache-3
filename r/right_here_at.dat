[...] It was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In the 1980s, after the station had been vacant for many years, the Community Redevelopment Agency spent $700,000 to restore the structure to its original exterior design. [...] The station was re-opened in 1989 as a customer service office for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and a small museum of Watts history.

2500|$|On March 31, 1968, {{following}} the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's {{entry into the}} election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing [...] "With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> home, with our hopes and the world's hopes {{for peace in the}} balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office—the presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President." [...] Not discussed publicly at the time was Johnson's concern he might not survive another term—Johnson's health was poor, and he had suffered a serious heart attack in 1955 while serving in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.|$|E

40|$|Human {{capital is}} defined by Krugman and Wells as “the {{improvement}} {{in the labor force}} generated by education and knowledge. ” 1 Other definitions are broader to include physical health and social structures such as connections and networks. You have made a choice as an individual to develop your human capital <b>right</b> now <b>here</b> <b>at</b> Washington State University, and economists use models to make predictions not just about how this will affect your life personally, but how that choice affects society as a whole. This presentation will focus on giving a broad overview of what human capital is, how economists measure it, and provide a quick macroeconomic application analyzing the economic arguments for why human capital should be subsidized. Measurement: Though human capital cannot be measured directly, {{there are a number of}} things which can be measured that are believed to be related to human capital. These include data on inputs such as education spending, school enrollment rates, and average years of schooling. Outcomes can also be measured, such as the adult literacy rate. 2 All measures have their benefits and drawbacks. No matter what proxy is used for human capital in regressions, one persistent issue is the matte...|$|R

6000|$|LAPHAM had {{the pride}} which comes of self-making, {{and he would}} not openly lower his crest to the young fellow he had taken into his business. He was going to be {{obviously}} master in his own place to every one; and during the hours of business he did nothing to distinguish Corey from the half-dozen other clerks and book-keepers in the outer office, but he was not silent about the fact that Bromfield Corey's son had taken a fancy to come to him. [...] "Did you notice that fellow at the desk facing my type-writer girl? Well, sir, that's the son of Bromfield Corey--old Phillips Corey's grandson. And I'll say this for him, that there isn't a man in the office that looks after his work better. There isn't anything he's too good for. He's <b>right</b> <b>here</b> <b>at</b> nine every morning, before the clock gets in the word. I guess it's his grandfather coming out in him. He's got charge of the foreign correspondence. We're pushing the paint everywhere." [...] He flattered himself that he did not lug the matter in. He had been warned against that by his wife, but he had the right to do Corey justice, and his brag took the form of illustration. [...] "Talk about training for business--I tell you it's all in the man himself! I used to believe in what old Horace Greeley said about college graduates being the poorest kind of horned cattle; but I've changed my mind a little. You take that fellow Corey. He's been through Harvard, and he's had about every advantage that a fellow could have. Been everywhere, and talks half a dozen languages like English. I suppose he's got money enough to live without lifting a hand, any more than his father does; son of Bromfield Corey, you know. But the thing was in him. He's a natural-born business man; and I've had many a fellow with me that had come up out of the street, and worked hard all his life, without ever losing his original opposition to the thing. But Corey likes it. I believe the fellow would like to stick at that desk of his night and day. I don't know where he got it. I guess it must be his grandfather, old Phillips Corey; it often skips a generation, you know. But what I say is, a thing has got to be born in a man; and if it ain't born in him, all the privations in the world won't put it there, and if it is, all the college training won't take it out." ...|$|E
