40|$|The {{research}} work herein presented {{is aimed at}} investigating the structural behavior of stone masonry walls reinforced through different strengthening techniques. In particular, the difference between them is given by (i) application on both faces of a mortar coating reinforced with a GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers) mesh; (ii) application of the GFRP jacketing on one side only and (iii) application of a hybrid technique, obtained by {{the combination of a}} GFRP jacketing, on one side, and a reinforced repointing with steel-strands, on the other. Shear-compression (SC) and diagonal compression (DC) experiments were carried out on full-scale masonry walls both reinforced (RM) and unreinforced (URM), as reference. The structural effectiveness of the various reinforcing techniques is highlighted. Further assessment of test predictions was then performed by means of well-calibrated finite-element (FE) numerical models able to properly take into account the effective contribution of each specimen component. Interesting correlations were generally found between test predictions and corresponding numerical models. The experiments, as shown, generally evidenced a good effectiveness of the strengthening techniques proposed, with particular concern to that with the <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> on both sides, and highlighted also the importance of the transversal connectors to prevent in plane cracks in the masonry and the detachment of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports on}} the erosion {{performance}} of three particle reinforced metal matrix composite coatings, co-deposited with an aluminium binder via cold-gas dynamic spraying. The deposition of ceramic particles is difficult to achieve with typical cold spray techniques due {{to the absence of}} particle deformation. This issue has been overcome in the present study by simultaneously spraying the reinforcing particles with a ductile metallic binder which has led to an increased level of ceramic/cermet particles deposited on the substrate with thick (> 400 µm) coatings produced. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the erosion performance of the co-deposited coatings within a slurry environment. The study also incorporated standard metallographic characterisation techniques to evaluate the distribution of reinforcing particles within the aluminium matrix. All coatings exhibited poorer erosion performance than the uncoated material, both in terms of volume loss and mass loss. The Al 2 O 3 <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> sustained the greatest amount of damage following exposure to the slurry and recorded the greatest volume loss (approx. 2. 8 mm 3) out of all of the examined coatings. Despite the poor erosion performance, the WC-CoCr <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> demonstrated a considerable hardness increase over the as-received AA 5083 (approx. 400 %) and also exhibited the smallest free space length between adjacent particles. The findings of this study reveal that the removal of the AA 5083 matrix by the impinging silicon carbide particles acts as the primary wear mechanism leading to the degradation of the coating. Analysis of the wear scar has demonstrated that the damage to the soft matrix alloy takes the form of ploughing and scoring which subsequently exposes carbide/oxide particles to the impinging slurry...|$|E

Tungsten carbide – cobalt chromium, chromium carbide – nickel chromium and aluminium oxide coatings were successfully cold spray deposited on AA 5083 grade aluminium. In order to improve the deposition efficiency of the cold spray process, coatings were co-deposited with powdered AA 5083 using a twin powder feed system that resulted in thick (> 300 µm) composite coatings.

Tungsten carbide – cobalt chromium, chromium carbide – nickel chromium and aluminium oxide coatings were cold spray deposited on to AA 5083 grade aluminium and subsequently friction stir processed. In order to improve the deposition efficiency of the cold spray process, coatings were co-deposited with powdered AA 5083. Friction stir processing (FSP) has been used in combination with the cold spray deposited coating to produce an engineered surface layer containing evenly dispersed reinforcing particles that reflects the constituent phases of the feedstock powder. Microstructural characterisation was performed on the test specimens making use of micro-hardness testing, light optical and scanning electron microscopy with electron dispersive spectroscopy to establish the elemental composition of the processed layer. The resulting data was contrasted with as-deposited coatings (no FSP) to highlight the variation in microstructure between the two conditions.

In particular, textile threads as an alternative fiber reinforcement solution for cement based coating mortar.

Meanwhile, finding applications for the waste derived from the textile industry may also result in attractive economical and sustainable solutions.

40|$|A {{strengthening}} {{technique for}} increasing both the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance of masonry walls {{based on the}} application {{on both sides of}} the wall of a mortar coating reinforced with glass fiberreinforced polymer (GFRP) meshes is herein considered. A recent experimental campaign evidenced the effectiveness of this technique both in terms of resistance and deformation capacity of masonry walls. The paper focuses on the in-plane behavior of reinforced masonry, collecting the results of diagonal compression tests performed on solid brick masonry specimens enhanced by considering 17 different types of mortar for the coating (tensile resistances ranging from 0. 7 to 3 MPa, Young modulus from 6000 to 23000 MPa). These experimental results are useful to extend the validity of an analytical formulation proposed by the authors and to investigate on the behavior of the reinforced masonry when the coating mechanical characteristics vary considerably. It emerged that the effectiveness of the reinforcement decreases with the increase of the mortar resistance and that the assessment of the reinforced masonry resistance as sum of the resistances of the masonry and that of the <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> in not always on the safe side but has to be corrected through a coefficient.

In order to improve the hardness and wear resistance properties of stainless steel surface, TiC <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> has been produced on AISI 304 stainless steel using pulsed Nd:YAG laser and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) cladding process. Further, to enhance the efficiency of TIG cladding process {{as well as to}} amend the tribological properties of TiC based coating, Ni (for better bonding) and CaF 2 (as a solid lubricant) have been incorporated in various phases of experiments.

The experimental analysis revealed that TiC reinforced composite coating produced by TIG heat source improved the micro-hardness and abrasive wear resistance significantly. Further, with the incorporation of Ni, bonding between the substrate and TiC reinforcement enhances, and consequently augmented the wear resistance of the coating.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work {{was to develop a}} low cost and efficient retrofitting technique for masonry buildings in Pakistan using indigenous materials, technologies and local skills. Three retrofitting techniques; ferrocement overlay, bed joint reinforcement and grout injection were investigated. Ferrocement overlay, also called <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating,</b> is a technique used for rehabilitation and retrofitting of unreinforced masonry buildings in which a steel welded wire mesh is connected to the surface of masonry wall and then plastered with a rich mortar. The efficacy of reinforced plaster is dependent on the bond between masonry and the plaster coating which is established through connectors, e. g. screws or bolts, and the bond between plaster and masonry. This study was carried out through a number of quasi-static reverse cyclic testing on isolated piers, perforated walls and single room building. Shake table test of half scale model before and after retrofitting was also carried out as part of the study. Damage patterns and the force-deformation parameters such as lateral stiffness, lateral strength, deformation capacity, energy dissipation capacity, etc. of specimens tested before and after retrofitting were studied and compared. It was concluded that the proposed cement-based grout might restore or even improve the pre-damaged state of unreinforced brick masonry buildings. Bed joint reinforcement in combination with grout injection might be utilized for local strengthening of cracked regions. Ferrocement overlay, on the other hand, was found very effective in enhancing the overall seismic performance of unreinforced masonry buildings. When applied to both sides of walls in single and double storey unreinforced masonry building, ferrocement overlay in combination with grout injection increased the lateral strength and stiffness by more than 100 % without significantly affecting the deformation and energy dissipating capacities. This technique was found to be more effective on shearcritical piers than rocking-critical piers. This technique is very simple in application because of utilization of locally available materials and with no special skill requirements. This technique is not only simple and efficient but also economical. The total cost of retrofitting (ferrocement overlay and grout injection) is less than 20 % of the cost of replacement of the building. Guidelines for the application of ferrocement overlay and grout injection and detailed procedure for the design of the unreinforced buildings retrofitted with ferrocement overlay are developed. A simple analytical model is proposed for the seismic performance evaluation of unreinforced masonry buildings retrofitted with ferrocement overlay. This model is based on results obtained from experimental work and existing formulations for unreinforced masonry buildings and reinforced concrete members and is calibrated with the test results performed as a part of this study. Performance modification factors for rocking-critical and shear-critical piers, corresponding to various damaged levels, are also proposed that are required for the performance evaluation of damaged buildings...|$|E
30|$|A single-effect {{conventional}} {{solar still}} is an air tight basin that contains saline water (i.e., feed water). It is enclosed by a transparent top cover, usually of glass which allows {{incident solar radiation}} to pass through. The inner surface of the basin is usually blackened {{to increase the efficiency}} of the system by absorbing more of the incident solar radiation (Tiwari et al. 2003). A multiple wick bed-type solar still with condenser arrangement gives higher output than simple traditional solar still (Reddy et al. 1983). The multi-wick solar still is most economical and efficient one. From the investigation, it showed that the conventional solar still made of concrete with black fiber <b>reinforced</b> <b>coating</b> from inside is suitable for a large scale system with capacity more than 1000  l/day. Whereas the small scale system with capacity less than 1000  l/day, the fiber reinforced plastic multi-wick solar still is appropriate (Tiwari and Garg 1985). A potable-type solar still was designed with basin area of 0.54  m 2. The daily output of fresh water was found 1.7  l/day in the month of July. The maximum output of fresh water is 0.339  l/h at 13 : 00  hours. The feed surface water 330  ppm (TDS), conductivity 1.291  mS/cm, and pH 6.72 were measured before distillation. The distilled water was found TDS of 30  ppm, conductivity 41  mS/cm, and pH of 6.5 after distillation (Samee et al. 2007). Sodha et al. (1981) have developed new concept on multi-wick solar still to increase the productivity of still. They used a black jute cloth pieces uneven length placed one upon another and separate by polyethylene film. The entire wick remains wet due to capillary action. The width of each jute cloth is 86  cm and length of wick is 100  cm. The glass thickness is 3.0  mm. Output distilled was 2.5  l/m 2 day. Mahdi et al. (2011) designed and experiment a wick-type solar still. They used charcoal as an absorber for their analysis and increase efficiency of 53  % on clear day of summer. Naim and ElKawi (2002) investigated on basin-type solar still in which charcoal is used as an absorber medium. A similar inclined wick-type solar still was tested by SMA Maustafa et al. (1979) in which a 2.5 -cm-thick black synthetic wettable mat of area 0.182  m 2 was placed over a plastic sheet. The flow of water in the wick was controlled using a flow regulator and shut-off valve operated with a photocell. Another novel idea in a wick-type solar still was given by Frick and Summerfeld (1973), who suggested the use of jute cloth along the width of the still, dipped in saline water trays. The jute cloth remains wet due to capillary action and therefore avoiding the use of water distribution system. They are also reported the efficiencies achieved 40 – 50  % with this type of still. Kabeel (2009) investigated on a concave-type wick for absorption and pyramid shaped still were normally used for condensation. The average production of still was 4.1  l/m 2 day. Sakthivel et al. (2010) used jute cloth on middle vertical position of the basin and another jute cloth is on the surface wall of the still. A series of experimental and theoretical studies on inclined wick-type solar stills are conducted by Mimaki et al. (1981) and Tanaka et al. (1981) in Japan. They used a black cotton towel as wick with an effective area of 1.79  m 2 and glass thickness of 5  mm.

The micro-mechanical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results for the two systems...|$|R
50|$|Ponckhockie Union Chapel is a {{historic}} chapel at 91 Abruyn Street in Kingston, New York. It was built in 1870, and is a rectangular, Gothic Revival style poured <b>reinforced</b> concrete structure <b>coated</b> in stucco. It is three bays wide and five bays deep, and features a projecting bell tower topped by a truncated spire.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this article}} we utilize a {{concentric}} cylinder model to analyze the stress state in a continuously <b>reinforced</b> <b>coated</b> fiber composite subjected to transverse loading. We incorporate this analysis into a methodical approach to determine an optimal inter-phase coating for the fibers to maximize the composite’s transverse strain to failure. The present study focuses {{on the effect of}} interphase Young’s modulus on the stress state in the matrix material of a composite subjected to constant strain (displacement) boundary con-ditions. We demonstrate, by analytically varying the coating modulus, that an optimum in-terphase property exists which minimizes the maximum principal stress and the strain en-ergy density in the composite material. The minimization of these quantities clearly indicates that failure initiation in a composite with an optimal fiber coating will occur at a significantly larger strain level. Therefore, we postulate (based on the current analysis) that the transverse strain to failure of a composite system can be increased with appropriate fiber coatings. Results and design curves are presented for an AS- 4 /Epon 828 composite system which suggest that for large fiber volume fractions (i. e., 60 %) the optimum coating is an elastomeric material. The data presented on this composite suggest that the strain to failure can be increased as much as 6 times by coating the structural fibers with an optimal coating. A comparison between constant stress boundary conditions (i. e., optimizing strength) and constant strain boundary conditions (i. e., optimizing strain to failure) are also presented...|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} 2002-2003, a {{complete}} overhaul {{was carried out}} on the old bridge related {{to the construction of}} the Ladozhsky Rail Terminal with a total value of around 900 million rubles. During overhaul a new pivot span and turning machinery were mounted and the supporting bridge towers underwent renovation—the supporting piers of the bridge were substituted by new ones. The bridge's footings were strengthened by installing a <b>reinforced</b> concrete <b>coating</b> using falsework plates and underwater concreting. Additionally, the adjoining metal overpass was completely overhauled with the replacement of 43 pillars and the corresponding 42 spans. All the construction and repair work had been completed on January 2003.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of seismic vulnerability of existing masonry buildings {{through the application}} {{on the walls of}} a mortar <b>coating</b> <b>reinforced</b> with a GFRP (glass fiber reinforced polymer) mesh is studied and discussed. Numerous experimental tests, carried out by the authors, demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for enhancing the mechanical response of the walls, both subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane actions. In the study, the capacity curves of an existing unreinforced masonry building are compared with those of the same building strengthened with the GFRP <b>reinforced</b> mortar <b>coating</b> technique. An almost regular two storey building is considered in the numerical study and it is analyzed by adopting the method of the equivalent frame. Two different types of masonry are considered in the study: solid bricks and rubble stones. Static nonlinear analyses are carried out and the nonlinearity of the material of the wall elements (piers and spandrels) is considered through the introduction of plastic hinges in the plane of the masonry wall. The results evidence a significant increase in terms of shear resistance, displacement capacity and total strain energy. The collapse due to bending of piers in most cases of strengthened buildings occurred before than the ultimate shear drift was obtained...|$|R
