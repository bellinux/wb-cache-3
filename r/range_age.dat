40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{presence}} of angina pectoris and myocardial scarring {{in patients with}} hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) suggests that myocardial ischemia {{is a factor in}} the pathophysiology of the disease. The clinical evaluation of ischaemia is problematic in HCM as baseline electrocardiographic abnormalities are frequent and thallium- 201 perfusion abnormalities correlate poorly with anginal symptoms. Coronary sinus pH measurement using a catheter mounted pH electrode is a validated sensitive technique for the detection of myocardial ischaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: 11 patients with HCM and chest pain (eight men; mean (SD) (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> 36 (11) (19 - 53) years) and six controls (two men; mean (SD) (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> 49 (11) (31 - 62) years) with atypical pain and normal coronary angiograms were studied. Eight patients with HCM had baseline ST segment depression of > or = 1 mm and four had reversible perfusion defects during stress 201 TI scintigraphy. A catheter mounted hydrogen ion sensitive electrode was introduced into the coronary sinus and pH monitored continuously during dipyridamole infusion (0. 56 mg/kg over four min). The maximal change in coronary sinus pH during dipyridamole stress was greater in patients with HCM than in controls (0. 082 (0. 083) (0 to - 0. 275) v 0. 005 (0. 006) (0 to - 0. 012), P = 0. 02). In six patients (four men; mean (SD) (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> 29 (9) (19 - 40 years) the development of chest pain was associated with a gradual decline in coronary sinus pH (mean 0. 123 (0. 089)), peaking at 442 (106) s. There were no relations among left ventricular dimensions, maximal wall thickness, and maximum pH change. In patients with HCM there was a correlation between maximum pH change and maximum heart rate during dipyridamole infusion (r = 0. 70, P = 0. 02). CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that chest pain in patients with HCM is caused by myocardial ischaemia. The role of myocardial ischaemia in the pathophysiology of the disease remains to be determined but coronary sinus pH monitoring provides a method for quantifying and prospectively assessing its effects on clinical presentation and prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in genes {{traditionally}} {{associated with}} syndromic retinal disease are increasingly found to cause nonsyndromic inherited retinal degenerations. Mutations in CLN 3 are classically associated with juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a rare neurodegenerative disease with early retinal degeneration and progressive neurologic deterioration, but have recently also {{been identified in}} patients with nonsyndromic inherited retinal degenerations. To our knowledge, detailed clinical characterization of such cases {{has yet to be}} reported. To provide detailed clinical, electrophysiologic, structural, and molecular genetic findings in nonsyndromic inherited retinal degenerations associated with CLN 3 mutations. A multi-institutional case series of 10 patients who presented with isolated nonsyndromic retinal disease and mutations in CLN 3. Patient ages ranged from 16 to 70 years; duration of follow-up ranged from 3 to 29 years. Longitudinal clinical evaluation, including full ophthalmic examination, multimodal retinal imaging, perimetry, and electrophysiology. Molecular analyses were performed using whole-genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing. Electron microscopy studies of peripheral lymphocytes and CLN 3 transcript analysis with polymerase chain reaction amplification were performed in a subset of patients. There were 7 females and 3 males in this case series, with a mean (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at last review of 37. 1 (16 - 70) years. Of the 10 patients, 4 had a progressive late-onset rod-cone dystrophy, with a mean (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at onset of 29. 7 (20 - 40) years, and 6 had an earlier onset rod-cone dystrophy, with a mean (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at onset of 12. 1 (7 - 17) years. Ophthalmoscopic examination features included macular edema, mild intraretinal pigment migration, and widespread atrophy in advanced disease. Optical coherence tomography imaging demonstrated significant photoreceptor loss except in patients with late-onset disease who had a focal preservation of the ellipsoid zone and outer nuclear layer in the fovea. Electroretinography revealed a rod-cone pattern of dysfunction in 6 patients and were completely undetectable in 2 patients. Six novel CLN 3 variants were identified in molecular analyses. This report describes detailed clinical, imaging, and genetic features of CLN 3 -associated nonsyndromic retinal degeneration. The age at onset and natural progression of retinal disease differs greatly between syndromic and nonsyndromic CLN 3 disease, which may be associated with genotypic differences...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To analyse the {{self-reported}} {{degree of}} and factors influencing the compliance to desferrioxamine (DFO) therapy {{in children with}} transfusion-dependent thalassaemia major in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on all children with thalassaemia major on DFO attending Likas Hospital, Sabah, in September 2008. Patients or carer-providers were interviewed {{to report on the}} degree of compliance as either highly (administering > 90 of DFO), moderately (51 - 90), poorly (1 - 50) or non-compliant (0) to DFO in the preceding month. The latest serum ferritin levels were noted. Results: The median (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at first blood transfusion of these 139 (73 males, median (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at interview: 9. 0 years (2 - 16 years)) patients were 1. 0 year (2 months to 10 years). The median (range) duration of regular DFO therapy was 2 years (2 months to 10 years). Forty-three (31) of the patients reported themselves to be highly compliant, 70 (50) moderately and 26 (19) poorly or non-compliant. Multivariate analysis showed that a lower family income negatively affected the degree of compliance, while family support positively affected the degree of compliance to DFO. No correlation existed between self-reported degree of compliance and latest serum ferritin level (6444 +/- mu mol/L; P = 0. 186). Conclusion: The self-reported compliance to DFO therapy was moderate in this cohort of patients with thalassaemia major in Malaysia. The serum ferritin level was high, possibly because of the relatively short duration of DFO therapy and compliance. Oral iron chelator should be considered to improve the compliance to iron chelation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} clinical features and long-term survival in childhood sarcoidosis. In total, 46 ethnic Caucasian Danish children (aged, 16 yrs, 24 males) with sarcoidosis were identified in 1979 – 1994. In 33 (72 %) children, diagnosis was verified by histology and, in the remaining 13, by clinical and radiological findings. In total, 37 subjects had a follow-up examination. Median (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at onset of disease was 14 (0. 7 – 15. 8) yrs and median (range) clinical follow-up was 15 (3 – 23) yrs after onset of disease. The median (<b>range)</b> <b>age</b> at clinical follow-up was 28 (17 – 30) yrs. At follow-up: 36 (78 %) children recovered completely; 30 (65 %) showed complete clinical regression at a median (range) 0. 7 (0. 6 – 5. 9) yrs after onset of disease; two (4 %) recovered with organ damage (unilateral loss of vision, abnormal chest radiograph); five (11 %) still had chronic active disease with multiorgan involvement and impaired lung function; and three (7 %) were deceased, due to central nervous system sarcoidosis and acute myeloid leukaemia probably caused by cytostatics. In Danish children, sarcoidosis had a favourable prognosis; the majority recovered, 6 yrs after onset of disease. Some developed chronic active disease and impairment of pulmonary function, demanding continuous medical treatment. Prognosis was not related to the age at onset of disease. Erythema nodosum was associated with a good prognosis, and central nervous system involvement with a poor prognosis...|$|E
