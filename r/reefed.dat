5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not <b>reefed</b> and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these cars, other cars were also stored around the system. Pair 9400-9401 was stored at the Corona Yard for preservation; however, the cars were never used and were scrapped on October 7, 2013. Pair 9564–9565 was set aside and transferred to Coney Island Yard in December 2004 for conversion of 9564 to a visitor center at Queens Borough Hall in Kew Gardens, Queens, and the preservation of 9565 in a museum in West Babylon, New York. However, R33 9075 was used at Queens Borough hall instead of 9564, and 9565 {{never made it to}} the proposed museum; the cars were subsequently <b>reefed</b> in 2008. Pair 9588–9589 was stored at the Concourse Yard until 2008, when the pair was <b>reefed.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{traditional}} schooner design had {{a number}} of drawbacks. The shallow hull did not, in fact, contribute significantly to speed, and the wide stern design actually hindered fast sailing. The ships shallowness of hull gave them a high center of gravity that made them prone to capsizing and sinking in heavy seas, often with significant or total loss of life among their crews. The foremast rising to the same height as the mainmast often meant either that the jib when raised {{to the top of the}} foremast caused an inefficient, asymmetrical sail pattern, or that the upper parts of the foremast were left unused; having a foremast that was taller than necessary added extra expense to the cost of the ships construction and also meant that she had an unnecessary amount of weight aloft, making her less stable and more prone to dangerous rolling and capsizing. The large jib also created problems, moving the sails center of effort too far forward when the schooner shortened sail and the mainsail was <b>reefed,</b> making the ship harder to handle. Moreover, handling the large jib required crew members to work on the bowsprit in bad weather, a dangerous practice that resulted in men being swept overboard and drowned.|$|E

On 20 September 1797, Pigot ordered the topsails to be <b>reefed</b> after a squall struck the ship. Dissatisfied {{with the speed of}} the operation because [...] "these would be the yard-arm men, the most skilful topmen" [...] he gave the order that the last men off the yard would be flogged. This policy was particularly unreasonable as the men would be spaced along the yard, and the two whose stations were furthest out would always be the last down. Three young sailors, in their haste to get down, fell to their deaths on the deck. One of the sailors hit and injured the master, Mr. Southcott. Pigot ordered their bodies thrown into the sea with the words [...] "throw the [...] overboard"; a particularly offensive insult in the seaman's vocabulary. He then instructed two boatswain's mates to flog the rest of the topmen when they complained. The topmen were also flogged the next morning.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Waller on Emerald {{was divided}} {{from the other}} frigates, and his lookouts had {{observed}} Vanguard in its dismasted state {{at the height of}} the storm. The other two frigates had <b>reefed</b> their sails and ridden out the storm together, Captain Gage turning towards the Spanish coast when the storm abated and on 29 May encountered HMS Alcmene under Captain George Johnstone Hope, which had been sent by St. Vincent to augment Nelson's force. Two days later Hope's squadron encountered Emerald, which had captured two merchant ships, and together they sailed for the prearranged rendezvous point [...] off Cape St. Sebastian near Barcelona. Hope ordered Terpsichore and Bonne Citoyenne to cruise off Sardinia and on 3 June encountered the brig HMS Mutine under Captain Thomas Hardy, the scout of a fleet sent by Earl St. Vincent that was approaching the rendezvous. Knowing of the damaged suffered by Vanguard and aware that the French had left Toulon, Hope then took the unilateral decision to search for the French himself, dispersing the frigates across the Western Mediterranean. Hope's ships failed to find either the British or French fleets and none of the frigates returned to Nelson's command until after the Battle of the Nile.|$|E

2500|$|She {{was built}} in 1900 by Ferguson and Baird at their Connah's Quay, Flintshire yard, for local {{shipping}} company Coppack Bros. Constructed with a doubled frame of oak, these were covered by [...] thick seasoned pitch pine planks, fastened to the frames with treenails and iron bolts. Equipped with the first known fitting of Appledore roller reefing, the sails are <b>reefed</b> by a ratchet lever that engaged the cogs on the Gaff boom, thereby winding the sail around it, and then locked to prevent the sail unwinding from the boom. Launched in April 1900 under Captain John Coppack, she was named Lizzie May after the Captain’s daughters.|$|E

2500|$|Dundas was {{eventually}} forced to haul {{away from the}} Belleisle as night fell, and try to save his own ship. During the night the Naiads larboard topsail sheet blew away, and the <b>reefed</b> topsail sheet was split. The crew were forced to cut away the other sheet to save the yard, but the sheet blew away in the gale. Shortly afterwards the fore topmast staysail was blown to bits. Belleisle was also in a desperate situation, blown almost onto the breakers of the Spanish coast before her crew managed to wear her around. With difficulty she survived the night, and was found when the light came the next morning by Dundas, who had a line reattached. [...] He steered straight for Gibraltar, and came {{within sight of the}} rock by midday, despite having been fired on by the Spanish battery at Tarifa. Dundas took Naiad in and anchored at 1330 that afternoon, while the Belleisle was warped into the mole. Dundas subsequently was awarded a sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund for his services at Trafalgar.|$|E

40|$|In the Late Triassic (~ 235 – 201. 3 Ma) scleractinian corals and hypercalcified sponges built large, diverse <b>reef</b> ecosystems, {{the most}} famous of which are the Dachstein <b>reefs.</b> This study {{presents}} a depth transect along an Upper Triassic (lower Rhaetian) Dachstein <b>reef</b> from the Gosausee margin of the Dachsteingebirge (Gosau, Austria). The Gosausee microbial-sponge-coral <b>reef</b> is a complete barrier <b>reef</b> with an almost continuous fore <b>reef</b> to lagoon transect preserved (a very rare occurrence for the Triassic), and thus provides a window into depth zonation of Dachstein-type <b>reef</b> facies and biotic succession. The Gosausee <b>reef</b> facies exhibit strong depth control and five classic <b>reef</b> facies or zones are identified: the fore <b>reef,</b> <b>reef</b> front, <b>reef</b> crest, back <b>reef,</b> and lagoon facies. Thin, rare microbial fabrics and a high abundance of fine-grained, mud-rich skeletal wackestones (transported <b>reef</b> debris) characterize the deepest fore <b>reef.</b> As the <b>reef</b> shallows, muddy sediments decrease in abundance and are replaced by microbial fabrics, corals, and cements. Abundant sponges, microbial crusts, and thick, marine cements typify the <b>reef</b> crest, whereas microbialite-coated phaceloid corals are dominant in the back <b>reef</b> facies. Heavily cemented oncoids or microbial-sponge bindstones are characteristic of the lagoon. Based on their compositional and biotic similarities, the Gosausee <b>reef</b> was likely part of the same barrier <b>reef</b> systems as the source <b>reef</b> for the Gosaukamm <b>reef</b> breccia (one of the classic Norian–Rhaetian Dachstein <b>reefs).</b> The <b>reef</b> zones of the Gosausee margin can be used to interpret the depth or <b>reef</b> zone of less well preserved <b>reef</b> fragments, can inform models of community ecology and niche utilization in the Late Triassic, and highlight the need for additional research into the environmental factors that controlled biotic distribution in Upper Triassic <b>reefs...</b>|$|R
