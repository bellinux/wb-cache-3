5|$|Two aluminium-alloy {{castings}} {{joined together}} on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, supercharger and accessories; and carries the cylinder blocks, crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead bronze alloy), {{and part of the}} housing for the airscrew <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b> The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the oil pumps and filters.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
50|$|The Rolls-Royce Falcon {{engine of}} 1915 {{featured}} epicyclic propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> which contained a clutch designed {{to limit the}} maximum torque, thus protecting the <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b> The later Merlin engine from the same company used opposite rotation <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> to provide counter-rotating propellers for twin-engined aircraft, a much cheaper method than designing and building the engines to run in opposite directions.|$|R

25|$|The Pegasus was {{produced}} in many variants, early prototype engines were unsupercharged but the majority used a geared supercharger, either single-speed or two-speed. Variant differences included compression ratios, propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> ratios and accessories.|$|E
25|$|A {{steam turbine}} ship {{can be either}} direct {{propulsion}} (the turbines, equipped with a <b>reduction</b> <b>gear,</b> rotate directly the propellers), or turboelectric (the turbines rotate electric generators, which in turn feed electric motors operating the propellers).|$|E
25|$|The EV {{is based}} on the 2LT model, and adds unique alloy wheels with black-painted accents, replaces the I4 engine and 6-speed {{automatic}} transmission with an electric motor, a fixed, 3.87 ratio <b>reduction</b> <b>gear,</b> and closes off the front grill due to being entirely electric.|$|E
50|$|The Wright {{brothers}} recognised {{the need}} for propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> in 1903, {{but it was not}} generally used on aircraft engines until larger engines were designed in the 1920s. Large engines with high crankshaft speeds and power outputs demanded propeller reduction, pilots noted the increase in performance of similar aircraft fitted with <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|R

25|$|While Babbage's {{original}} design placed the crank {{directly on the}} main shaft, it was later realized that the force required to crank the machine {{would have been too}} great for a human to handle comfortably. Therefore, the two models that were built incorporate a 4:1 <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> at the crank, and four revolutions of the crank are required to perform one full cycle.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Aeronautics {{analyzed}} {{the possibilities of}} the plane becoming a competitive race plane, and decided that the extra weight of the supercharger could be better put to use by installing an epicyclic <b>reduction</b> <b>gear,</b> for improved propeller efficiency, thereby providing greater improvement in performance than what the supercharged engine with a direct drive propeller could provide for the same weight.|$|E
25|$|The Cheetah was {{developed}} from the earlier Lynx using the increased bore cylinders from the Armstrong Siddeley Panther but the engine retained the stroke of the Lynx. Initially only direct-drive variants were produced with later engines being made available with propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> of various ratios. Superchargers were also available for later variants, both geared and directly driven by the crankshaft.|$|E

25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{steam power}} is {{generated}} by the submarine's nuclear reactor delivering pressurized hot water to the steam generator, which generates steam to drive the steam-driven turbines and generators. While the emergency diesel generator is starting up, power can be provided from the submarine's battery through the ship service motor generators. Likewise, propulsion is normally delivered through the submarine's steam-driven main turbines that drive the submarine's propeller through a <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> system. The submarine has no main drive shaft, unlike conventional diesel electric submarines.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{starboard}} engine ran normally {{after it was}} decoupled from the <b>reduction</b> <b>gear,</b> a likely reason for the sudden drop of engine speed from 1,000 to 270 rpm and subsequent stalling when reconnected was increased load in the propulsion system due to damaged shaft bearing or a foreign object, perhaps something that had fallen from the deck, wedged in the propeller duct, although malfunction in the fuel supply and lubrication system due to the violent pitching of the vessel were not ruled out.|$|E

50|$|Conceptually, {{electric}} drive {{is only a}} segment of the propulsion system (it does not replace the nuclear reactor or the steam turbines). Instead it replaces <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> (mechanical drive) used on earlier nuclear-powered submarines. In 1998, the Defence Science Board envisaged a nuclear-powered submarine that would utilise an advanced {{electric drive}} eliminating the need for both <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> (mechanical drive) as well as steam turbines.|$|R
