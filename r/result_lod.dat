40|$|The {{level of}} detail in 3 D city modelling, despite its {{usefulness}} and importance, is still an ambiguous and undefined term. It {{is used for the}} communication of how thoroughly real-world features have been acquired and modelled, as we demonstrate in this paper. Its definitions vary greatly between practitioners, standards and institutions. We fundamentally discuss the concept, and we provide a formal and consistent framework to define discrete and continuous levels of detail (LODs), by determining six metrics that constitute it, and by discussing their quantification and their relations. The <b>resulting</b> <b>LODs</b> are discretisations of functions of metrics that can be specified in an acquisition–modelling specification form that we introduce. The advantages of this approach over existing paradigms are formalisation, consistency, continuity, and finer specification of LODs. As an example of the realisation of the framework, we derive a series of 10 discrete LODs. We give a proposal for the integration of the framework within the OGC standard CityGML (through the Application Domain Extension) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{popularity}} of Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) to capture three dimensional (3 D) objects {{has been used}} widely for various applications. Development in 3 D models has also led people to visualize the environment in 3 D. Visualization of objects in a city environment in 3 D can be useful for many applications. However, different applications require different kind of 3 D models. Since a building is an important object, CityGML has defined a standard for 3 D building models at four different levels of detail (LOD). In this research, the advantages of TLS for capturing buildings and the modelling process of the point cloud can be explored. TLS {{will be used to}} capture all the building details to generate multi-LOD. This task, in previous works, involves usually the integration of several sensors.

Identification of susceptibility genes for BMI regulation has been difficult. Reasons for these inconclusive results are both methodological and related to obesity aetiology. A genome-wide linkage analysis was performed to localise Quantitative trait loci influencing BMI in a large cohort collected in the PROCARDIS coronary heart disease study consisting of 1, 812 informative families. METHODS: Multipoint linkage analysis for BMI was conducted using both a variance component approach and a model-free regression method, and the <b>resulting</b> <b>LOD</b> scores were compared. RESULTS: The strongest evidence for linkage was detected on chromosomes 13 (LOD 1. 6). Other regions showing a LOD score greater than 1 were observed on chromosomes 3, 5, 11, 12 and 15. These results were mainly confirmed by the three different approaches used in the analysis. CONCLUSION: Our study did not find any locus with strongly supporting evidence for linkage to BMI even in such a large sample.

40|$|Multipoint lod {{scores are}} {{typically}} calculated for {{a grid of}} locus positions, moving the putative disease locus across a fixed map of genetic markers. Changing {{the order of a}} set of markers and/or the distances between the markers can make a substantial difference in the <b>resulting</b> <b>lod</b> score curve and the location and height of its maximum. The typical approach of using the best maximum likelihood marker map is not easily justified if other marker orders are nearly as likely and give substantially different lod score curves. To deal with this problem, we propose three weighted multipoint lod score statistics that make use of information from all plausible marker orders. In each of these statistics, the information conditional on a particular marker order is included in a weighted sum, with weight equal to the posterior probability of that order. We evaluate the type 1 error rate and power of these three statistics on the basis of results from simulated data, and compare these results to those obtained using the best maximum likelihood map and the map with the true marker order. We find that the lod score based on a weighted sum of maximum likelihoods improves on using only the best maximum likelihood map, having a type 1 error rate and power closest to that of using the true marker order in the simulation scenarios we considered.

40|$|Abstract Background Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations {{in at least two}} different loci. Prior to performing mutation screening, if DNA samples of sufficient number of family members are available, it is worthwhile to assign the gene involved in disease progression by the genetic linkage analysis. Methods We collected samples from 36 Slovene ADPKD families and performed linkage analysis in 16 of them. Linkage was assessed by the use of microsatellite polymorphic markers, four in the case of PKD 1 (KG 8, AC 2. 5, CW 3 and CW 2) and five for PKD 2 (D 4 S 1534, D 4 S 2929, D 4 S 1542, D 4 S 1563 and D 4 S 423). Partial PKD 1 mutation screening was undertaken by analysing exons 23 and 31 – 46 and PKD 2. <b>Results</b> <b>Lod</b> scores indicated linkage to PKD 1 in six families and to PKD 2 in two families. One family was linked to none and in seven families linkage to both genes was possible. Partial PKD 1 mutation screening was performed in 33 patients (including 20 patients from the families where linkage analysis could not be performed). We analysed PKD 2 in 2 patients where lod scores indicated linkage to PKD 2 and in 7 families where linkage to both genes was possible. We detected six mutations and eight polymorphisms in PKD 1 and one mutation and three polymorphisms in PKD 2. Conclusion In our study group of ADPKD patients we detected seven mutations: three frameshift, one missense, two nonsense and one putative splicing mutation. Three have been described previously and 4 are novel. Three newly described framesfift mutations in PKD 1 seem to be associated with more severe clinical course of ADPKD. Previously described nonsense mutation in PKD 2 seems to be associated with cysts in liver and milder clinical course. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a {{potentially}} curable disease that cause hypertension (HT). The {{first step in}} diagnosing PA consists in {{the determination of the}} aldosterone-renin-ratio (ARR). Recently, new methods with superior analytical performance for the measurement of both, aldosterone and renin, have been introduced in clinical practice. While aldosterone can be measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or automated immunoassays, renin is predominantly measured by direct immunoassays. ARR is strongly method dependent. Insufficient data exists on ARR in healthy subjects and PA patients when aldosterone and renin are measured with one of these new methods. Aim of study The present study evaluated the analytical performance a commercial LC-MS/MS method from Perkin Elmer (CHS ™ MSMS Steroids) for the measurement of aldosterone. In addition, we established a reference range for ARR when aldosterone is measured with the before mentioned LC-MS/MS method and renin is measured by a direct immunoassay from DiaSorin on a Liaison XL auto-analyser. Materials and methods The Perkin Elmer CHS ™ MSMS Steroids method is a multiplex assays. Analyses were performed on a Shimadzu 8050 LC-MS/MS. The analytical performance of aldosterone measurement was evaluated determining the following performance indices: LoD, LoQ, recovery, carryover, linearity and precision. For the establishment of the ARR reference range serum aldosterone and plasma renin were measured in samples from 128 normotensive blood donors. <b>Results</b> <b>LOD</b> and LOQ were respectively 12. 9 pg/mL and 26 pg/mL. Intraassay precision at different concentrations was 7 % (at 79. 9 pg/mL.), 7. 6 % (at 161. 8 pg/mL.) and 1. 5 % (at 3506. 08 pg/mL). Interassay precision was 8. 5 %, 9. 6 % e 5. 1 % respectively. Recovery ranged between 80. 5 and 104. 4 %. Between x and y the method was linear. ARR in healthy blood donors varied between 0. 6 - 62. 4 pg/µU with a median of 5. 7 pg/µU. The 2. 5 th and 97. 5 th percentiles (without outlier) were 1. 0 and 16. 4, respectively.

Discovery of the gene which causes Best disease has the potential to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of all types of macular degeneration, including the common age-related form. Best disease has recently been mapped to chromosome 11 q 13. The photoreceptor-specific protein ROM 1 has also been recently mapped to this location, and the ROM 1 gene is a candidate gene for Best disease. Using highly polymorphic markers, we have narrowed the genetic region which contains the Best disease gene to the 10 -cM region between markers D 11 S 871 and PYGM.

40|$|Facioscapulohumeral muscular {{dystrophy}} (FSHMD) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and clinical onset in {{the muscles of}} the face and shoulder girdle. Using a set of RFLP markers spaced at approximately 20 centimorgans, we have begun a systematic search for markers linked to the disease. A total of 81 RFLP loci on six autosomes (1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 16) have been examined for linkage to FSHMD in 13 families. With the computer program CRI-MAP, two-point and multipoint analyses have not <b>resulted</b> in any <b>LOD</b> score indicative of linkage to FSHMD. However, these analyses have allowed us to exclude 909 centimorgans (sex average) of our genetic maps in intervals where the LOD score is less than – 2. 0. We estimate our data have excluded 23 % of the human genome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{information}} {{content of a}} continuous variable exceeds that of its categorical counterpart. The parameterization of a model may diminish the benefit of using a continuous variable. We explored the use of continuous versus discrete environment in variance components based analyses examining gene × environment interaction in the electrophysiological phenotypes from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism. Results The parameterization using the continuous environment produced {{a greater number of}} significant gene × environment interactions and lower AICs (Akaike's information criterion). In these cases, the genetic variance increased with increasing cigarette pack-years, the continuous environment of interest. This did not, however, <b>result</b> in enhanced <b>LOD</b> scores when linkage analyses incorporated the gene × continuous environment interaction. Conclusion Alternative parameterizations may better represent the functional relationship between the continuous environment and the genetic variance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Variance {{component}} analysis provides an efficient method for performing linkage analysis for quantitative traits. However, type I error of variance components-based likelihood ratio testing {{may be affected}} when phenotypic data are non-normally distributed (especially with high values of kurtosis). This <b>results</b> in inflated <b>LOD</b> scores when the normality assumption does not hold. Even though different solutions have been proposed {{to deal with this}} problem with univariate phenotypes, little work has been done in the multivariate case. We present an empirical approach to adjust the inflated LOD scores obtained from a bivariate phenotype that violates the assumption of normality. Using the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism data available for the Genetic Analysis Workshop 14, we show how bivariate linkage analysis with leptokurtotic traits gives an inflated type I error. We perform a novel correction that achieves acceptable levels of type I error. </p...|$|R
40|$|Among white adults {{otosclerosis}} is {{the single}} most common cause of hearing impairment. Although the genetics of this disease are controversial, the majority of studies indicate autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance. We studied a large multi-generational family in which otosclerosis has been inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Five of 16 affected persons have surgically confirmed otosclerosis; the remaining nine have a conductive hearing loss but have not undergone corrective surgery. To locate the disease-causing gene we completed genetic linkage analysis using short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) distributed over the entire genome. Multipoint linkage analysis showed that only one genomic region, on chromosome 15 q, gener-ated a lod score> 2. 0. Additional STRPs were typed in this area, <b>resulting</b> in a <b>lod</b> score of 3. 4. STRPs FES (centromeric) and D 15 S 657 (telomeric) flank the 14. 5 cM region that contains an otosclerosis gene...|$|R
