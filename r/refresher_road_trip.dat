50|$|Generally, while <b>road</b> <b>trips</b> {{can occur}} at any mass of land, large masses of land {{are the most}} common {{location}} for the occurrence of <b>road</b> <b>trips.</b> The most popular locations for <b>road</b> <b>trips</b> include Canada, Mainland U.S., and Central Europe.

This may also be due to the distance required to qualify as a <b>road</b> <b>trip,</b> which residents of smaller bodies of land may find themselves incapable of achieving.|$|R
