40|$|Like {{many large}} countries, Indonesia has {{difficulty}} attracting doctors to service in rural and remote areas. To guide {{the creation of}} incentives for service in these areas, the authors analyze two sets of data about physicians: 1) the locations chosen by graduating medical students before and after {{a major change in}} the incentive system, and 2) survey data on choices among hypothetical assignments differing in compensation, career prospects, and amenities at various locations. Their findings suggest that: a) The current policy of offering specialist training is incentive enough to make doctors from Java willing to serve in remote areas. (It is not necessary to also offer a civil service appointment.) But providing specialist training as an incentive to work in remote areas is not only expensive, but potentially inefficient, since specialist practice and <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> health <b>management</b> require different skills and attitudes. b) Moderately (but not extremely) remote areas can be staffed using modest cash incentives. c) Doctors from the Outer Islands are far more willing to serve in remote areas than their counterparts from Java. So, it may be worthwhile increasing the representation of Outer Island students in medical schools (perhaps through scholarships and assistance in pre-university preparation).

The shortages of <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> product supply lead to the difficult ties in developing agriculture and rural economy; enriching farmers and narrowing the urban and rural income gap. Problems in <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> product supply are further analyzed. Firstly, the national finance used in agriculture is low.

Firstly, public goods supply {{in rural areas}} is inadequate, for example, inadequate supply of agricultural infrastructure, lack of expenditure in agricultural science and technology, problems of rural drinking water safety, problems of rural roads and transportation, low levels of health care, weak <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> culture, short supply of farmers’ education. Secondly, the system and level of urban public goods provision can’t meet migrant workers’ demand, for example, less migrant workers are employed by the governments’ direction; migrant workers are isolated by urban housing project and these workers have difficulty in receiving city social security. One reason of new generation migrant workers facing the double marginalization of rural and urban crisis is that urban and <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> goods supply are different in particular the inadequate supply of <b>public</b> goods in <b>rural</b> areas.

The study assessed trends of public health services accessibility in rural China from 2008 to 2010, {{as well as the}} current situation about the China’s <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> health system performance. Methods: The data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2011, which used a multistage stratified random sampling method to select 12 counties and 118 villages from China. Three sets of indicators were chosen to measure the trends in access to coverage, equality and effectiveness of <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> health services. Data were disaggregated by provinces and by participants: hypertension patients, children, elderly and women. We examined the changes in equality across and within region. Results: China’s <b>rural</b> <b>public</b> health system did well in safe drinking water, children vaccinations and women hospital delivery. But more hypertension patients with low income could not receive regular healthcare from primary health institutions than those with middle and high income. In 2010, hypertension treatment rate of Qinghai in Western China was just 53. 22 % which was much lower than that of Zhejiang in Eastern China (97. 27 %).
