30|$|Decision-making is {{no longer}} a uniquely human {{function}} in complex systems. Indeed, the speed and complexity of many system processes often preclude the human from decision and control functions [4]. Especially, the problems in electric power industry deal with lots of data and variables which comprises a huge scale of problem with thousands of variables so that it is inevitable to be supported by computerized tool on the decision-making process. Supporting decision-making requires understanding of both the processes involved and the provision of a computer-based system that supports these processes and allows them to be carried out more effectively [5]. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>business</b> also requires several decision-making processes shown in Figure 1 considering lots of strategic variables connected with electric power system as stated above.

50|$|<b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Business.</b> Influenced by architect, {{inventor}} and philosopher, Buckminster Fuller, {{who believed}} {{in the importance of}} <b>renewable</b> <b>energy,</b> Osborne began to focus on the <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>business</b> in the late 1970s by building passive solar homes and selling energy-saving wood stoves. In 1981 he developed the first wind energy project (consisting of five 25-kilowatt wind turbines) that sold energy to an electric utility in Texas. in 1983, he signed on as the first distributor in Texas for Solarex, a now-defunct maker of solar cells used then as power sources for such things as ranch gates, railroad signals and other places where stringing power lines was difficult or expensive. In the 1990s he ran the Texas operations for Zond Energy, which is now part of GE Wind Energy, the largest U.S. wind turbine maker. Throughout the 80's and 90s, Osborne documented and leased the wind resource for Texas wind fields. Many of his exploits are documented in the book, The Great Texas Wind Rush.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} {{sustainable}} energy systems based on solar and biomass technologies to provide solutions to utility challenges in Nigeria and acute water shortage both in rural and urban areas of that country. The paper highlights the paradoxes of oil-rich Nigeria and the stark reality of social infrastructure deprivations in that country. Perennial power outages over many years have translated {{to the absence of}} or poorly-developed basic social infrastructures in Nigeria. The consequences of this lack have been an increase in abject poverty in rural and urban communities as well as the erosion of social order and threats to citizen and their property. This paper proposes the adaptation of two emerging technologies for building sustainable energy systems and the development of decentralized and sustainable energy sources as catalyst for much-needed social infrastructure development through the creation of <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Business</b> Incubators, creative lending strategies, NGO partnerships and shifting energy-distribution responsibilities. These changes will stimulate grassroots economies in the country, develop large quantities of much needed clean water, maintain acceptable standards of sanitation and improve the health and wellbeing of Nigerian communities. The proposed strategies are specific to the Nigerian context; however, the authors suggest that the same or similar strategies may provide energy and social infrastructure development solutions to other developing countries as well. sustainable energy; social infrastructure; solar energy; bio-energy; OPEC; NGO; <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Business</b> Incubators...|$|R
