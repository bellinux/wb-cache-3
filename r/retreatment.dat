40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Corneal neovascularisation (CoNV) {{can lead}} to {{significant}} ocular comorbidity with reduction in vision and cosmesis. A number of techniques have been described to reduce CoNV, but these can be expensive. Our study aimed to determine the safety, efficacy and long-term outcomes of fine needle diathermy (FND) for CoNV. METHODS: A 5 -year retrospective study identified all cases of FND. Indications, intraoperative complications, and postoperative visual acuity, after treatment and <b>retreatments,</b> were documented, along with the procedure time. Evidence of regression and number of <b>retreatments</b> were identified. RESULTS: 56 eyes from 52 patients underwent FND for CoNV. The main indications included herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) (53 %, n= 25) and microbial keratitis/peripheral ulcerative keratitis (13 %, n= 6). Pretreatment acuity was significantly correlated with extent of CoNV (p= 0. 044). One complication was noted during the procedure-an intrastromal and subconjunctival haemorrhage (rate 2 %). 68. 1 % of patients demonstrated regression at first follow-up (mean 6. 9 weeks), and 89. 3 % (n= 42) showed regression with two or less treatments. Mean post-FND acuity was 0. 72 (range - 0. 2 - 3. 0) vs 0. 82 (- 0. 2 - 3. 0) preprocedure (p= 0. 08). VA improved in the HSK subgroup (p= 0. 012). Mean follow-up was 18. 9 months (range 1 - 56 months).

Patients and methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical charts of 51 patients with AMD. Thirty-one eyes of typical AMD (tAMD) and 20 eyes of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) were evaluated. Results: The mean logarithm {{of the minimum}} angle of resolution (logMAR) vision of all AMD patients was 0. 807 at the baseline examination and 0. 937 at the 5 year examination. Mean visual acuity letter score loss is similar between patients with tAMD (− 7. 25) and with PCV (− 5. 36) at the month 60 examination. The patients with lesions of classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) had 10. 0 letters loss, but the patients with lesions of occult CNV had only 1. 43 letters loss. The number of <b>retreatments</b> peaked in year 1 and declined immediately for patients with tAMD, but patients with PCV had significantly more frequent <b>retreatments</b> in the years 3 and 4 than patients with tAMD (P = 1. 48 × 10 − 2, 5. 96 × 10 − 3, respectively). Conclusion: Visual outcomes in patients with Japanese patients with AMD treated with PDT after 5 -year follow up were worse than that in short-term follow up reported previously. In addition, the difference in visual prognosis between tAMD and PCV was not demonstrated after long-term follow-up.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} ranibizumab as a surgical adjunct during cataract surgery in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with rubeosis, and to {{evaluate the}} efficacy and adverse effects of ranibizumab in treating PDR with rubeosis. Materials and Methods: Three intravitreal injections of 0. 5 mg ranibizumab were administered on day- 1, months- 1 and - 2 with cataract surgery 6 - 16 days after first injection. <b>Retreatments</b> with ranibizumab injections and pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) were given if recurrence or persistence of PDR was noted between months- 3 and - 11. Safety observation visits occurred at months- 12, - 18 and - 24. Primary end points were incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) that were related to both cataract surgery and treatment of PDR with rubeosis through month - 12. Results: Of six patients screened, four (mean age 61. 3 years) were enrolled. No AEs were noted with either cataract surgery or treatment of PDR. Neovascularization of iris (NVI) promptly regressed by 4 days after first ranibizumab injection, prior to cataract surgery in three of four patients (one had significantly regressed NVI by post-injection day- 3 visit); NVI was not noted in any patient at 2 weeks after first ranibizumab injection. Recurrence of rubeosis or NVA after 3 monthly injections was not observed in any. At month- 12, PDR was not present when assessed clinically and by fluorescein angiogram (FA). Only one patient developed neovascularization of disc and neovascularization elsewhere and required <b>retreatments</b> at months- 5 and - 9. Conclusions: Multiple intravitreal injections of ranibizumab may be a safe, effective treatment adjunct for PDR and diabetes-related rubeosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: There {{are various}} {{alternatives}} {{for the management}} of oral conditions that may lead to or already have lead to partial or full edentulism. Economic evaluations measure the efficiency of alternative healthcare interventions and provide useful information for decision-making and the allocation of scarce resources. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current English literature dealing with 'cost-effectiveness' of dental implant therapy versus different alternative treatment modalities, that is, complete and fixed partial dentures, root canal, and periodontal treatment, has been included in this narrative review. Due to the high heterogeneity within the literature, a meta-analysis could not be conducted. RESULTS: The available evidence from economic evaluations indicated that for the treatment of central incisors with irreversible pulpitis and coronal lesions, root canal treatments were most cost-effective initial treatment options. When initial root canal treatments failed, orthograde <b>retreatments</b> were most cost-effective. When root canal <b>retreatments</b> failed, extractions and replacement with single implant-supported crowns were more cost-effective compared to fixed or removable partial dentures. In the treatment of periodontitis in molars with Class I furcation invasion, non-surgical periodontal therapy was more effective and costed less than implant-supported single crowns. For the replacement of single missing teeth, two evaluations indicated that implant-supported single crowns provided better outcomes in terms of greater quality-adjusted tooth years or survival rates at lower costs compared to fixed partial prostheses. Another economic evaluation found that implant-supported crowns costed more, but provided greater survival rates compared to fixed partial dentures. For the restoration of edentulous mandibles, two evaluations indicated that overdentures retained by two or four implants improved oral health-related quality of life outcomes, but costed more than complete dentures. CONCLUSIONS: To better assess the efficiency of implant-supported prostheses in various clinical conditions, more economic evaluations are needed that follow well-established methodologies in health economics. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Moreover, by directing the biopsy needle towards solid, enhancing portions of the lesion, necrotic portions can be avoided, thus reducing the need for biopsy repetition [50].

40|$|Purpose: This review {{addresses}} {{the role of}} high-dose-rate endobronchial brachytherapy (HDREB) for symptom palliation in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods and materials: Relevant trials were identified through a systematic search of the literature. Results: Twenty-nine trials were eligible. Six randomized trials involved HDREB alone or with external beam radiation therapy (EBR) or laser therapy. Median and 1 -year survival ranged from 4 to 10 months and from 11 % to 38 %, respectively. Symptoms controlled by HDREB were dyspnea, cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Fatal hemoptysis ranged from 7 % to 22 %. Better overall symptom palliation and fewer <b>retreatments</b> were required in previously untreated patients using EBR alone or EBR with HDREB. Conclusions: EBR alone {{is more effective than}} HDREB for symptom palliation in previously untreated patients with endobronchial non-small-cell lung cancer. HDREB with EBR seems to provide better symptom relief than EBR alone.

This TTD {{is consistent with the}} findings of Chiesa et al. (217  Gy) [25]. However, larger lesions require a higher Dtumour; i.e. > 1000  Gy for lesions > 10  cc to achieve 50 % tumour control probability [25].
