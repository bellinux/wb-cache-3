5|$|Plans {{to connect}} Ottawa with Bancroft {{arose in the}} mid-1950s. When the {{province}} designated Highway132 in January 1956, they also announced {{plans for a new}} highway which would travel south from Renfrew to Calabogie, then turn west towards Denbigh and Bancroft. Ultimately this road was never constructed, but new <b>road</b> <b>links</b> were established in the following years regardless.|$|E
5|$|The {{area has}} a number of {{high-volume}} <b>road</b> <b>links</b> to neighbouring Glasgow. The A77 main Glasgow to Kilmarnock road passes through the centre of the town and crosses the A727 from Paisley to East Kilbride at the Eastwood Toll. The nearest motorway is the M77, of which Junction 3 Darnley is the interchange for Giffnock.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or <b>road</b> <b>links</b> to the rest of the country, further adding to the already obvious economic decline.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} {{roads in}} Windy Nook are Windy Nook Road and Albion Road, but several housing developments lack cohesive <b>road</b> <b>links</b> and some streets lead to dead ends. Journey time by car or bus to Gateshead town centre is approximately ten minutes, and fifteen {{minutes into the}} centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. Residents have a comparatively high level of car ownership; 71% as compared to a borough average of 56.8%.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{attracted}} criticism from local residents. A parish council meeting in October 2001 revealed that Arsenal players {{had not been}} involved with local initiatives, despite claims during its planning phase that the ground would allow the club to develop links with the local community. Shenley Primary School reportedly failed to receive any visits from players despite repeated requests. The club responded by pointing to initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds. Plans to develop new buildings and <b>road</b> <b>links</b> to the site were challenged by residents four years later; they believed {{it would lead to}} increased traffic and noise pollution in the area.|$|E
5|$|Communications within Wales are {{influenced}} by the topography and the mountainous nature of the country: the main rail and road routes between South and North Wales loop to the east and pass largely through England. The only motorway in Wales is the M4 motorway from London to South Wales, entering the country over the Second Severn Crossing, passing close to Newport, Cardiff and Swansea and extending as far west as the Pont Abraham services before continuing northwest as the A48 to Carmarthen. The A40 is a major trunk road connecting London to Fishguard via Brecon and Carmarthen. The A487 coast <b>road</b> <b>links</b> Cardigan with Aberystwyth, and the A44 links Aberystwyth with Rhayader, Leominster and Worcester. The main trunk road in North Wales is the A55 dual carriageway road from Chester past St Asaph and Abergele, continuing along the coast to Bangor, crossing Anglesey and terminating at Holyhead.|$|E

50|$|Mali had a {{road network}} totaling about 18,563 {{kilometers}} in 2000, including about 4,450 kilometers of paved roads. Mali’s main economic {{link to the}} coast is a paved road between Bamako and Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire. The European Development Fund is financingconstruction of a <b>road</b> <b>linking</b> Bamako and Dakar, Senegal.

There are also plans for a trans-Saharan <b>road</b> <b>linking</b> Mali with Algeria.|$|R
5|$|Junction 28 of the M5 {{lies within}} the parish of Cullompton {{and a short}} {{distance}} from the town centre. Other major <b>road</b> <b>links</b> are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.|$|E

25|$|Apart from on the coastline, Jewish yishuvim, or settlements, {{were very}} dispersed. Communication between the coastal area—which {{was the most}} {{developed}} in terms of Jewish settlements—and the peripheral settlements {{was carried out by}} <b>road</b> <b>links.</b> These <b>road</b> <b>links</b> were an easy target for attacks, as the majority of them passed through or near entirely Arab localities. The isolation of the 100,000 Jewish people in Jerusalem and other Jewish settlements outside the coastal zone, such as kibbutz Kfar Etzion, halfway on the strategic road between Jerusalem and Hebron, the 27 settlements in the Southern region of Negev and the settlements to the north of Galilee, were a weak strategic point for Yishuv.|$|E
