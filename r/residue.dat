5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid <b>residue,</b> and deprotonation of the nucleophile <b>residue.</b> β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine <b>residue</b> as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E

5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic <b>residue.</b> This aligns the basic <b>residue</b> by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, hepatitis A virus protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid <b>residue</b> should be.|$|E

40|$|Terminal <b>residues</b> {{of protein}} chains are charged and more {{flexible}} than other <b>residues</b> {{since they are}} constrained only on one side. Do they play a particular role in protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces? To answer this question, we considered large sets of non-redundant protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes and analyzed the status of terminal <b>residues</b> and their involvement in interfaces. In protein-protein complexes, we {{found that more than}} half of terminal <b>residues</b> (62 %) are either modified by attachment of a tag peptide (10 %) or have missing coordinates in the analyzed structures (52 %). Terminal <b>residues</b> are almost exclusively located at the surface of proteins (94 %). Contrary to charged <b>residues,</b> they are not over or under-represented in protein-protein interfaces, but strongly prefer the peripheral region of interfaces when present at the interface (83 % of terminal <b>residues).</b> The almost exclusive location of terminal <b>residues</b> at the surface of the proteins or in the rim regions of interfaces explains that experimental methods relying on tail hybridization can be successfully applied without disrupting the complexes under study. Concerning conformational rearrangement in protein-protein complexes, despite their expected flexibility, terminal <b>residues</b> adopt similar locations between the free and bound forms of the docking benchmark. In protein-DNA complexes, N-terminal <b>residues</b> are twice more frequent than C-terminal <b>residues</b> at interfaces. Both N-terminal and C-terminal <b>residues</b> are under-represented in interfaces, in contrast to positively charged <b>residues,</b> which are strongly favored. When located in protein-DNA interfaces, terminal <b>residues</b> prefer the periphery. N-terminal and C-terminal <b>residues</b> thus have particular properties with regard to interfaces, which cannot be reduced to their charged nature...|$|R

The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports.
