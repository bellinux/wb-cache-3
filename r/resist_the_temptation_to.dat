5|$|The 1969–70 season {{opened with}} {{victory in the}} 1969 FA Charity Shield, as Bremner captained Leeds to a 2–1 victory over Manchester City. With new arrival Allan Clarke played upfront {{alongside}} Mick Jones and Peter Lorimer Revie had to instruct Bremner and Giles to <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> get forward and attack. It took the team some time to gel, as only two wins came from the opening eight league games, and Leeds eventually finished a distant second to champions Everton. They chased Everton all season only {{to give up on}} the title after a home defeat by Southampton late in the campaign. In the European Cup Leeds recorded a club record 10–0 win over Norwegian side Lyn, with Bremner netting two of the goals. However they exited the competition at the semi-final stage after two defeats to Celtic; Bremner levelled the aggregate score by putting United 1–0 ahead in front of a competition record 136,505 spectators at Hampden Park, but Celtic came back to win the game and the tie with two second half goals. Further disappointment came in the 1970 FA Cup Final, where Leeds were beaten 2–1 in extra-time of the replay at Old Trafford. Bremner was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the season.|$|E

500|$|The Emancipation of Mimi {{received}} a 64 out of 100 (indicating [...] "generally positive reviews") on Metacritic, a website that averages professional reviews from critics into a numerical score. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album a [...] "highly crafted piece of dance-pop" [...] and [...] "relative comeback" [...] for Carey, {{although it is}} not as [...] "catchy" [...] as he thought it should have been. Erlewine voiced a common criticism of the album: that Carey's voice seemed [...] "damaged" [...] in comparison to her [...] "glory years" [...] in the 1990s. He commented that in the belted songs such as [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] and [...] "I Wish You Knew", Carey's voice sounded [...] "as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet". Michael Paoletta from Billboard was less critical of her vocals, writing that [...] "while her voice has lost some of the power through the years, Mimi deftly showcases her still-considerable pipes with strong lyrics and slick production." [...] Paoletta praised The Emancipation of Mimi as Carey's best album since Butterfly (1997). Michael Dougall Bell from the Calgary Sun called Carey's voice [...] "very impressive". He concluded: [...] "While Emancipation may not send Carey's stock or star back up to where it once was and where that voice deserves to be, at least she's not plummeting – she's merely levelled off." [...] Entertainment Weekly editor Tom Sinclair noted that almost every song [...] "showcases Carey's undeniable vocal strengths". Reviewing [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Sinclair concluded, [...] "It's so moving that we'll <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> be crass and interpret the song as a plea for heightened record sales. Help from above is always welcome, but Emancipation sounds like it just might do fine all on its own." ...|$|E
500|$|The 19th century {{transcription}} of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately {{assessed the}} leadership qualities {{of each of}} the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was [...] "a gun that loads itself." [...] The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every last drop. Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, [...] "This man can't even <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> eat the kidney." [...] He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring [...] "These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum)." [...] Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking [...] "You are the king, and yet you do not understand?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Eryximachus [...] speaks next, {{though it}} is Aristophanes' turn, as the latter has not {{recovered}} from his hiccups enough {{to take his place}} in the sequence. First Eryximachus [...] starts out by claiming that love affects everything in the universe, including plants and animals, believing that once love is attained it should be protected. The god of Love not only directs everything on the human plane, but also on the divine (186b). Two forms of love occur in the human body – one is healthy, the other unhealthy (186bc). Love might be capable of curing the diseased. [...] Love governs medicine, music and astronomy (187a), and regulates hot and cold and wet and dry, which when in balance [...] result in health (188a). Eryximachus here evokes the theory of the humors. He concludes: [...] "Love as a whole has ... total ... power ... and is the source of all happiness. It enables us to associate, and be friends, {{with each other and with}} the gods" [...] (188d Transl. Gill).

All four of them are regulated by the thief-taker of course. Besides denouncing him as a protector of coiners, prostitutes, etc. Hitchen coins the name of the thief-maker for Wild, used to refer to him by others later. Through a fictional character's eyes, that is some countryman, Hitchen tries to give a panoramic view of the [...] "Goat" [...] with old thieves, spies, suspicious women, Lemon himself sitting in the corner filling remorse for betrayal. This portrayal is considered somewhat clumsy alongside the insertion of [...] "proclamation", a parody of Wild's advertisements, {{in the middle of the}} pamphlet. Here, Wild proclaimed as [...] "His Skittish and Baboonish Majesty", assures the thieves of himself to be better equipped for subverting the course of justice and offers his legal protection and higher financial terms compared to those of their older [...] "locks, fences and flash pawnbrokers". Hitchen finishes his treatise with the list of [...] "flash cases" [...] and Wild's [...] "weekly pensioners". The list of convicts awaiting transportation under the [...] "Transportation Act"(introduced as an alternative punishment to hanging) enables dating of the pamphlet between June to August. As for the publishers, they were Warner and B. Boreham, publishing Wild's responding pamphlet in May.(p.102-104, Howson)Wild's [...] "Answer" [...] was written anonymously and polished most likely by a hack for two guineas. He refers mostly to the years 1713-1714 for he had personal experience of marshals adventures and could not <b>resist</b> <b>the</b> <b>temptation</b> <b>to</b> describe them, including the scene [...] "in a Sodomitish Academy". As other dealings are mentioned while reviewing their partnership, it is more interesting to describe the event when the under-marshal took his assistant, a buckle-maker as Wild refers to himself in his pamphlet, to a house near Old Bailey one night. The buckle-maker, having never met the types marshal was too willing to see, followed him and to his great surprise discovered men talking and behaving in effeminate way. No less surprising appeared marshal's reaction on being referred to as [...] "your Ladyship" [...] or [...] "Madam", even more, he [...] "dallied with the young sparks with a great deal of pleasure". However, no sooner had he seen those who might have exposed his [...] "power of securing the lads to himself", he flew into a rage and threatened to [...] "spoil their diversion". Later that night, marshal lurked with several constables near Mother Clap's House in Fleet street, Holborn, knowing that a masquerade would be held as usual and he would be able to catch several sodomites dressed in woman's apparel, which he did. Next morning detainees stood before the Lord Mayor and were committed to workhouse, but before were ordered to walk through the streets on the way in their bizarre look:"Some were completely rigg'd in gowns, petticoats, head cloths, fine lac'd shoes, furbelow scarves, and masks. Some had riding hoods; some were dressed like shepherdesses, others like milkmaids with fine green hats..." [...] etc. Some time later they were released after Hitchen's application to the Lord Mayor having been threatened by one of them for his previous adventures with them. The experience appeared too humiliating for one of them and in few days he died after the release.
