40|$|Intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport,</b> {{known as}} a {{possible}} solution for developing a sustainable and efficient transport system, has received great concerns recently. This thesis develops a model for analyzing the cost and environmental potential of longer and heavier vehicles (LHVs) related to pre- and post-haulage in rail-road intermodal transport chain. This thesis compares economic, emission, and total costs between three different transport networks including intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> with current Swedish trucks, intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> with LHVs, and the unimodal road transport. Contribution of the LHVs to cost efficiency of intermodal network will be identified by the traffic volume break-even between the three transport networks. The objective is to give a solution for enhancing the competitiveness of intermodal transport from a full costs perspective. By deducting an empirical diagram, this thesis will take a Swedish project as the case for calculation. The case will present three scenarios respectively, representing the three transport networks mentioned above. Msc in Logistics and Transport managemen...|$|E

30|$|Finally, some {{considerations}} are presented about alternative solutions for road transport, in particular electric and hybrid heavy-duty vehicles.

30|$|This paper {{intends to}} be the {{kick-off}} of a larger study whose aim will be {{the assessment of the}} competitiveness of <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport.</b> This will be attained through optimizing the efficiency of the terminal operations, in both economic and energy terms, by implementing ITS (Intelligent Transport System) technologies. Future works will cover the creation of new exploratory scenarios, in which the initial assumptions will be varied, for example, by eliminating the symmetry of the interchange terminal positions, the cost functions will be examined in detail, and new variables, such as road congestion externalities, will be introduced.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we will mainly {{deal with}} {{rail-road}} combined transport or ferroutage, {{in which the}} main distance is covered by rail, and the road solution is only adopted for pre- and post-haulage (also called drayage 1). The <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> we refer to is unaccompanied, and the driver therefore does not follow the goods along the path covered by the alternative mode. A modal shift is carried out by using suitable handling equipment in specific nodes of the transport network, i.e. inland terminals (sometimes called freight stations, that is, when depot areas are included), {{which may or may}} not be matched with a freight village or a logistics centre [3].|$|E

30|$|After {{defining}} the linear cost functions for <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport,</b> 13 scenarios {{have been created}} by changing both the initial and final length of drayage, from 0  km to 120  km, then separating the internal from the external costs. Subsequently, other scenarios have been generated by varying both the pre- and post- haulage and {{the distance between the}} origins and destinations.|$|R
30|$|Road haulage {{has been}} the most widely used mode of freight {{transport}} in many European countries for several decades. Given the attention to sustainable transport in this century, the <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport</b> may result to be a good alternative, under specific conditions, to road haulage. This paper analyses the main conditions to make the option competitive, using a simplified method useful for the stakeholders involved in decision processes.|$|R
30|$|The {{total costs}} {{increase}} with the distance, {{due to the}} chosen method. <b>Rail-road</b> combined <b>transport</b> can be cost-effective vs. the full-road mode, when a drayage of 40  km was assumed and when {{the distance between the}} origin and destination was approx. 750  km, i.e. a comparable value with those that have already been mentioned in the scientific literature; such a value would increase if the terminals were located far from the origin and destination points.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{starts with}} a {{theoretical}} description of the main characteristics of intermodal and combined transport (section § 2). The section {{is made up of}} three subsections: a review of the relevant elements related to the internal and external costs, a simplified method to assess the total costs of <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> and then different scenarios are presented. The results are discussed in section § 3. Section § 4 presents some technical evaluations that are used to further explore the range of competitive distances for rail and combined transport. The starting point of this paper was a previous one by Dalla Chiara & Pellicelli (2011), which suggested the basis for a combined transport cost evaluation.|$|E
30|$|Only {{few cases}} of {{integration}} {{refer to the}} first type (a), i.e. within two firms of different transport sub-industries. A significant example is given by the investments of Eurokai in Sogemar and Hannibal 9, two companies offering intermodal (<b>rail-road)</b> <b>transport.</b> The main motivation can be found, from one hand, in cutting transaction cost as well as controlling the level of service along the entire transport chain (i.e. in terms of reliability and speed), from the other hand, in satisfying the growing customers’ {{need to have a}} complete transport service from origin to destination. In this way, the transport providers reinforce or perhaps defend their market share and try to control the main traffic flows, reaching economies of scale and scope.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{the results}} reflect {{what might be}} expected: the {{location}} of inland terminals influences the pre- and post-haulage by road and has a heavy impact on the final price. We here confirm that <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> may be competitive if the external costs are internalised, as {{pointed out in the}} work by Mostert and Limbourg [17], and if the total distances are sufficient to exploit the advantages of rail transport, with a limited resort to drayage. In order to underline this latter point, the initial length assumed from the origin to the destination has been varied to ascertain whether combined transport is efficient over long distances. Rail-road combined transport over longer door-to-door distances (approx. 2000  km) may be cost-effective, even for a high drayage length, an aspect that tends to have been overlooked in the literature.|$|E
30|$|The {{method has}} been used to examine those situations, in terms of {{distance}} covered and frequency of the service, in which <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport</b> can be cost-effective {{as an alternative to the}} full-road solution. The obtained range can be reviewed based on the services, such as shuttle trains to connect seaports with dry ports: the short distance covered may be more convenient due to the high quantities of goods as well as the fixed train composition and path allocation, which means lower terminal cost and times. Finally, some innovative proposals have been introduced.|$|R
40|$|A {{proposal}} {{for evaluating the}} attractiveness of the first European ro-ro service based on traditional bogies is presented, to estimate to what extent its realization is able to influence distribution of freight transport, between the traditional road transport and the new alternative available, through the specification and calibration of a modal split model (Logit), based on random utility theory. For the scenarios analyzed, the model estimates that nearly 4 % of the total shipments would use the ro-ro service, when its frequency is four journeys per day, and about 9 %, {{in the case of}} increased frequency to ten.

Mobility affects both transit users and freight with regards to the timely, efficient provision of service, and further connects the competitiveness of products, especially in sectors with low-margin profits and stochastic demands.

40|$|The paper evaluates {{technical}} and logistics developments {{that could lead}} to increased economic and technical efficiency of <b>rail–road</b> <b>transport</b> terminals. The main design parameters are identified (length and utilisation of transhipment tracks, train and truck arrival behaviour/patterns, type and number of handling equipment, mean stacking height in the storage area, terminal access system and procedures) and analysed. A comparative evaluation of selected conventional and advanced technologies is performed by use of an analysis tool that was developed on purpose. This tool consists of three modules (an expert system, a simulation model and a cost calculation module). The overall outcome of the analysis is a number of cost-versus-volume curves for various terminal configurations. The paper concludes with two groups of results: (a) a comparative evaluation of conventional and advanced technologies that reveals similarities in terms of track numbers and the associated area requirements as well as differences in terms of layout flexibility, number of equipment, stacking policies and personnel requirements.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the market of goods became globalized, {{increasing}} international trade {{relations and the}} demand for long distance transportation. As a consequence of the larger distances traveled and of the containerization of goods, maritime transportation became more efficient and reliable. In the hinterland, intermodal (rail-road) freight transportation emerged as a competitive alternative to truck-only transportation. In one of its possible meanings, intermodal freight transportation is the multimodal chain of container-transportation services [1] that, e. g., brings containers from (or to) the seaport by barge or rail to (or from) an intermodal terminal in the hinterland from where they are shipped by truck to their final destination (or origin). This study focus on inland intermodal freight transport, in particular, on the rail–truck transport of cargo containers in Belgium. This European country has a long rail system and in the last years has readapted this system in order to handle with containerized cargo. Since 2004, some rail-road terminals have been built and new intermodal services between the seaports of Belgium have been established. In addition, with the aim of promoting the modal share of intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport,</b> the federal government of Belgium started subsidizing part of the rail transport cost and of the transshipments costs at the rail-road terminals. With these investments the intermodal freight flows in Belgium have increased. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{investigated}} how the intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> {{business model}} {{is influenced by}} external factors in two countries. For the analysis TX Logistik was chosen as an illustrative case and its business models in Germany and Sweden were examined. The competition with intermodal companies and trucking, policy and society, infrastructure and innovation, and demand were taken into account as external factors. After conduction of two interviews with TX Logistik representatives from Sweden and Germany, the description and analysis of TX Logistik business model in these two countries were made, according to Osterwalder’s business model’s canvas. It was identified that the company uses a subcontractor business model. The comparison of the German and Swedish intermodal transport markets {{in terms of the}} mentioned external factors was also done. Finally, the business models’ adaptations in the German and Swedish markets were analyzed. It was found out that the policy, demand and intramodal competition influenced the strategy and, consequently, the business models, significantly. However, there are some areas for improvement. The company should establish partnerships with other institutions in order to achieve promising innovations for the reduction of transport time. This would improve the value proposition and strengthen a competitive position against all-road transport. The governments, on other hand, should review their policy regarding regulation, certification and also fees for the usage of infrastructure. MSc in Logistics and Transport Managemen...|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{economic}} considerations {{have been}} dealt with in some papers. Santos et al. [16], for instance, analysed the effect of some transport policies {{with the aim of}} promoting <b>rail-road</b> intermodal <b>transport</b> in Europe. One of these policies regards the internalization of the external costs related to the drayage length, which is also an important aspect in our paper. They proposed, through a practical application in Belgium, an innovative mixed integer intermodal freight location-allocation model, based on the hub-location theory, and deal with non-linear transport costs in order to replicate the economies of distance. Mostert and Limbourg [17] presented {{the state of the art}} about the external costs of freight transport, while Kos et al. [18] focused their research on the container transport chain. The former work also compared the total costs of road and <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport,</b> using Janic’s fomulas [19], by varying the drayage length. Their results did not show the trend of the costs related to a single component (drayage, terminals and rail), but only the amount of each. The above-mentioned paper by Janic [19] considered the externalities by means of a model that was proposed to calculate the internal and external costs of intermodal and road freight transport networks. His interesting approach considered a network with several origins and destinations that converged in two main terminals. The author found significant results using some assumptions and detailed formula and considering the time components. His paper was focused on the door-to-door distance, but the influence of the drayage length did not emerge. Janic found that the full costs decrease more than proportionally as the door-to-door distance increases, thus suggesting economies of scale.|$|R

40|$|Optimisation of {{transport}} networks can yield substantial reductions in transport costs {{and improve the}} quality of service for the users of these networks. When optimising intermodal rail-road networks, organising large transport volumes on transport links is key for bringing down the costs per container-kilometre. By bundling container flows in Twin Hub Bundling (THB) networks, thereby integrating the flows of the Dutch and Belgian seaports, the Twin Hub project aims to stimulate intermodal <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> in North-West Europe. The goal of this thesis is to create a bundling tool that finds the most promising THB networks based on projected container flows. In this thesis, a modelling is presented of the THB problem, introducing three innovative features: the organisation of intermodal transport services in batches, the introduction of indirect trains, and the integration of train and truck services in one service network. We then prove this problem to be an NP-hard optimisation problem, and present an exact algorithm based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) as well as a relaxation of that formulation. An experimental evaluation shows that both the exact algorithm and the combination of the relaxation and the ILP algorithm (cascade algorithm) are capable of producing good-quality solutions to real-world sized instances within 24 hours. Finally, we present the bundling tool itself, which provides an easy interface for running the algorithms, evaluating the results, and selecting the most promising THB network to be implemented in a pilot operation.

The goods study is based on national and international literature, complemented by a discussion meeting with representatives of the business sector, research sector and public authorities. The international survey is based on literature. Economic instruments, correctly designed, are cost-effective in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Railway investments are not a climate measure but should be carried out if they are socially efficient. There is a great potential for reducing emissions within the respective mode of transport. The largest transfer potential for goods transport is within long-distance lorry transport to combined <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport.</b> Several impediments such as inefficient use of the railway infrastructure and unclear responsibility for combi terminals can limit the measures. Insufficient flexibility and co-operation among transport purchasers and companies can have similar effects. Several measures are often combined for passenger transport to reduce car use and provide incentives to use public transport, cycle or walk. Reductions in travelling time are mainly discussed in the case of high-speed trains. Impediments for the introduction of instruments include political resistance as well as the difficulty of changing travel habits. Measures such as improved accessibility and more efficient cars may also counteract transfer to more climate-friendly modes of transport.

40|$|Elasticities for freight {{transport}} {{in the context}} of mode choice are hardly available for markets in which intermodal container transport competes with truck only transport. These elasticities are expected to be different, however, from values found in the literature for traditional {{freight transport}}, as trucking is a complement to rail or inland waterway transport when used for pre- or post-haulage, but a substitute to these modes when used from the origin to the final destination. This paper presents direct and cross (generalized) cost elasticities for road and rail transport demand for continental intermodal container transport and constitutes an attempt to compare the elasticities for intermodal transport with those for general freight transport. We first look into the sensitivity of elasticities to the total length of the haul and to pre- and post-haulage distances by road using a stylized, theoretical model. The assumption about pre- and post-haulage distances in mode choice appears to be important, as elasticities for road transport {{in the context of}} intermodal transport chains can be half of the values currently used in a conventional mode choice situation without access or egress by road. Next we provide empirical values for the market of container transport using a European multimodal network model. The absolute values of the estimated elasticities follow a double trend when the cost for trucking is modified: they increase with the distance between the origin and the destination, but decrease with the length of pre- or post-haulage. In all cases, the values are estimated to be inelastic. Overall, the “complement” component of the computed elasticities for <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> is estimated to be approximately 20 % of the total impact.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{imbalance}} between modes of transport in the European Union. The increasing success of road results in an ever worsening congestion, more environmental nuisances and accidents.

Among the various types of intermodal transport this doctoral dissertation is concerned by <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport</b> for which the terminals are embedded in a hub-and-spoke network. This kind of topology can reduce the transportation costs by consolidations at the hubs. The proposed method uses the flows of commodities and their geographic spreading as input to determine a set of good potential locations for transfer container terminals. This set can further be used as input for an iterative procedure based on both the p-HMP and the multi-modal assignment in order to identify the optimal locations for such terminals in Europe.

30|$|This paper {{examines}} the performance indicator changes {{based on the}} multiagent simulation {{before and after the}} implementation of the physical internet in an urban rail transit system. Considering that the digital transformation is targeting the logistics sustainability grand challenge [11], {{it is important to understand}} how the urban transit systems benefit from adopting the distributed infrastructure with the help of physical internet and how this could increase the accessibility and mobility of local operators. The investigation is therefore challenged to build validated multiagent simulation for the analysis of infrastructure-meditated impacts on economic and productivity prospects. In contrast to previous works of modelling business processes in transit terminals, this article looks into the distributed operation between resource units supported by real operational data. The simulation model is built upon the flow of multiple types of resources with heterogeneity, allowing for the analysis of the impact of different infrastructure measurements before and after a digital transformation. The schematic of the agent-based simulation intends to be a theoretical framework of developing the micro-level protocols of interacting resource units, whereas the empirical validation is performed for further quantification of improvement options to the <b>rail-road</b> intermodal <b>transport</b> system.|$|R
30|$|Simulation-based {{analysis}} {{has been used}} for planning, control, and decision-making support of physical internet enabled logistics networks. However, multiagent modelling and simulation based on micro-level interactions have been rarely developed for the pre-studies of digital transformation of urban rail transit systems. This hinders a wider industrial deployment of agent technology in the physical internet enabled transport infrastructure. To fill in this knowledge gap, this work presents an agent-based simulation that explicitly models the micro-level protocols of mobile recourse units and their interaction with the physical infrastructure in a <b>rail-road</b> intermodal <b>transport</b> network. Parameterisation of the simulation model is changeable to examine the influences of different efficiency factors. This allows understanding of which structural functions and resource configuration would make an impact system-wide. Through a practical application, a multiagent system is developed for modelling and analysis of sustainable logistics with individually operated mobile resource units. An agent-based simulation assessment is performed to quantify the improvement options. The results reveal that the physical internet can prevent trucks from empty driving, which has a positive effect on the sustainable logistics operations. The proposed model can be used to support the deployment and planning of digital transformation that could be implemented in urban rail transit systems serving urban distribution and passenger transport.|$|R
40|$|The European {{transport}} policy {{has focused on}} sustainable transport solutions. One of its objectives for freight transport is to restore the balance between modes and to develop intermodality. Among {{the various types of}} intermodal transports, this research is concerned with rail-road container terminals embedded in a hub-and–spoke network. These terminals will further be referred to as hubs. Hub-and-spoke networks have been implemented in a number of transportation systems when it is favourable to consolidate and disseminate flows at certain locations called hubs. The efficiency of such a network depends on the location of the hubs. The problem is to find the optimal hub locations and to allocate the remaining nodes to these hubs. This problem is known as the p-hub median problem (p-HMP) where p is the number of hubs to locate. This location-allocation problem is proved to be NP-hard. The time needed to solve it increases as the number of nodes exponent three. Thus, in order to model <b>rail-road</b> <b>transport</b> on the trans-European networks, a subset of nodes that can be considered as good potential locations is needed. We applied the p-HMP to a set of potential locations obtained by both spatial aggregation of demand nodes using hierarchical clustering methods and by a flow-based approach which takes the flows of commodities and their geographic spread into account. They showed that the latest method gives better results and that is why it is retained to determine a set of potential locations. The set of potential locations is used as input for an iterative procedure. One of the main contributions of this research is to propose this iterative procedure based on both the p-HMP and the multi-modal assignment problem. Moreover, the objective function of our p-hub median formulation includes the costs for pre- and post-haulages by road, trans-shipment (according to the number of handled containers into account) and rail haulage. Furthermore, in the p-hub median problem, the total demand is assigned to the hubs. In this research however, the demand can be assigned over all the transportation modes, with the possibility (but not the obligation) of using the trans-shipment facilities. Finally, we presents a methodology able to compare road and rail-road intermodal market areas that takes the network structures, the operation costs and the location of the rail-road terminals into account. This methodology is applied to the optimal configurations obtained by the resolution of the p-HMP and the p-hub centre problem (p-HCP) for the whole trans-European network. Indeed, p-HMP has an efficiency goal by minimizing the total transportation cost. The hub network design obtained by this method can sometimes lead to unsatisfactory results when worst-case origin-destination pairs are separated by a very large distance. Therefore, the p-HCM meets the equity objective by minimizing the maximum cost of a combined transport...|$|E
30|$|The role of pre- and post-haulage {{covered by}} road in {{combined}} transport is relevant, {{as pointed out}} in the previous sections, both in terms of internal and external costs. Ye et al. [25] analysed the potential of longer and heavier vehicles, related, for instance, to pre- and post-haulage. They showed that these types of trucks contribute to improving intermodal transport efficiency, thanks to internal and external cost formulas, in which volume variables were considered. Other solutions to improve the efficiency of road drayage could be in terms of power supply. A number of manufacturers are currently proposing new solutions for the power supply of trucks, such as electric vehicles for lower classes of weight (up to roughly 5 – 7.5 tons), hybrid vehicles and CNG or LNG engines for higher weights. These alternatives, in particular the hybrid or electric ones, are usually compatible with the distances covered during pre- and post-haulage, considering the location of charging stations in the terminals. The positive effects of replacing traditional engines are mainly reflected on the external costs, due to the reduction in emissions, and on the internal costs, in terms of consumption. Furthermore, the final section of <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport</b> usually takes place on urban routes, which are subject to environmental restrictions in many cities.|$|R
30|$|The first element was {{examined}} by Mathisen and Hanssen [6] through a historical research on intermodal freight transport. Their paper underlined {{the growth in}} the number of published articles from 2000 onwards, which can reasonably be attributed to the intense political focus on intermodal freight transport. Islam et al. [7] also began their work by considering the indications of the EU’s White Paper 2011 and by analysing a framework to pursue a modal shift from road to rail. They underlined that the rail alternative should provide some implementations to offer a competitive price, such as the operation of heavier and longer trains, wider loading gauges, higher average speeds, and a better utilisation of wagon space. Implementations for improving intermodal freight transport were also studied by Skočibušić et al. [8]. They in particular summarized some important aspects of intermodal freight transport, such as the introduction of an ICT solution to improve efficiency, or a distance for competitive combined transport equal to 300  km. These considerations were provided on the basis of a literature review. Frémont and Franc [9] suggested that the transfer to <b>rail-road</b> combined <b>transport</b> could occur if the price of the combined alternative were attractive: according to the involved operators, the price would need to be 10 – 20 % lower than the road solution.|$|R

40|$|The {{trend of}} growing road freight {{transport}} causes significant negative impacts on the society, economy and environment. A substantial share of the road freight sector’s externalities is imposed on urban areas because cities are the main destination for freight flows either for production, consumption or for transfer to other locations. City-regions that host centralized transport facilities of inter-regional networks suffer from congestion, noise and air pollution {{while at the same}} time the urban context challenges their efficient operation. Urban freight transport networks thus need to adjust to the urban environment and to balance different interest which in turn is likely to have an impact on inter-regional freight transport networks. This thesis aims to explore the relationship between urban freight transport and inter-regional freight transport networks for the sustainable development of the freight transport sector. This thesis is based on a multiple case-study. By means of in-depth interviews with freight transport stakeholders in six cities, the urban context of freight transport and how it affects inter-regional freight transport networks and vice versa is investigated. In a complementary theoretical study the case study findings are applied on intermodal <b>rail-road</b> freight <b>transport</b> with the goal to identify the urban context’s barriers and opportunities for the design of more competitive inter-regional rail transport services. The results confirm the tension in contemporary urban freight transport between local sustainable development and freight transport network performance. Economic interests on the one hand and environmental and social interests on the other hand are perceived as trade-offs and there is no long-term strategy to balance these interests. However, there is indication that adapting freight transport networks to the urban conditions can be beneficial for both the competitiveness of intermodal road-rail transport and local sustainability. Hence, a deeper integration of freight transport and urban sustainability strategies can possibly contribute to more sustainable freight transport...|$|R
