40|$|Glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) deficiency is {{the most}} common <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> <b>enzymopathy</b> found in humans. It clearly has an X-linked recessive inheritance with its prevalence varying from 0 % to 27 % in a different caste, ethnic, and linguistic groups. This deficiency may result in hemolytic anemia during stress, infection, and use of certain drugs. The use of topical silver sulfadiazine can produce hemolysis in patients having G 6 PD deficiency. Here, we describe one case successfully treated of pediatric burn of 25 % of body surface area who was a known case of G 6 PD deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD) deficiency, the commonest <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> <b>enzymopathy</b> in humans, has an X-linked inheritance. The major clinical manifestations are drug induced hemolytic anemia, neonatal jaundice {{and chronic}} nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia {{is much greater}} in G 6 PD-deficient neonates than babies without this deficiency. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain the presence of neonatal jaundice in erythrocyte G 6 PD-deficient male newborns. Samples of umbilical cord blood from a total of 204 male newborns of the Januário Cicco School Maternity located in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil were analyzed. The G 6 PD deficiency was identified by the methemoglobin reduction test (Brewer's test). The deficiency was confirmed by quantitative spectrophotometric assay for enzyme activity and cellulose acetate electrophoresis was used to identify the G 6 PD variant. Eight newborns were found to be G 6 PD deficient with four of them exhibiting jaundice during the first 48 hours after birth with bilirubin levels higher than 10 mg/dL. All deficient individuals presented the G 6 PD A- variant at electrophoresis. Our findings confirmed the association between G 6 PD deficiency and neonatal jaundice. Hence, early diagnosis of the deficiency at birth is essential to control the appearance of jaundice and to prevent the exposure of these newborns to known hemolytic agents...|$|E
40|$|Deficiency in glucose- 6 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G 6 PD), an X-linked recessive <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> <b>enzymopathy,</b> is endemic in Southern Chinese. Universal {{screening of}} newborn {{is done in}} Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, among other places. In Hong Kong, 4. 8 % of males are affected and seven common G 6 PD alleles account for over 99 % of all defects. Male hemizygotes suffer from severe deficiency, while female heterozygotes may also be affected. Deficiency of G 6 PD may affect haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients and donors, before and after HSCT. Female patients with clonal erythropoiesis (eg myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative diseases) will have the male population incidence of G 6 PD. Quantitative enzyme level screening is prudent for donors and recipients, and should be repeated after engraftment. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be avoided in known male and female carriers, including those with low-normal G 6 PD enzyme levels. Our experience suggested that G 6 PD-deficient marrow, stem cell and cord blood donor units have no engraftment problems. Post-engraftment G 6 PD levels correlate with those in donors. An acquired change in G 6 PD status {{may serve as a}} surrogate marker for engraftment. For female heterozygote donors with normal G 6 PD levels, skewing of lyonized X-chromosome ratio during engraftment may result in over-expression of the deficient allele. This can result in unexpected significant G 6 PD deficiency. Hence, a repeat G 6 PD screening at stable engraftment is recommended, especially before commencement of oxidative medications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To date, {{it remains}} a {{challenge}} to correctly and timely diagnose <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> (RBC) <b>enzymopathies</b> that result in hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA), the third most common of which is pyrimidine 5 ′-nucleotidase (P 5 N) deficiency with just over 100 cases recognized and confirmed worldwide. Experimental design We have investigated the RBC proteome of a patient with P 5 N deficiency due to a homozygous frameshift mutation in the NT 5 C 3 A gene. Protein expression levels were analyzed against healthy controls and against patients with hemolytic anemia of different origin, {{to account for the}} patient's elevated reticulocyte versus RBC ratio. Results Stringent relative quantification of the patient's protein levels revealed reduced levels of P 5 N, and unexpectedly, also decreased levels of transketolase, an enzyme involved in the nonoxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, one of the few key pathways active in RBCs. Immunoblotting of whole blood samples from this and other P 5 N-deficient patients with dissimilar mutations indicated that P 5 N deficiency was correlated with reduced transketolase levels. Conclusions and clinical relevance Consequently, insight into patient RBC proteomes illustrates potential benefit of coupling quantitative proteomics strategies with routine HNSHA diagnostic procedures. Proteomics facilitates finding novel biomarkers for HNSHA patients, for example, suffering from P 5 N deficiency, providing new prospects for future diagnosis and therapy...|$|R
40|$|Metabolically {{defective}} <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> are old {{before their}} time, and suffer from metabolic progeria. The {{focus of this}} thesis was to identify the molecular mechanisms by which inherited enzymopathies of the <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> lead to impaired enzyme function and, consequently, shorten <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> survival. We studied patients with deficiencies of key enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway (hexokinase  HK and pyruvate kinase  PK) and the Hexose Monophosphate Shunt (glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase  G 6 PD). The clinical hallmark of these patients is chronic hemolysis {{as a result of}} a depletion of the cellular ATP content (HK or PK deficieny) or increased susceptibility to oxidative damage (G 6 PD deficiency). The investigated mutations caused disease by means of a variety of mechanisms and affected several aspects of human gene expression. In chapter 2 we described a severely PK-deficient patient. In reticulocyte RNA from this patient we detected a monoallelic pattern of (mutant) PKLR gene expression, associated with three in cis mutations in the erythroid-specific promoter of PKLR. Ultimately, this led to the identification of a novel transcriptional regulatory element in the proximal promoter that was actively involved in DNA-protein interaction. The synthesis of only one species of mutant PK was also demonstrated in another patient with severe PK deficiency. In this case, the production of mutant PK was due to aberrant processing of PKLR pre-mRNA. The concerning patient, described in chapter 3, was compound heterozygous for two mutations which were both likely to affect correct splicing. A novel ex vivo approach was employed to study the effects of both mutations on pre-mRNA processing and multiple aberrant transcripts were characterized. On the protein level, once a mutant enzyme is synthesized it may be unstable because of significant structural perturbation. In chapter 4 we studied 28 PK-deficient patients, classified according to their phenotype. Twenty-four different mutant alleles were identified, including 14 novel mutations. Of the novel mutations, 12 predicted a single amino acid substitution. We used the recently elucidated tetrameric crystal structure of human erythrocyte PK to study the consequences of the amino acid changes on structure and function of PK. The location and interactions of the affected amino acid, as well as the nature of the introduced substitution were important determinants for the resulting molecular perturbation and its impact on protein function. This was further illustrated by the two patients with severe G 6 PD deficiency, described in chapter 6. Both patients were hemizygous for a different G 6 PD variant caused by a de novo missense mutation. Both mutations affected the interface of the G 6 PD dimeric enzyme, a region crucial for G 6 PD enzymatic activity. The patients displayed, however, quite distinct clinical pictures. In chapter 7 we showed that also subtle alterations in crucial areas of the enzyme can cause a severe impairment of enzyme function. In this case, a patient was diagnosed with severe HK deficiency caused by a conservative missense mutation in the active site of HK. Biochemical analysis of mutant HK from the patient displayed only a relatively modest effect of the amino acid substitution on enzymatic properties in vitro. However, we showed that its reasonable to assume a more significant effect in vivo. The variety of clinical features associated with the various enzymopathies, regardless of the underlying molecular mechanism, have unequivocally made clear that the phenotype of hereditary <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> <b>enzymopathies</b> is not solely dependent on the molecular properties of mutant proteins but rather reflects a complex interplay between physiological, environmental and other (genetic) factors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Severe anemia due to Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{is a major}} cause of {{mortality}} among young children in western Kenya. The factors that lead to the age-specific incidence of this anemia are unknown. Previous studies have shown an age-related expression of <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> complement regulatory proteins, which protect erythrocytes from autologous complement attack and destruction. Our primary objective was to determine whether in a malaria-endemic area <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> with low levels of complement regulatory proteins are at increased risk for complement (C 3 b) deposition in vivo. Secondarily, we studied the relationship between <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> complement regulatory protein levels and hemoglobin levels. Methods Three hundred and forty-two life-long residents of a malaria-holoendemic region of western Kenya were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and stratified by age. We measured <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> C 3 b, CR 1, CD 55, and immune complex binding capacity by flow cytometry. Individuals who were positive for malaria were treated and blood was collected when they were free of parasitemia. Analysis of variance was used to identify independent variables associated with the %C 3 b-positive <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and the hemoglobin level. Results Individuals between the ages of 6 and 36 months had the lowest <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CR 1, highest %C 3 b-positive <b>red</b> <b>cells,</b> and highest parasite density. Malaria prevalence also reached its peak within this age group. Among children ≤ 24 months of age the %C 3 b-positive <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> was usually higher in individuals who were treated for malaria than in uninfected individuals with similarly low <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CR 1 and CD 55. The variables that most strongly influenced the %C 3 b-positive <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> were age, malaria status, and <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CD 55 level. Although it did not reach statistical significance, <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CR 1 was more important than <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CD 55 among individuals treated for malaria. The variables that most strongly influenced the hemoglobin level were age, the %C 3 b-positive <b>red</b> <b>cells,</b> <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CR 1, and <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CD 55. Conclusion Increasing malaria prevalence among children > 6 to ≤ 36 months of age in western Kenya, together with low <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> CR 1 and CD 55 levels, results in increased C 3 b deposition on <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and low hemoglobin. The strong contribution of age to C 3 b deposition suggests that there are still additional unidentified age-related factors that increase the susceptibility of <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> to C 3 b deposition and destruction. </p...|$|R

There was a significant difference in survival in vivo between the light young <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and the heavy old <b>red</b> <b>cells.</b> The potential survival in vivo of the 50 % lightest <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> was 56 days, compared to 28 days for the heaviest <b>red</b> <b>cells.</b> Arabino-galactane appeared to be devoid of acute toxicity and of strong antigenicity and it did not appear to adhere to the <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> stroma.

40|$|In {{homozygous}} 8 -thalassemia the erythrocyte {{population is}} largely nonhomogeneous; no other condition presents such {{a variation of}} size, shape, and content of hemoglobin in the <b>red</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> morphology may differ from patient to patient as concerns degree and quality of alterations. This variability, evident at mere examination of <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> morphology, has been supported by the early studies on <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> sur-vival, which showed that the <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> population contains very short-living as well as rather long-living cells (1). Essentially similar findings were obtained in some studies by using chromated erythrocytes (2, 3); in other studies no initial rapid fall of the chromium survival curve was observed, but there was indirect evidence com-patible {{with the presence of}} a very short-lived population of <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> (4).

40|$|As {{the first}} step to analyze the {{autoimmune}} disease of <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> the recognition mechanism of macrophage to <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> or erythrophagocytosis has been studied in vitro by using mouse peritoneal macrophage and homologous and cells and the following results were obtained: 1. In Hanks solution, the mouse macrophage hardly phagocytizes living <b>red</b> <b>cells,</b> both homologous and heterologous ones. But in the presence of mouse serum, the macrophage phagocytizes heterologous <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> selectively but does not phagocytize homologous ones. 2. The macrophage actively phagocytized homologous <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> prior to treatment with concanavalin A (Con A) at a concentration as low as 1. 95 ltg/ml. 3. Red cell agglutination was clearly recognized in those treated with Con A at 62. 5 lag/ml or more, but not at 1. 95 ltg/ml. 4. The <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> agglutination by Con A was inhibited with D-glucose, D. mannose and a-methyl glucopyranoside at the concentration as low 1. 5 mM, while the phagocytosis was suppressed only at a very high concentration of the sugars, 1, 000 mM. 5. Fragility test of the <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> treated with Con A showed a lower resistance of <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> to hypotonic solution than those treated with Con A at the concentration of 31. 25 p. g/ml or more 6.

The membrane damage occur. red by treating with Con A at 31. 25 ltg/ml or higher. 7. All the data indicate that the phagocytosis of homologous <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> by macrophage is induced by the adherence of a small amount of Con A, which induces no detectable changes of <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> surface and <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> membrane as revealed by agglutination test, fragility test, electron microscope observation and circular dichroism. On the basis of these observations a possible recognition error to homologous <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> by adsorbing a minute quantity of foreign substances on their surfaces has been discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{circulating}} <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> {{volume of}} man and animals has been investigated heretofore by the in-jection of <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> labeled with the radioisotopes of iron (Fe 55 and Fe 59) and phosphorus (P 32) (1 - 10). The preparation of <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> tagged with radio-active iron necessitates the administration of radio-iron for one or more weeks to volunteer donors who incorporate it into the hemoglobin of their <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> (1, 2) which must then be transfused into the experimental subject. Radioactive phos-phorus may be added in vitro to a small volume of the experimental subject's own <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> which become labeled rapidly. This technical advantage, however, is counter-balanced by the rapid phos-phate exchange in vivo between the <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and the plasma, causing the radioactivity of the tagged cells to fall significantly after one to three hours (5 - 8). In the present investigation a new biological tracer, radioactive chromium (Cr 51), with a half-life of 26. 5 days, has been employed for the de-termination of the circulating <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> volume. When this isotope was added to erythrocytes in vitro as Na 2 Cr 5104, it was taken up avidly by the <b>red</b> <b>cells,</b> which retained their radioactivity with-out significant loss to the plasma for periods of one day or more after injection into experimental animals (11). Since the exchange of Crp 5 be-tween the <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> and plasma was negligible for 24 hours, radioactive chromate appeared to be ideal for the tagging of <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> and the measurement of the circulating <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> volume...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with two thermal properties of <b>red</b> <b>cells,</b> paracrystalline <b>red</b> <b>cells,</b> and sickled <b>red</b> ceils. The first is their specific heats, which, generally speaking, {{can be expected to}} decrease as the degree of molecular orientation increases. The second is the thermal effect of compression, heating or cooling occurring on the application of pressure according to whether the orderliness of the molecules is decreased or increased. Since there is evidence that the molecules of the mammalian <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> are arranged to form a structure, well defined at the surface and much less well defined in the interior (Ponder, 1951), an investigation of the specific heats and the effects of compression may give a certain amount of information about the molecular orderliness which exists, particularly in the ease of cold pamcrystalline rat <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> (Ponder, 1945) and sickled <b>red</b> <b>cells.</b> There seems to be no doubt that the orderliness of the molecules in the cold paracrystalline rat <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> is greater than that in the normal <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> or in the paxacrystalline rat <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> when warmed (when it ceases to be paracrystalline) ...|$|R
