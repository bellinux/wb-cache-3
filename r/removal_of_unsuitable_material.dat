40|$|The {{adoption}} of innovation in construction technology {{is important for}} product development and {{for the construction of}} buildings. Making use of technologically innovative construction products by focusing on a single point based on a heuristic, trial and error method reduces the possibility of making an accurate determination of the value of these innovations. Obtaining accurate information is difficult if deficiencies occur during information capture. These deficiencies may lead to the selection <b>of</b> <b>unsuitable</b> <b>materials</b> and can cause delays, loss of workers and material thus affecting economic strength. These incidents may be relevant to design, construction or problems in the information capture processes. The performance of the building is also affected and accordingly the building’s service life is shortened. The interaction of the building with the environment becomes unhealthy with building users experiencing negative effects. Therefore, the information process should be considered the first vital step in the {{adoption of}} technological innovations in construction products. Consequently, the logic behind the information capture process should be systematic and concrete, and phases correctly built in order to systematically obtain accurate and pertinent information. The developed model consists of Communication, Networking, Information Assessment and Determination of Scale of the information phases.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{forensic}} investigations of problems across Iowa, a research study was developed aimed at providing solutions to identified problems through better management and optimization of the available pavement geotechnical materials and through ground improvement, soil reinforcement, and other soil treatment techniques. The overall goal was worked out through simple laboratory experiments, such as particle size analysis, plasticity tests, compaction tests, permeability tests, and strength tests. A review of the problems suggested three areas of study: pavement cracking due to improper management of pavement geotechnical materials, permeability of mixed-subgrade soils, and settlement of soil above the pipe due to improper compaction of the backfill. This resulted in the following three areas of study: (1) The optimization and management of earthwork materials through general soil mixing of various select and unsuitable soils and a specific example of optimization of materials in earthwork construction by soil mixing; (2) An investigation of the saturated permeability of compacted glacial till in relation to validation and prediction with the Enhanced Integrated Climatic Model (EICM); and (3) A field investigation and numerical modeling of culvert settlement. For each area of study, a literature review was conducted, research data were collected and analyzed, and important findings and conclusions were drawn. It was found that optimum mixtures <b>of</b> select and <b>unsuitable</b> soils can be defined that allow the use <b>of</b> <b>unsuitable</b> <b>materials</b> in embankment and subgrade locations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of geosynthetic materials {{has become an}} ordinary part of not only transport constructions. Such materials are very versatile depending on the earth construction requirements and soil character. With regard to their popularity in use, {{research and development of}} new material and innovations of the existing ones are under way, so that the demands on their usability were met and their long life was ensured. According to their production methods, geosynthetics may be classified into basic groups of woven, non-woven and knitted materials. According to their function, which is expected from the different types of geosynthetics, we distinguish geosynthetics with a filtration, separation, protection barrier, erosion control, drainage and reinforcement functions. However, the {{application of}} the geosynthetic materials is not possible without a conveniently prepared subgrade. The use of heavy machinery thus becomes an important step in the implementation of transport constructions. Without quality preparation of the surface and subgrade of the body, the effectiveness of the geosynthetics would be supressed and their life would be much shorter. This could lead to deformations and cause fatal consequences to the overall transport structure. A set of earth works, {{depending on the type of}} transport structure, precedes the laying of the geosynthetic material. In general, heavy machinery is used to handle earth in extraction or filling, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>unsuitable</b> sharp-edged stones and other undesirable objects, to even the surface and to compact it.

To investigate the effects of kind and mixing proportion of bulking material and sewage sludge decomposition stage on vermicompost quality, an experiment was carried out in a split plot design with three replications. In this experiment, the stage of sewage decomposition (raw sewage, digested sludge in digester, dewatered sludge in lagoons, and final dried sludge in lagoons) was main factor and kind of bulking materials (woodchips, three leaves, and wheat straw) and mixing proportion of bulking materials to swage sludge (0, 15, 30, and 45 %, V/V) were as subordinate factors. Chemical {{properties of}} sewage in different decomposition stages and bulking materials were determined. After 5 months of incubation in the controlled moisture and temperature condition, and in the presence of earthworms, the pot's contents were harvested, and nutrients and heavy metal concentration of vermicomposts were measured. Vermicomposts had relatively low pH and EC. Their nutrients content especially N, P, Fe, and Zn were high. These properties showed vermicompost suitability for use as a soil amendment and organic fertilizer. Heavy metals concentrations of vermicomposts, except for Zn, were lower than recommended values by EPA.
