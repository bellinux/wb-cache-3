40|$|AbstractWhile {{implementing}} the perspective programs of “RZhD”, JSC (high-speed movement, heavy-load movement, resource saving etc.) connected with efficiency increase of railway transport, {{it is necessary}} to provide the safe functioning and reliability of all elements of the high layer of the track. The given article considers the research of the stress-deformed condition in a bearing plate of a counter <b>rail</b> attachment <b>fitting</b> of turnouts. The bearing plate gets out of order {{as a result of a}} multi-cycle endurance destruction. Based on developed methods of the experimental research, a scheme discrete model of a counter <b>rail</b> attachment <b>fitting</b> of the turnout was created. The article studies the influence of constructive parameters of a spacing lug and latches on the bearing plate load. The results of the experimental research are used for development and projecting of a new construction of a bearing plate for a counter <b>rail</b> attachment <b>fitting,</b> the patent of useful model 152367. The authors conducted the comparative research of the stress-deformed condition of bearing plates with the model of a high way construction consisting of three sleepers with a base rail, counter rail and a base plate with two variants of plates: standard and new. An experimental layout of bearing plates was designed which is now being tested and exploited in the Southern Ural Railway...|$|R
50|$|The {{different}} construction {{periods of}} {{the east and west}} wings is evident in the finishes and fittings. In the earlier east wing more is made of timber finishes, in particular the use of panelling (in the director's office) where Queensland Silky Oak veneer panels are framed with Queensland maple. Queensland maple is used throughout the building for skirtings, architraves, jamb linings, hand <b>rails</b> and <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Victoria Coal Company {{constructed}} a short length of tramway across the rock platform and sandy shore at the boat harbour {{to the east}} of the proposed terminus at Cape Paterson. Tramway materials were landed at a jetty constructed {{from the end of the}} rock platform and were carried over the tramway to firmer ground from where bullock teams hauled the <b>rails</b> and <b>fittings</b> to the railhead. By 2005 virtually all rails had been removed...|$|R
5000|$|Filming {{began in}} early January 1996. Trinity United Methodist Church in Newark, New Jersey, {{served as the}} Biggs' New York City church. The {{production}} leased the church, and began renovating it in February 1996. The interior was painted, new carpet laid, and the main doors repaired. The production team designed a pulpit and altar rails that more accurately reflected the design of Baptist churches. After filming, the church kept the pulpit, and the production crew worked with architects from the United Methodist Church to design and install <b>rails</b> more <b>fitting</b> of the Methodist style. Filming occurred there from March 11 to April 3, with {{about a quarter of}} the church's membership hired as extras. (The church used the rental fees paid by the production to replace its boiler and HVAC system.) ...|$|R
500|$|When the {{suspension}} bridge fell in 1869, {{the idea of}} a new bridge was discussed at length. [...] The initial project dates from 1875, which proposed that the new bridge had accompanying rail tracks, and that it be built on the remaining foundations of {{the suspension}} bridge, using scaffolding. Actually, given the height of the bridge and the river's depth and current, scaffolding is almost technically impossible to implement. In the final project from 1878, a jetting alternative was offered, despite very few companies mastering the technique at the time. The problem of <b>fitting</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, which was later abandoned, delayed the project.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{high degree}} of parts {{commonality}} between the Mk48, M249 and Mk46 machine guns, which simplifies maintenance and repair. The use of M1913 [...] "Picatinny" [...] <b>rails</b> allows the <b>fitting</b> of various accessories from the SOPMOD kit, such as the ECOS-N (Enhanced Combat Optical Sight) red dot sight and other sighting or target-designating devices. The Mk 48 can also be fitted with a vertical foregrip for increased controllability during sustained fire. While heavier than the 5.56×45mm NATO M249 due to its larger chambering and heavier barrel, the Mk 48 Mod 0 is still 17% lighter and 8.4% shorter than the M240.|$|R
50|$|Trackwork {{supplies}} for phase 4 {{of the new}} line, after small quantities of South African <b>rail,</b> sleepers and <b>fittings</b> had been used up, were obtained from EU member state Poland. The entire order, signed on 1 August 2005, for 1,300 tons of rail, was delivered during 2005 and some was sent direct to WHR Ltd for use between Pen-y-Mount and Traeth Mawr Loop. The sleeper order comprised just over 21,000 steel sleepers and 84,000 elastic rail clips similar to the type manufactured by Pandrol. This was enough to complete the railway - though timber sleepers fitted with steel baseplates are used at stations and in various other places. These were all delivered in 2005.|$|R
60|$|Then there {{began an}} {{altogether}} different phase of hunting conversation. As {{long as the}} ladies were there {{it was all very}} well to talk of hunting as an amusement; good sport, a thirty minutes or so, the delight of having a friend in a ditch, or the glory of a stiff-built <b>rail</b> were <b>fitting</b> subjects for a lighter hour. But now the business of the night was to begin. The difficulties, the enmities, the precautions, the resolutions, the resources of the Brake hunt were to be discussed. And from thence the conversation of these devotees strayed away to the perils at large to which hunting in these modern days is subjected;--not the perils of broken necks and crushed ribs, which can be reduced to an average, and so an end made of that small matter; but the perils from outsiders, the perils from new-fangled prejudices, the perils from more modern sports, the perils from over-cultivation, the perils from extended population, the perils from increasing railroads, the perils from literary ignorances, the perils from intruding cads, the perils from indifferent magnates,--the Duke of Omnium, for instance;--and that peril of perils, the peril of decrease of funds and increase of expenditure! The jaunty gentleman who puts on his dainty breeches, and his pair of boots, and on his single horse rides out on a pleasant morning to some neighbouring meet, thinking himself a sportsman, has but a faint idea of the troubles which a few staunch workmen endure in order that he may not be made to think that his boots, and his breeches, and his horse, have been in vain.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the automatic extraction of centerlines of railroads. Mobile Laser Scanning systems are able to capture the 3 D environment of the rail tracks {{with a high level}} of detail. Our approach first detects laser points that were reflected by the rail tracks, by making use of local properties such as parallelism and height in relation to neighboring objects. In the modeling stage, we present two approaches to determine the centerline location. The first approach generates center points in a data-driven manner by projecting rail track points to the parallel track, and taking the midpoint as initial center point. Next, a piecewise linear function is fitted through the center points to generate center points at a regular interval. The second approach models the <b>rail</b> track by <b>fitting</b> piecewise 3 D track models to the rail track points. The model consists of a pair of two parallel rail tracks. The fitted pieces are smoothened by a Fourier series interpolation function. After that the centerline is implicitly determined by the geometric center of the pair of tracks. Reference data has been used to analyze the quality of our results, confirming that the position of the centerlines can be determined with an accuracy of 2 – 3 cm...|$|R
