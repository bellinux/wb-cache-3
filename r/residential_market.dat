5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1990s, Philadelphia was {{experiencing}} a condominium boom, with more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings being converted into rental and condominium apartments between 1998 and 2004. With the <b>residential</b> <b>market</b> in Center City growing, P Associates found financing by going into a partnership with real estate firm Boston Financial to fund its planned residential tower. Around the same time, the Barton Group ended its intentions with the site and sold its interest in the property to P Associates and Boston Financial. The tower announced by P Associates and Boston Financial would be a 300-unit luxury rental tower called St. James Court, named after an adjacent street. The high-rise would still incorporate the preservation efforts for the 19th-century buildings it agreed to in 1995.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{cumulative}} PV {{capacity in the}} U.S., there has been growth in the distributed generation segment, which are all grid-connected PV installations in the residential and non-residential markets. Non-residential market includes installations on commercial, government, school and non-profit organization properties. Between 2000 and 2013 there had been 2,261 MW of residential solar and 4,051 MW non-residential solar installed. In 2013, there were 1,913 MW installed for these markets; the top 5 states were California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Arizona. The <b>residential</b> <b>market</b> had 60% annual growth in 2013. The growth contributing factors were new marketing strategies to partner with retailers to reach more customers, and new financial models including the securitization of residential solar assets. Non-residential PV had a slight growth of 4% in 2013 as the market was recovering from the oversupply in 2012. The future growth will likely come from New York, Arizona, and Colorado.|$|E

40|$|The paper aims to {{show how}} the {{historical}} development of CEE countries and their institutional framework has influenced the quality of information on housing markets. Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) have undergone the serious economic and institutional transformation. The functioning of the residential sector was changed by introducing the new institutions, regulations, housing finance institutions and internet. The newly established <b>residential</b> <b>markets,</b> the actors operating on these markets, and the governments (both national as well as EU) have generated the demand for better information. This was partially fulfilled, yet the quality of the information on the <b>residential</b> <b>markets</b> is still lagging behind the developed Western economies. Moreover there is clear lack of the historical market data, which make the decision making regarding the regulation of the markets and the mortgage provision more risky. The global economic crisis has uncovered the economic vulnerabilities of the CEE and their <b>residential</b> <b>markets.</b> At the same time the crisis created the serious pressure for more responsible investments and higher efficiency, and the triggered demand for higher quality and more comprehensive information on the <b>residential</b> <b>markets.</b> </p...|$|R

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1980, the Gowanus area's low rents and {{nearness}} to more expensive cultural centers in New York had attracted artists and musicians. The largely untenanted industrial area offered spaces for studios, music venues, bars, gyms {{and other businesses}} that benefited from low space-to-cost ratios. Nonetheless, population of the area hit a historic low in 1990. [...] However, by 1998, the neighborhoods around the canal (Carroll Gardens and Park Slope) were experiencing a resurgence {{of interest in the}} <b>residential</b> <b>market.</b> Perceptions of environmental risk related to pollution and possible flooding vied with the appeal of a diverse community accessible to more expensive areas of New York City.

40|$|Externalities {{are defined}} as {{situations}} where an economic activity of an economic subject affects the production or consumption activities of other economic subjects (third parties), that {{do not participate in}} the activity. Externalities therefore cause changes in the welfare state of third party subjects and result in an economic inefficiency in an economy, indicating that the economy does not enjoy the maximum benefits from its given resources. Reconstruction project is a kind of large scale residential renewal programs that is organized and undertaken by private sector in Korea. In the process of profit maximization in the private sector, old housing estates are reconstructed with higher and larger residential buildings, as well as more dwelling units on the same sites. These changes emit externalities into the neighbourhood <b>residential</b> <b>markets.</b> The aim of the study is to demonstrate, statistically, the creation of externalities in the reconstruction of old housing estate. In doing so, the study investigates the differences of land prices in the neighbourhood <b>residential</b> <b>markets</b> due to the externalities generated by the projects and quantifies the differences, using the land price data from the Ministry of Construction and Transportation in Korea. Three statistical analysis methods were used in the study. Firstly, descriptive statistic detected the differences of land prices between the <b>residential</b> <b>markets</b> in each project case and indicated the existence of the externalities in some of the neighbourhood <b>residential</b> <b>markets.</b> Secondly, ANOVA and T-tests statistically concluded that reconstruction projects emit externalities in some neighbourhood <b>residential</b> <b>markets.</b> Lastly, the intervention analysis quantified the amounts of the externalities and verified the established hypotheses. The major finding of the study is that reconstruction projects emit externalities in the neighbourhood <b>residential</b> <b>markets,</b> and the net externalities are, on the whole, positive. It is concluded that the general welfare could be extended as the production level of reconstruction projects is increased...|$|R
