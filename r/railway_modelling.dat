2500|$|Roderick David Stewart {{was born}} at 507 Archway Road, Highgate, North London on 10 January 1945, the {{youngest}} of five children of Robert Stewart and Elsie Gilbart. His father was Scottish and had been a master builder in Leith, Edinburgh, while Elsie was English and {{had grown up in}} Upper Holloway in North London. Married in 1928, the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, and then they moved to Highgate. Stewart came after an eight-year gap following his youngest sibling; he {{was born at}} home during World War II. The family was neither affluent nor poor; Stewart was spoiled as the youngest, and has called his childhood [...] "fantastically happy". He had an undistinguished record at Highgate Primary School and failed the eleven plus exam. He then attended the William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School (later Fortismere School), Muswell Hill. His father retired from the building trade at age 65, buying a newsagent's shop on the Archway Road when Stewart was in his early teens; the family lived over the shop. Stewart's main hobby was <b>railway</b> <b>modelling.</b>|$|E

Computer systems for railway systems suffer from poor integration {{and lack of}} explicit understanding of {{the large amount of}} static and dynamic information in the railway. In this paper we give solutions to both problems. It is shown how a component-oriented approach makes it easy to construct and refine basic <b>railway</b> <b>models</b> by effective methods, such that a variety of models with important properties can be maintained within the same framework. Basic railway nets are refined into several new kinds; nets that are safe, permit collision detection, include time, and are sensitive to its surroundings. Since the underlying implementation language is Petri Nets, large expressibility is combined with simplicity, and in addition the analysis of the behaviour of <b>railway</b> <b>models</b> come gently.

50|$|In 1981 the {{magazine}} began covering {{the subject of}} <b>railway</b> <b>modelling</b> in {{the magazine}}, which now appeared monthly.
