40|$|The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, {{is a major}} pest {{of maize}} in the United States and more recently, Europe. Understanding the {{dispersal}} dynamics of this species will provide crucial information for its management. This study used geometric morphometric analysis of hind wing venation based on 13 landmarks in 223 specimens from nine locations in Illinois, Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri, to assess whether wing shape and size differed between rotated and continuously grown maize where crop <b>rotation-resistant</b> and susceptible individuals are found, respectively. Before assessing differences between <b>rotation-resistant</b> and susceptible individuals, sexual dimorphism was investigated. No significant difference in wing (centroid) size was found between males and females; however, females had significantly different shaped (more elongated) wings compared with males. Wing shape and (centroid) size were significantly larger among individuals from rotated maize where crop-rotation resistance was reported; however, cross-validation of these results revealed that collection site resistance status was an only better than average predictor of shape in males and females. This study provides preliminary evidence of wing shape and size differences in D. v. virgifera from rotated versus continuous maize. Further study is needed to confirm whether wing shape and size {{can be used to}} track the movement of <b>rotation-resistant</b> individuals and populations as a means to better inform management strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{western corn rootworm}} Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and the {{northern}} corn rootworm Diabrotica barberi Smith 2 ̆ 6 Lawrence (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) are major pests of corn (Zea mays L.). Historically, crop rotation has been an effective management strategy, but both species have adapted to crop rotation in the Midwest. For both species in eastern Iowa, we measured abundance and prevalence of rotation resistance using sticky traps and emergence cages in fields of corn and soybean (Glycine max L.). Based on currently available data, we calculated the economic thresholds for these pests at two Diabrotica spp. per trap per day in cornfields and 1. 5 D. v. virgifera per trap per day in soybean fields. The economic injury level of <b>rotation-resistant</b> D. barberi {{was determined to be}} 3. 5 adult insects per emergence cage per year. Peak abundance of rootworm adults in cornfields was below economic thresholds in the majority of fields sampled, suggesting that management of rootworm larvae in continuous cornfields may not always be necessary. <b>Rotation-resistant</b> D. barberi was found throughout eastern Iowa using emergence cages in first-year cornfields, however, the abundance was below levels expected to impose economic injury in 14 of 17 fields evaluated. The presence of <b>rotation-resistant</b> D. v. virgifera, as measured by the occurrence of this insect in soybean fields, occurred only in northeastern Iowa and was also below the economic threshold. These data suggests that crop rotation remains a viable pest management strategy in eastern Iowa...|$|E
40|$|The {{western corn rootworm}} Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (WCR) and the {{northern}} corn rootworm Diabrotica barberi Smith 2 ̆ 6 Lawrence (NCR) are two significant insect pests of corn in North America. Both species have adapted to crop rotation in the Midwest, NCR through extended diapause and WCR by ovipositing in alternative crops. We conducted surveys during 2008 and 2009 {{to collect data on}} the presence of <b>rotation-resistant</b> NCR and WCR. Data were collected by placing Pherocon AM sticky traps in soybean and corn fields and by placing emergence cages in corn fields. <b>Rotation-resistant</b> WCR was most common in the northeastern and east-central Iowa, although no populations were above the economic threshold. <b>Rotation-resistant</b> NCR was found throughout eastern Iowa, the majority captured in the north-central and south-central regions. In 2009 a laboratory study was conducted to test whether soybean varieties with varying resistance to soybean aphid Aphis glycines affected survival and fecundity of several WCR strains. Soybean varieties included lines with resistance genes rag 1 and rag 1 /rag 3 as well as a near yisoline that lacked rag 1 or rag 1 /rag 3. All WCR strains displayed similar longevity, fecundity, and consumption of leaf tissue across the soybean lines tested. We interpret the results of our laboratory study to indicate that soybean varieties with rag 1 and rag 1 /rag 3 resistance to A. glycines are selectively neutral for rotation-resistance trait in WCR...|$|E
40|$|The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important insect pests threatening the production of corn, Zea mays (L.), in the United States. Throughout its history, this insect has displayed considerable adaptability by overcoming a variety of pest management tactics, including the cultural practice of annual crop rotation. Since first reported in Illinois in the late 1980 s, populations of the <b>rotation-resistant</b> western corn rootworm have spread over a wide area of the eastern Corn Belt. Currently, little information is available concerning the interaction of rotation resistance with the use of genetically modified corn expressing insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt), a popular tactic for preventing larval injury and its associated yield loss. The goal of this greenhouse experiment was to determine whether <b>rotation-resistant</b> and rotation-susceptible western corn rootworm larvae differ with respect to survival or development when exposed to single- or dual-toxin (pyramided) Bt corn. Individual corn plants were infested with 225 near-hatch eggs at the V 5 (five leaf collar) growth stage. Larvae developed undisturbed on the root systems for 17 days, after which they were recovered using Berlese–Tullgren funnels. Surviving larvae were counted to estimate mortality, and head capsule widths were measured to assess development. <b>Rotation-resistant</b> and rotationsusceptible larvae had statistically similar mean levels of mortality and head capsule widths when exposed to both single-toxin (Cry 3 Bb 1 or Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1) and pyramided (Cry 3 Bb 1 + Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1) Bt corn, suggesting that these two populations do not differ with respect to survival or development when exposed to Bt corn. Additionally, the statistically similar mean levels of mortality for larvae exposed to single-toxin and pyramided Bt corn suggest that pyramided Bt hybrids containing the Cry 3 Bb 1 and Cry 34 / 35 Ab 1 toxins do not result in additive mortality for western corn rootworm larvae. Implications for management of this economically important pest are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Across a {{large area}} of the midwestern United States Corn Belt, the western corn rootworm beetle (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) {{exhibits}} behavioral resistance to annual crop rotation. Resistant females exhibit increased locomotor activity and frequently lay eggs in soybean (Glycine max L.) fields, although they also lay eggs in fields of corn (Zea mays L.) and other locations. The goals {{of this study were}} (1) to determine whether there were any differences in ovipositional behavior and response to plant cues between individual rotationresistant and wild-type females in the laboratory and (2) to examine the roles of, and interaction between, host volatiles, diet, and locomotor behavior as they related to oviposition. Because rootworm females lay eggs in the soil, we also examined the influence of host plant roots on behavior. In {{the first year of the}} study, <b>rotation-resistant</b> beetles were significantly more likely to lay eggs in the presence of soybean foliage and to feed on soybean leaf discs than wild-type females, but this difference was not observed in the second year. Oviposition by <b>rotation-resistant</b> females was increased in the presence of soybean roots, but soybean herbivory did not affect ovipositional choice. Conversely, ovipositional choice of wild-type females was not affected by the presence or identity of host plant roots encountered, and wild-type females consuming soybean foliage were more likely to lay eggs...|$|E
40|$|Due to slow {{advance in}} battery technology, power remains a {{bottleneck}} to limit wide applications of mobile ad hoc and wireless sensor networks. Among all extensive studies on minimizing power consumption, neighbor discovery {{is one of}} the fundamental components focusing on communication and access. This work surveys research literature on neighbor discovery protocols (NDPs). In general, they can be roughly classified by four underlying principles: randomness, over-half occupation, <b>rotation-resistant</b> intersection, and coprime cycles. The Birthday protocols act as representatives of NDPs using randomness, in which a node decides to listen, transmit, or sleep with probabilities. The original idea of over-half occupation is to be active over at least half of each period, though several refinements have been proposed to decrease its high duty cycle. Methods of <b>rotation-resistant</b> intersection formulate the problem of discovery using combinatorial characteristics of discrete time slots, and guarantee discovery at least once per period. Moreover, neighbor discovery can also be guaranteed within a worst-case bound, as shown by methods adopting coprime cycles. In this paper, we elaborate on these ideas and present several representative protocols, respectively. In particular, we give an integrative analysis of deterministic protocols via a generic framework. A qualitative comparison incorporating multiple criteria and a quantitative evaluation on energy efficiency are also included. Finally, we point out promising research directions towards energy-efficient neighbor discovery...|$|E
40|$|The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), {{is a major}} pest of corn, Zea mays L., in North America {{that has}} {{recently}} invaded Europe. A loss of ovipositional fidelity to cornfields has allowed the species to circumvent crop rotation {{as a means of}} control in part of its range in the United States. Analyses of variation at eight microsatellite loci provided no evidence for general genetic differentiation between samples of western corn rootworm collected in soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., fields and those collected in cornfields {{both inside and outside the}} rotation-resistance problem area. This result suggests that few or no barriers to gene flow exist between <b>rotation-resistant</b> and -susceptible rootworm populations. The implications of this result for the management of western corn rootworm in North America and Europe are discussed...|$|E
40|$|As pest {{species may}} evolve {{resistance}} to chemical controls, {{they may also}} evolve resistance to cultural control methods. Yearly rotation of corn (Zea mays) with another crop interrupts {{the life cycle of}} the western corn rootworm beetle (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), but behavioral resistance to crop rotation is now a major problem in the Midwest of the USA. Resistant adult females exhibit reduced fidelity to corn as a host and lay their eggs in the soil of both corn and soybean (Glycine max) fields. Behavioral assays suggest that the adaptation is related to increased locomotor activity, but finding molecular markers has been difficult. We used microarray analysis to search for gene expression differences between resistant and wild-type beetles. Candidates validated with real-time polymerase chain reaction exhibit predicted patterns from the microarray in independent samples across time and space. Many genes more highly expressed in the <b>rotation-resistant</b> females have no matches to known proteins, and most genes that were more lowly expressed are involved in antimicrobial defense...|$|E
40|$|The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is an {{established}} insect pest of maize (Zea mays L.) in North America. The rotation of maize with another crop, principally soybeans, Glycine max (L.), {{was the primary}} management strategy utilized by North American producers and remained highly effective until the mid- 1990 s. In 1995, widespread and severe root injury occurred in east-central Illinois and northern Indiana maize fields that had been annually rotated with soybeans {{on a regular basis}} for several decades. The failure of this cultural tactic from a pest management perspective was attributed to a behavioral adaptation by a variant western corn rootworm that had lost fidelity to maize for egg laying. In 1992, an infestation of western corn rootworm was found within a small maize field near the Belgrade Airport. By 2007, the presence of this insect pest had been confirmed in 20 European countries. More recent molecular studies have confirmed that at least three separate invasions (until 2004) of western corn rootworms have occurred in Europe, increasing the risk that <b>rotation-resistant</b> western corn rootworms will be introduced into a new continent. Although biological control and use of conventional resistant maize hybrids have not achieved widespread success in the management of western corn rootworms in North America, these tactics are being evaluated in Europe...|$|E
40|$|The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), {{is a major}} pest of corn (Zea mays L.) in North America and {{has evolved}} {{resistance}} to crop rotation by ovipositing in alternate crops such as soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ]. Through experiments with plants grown in the greenhouse and the field, we tested whether soybeans with resistance to the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), affected survival, fecundity, and consumption of soybean for D. v. virgifera. Soybean varieties tested included those types resistant to A. glycines (Rag 1 and rag 1 /rag 3) and a susceptible near isoline of the Rag 1 variety. Females were provided with a diet of corn tissue for 4 d after which they were fed a diet of tissue from one of three soybean varieties for 4 d, starved for 4 d, or fed corn tissue. When fed greenhouse grown plants, strains differed significantly in survival and consumption, but consumption did not differ by variety of soybean. Diet treatment only affected fecundity; individuals fed corn continuously had greater fecundity than those individuals fed soybeans. In the experiment with plants grown in the field, leaf consumption differed among strains and individuals fed corn continuously had greater fecundity than the other treatments. Soybean varieties with Rag 1 and rag 1 /rag 3 resistance toA. glycines {{did not appear to}} affect the fitness of D. v. virgifera. Thus, planting of these A. glycines-resistant soybean varieties should not directly affect the spread of <b>rotation-resistant</b> D. v. virgifera...|$|E
40|$|The {{western corn rootworm}} (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a {{significant}} insect pest of maize in the United States, Canada and Europe. Until the mid 1990 s, this pest was successfully controlled by annual crop rotation, alternating maize with a non-host plant like soybean. However, massive adoption of maize-soybean rotation in east-central Illinois selected for a WCR phenotype that circumvents crop rotation by laying eggs outside of maize fields. This <b>rotation-resistant</b> variant of WCR (RR-WCR) display reduced fidelity to maize {{and is likely to}} fly into rotated soybean fields where it feeds and oviposits. When eggs laid in rotated soybean hatch the following spring, the emerging larvae now in a cornfield produce severe injury to maize roots. For the last fifteen years, other than behavioral characterization of the RR-WCR, establishing a correlation between genotypic and phenotypic attributes has proved elusive. Despite the ability of soybeans to produce defense compounds, RR adults are more frequently found feeding on soybean foliage than wild-type (WT) WCR. Soybean defenses against herbivory include cysteine protease inhibitors, which inhibit the activity of digestive proteases and impair the fitness of many coleopterans. The objective of this research was to determine whether RR-WCR adults display an altered digestive proteolysis that may increase their tolerance to soybean foliage diet and facilitate the occurrence of rotation-resistance. The results show that RR-WCR beetles had higher soybean intake and extended survivorship on continuous soybean diet. In addition, cathepsin L protease activity in RR-WCR populations was significantly higher than that of WT populations fed on either corn silks or soybeans. Gene expression analysis of cysteine proteases in WCR guts supports these findings; the expression level of a cathepsin L-like clone was significantly higher in RR-WCR adults when compared with WT populations. This thesis is the first report of eco-physiological, biochemical and molecular evidence supporting higher tolerance of soybean hervibory in RR-WCR. The discovery of a mechanism of tolerance to soybean herbivory in WCR offers unique information and tools to use in advancing understanding of the proximate mechanisms of insect adaptation to dietary stress...|$|E
