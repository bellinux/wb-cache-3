40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} government investments in education on economic growth in Nigeria over the period 1981 - 2012. Economic growth proxy by growth rate of GDP is the dependent variable while government capital expenditure on social services, <b>recurrent</b> expenditure on <b>education,</b> primary school total pupil enrolment and primary school pupils-teachers ratio are explanatory variables. Employing the OLS technique, the paper found that government capital expenditure on social services (education and health) and government <b>recurrent</b> expenditure on <b>education</b> have significant implications on economic growth over the period of this study. Total primary school pupil enrolment and primary school pupils-teachers enrolment {{were found to have}} mixed influences on economic growth. The low level of funding of the sector, poor conditions of service, high level of pupils out of school and the low pupil-teachers ratio in Nigeria were suspected to have accounted for these results. However, the goodness of fit of about 66 percent indicates that high potentials for growth exist in the educational sector. The paper therefore recommends an increase in government budgetary allocation to the education sector from the present less than 15 percent to UNDP/UNESCO requirement of 25 percent allocation to the sector, improvement in the welfare of educational staff and regular monitoring of funds and services rendered in the sector to ensure improved standards as possible ways of making education growth a friendly sector in Nigeria...|$|R

There are three main findings in this paper. First, each expansion of education policy coincides {{with a focus on}} the existing working population, allowing for broader access to extension education. Second, extension education is subject to fewer regulations than education at large in Taiwan. This deregulation of extension education affords universities more autonomy and has also contributed to the expansion of extension education in Taiwan. Third, following the lifelong education policy adopted by the Taiwanese government in 1990, a framework for <b>recurrent</b> <b>education</b> was established and integrated into extension education, bringing further empowering extension education within the administrative system. Furthermore, universities have responded to the government’s lifelong education policy by expanding programs for <b>recurrent</b> <b>education.</b> This institutional preparedness in tandem with the universities’ development strategy has been conducive to the development of extension education in Taiwan. In summary, extension education in Taiwan is not only a part of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>education</b> system, but also an important agent in the management of social needs for higher education...|$|E

40|$|As {{the saying}} goes, “a beloved child has many names”. So, too, {{is the case}} with the concept to be dealt with in this paper. Over the years various {{concepts}} have been used to denote education in a lifetime perspective, such as “education permanente”, <b>recurrent</b> <b>education</b> and lifelong learning. There are many who have disputed the correctness or appropriateness of one or the other concepts. Boudard (2001), for example, argues “some researchers maintain that today the concept of <b>recurrent</b> <b>education,</b> originally advanced by OECD, is the most widely recognized as the strategy that leads to lifelong learning, although the concept of lifelong learning often comes to mind”, citing Tuijnman, 1989; and OECD, 1973. Given the lack of clarity in the above argument, {{it is not surprising that}} confusion abounds as to what lifelong learning is, what the “strategy” entails and who it benefits. The aim of this article is to present a critical perspective on lifelong learning, such as it has developed over the years through my own work and the work of others. First, however, it is important to consider the birth of this “beloved child”, to understand from whence it came and under what circumstances. Despite the fact that much has been written about this topic, there are few who mention the fact that as Minister of Education (1967 - 1969) Olof Palme introduced in Sweden the concept of “återkommande utbildning”, which literally translated means <b>recurrent</b> <b>education.</b> Palme himself motivated this reform strategy as a means by which “to rectify after the fact, to break down the class barriers to education”.

40|$|Background: Interactions with {{children}} in clinical settings are often criticized because parents and medical professionals speak for children rather than to them. Such approaches do not take the agency of children into account. Objective: First, to examine how children enact agency in a clinical encounter and draw lessons from this to improve health-care practices for children and, second, to explain how looking at agency might help to move the participation agenda forwards. Design: A qualitative study incorporating a range of methods, including participant observation, interviews and focus group discussions. Setting: Three hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants: Children with diabetes type 1, between 8 and 12 years (n = 30), parents (n = 22) and medical professionals (n = 16). Results: Children do not simply accept the <b>recurrent</b> health <b>education</b> from medical professionals. Instead, they attribute their own personal meaning to their disease and treatment. Drawing from their years of experience with the disease and {{health care and the}} image of a passive and vulnerable child, they actively find ways to balance personal goals with medically defined goals. Conclusion: Efforts to facilitate child participation should be based on insights into the ways in which children enact agency in the clinical encounter. Our data show that children already participate in health care and that their enactment of agency is based on a practical logic. Understanding of children's current participation and agency is needed to more successfully attune their treatment to their daily lives with diabetes.

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review for male veterans hospitalized for hip fracture from January 1993 through July 1999. SETTING: The Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Madison, WI. RESULTS: Medical charts were available for 46 of 53 male patients admitted for hip fracture during the study period. Three subjects were excluded because hip fracture was associated with high-impact trauma. Mean age of the 43 study patients was 72 years (range 43 - 91 y), and mean length of hospitalization was 16 days (median 11 d, range 3 - 108 d). Thirty-two (82 %) of 39 veterans whose disposition was documented were discharged to a nursing home. Eleven (26 %) of 43 men died within 12 months after fracture. Twelve (28 %) had fractured previously. Four (10 %) subsequently had another fracture. Three of 9 patients with documented ambulation status were ambulatory at 1 year. Three patients received a bone mass measurement within a prespecified time interval of 6 months subsequent to fracture. No patient's records included a diagnosis of osteoporosis either before or within 6 months after fracture. One-third of the patients had documentation of calcium or multivitamin supplementation at discharge. One patient was receiving calcitonin {{at the time of}} fracture and continued to receive it afterward. No other patient was prescribed antiresorptive therapy by the time of hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Male veterans with hip fractures received inadequate evaluation and treatment for osteoporosis, although a substantial portion had documentation of <b>recurrent</b> fractures. <b>Education</b> of clinicians and creation of algorithms for management of established osteoporosis may improve outcomes for these individuals...|$|R

We examined work disability due to depression with four indicators of socioeconomic status. Methods: A prospective cohort study of 125 355 Finnish public sector employees was linked to national register data on work disability (. 9 days) due to depressive disorders (International Classification of Diseases, codes F 32 –F 34) from January 2005 to December 2011. Primary outcomes were the onset of work disability due to depressive disorders and, among those with such disability, return to work after and recurrent episodes of work disability due to depression. Results: We found a consistent inverse socioeconomic gradient in work disability due to depression. Lower occupational position, lower educational level, smaller residence size, and rented (vs. owner-occupied) residence were all associated with an increased risk of work disability.

One {{of the ways}} that farmers can cope with these changes is to become more professional in their management. Fewer young people are entering farming today and the average age of farmers is rising so tba. t the emphasis in agricultural education is shifting towards providing more continuing education for practising fanners. Post-secondary education is under increasing criticism from educators, Governments and society largely. because of its failure to provide equality of opportunity and for its emphasis on youth centred education at the expense. of adults. Lifelong education is now seen by many educators as the guiding principle which will enable everyone to have learning opportunities throughout their lifetime. Recurrent 'education is proposed as' an alternative educational strategy to permanent education and its theme is an alternation between education and other activities, such as work and. leisure, throughout life. A key feature of a system of <b>recurrent</b> <b>education</b> is that it is the Learner who controls the direction of the learning. This paper reports the results of a survey which set out to determine the needs for, and attitudes towards continuing. education amongst 200 practising farmers. It was found that educational attainment, youth, and other, farmer characteristics. were. positively related to participation and interest in continuing education. Agricultural colleges were seen as playing a vital role in providing opportunities for continuing education but that certain improvements in the planning, financing and timing of their activities would increase their use by farmers. There is an increasing need for TAFE, which is the ideal post-secondary, system for implementing the principles of <b>recurrent</b> <b>education,</b> to play a more active part than it has in supporting continuing education for farming.

Another dilemma is that {{there seems to be}} a small range of functional interventions that enhance {{adherence to}} long-term medication treatments. The aim was to review the last five years of published educational interventions for improving adherence to asthma medication. Through systematic database searches 20 articles were identified, which matched the inclusion criteria and described educational interventions to improve asthma self-management including adherence. The current review showed that addressing unintentional non-adherence in terms of incorrect inhaler technique by <b>recurrent</b> <b>education</b> improved the technique among many patients, but not among all. Phoning patients, as a means to remove medication beliefs as adherence barriers, seemed to be an effective educational strategy, shown as increased adherence. Involving patients in treatment decisions and individualising or tailoring educational support also seemed to have favourable effect on adherence. To conclude, addressing specific adherence barriers such as poor inhaler technique or medication beliefs could favour adherence. To change adherence behavior, the current review proposes that educational adherence support should be a collaborative effort between the patient and the health-care professional based on each individual patient's needs and patient factors, including elements such as personality traits...|$|E

A key issue in this debate relates to the effect of the composition of public expenditure, and its financing, on economic growth. The current paper lays out a research strategy to explore the effects of fiscal policy, including the composition of public expenditure, on economic growth, using a time series approach. Based on the modeling strategy by Greiner, Semmler and Gong (2005) we suggest a general model that includes (a) <b>recurrent</b> expenditure on <b>education</b> and health (which influences human capital), as well as expenditure on (b) public infrastructure investment, (c) transfers and consumption of public goods, and (d) public administration.

A simplified model is proposed, numerically solved and the out of steady state dynamics studied.

Whereas some runners rarely become injured, others experience recurrent injuries even during fairly short periods of time. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare selected personality traits in a group of runners who had sustained a previous tibial stress fracture (n½ 17), with a matched group of runners (n½ 17) who had never experienced stress fractures. The results indicated that the injured runners, especially the women, scored higher than the non-injured runners did on inventories measuring both the Type A behavior pattern and exercise dependency. Since motivation, ambitiousness, and competitiveness are integral parts of these inventories, high scoring individuals might be part of a high-risk population for running injuries, the more so if the individual also feels dependent on regular running for managing stress related mood states, which was the case particularly for the injured women in the present study. However, the somewhat limited number of runners who had had a confirmatory scintigram, which was a criterion for inclusion in the study, warrants a cautious interpretation of the results.

40|$|Depression is a {{major cause}} of {{disability}} in working populations and the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in disability is an important public health challenge. We examined work disability due to depression with four indicators of socioeconomic status. A prospective cohort study of 125 355 Finnish public sector employees was linked to national register data on work disability (> 9 days) due to depressive disorders (International Classification of Diseases, codes F 32 -F 34) from January 2005 to December 2011. Primary outcomes were the onset of work disability due to depressive disorders and, among those with such disability, return to work after and recurrent episodes of work disability due to depression. We found a consistent inverse socioeconomic gradient in work disability due to depression. Lower occupational position, lower educational level, smaller residence size, and rented (vs. owner-occupied) residence were all associated with an increased risk of work disability. Return to work was slower for employees with basic education (cumulative odds ratio =  1. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 1. 39) compared to those with higher <b>education.</b> <b>Recurrent</b> work disability episodes due to depression were less common among upper-grade non-manual workers (the highest occupational group) than among lower-grade non-manual (hazard ratio =  1. 16, 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 25) and manual (hazard ratio =  1. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 26) workers. These data from Finnish public sector employees show persistent socioeconomic inequalities in work disability due to depression from 2005 to 2011 in terms of onset, recovery and recurrence...|$|R
