50|$|Enjoying coffee {{made from}} freshly roasted beans {{is one of}} the major driving factors in the {{popularity}} of home roasting. Home roasting has the advantage of being able to roast smaller volumes of coffee to match consumption so that the roasted coffee is used before it goes stale. Depending on the bean's origin and the method of storage after roasting, generally whole bean coffee flavor is at its peak between seven and fourteen days after roasting, but some beans are best left even longer, up to 21 days. The flavor of ground coffee deteriorates even faster. Methods of extending freshness include <b>refrigeration,</b> <b>freezing,</b> vacuum packaging, and displacing oxygen in the container with an inert gas. Green coffee beans can be kept fresh for 1-3 years, depending upon storage conditions, and more particular home roasters reduce storage time to 8 or even 1.5 months.|$|E

50|$|In {{its more}} passive forms with minimal warming, what season {{extension}} accomplishes {{is to allow}} plants to remain metabolically idle (with very slow growth) but avoid dying. This allows growers to make a conceptual distinction between extending the growing season and extending the harvest season. The reality is a spectrum, and the same farm can do both (on a crop-by-crop or field-by-field basis), but nonetheless these two conceptual poles can be distinguished. The former type of extension is what a hothouse does, such as producing tropical fruit in winter by totally conquering the outdoor climate at high expense. In contrast, the latter type of extension can be viewed not {{as a way to}} escape the context of seasonality entirely but rather, working within the context of seasonality, to achieve food preservation in a way that uses life itself for preservation instead of using technology applied to dead plant or animal tissue (as mechanical <b>refrigeration,</b> <b>freezing,</b> or canning would). From this viewpoint it can even be compared to ancient norms of meat preservation, which relied on the principle that a good way to avoid meat spoilage is to keep the animal alive until just before consumption. In other words, the best postharvest strategy sometimes can be to confine the postharvest period to hours or days instead of weeks or months (by keeping the plant or animal alive as long as possible—the ultimate form of preservation). In the meat example, in preindustrial contexts livestock were brought to market on the hoof, and sailing ships on months-long voyages would keep turtles in forced semihibernation until each one was slaughtered to make a meal.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of refrigeration, several different methods of thawing, and pasteurization on the concentration of IgG in bovine colostrum. Four different experiments were designed to analyse these effects. In the first of these, 50 samples of bovine colostrum were stored in a cold-storage room at a temperature of 4 ⁰C for a 3 -month period. No statistically significant effects were observed within this time, although there was a reduction in IgG concentrations (51. 05 and 25. 11 mg/ml IgG at day 0 and 91, respectively). In the second experiment, 20 samples of bovine colostrum were frozen and subsequently thawed using four different methods: spray drying (60 ⁰C), refrigeration (4 ⁰C), deep freezing (- 20 ⁰C) and freeze drying (55 ⁰C). The process was carried out seven times {{for each of the four}} methods. The method of thawing did not affect the colostrum IgG concentration. However, the repetition of freezing and thawing tended to reduce IgG concentrations; albeit to no significant degree (15. 50 and 10. 73 mg/ml IgG at cycle 0 and 7, respectively).

Production of live microalgae has been seen as a major hatchery operating costs, accounting for 20 – 50  % of the total bivalve seed production costs (Coutteau and Sorgeloos 1992). Hatchery-reared oysters in the nursery with a low mortality rate in the sea should be bigger than 5  mm in length (Tanyaros and Tarangkoon 2014), but feeding of spat from post settling up to this size result in high consumption of microalgae. It is at this stage of culturing that an alternative food source is most needed. Today, this problem can be solved using preserved microalgae which can be produced by concentrating algae from mass culture and preserving the products through <b>refrigeration,</b> <b>freezing</b> or drying (McCausland et al. 1999; Ponis et al. 2008).

The highest probiotic populations, above 7. 45 log cfu/g, were observed for all frozen mousses during 112 days of storage.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} are anaerobic rod-shaped, Gram-positive bacteria {{associated with}} {{foods such as}} rolled meat joints, stews and gravies. During cooking, vegetative cells of C. perfringens die but they form spores able to survive the unfavourable conditions. If the food is cooled slowly, the spores can germinate into vegetative cells that can then multiply to high numbers. When the highly contaminated food is eaten, although the cells are unable {{to grow in the}} gut they form spores and as the cells break to release the spore, a large amount of toxin is released into the gut (Czeczulin et al., 1993; McClane, 2007). Symptoms include watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain that usually resolves itself as the diarrhoea removes the toxin from the body. There are five types of C. perfringens based on toxin type (A, B, C, D, E). Most C. perfringens food poisoning cases reported in developed countries are caused by type A strains. Type C causes a rare, severe, necrotic enteritis (Bates and Bodnaruk, 2003). Less than 5 % of all C. perfringens carry the gene responsible for the production of the enterotoxin causing Type A illness (the cpe gene). Only strains carrying this gene in a chromosome (C-cpe) cause foodborne illness (Sarker et al., 2000; Wen and McClane 2004; McClane, 2007).

40|$|Modern society {{relies on}} cooling {{technology}} for food safety, comfort and medical applications. For example, in the US about 34 % {{of the electricity}} is consumed by cooling appliances and 15 % of the total worldwide energy consumption {{involves the use of}} refrigeration (air conditioning, <b>refrigeration,</b> <b>freezing,</b> chilling, etc.). Nowadays, most cooling devices are based on vapour-compression technology, which uses strong greenhouse gases and the energy efficiency has reached its limit, the increased international concerns over global warming due to ever increasing energy consumption calls for a change. Currently, several solid-sate cooling technologies, such as optical refrigeration, thermoelectric refrigeration, electric refrigeration, and magnetic refrigeration, are being considered as viable alternative techniques because they are becoming increasingly efficient and affordable. However, for a technique to become a fully mature alternative, clever engineering and more detailed studies on the fundamental physical properties are needed. Roomtemperature magnetic cooling has attracted attention in recent years as a promising environmentally friendly alternative to conventional gas-compression cooling. Using solid magnetic materials as coolant, magnetic cooling does not involve any gases that cause ozone-depletion or global warming, which can help {{to meet the demands of}} the recently implemented Kyoto treaty. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that magnetic cooling is energetically 20 % more efficient than gas-compression cooling, which is of particular interest in view of the global energy shortage. The working materials for room-temperature magnetic cooling are required to possess Curie temperatures around room temperature. Having large magnetization is a prerequisite for achieving a large magnetocaloric effect (MCE). For a long time, Gd was the best room temperature magnetic cooling material with a Curie temperature of 293 K. In comparison with rare-earth-based compounds that exhibit large MCE but are expensive, perovskite manganites exhibit smaller magnetic moments but are far less expensive. The magnetic properties of manganites, the Curie temperature, and the saturation magnetization are strongly doping-dependent. Perovskite manganites are more convenient to prepare and exhibit higher chemical stability, as well as the higher resistivity that is favorable for lowering eddy current heating. In addition, the manganites possess much smaller thermal and field hysteresis than any rare earth and 3 d-transition metal based alloy. So, these materials may be good candidates for MR at various temperatures. Many investigations have therefore concentrated on perovskite manganites. The work presented in my thesis is a study of various perovskite manganites magnetocaloric materials for refrigeration applications. We also investigated the MCE of alloys. The structural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties of the manganite La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 have been studied. Significant magnetic entropy change of 5. 27 J/kg K was observed at 251 K under the magnetic field of 1. 5 T with out noticeable magnetic hysteresis and tiny thermal hysteresis loss. This value is about twice as large as those for other perovskite manganites and is even larger than for Gd-based magnetic materials at low fields. The influence of first and second order magnetic phase transitions on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and refrigerant capacity or relative cooling power (RCP) of La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 and La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Mn 0. 95 Co 0. 05 O 3 materials has been investigated. The La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 material experiences a large entropy change with the first-order magnetic phase transition at the Curie temperature, TC. On the other hand, La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Mn 0. 95 Co 0. 05 O 3 displays a smaller entropy change with a second order phase transition. While the first-order magnetic transition material induces a larger MCE (7. 528 J/kg K at 5 T) at TC, which is limited to a narrow temperature range, resulting in a relatively small RCP (218 J/kg), while the Co-doped second-order magnetic transition material induces a smaller MCE (7. 14 J/kg K for 5 T), but it is spread over a broader temperature range, resulting in a larger RCP (308 J/kg). The maximum magnetoresistance under a field of 5 T is about 206 % and 333 % for La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 and La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Mn 0. 95 Co 0. 05 O 3, respectively. The refrigeration capacity (RCP) is enhanced in La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Mn 0. 95 Co 0. 05 O 3 (by about 41 %) due to small changes from Co doping. The magnetocaloric features of these materials at lower magnetic fields (MCE = 3. 163 J/kgK for La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 Mn 0. 95 Co 0. 05 O 3 and 4. 63 J/kgK for La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 at 1 T), and the high RCP and MR can provide some ideas for exploring novel magnetic refrigerants that can be operated with permanent magnets rather than superconducting ones as the magnetic field source. The magnetic properties and magnetocaloric effect of La 0. 7 (Ca 1 −xAgx) 0. 3 MnO 3 (x = 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 7, and 1) powder samples were studied. The Curie temperature, TC, has been found to increase from ∼ 250 K for x = 0 to ∼ 270 K for x = 1. Ag doping weakens the first order phase transition, and at higher Ag doping, the phase transition is of second order. For the La 0. 7 (Ca 0. 27 Ag 0. 03) MnO 3 composition, the maximum magnetic entropy change (|ΔSM|) from change in the applied magnetic field of 0 - 2 T and 0 - 5 T is about 4. 5 and 7. 75 J/kgK, respectively, at the Curie temperature of ∼ 263 K. The relative cooling power (RCP) values without hysteresis loss are about 102 and 271 J/kg for applied field change of 0 - 2 T and 0 - 5 T, respectively. Due to the large ΔSM, large RCP, and high Curie temperature, La 0. 7 (Ca 0. 27 Ag 0. 03) MnO 3 may be a promising candidate for application in potential magnetic refrigeration near room temperature. Magnetic properties and the magnetocaloric effect have been investigated in La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 single crystal. Upon application of a 0 - 5 T field change, the magnitude of the magnetic entropy changes, reaching values of 7. 668 J/kg K and 6. 412 J/kgK for both the ab-plane and the c-direction, respectively. A magnetic entropy change of 3. 3 J/kgK was achieved for a magnetic field change of 1. 5 T at the Curie temperature, TC = 245 K. Due to the absence of grains in the single crystal, the ΔSM distribution here is much more uniform than for gadolinium (Gd) and other polycrystalline manganites, which is desirable for an Ericsson-cycle magnetic refrigerator. For a field change of 0 - 5 T, the relative cooling power, RCP, reached 358. 17 J/kg, while a maximum adiabatic temperature change of 5. 33 K and a magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of 507. 88 % at TC were observed. The spin fluctuation parameters were estimated by adapting Takahashi’s developed spin-fluctuation theory, and the reciprocal susceptibility was calculated. Evidence is presented that the magnetic property of La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 is weakly itinerant ferromagnetic. The large reversible MCE and lack of any hysteresis loss, combined with a considerable value of refrigerant capacity, indicate that La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 single crystal is a potential candidate as a magnetic refrigerant. Epitaxial grown La 0. 8 Ca 0. 2 MnO 3 /LaAlO 3 (LCMO/LAO) thin film exhibited a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic second order phase transition at 249 K. The lack of any hysteresis loss also confirmed that the material is intrinsically reversible. In addition, the large magnetization of the thin film results in a total entropy change larger than those of all other perovskite type materials and the same as that of Gd. Consequently, the relative cooling power is significantly enhanced. Improved film morphology would be the main reason for the remarkable values of entropy change and relative cooling power of the film. This indicates that thin film processing might provide an alternative pathway in searching for efficient magnetic refrigerators for microscale systems. The effect of frozen spin on the magnetocaloric properties of La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 CoO 3 polycrystalline and single crystal samples has been studied. Interestingly, an anomalous magnetic field memory effect, an exchange-bias-like effect, and a large inverse irreversible magnetocaloric effect have been observed in this system. It is found that the frozen spins have a significant influence on the ΔSM. The ΔSM – T curves in the low temperature range show totally different features between the ZFC and FC cooling procedures. The ΔSM shows a very large inverse irreversibility value for the ZFC process, since there are a large amount of unfrozen spins aligned under the external field in the low temperature range, while the ΔSM shows a normal positive value and a slightly larger ΔSM value, which indicates that a small amount of unfrozen spins still exist. It is proposed that compositional inhomogeneity is the predominant source of the magnetic properties and the magnetocaloric effect. Reduction of hysteresis loss in LaFe 11. 7 Si 1. 3 Hx hydrides with significant magnetocaloric effect has been investigated. The influence of hydrogen absorption on the MCE and especially on the magnetic hysteresis in LaFe 11. 7 Si 1. 3 Hx (x = 0, 1. 37, and 2. 07) compounds is discussed from the viewpoint of magnetic refrigerants, and a large MCE which is still higher than for Gd and a small hysteresis loss are achieved near room temperature are favourable for the practical application of these materials near room temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of some {{physical and chemical}} properties was done in order to investigate the effects of storage in hazelnuts, under certain conditions of tempera- ture, relative humidity and packaging. The fruit samples used were original from Spain, Portugal and Turkey. The storage of the nuts lasted for a month and a half, and the conditions tested were: at room temperature; at 30 and 50 C without control over relative humidity of the air; 30 and 50 C with relative humidity of 90 %, <b>refrigeration</b> and <b>freezing.</b> The two types of plastic package tested were low density polyethylene (LDPE) and linear low density poly- ethylene The water activity was measured by a hygrometer; moisture by oven drying until constant weight, colour with a colorimeter and texture with a texturometer. From the results obtained it was concluded that for a good preservation of the hazelnuts it must be chosen the LDPE type of package and with respect to storage conditions it should be done at room temperature, or alternatively in <b>refrigeration</b> or <b>freezing...</b>|$|R
