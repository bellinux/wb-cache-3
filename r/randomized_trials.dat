5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct <b>randomized</b> <b>trials</b> {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind– patients would know which statin they had been prescribed– but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could affect their health.|$|E

40|$|Marginal {{structural}} {{models were}} introduced {{in order to provide}} estimates of causal effects from interventions based on observational studies in epidemiological research. The key point is that this can be understood in terms of Girsanov's change of measure. This offers a mathematical interpretation of marginal structural models that has not been available before. We consider both a model of an observational study and a model of a hypothetical <b>randomized</b> <b>trial.</b> These models correspond to different martingale measures [...] the observational measure and the <b>randomized</b> <b>trial</b> measure [...] on some underlying space. We describe situations where the <b>randomized</b> <b>trial</b> measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the observational measure. The resulting continuous-time likelihood ratio process with respect to these two probability measures corresponds to the weights in discrete-time marginal structural models. In order to do inference for the hypothetical <b>randomized</b> <b>trial,</b> we can simulate samples using observational data weighted by this likelihood ratio.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Randomized</b> {{clinical}} <b>trials</b> that enroll {{patients in}} critical or emergency care (acute care) setting are challenging because of narrow time windows for recruitment {{and the inability}} of many patients to provide informed consent. To assess the extent that recruitment challenges lead to <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trial</b> discontinuation, we compared the discontinuation of acute care and nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials.</b> DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of 894 <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> approved by six institutional review boards in Switzerland, Germany, and Canada between 2000 and 2003. SETTING: <b>Randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> involving patients in an acute or nonacute care setting. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTIONS: We recorded trial characteristics, self-reported trial discontinuation, and self-reported reasons for discontinuation from protocols, corresponding publications, institutional review board files, and a survey of investigators. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 894 <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials,</b> 64 (7 %) were acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> (29 critical care and 35 emergency care). Compared with the 830 nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials,</b> acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> were more frequently discontinued (28 of 64, 44 % vs 221 of 830, 27 %; p = 0. 004). Slow recruitment was the most frequent reason for discontinuation, both in acute care (13 of 64, 20 %) and in nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> (7 of 64, 11 %). Logistic regression analyses suggested the acute care setting as an independent risk factor for <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trial</b> discontinuation specifically {{as a result of}} slow recruitment (odds ratio, 4. 00; 95 % CI, 1. 72 - 9. 31) after adjusting for other established risk factors, including nonindustry sponsorship and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> are more vulnerable to premature discontinuation than nonacute care <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> and have an approximately four-fold higher risk of discontinuation due to slow recruitment. These results highlight the need for strategies to reliably prevent and resolve slow patient recruitment in <b>randomized</b> clinical <b>trials</b> conducted in the critical and emergency care setting...|$|R

25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and qualitative studies.

25|$|For {{patients}} treated for stage I seminoma who choose surveillance rather than undergoing adjuvant therapy, {{there have been}} no <b>randomized</b> <b>trials</b> to determine the optimum frequency of scans and visits, and the schedules vary very widely across the world, and within individual countries. In the UK there is an ongoing clinical trial called TRISST. This is assessing how often scans should take place and whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used instead of CT scans. MRI is being investigated because it does not expose the patient to radiation and so, if it is shown to be as good at detecting relapses, it may be preferable to CT.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the relative strengths {{of different types of}} research. Because <b>randomized</b> <b>trials</b> provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.|$|E

25|$|A 2009 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving {{a total of}} 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews. Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD {{in the areas of}} cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior. In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI. Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI. Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site <b>randomized</b> <b>trials</b> are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism.
