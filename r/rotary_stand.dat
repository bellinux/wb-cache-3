40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to solving the problem of {{calibration}} with specified precision of triaxial block of navigation accelerometers on the uniaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>stand.</b> In paper introduced all the characteristics, for calibration of triaxial block of navigation accelerometers on the uniaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>stand,</b> instrumental error sources upon which was obtained mathematical errors model of calibration. This model allows to calculate the error which the coefficients of metrology model of triaxial accelerometer unit was identified, {{if we have the}} numerical values of precision equipment errors. Using the mathematical errors model of calibration, and the quality criterion of calibration of triaxial block of navigation accelerometers unit, were obtained inequality that used to determine requirements for accuracy characteristics bench equipment, on which the calibration is performed. These requirements ensure the calibration of triaxial block of navigation accelerometers on the uniaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>stand</b> with preset accuracy. Experimental verification was conducted on comparable accuracy errors existing equipment and the requirements to this equipment, confirm the adequacy of the obtained inequalities. As the result of research were identified the most influential sources of instrumental errors, and provided recommendations to reduce their impacts. ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ????? ?????????????? ??? ??? ?????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ????????????, ??? ?????????? ?? ??? ?????????? ????? ????????????? ?????????????? ? ???????? ?????????...|$|E
40|$|A new {{calibration}} method of triaxial navigation accelerometer unit on uniaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>stand</b> is considered. The {{aim is to}} determine the model of coefficients identification of metrology model for triaxial accelerometer unit by the method mentioned above. Metrology model of triaxial navigation accelerometer unit as a vector transmitter, physical and mathematical foundations of a new method for its calibration are described. To ensure the identifiability of all coefficients of the metrological model, two installations of accelerometer unit on a platform of uniaxial <b>rotary</b> <b>stand</b> were introduced. Identification models for metrology model of triaxial accelerometer unit were produced. Experimental validation of the obtained identification coefficients models was carried out. The ability to calibrate a triaxial accelerometer navigation unit with the given accuracy was confirmed. According to the research specific recommendations for the practical application of the developed {{calibration method}} are proposed. ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ????? ????????????? ?????????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????. ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ????????. ???????????????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ?????????????...|$|E

40|$|El libro en el que es publicado este capítulo {{puede ser}} consultado en el enlace: [URL] This paper aims to analyse the transformations of metal {{technology}} during the Late Bronze Age in the Iberian Peninsula, {{focusing on the}} effects of the contacts with Mediterranean societies. Special attention is paid to objects such as wheeled <b>stands,</b> <b>rotary</b> spits and metal vessels, which reflect the use of new techniques (lost-wax casting, casting-on, etc.). We argue against the idea that all these bronzes were imported from the central or western Mediterranean; in our opinion, most of them were locally produced and, though lost-wax casting was not a widespread technique in Late Bronze Age Iberian metallurgy, some bronzeworkers could make successful use of this innovation as a consequence of their contacts with Mediterranean craftsmen. Secondly, we reassess the dynamics of interaction between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean in the Iberian Late Bronze Age, as well as its relationship with Phoenician colonization. We argue that the goal of the Mediterranean presence in the west was not to prepare for colonization, but that this process generated a socio-economic context that made the colonization possible. The quest for ores and metals was not the only reason for the Phoenician presence in the western Mediterranean, though it was an important one. Finally, the continued production of pre-colonial forms and motifs in colonial times is discussed, aiming to assess the reasons for this phenomenon which is attested in north-east Iberian metallurgy. Our conclusion is that the long use of some of these pre-colonial objects as prestige goods may have motivated their imitation later. Peer reviewe...|$|R
