The early Aircraft <b>Reactor</b> <b>Experiment</b> was primarily motivated by the small size that the design could provide, while the Molten-Salt <b>Reactor</b> <b>Experiment</b> was a prototype for a thorium fuel cycle breeder nuclear power plant.

25|$|Alvin M. Weinberg {{pioneered the}} use of the MSR at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At ORNL, two {{prototype}} molten salt reactors were successfully designed, constructed and operated. These were the Aircraft <b>Reactor</b> <b>Experiment</b> in 1954 and Molten-Salt <b>Reactor</b> <b>Experiment</b> from 1965 to 1969. Both test reactors used liquid fluoride fuel salts. The MSRE notably demonstrated fueling with U-233 and U-235 during separate test runs. Weinberg was removed from his post and the MSR program closed down in the early 1970s, after which research stagnated in the United States. Today, the ARE and the MSRE remain the only molten salt reactors ever operated.|$|E

25|$|Although {{individual}} experiments, {{such as the}} set {{of solar}} neutrino experiments, are consistent with non-oscillatory mechanisms of neutrino flavor conversion, taken altogether, neutrino experiments imply the existence of neutrino oscillations. Especially relevant in this context are the <b>reactor</b> <b>experiment</b> KamLAND and the accelerator experiments such as MINOS. The KamLAND experiment has indeed identified oscillations as the neutrino flavor conversion mechanism involved in the solar electron neutrinos. Similarly MINOS confirms the oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos and gives a better determination of the mass squared splitting. Takaaki Kajita of Japan and Arthur B. McDonald of Canada received the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physics for their landmark finding, theoretical and experimental, that neutrinos can change flavors.|$|E
25|$|Uncertain {{decommissioning}} costs - Cleanup of the Molten-Salt <b>Reactor</b> <b>Experiment</b> was about $130 million, {{for a small}} 8 MW(th) unit. Much of the high cost {{was caused by the}} unexpected evolution of fluorine and uranium hexafluoride from cold fuel salt in storage that ORNL did not defuel and store correctly, but this has now been taken into consideration in MSR design. In addition, {{decommissioning costs}} don't scale strongly with plant size based on previous experience, and costs are incurred at the end of plant life, so a small per kilowatthour fee is sufficient. For example, a GWe reactor plant produces over 300 billion kWh of electricity over a 40-year lifetime, so a $0.001/kWh decommissioning fee delivers $300 million plus interest {{at the end of the}} plant lifetime.|$|E
