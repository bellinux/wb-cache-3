25|$|Upadhyaya rejects Nehruvian {{economic}} policies and industrialization {{on the grounds}} that they were borrowed uncritically from the West, in disregard of the cultural and spiritual heritage of the country. There is a need, according to Upadhyaya, to strike a balance between the Indian and Western thinking in view of the dynamic nature of the society and the cultural heritage of the country. The Nehruvian model of economic development, emphasizing the increase of material wealth through rapid industrialization, promoted consumerism in Indian society. Not only has this ideology of development created social disparities and <b>regional</b> <b>imbalances</b> in economic growth, but it has failed to alleviate poverty in the country. The philosophy of integral humanism, like Gandhism, opposes unbridled consumerism, since such an ideology is alien to Indian culture. This traditional culture stresses putting restraints on one's desires and advocates contentment rather than ruthless pursuit of material wealth.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{governments of}} the [...] "liberal-conservative" [...] Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda (1998–2006) pursued {{policies}} of macroeconomic stabilization and market-oriented structural reforms. Nearly the entire economy has now been privatized, and foreign investment has picked up. Economic growth exceeded expectations in the early 2000s, despite recession in key export markets. In 2001 policies of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform led to spiraling unemployment. Unemployment peaked at 19.2% [...] (Eurostat regional indicators) in 2001 and though it has fallen to (depending on the methodology) 9.8%( [...] or 13.5% as of September 2006, it remains a problem. Solid domestic demand boosted economic growth to 4.1% in 2002. Strong export growth, in turn, pushed economic growth to a still-strong 4.2% in 2003 and 5.4% in 2004, despite a downturn in household consumption. Multiple reasons entailed a GDP growth of 6% in 2005. Headline consumer price inflation dropped from 26% in 1993 to an average rate of 7.5% in 2004, though this was boosted by hikes in subsidized utilities prices ahead of Slovakia's accession to the European Union. In July 2005, the inflation rate dropped to 2.0% and is projected at less than 3% in 2005 and 2.5% in 2006. In 2006, Slovakia reached the highest economic growth (8.9%) {{among the members of}} OECD and the third highest in the EU (just behind Estonia and Latvia). The country has had difficulties addressing <b>regional</b> <b>imbalances</b> in wealth and employment.

The EU official statistical assessment of <b>regional</b> economic development <b>imbalance</b> refers to the dispersion of regional GDP per inhabitant.

We determined a number of additional <b>regional</b> development <b>imbalance</b> indicators and tackeld the following research tasks: * analysis of general basics and formation of comprerensive indicator system for assessment of regional disparities and its trends in economic development; * empirical analysis of imbalance and its dynamics between economic development of EU member countries on the base of the comprehensive indicator system using GDP in market prices and PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) prices; * eliminating of the price change impact from assessments of <b>regional</b> economic development <b>imbalance</b> dynamics. Our results explain the absolute and relative <b>regional</b> development <b>imbalance</b> and its dynamics in 1996 - 2008 in EU as a whole and in "old" and "new" member state groups. <b>Regional</b> development <b>imbalances</b> point to improvement necessities of quantitative measurement of <b>regional</b> economic development <b>imbalance</b> and its dynamics...|$|R

It was estimated that the soudanian zone produced between 53 and 77% of Chad's total cereal production from 1976 to 1985, with the average falling in the 60- to 70-% range. But because the populations of the two regions were approximately equal, {{the lack of a}} good transport system and marketing mechanisms to allow the rapid transfer of the southern surplus to the northern zones was a constant problem.
