5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war, {{the militias}} of collaborationist {{political}} parties also began to participate actively in reprisals for attacks or assassinations by the resistance. These included both <b>reprisal</b> assassinations of leading figures suspected of resistance involvement or sympathy (including Alexandre Galopin, head of the Société Générale, who was assassinated in February 1944) or retaliatory massacres against civilians. Foremost among these was the Courcelles Massacre, a <b>reprisal</b> by Rexist paramilitaries for the assassination of a Burgomaster, in which 20 civilians were killed. A similar massacre also took place at Meensel-Kiezegem, where 67 were killed.|$|E
5|$|Marian {{finally agreed}} to play the part of Süß for fear of <b>reprisal</b> against members of his family. Marian had a {{daughter}} {{from his first marriage}} to the Jewish pianist, Irene Saager. The former husband of his second wife was also Jewish, making her son (and Marian's stepson) half-Jewish.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Belgian {{civilians were}} often subject to {{retaliation}} by paramilitaries and German forces for resistance activity. In August 1944, 20 {{civilians were killed}} by Rexist paramilitaries in a <b>reprisal</b> for a single attack on a Rexist politician in the Courcelles Massacre.|$|E

50|$|After 1945, as {{a result}} of the general {{prohibition}} on use of force imposed by Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter, armed <b>reprisals</b> in time of peace are no longer legal, but the possibility remains of non-armed <b>reprisals</b> (also known as countermeasures) as well as belligerent <b>reprisals</b> during hostilities when the law of international armed conflict (LOIAC) is violated.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of belligerent <b>reprisals,</b> apart from the three factors in the Naulila case, a warning must also be issued beforehand; once the other party has stopped {{violation}} of LOIAC, belligerent <b>reprisals</b> must also be terminated; and the decision to engage in belligerent <b>reprisals</b> must be taken by a competent authority. All four Geneva Conventions prohibit <b>reprisals</b> against, respectively, battlefield casualties, shipwreck survivors, prisoners of war, and protected persons (civilian or military), as well as certain buildings and property. An additional 1977 protocol extends this to cover historic monuments, works of art, and places of worship.|$|R

5|$|While it {{achieved}} {{successes and}} proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division {{earned a reputation}} for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone.

5|$|By 1972, the Portuguese {{military}} had changed its strategy, adapting the British/American search and destroy operations utilising small shock troop sweeps. They also initiated a {{hearts and minds}} campaign, named the Aldeamentos Programme, which was a forced relocation program. But on November 9, 1972, FRELIMO – not numbering more than 8,000 fighters – launched a large offensive in Tete Province. The response from the Portuguese military was fierce, leading to <b>reprisal</b> attacks {{in an attempt to}} unbalance the local population's continuing faith in FRELIMO.|$|E

Very soon, the Cretans formed resistance groups and in cooperation witn British SOE agents began to harass the German forces with considerable success till the end of the war.

In Madrid, the people attempted a rebellion against the French occupation which spread across Spain resulting in mass executions in <b>reprisal,</b> leading both the Portuguese and Spanish juntas (local administrations) to call on British support.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1904, Piłsudski formed a {{paramilitary}} unit (the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party, or bojówki) aiming to create an armed resistance movement against the Russian authorities.
