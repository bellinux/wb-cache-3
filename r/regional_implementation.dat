40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of the Mediterranean Fore-casting System (MFS) project, the performance of re-gional numerical ocean forecasting systems is assessed by means of model-model and model-data comparison. Three different operational systems considered in this study are: the Adriatic REGional Model (AREG); the Adri-atic Regional Ocean Modelling System (AdriaROMS) and the Mediterranean Forecasting System General Circulation Model (MFS-GCM). AREG and AdriaROMS are <b>regional</b> <b>implementations</b> (with some dedicated variations) of POM and ROMS, respectively, while MFS-GCM is an OPA based system. The assessment is done through standard scores. In situ and remote sensing data are used to evaluate the system performance.

Following {{in the footsteps of}} other successful global research programs, several nations and groups of nations brought together regional CoML stakeholders, such as researchers, government and non-government agencies, and resource managers, to assess the status of knowledge of marine biodiversity in their waters. These assessments led to the organization of National or <b>Regional</b> <b>Implementation</b> Committees (NRICs) to implement more local programs and improve the geographic scope of CoML and its projects. By engaging scientists, funding agencies, policy-makers and the broad user community, these national and regional committees identified their research and data priorities for marine biodiversity and find ways to make them happen by building partnerships, exploring funding opportunities for local science, and promoting CoML to local audiences. The committees worked under the umbrella of the CoML.|$|E

An Environment Canterbury commissioned discussion paper (Sinclair Knight Merz: The Future of Public Transport in Christchurch Discussion Paper, June 2004) concluded that priority should be given to bus-based public transport, but that future planning should include provision for other public transport options. A report commissioned in 2005 by Environment Canterbury from consultants GHD Limited (Network Level Investigative Report - Proposed Introduction of Commuter Rail Services to Christchurch City and Environs, June 2005) suggested that commuter rail would involve substantial costs and further investigation would be needed to determine what the requirements are.|$|E

One of the problems that often arises in the elderly is a cognitive impairment or dementia. Dementia is a condition where there is a decline in cognitive functions such as deterioration of memory and the power of thought that affect daily activities. The purpose of this research was to find out the level of dementia in elderly at <b>Regional</b> Technical <b>Implementation</b> Unit (UPTD) of Rumoh Aceh Geunaseh Sayang in Ulee Kareng of Banda Aceh in 2016. This research used descriptive research design with total population of 70 people and samples were collected by using total sampling technique. Instrument used were questionnaires and guided interview. Data were collected on June 23 to 28, 2016. The result of univariate analysis showed that elderly with mild dementia were 19 people (27. 1 %), with moderate dementia were 29 people (41. 4 %), with severe dementia were 14 people (20. 0 %) and without dementia were 8 people (11. 4 %). It can be concluded that a majority the elderly at <b>Regional</b> Technical <b>Implementation</b> Unit (UPTD) of Rumoh Aceh Geunaseh Sayang in Ulee Kareng of Banda Aceh had moderate dementia. Based on the results of the research, the researcher suggests the caregivers in the nursing home provide and support the needs of elderly with dementia. The possible strategies to provide more effective support are by providing nursing care in caring for the elderly with dementia and facilitating the elderly to do brain gymnastics effectively and regularly to reduce the occurrence of dementia.
