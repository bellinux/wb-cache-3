40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} were to 1) examine the ecological adaptability of Potentilla acaulis to grassland degradation {{from the perspective}} of <b>root</b> architecture, 2) reveal why it can be a dominant species in extremely degraded grassland and 3) discuss its important roles in vegetation restoration or succession and preventing grassland fromdesertification. Methods We collected relatively complete P. acaulis <b>roots</b> by trenching. The numbers of first vertical <b>roots,</b> length of horizontal <b>root</b> tillering and number of plant tillers were recorded in the field. The <b>root</b> analysis system of WinRHIZO was used to determine total <b>root</b> length, <b>root</b> surface area, total <b>root</b> volume, <b>root</b> average diameter, number of furcations, average branching angle, number of <b>root</b> axes, length of <b>root</b> axes, number of <b>root</b> tips, number of first lateral <b>roots,</b> length of first lateral <b>roots,</b> number of secondary lateral <b>roots,</b> length of secondary lateral <b>roots,</b> <b>root</b> diameters along <b>root</b> length, <b>root</b> surface area and <b>root</b> volume. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis. Important findings In degraded grassland typified by Stipa grandis, the function of P. acaulis became more important in the community and its <b>root</b> range, <b>root</b> depth, the number of first vertical <b>roots,</b> the number of plant tillers and the length of horizontal <b>root</b> tillering increased significantly. The parameters of <b>root</b> surface area, length of secondary lateral <b>roots,</b> total <b>root</b> length and the number of furcations explained the adaptability of P. acaulis to grassland degradation. <b>Roots</b> with a diameter < 2 mm had a significant effect on <b>root</b> surface area and total <b>root</b> length of single plants of P. acaulis.

Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds.

40|$|The <b>root</b> cap is {{increasingly}} appreciated {{as a complex}} and dynamic plant organ. <b>Root</b> caps sense and transmit environmental signals, synthesize and secrete small molecules and macromolecules, and in some species shed metabolically active cells. However, {{it is not known}} whether <b>root</b> caps are essential for normal shoot and <b>root</b> development. We report the identification of a <b>root</b> cap-specific promoter and describe its use to genetically ablate <b>root</b> caps by directing <b>root</b> cap-specific expression of a diphtheria toxin A-chain gene. Transgenic toxin-expressing plants are viable and have normal aerial parts but agravitropic <b>roots,</b> implying loss of <b>root</b> cap function.

Although the radial organization of the <b>roots</b> is normal in toxin-expressing plants, the <b>root</b> tips have fewer cytoplasmically dense cells than do wild-type <b>root</b> tips, suggesting that <b>root</b> meristematic activity is lower in transgenic than in wild-type plants. The <b>roots</b> of transgenic plants have more lateral <b>roots</b> and these are, in turn, more highly branched than those of wild-type plants. Thus, <b>root</b> cap ablation alters <b>root</b> architecture both by inhibiting <b>root</b> meristematic activity and by stimulating lateral <b>root</b> initiation.

5|$|Moroccan {{collections}} {{under the}} cork oak (Quercus suber) that were initially regarded as B.aereus {{were described as}} a separate species—Boletus mamorensis—in 1978, {{on the basis of}} a rufous chestnut cap and a <b>rooting</b> stipe, or stem, with a reticulation often limited to the top (apex). In 2010 however, molecular phylogenetic studies by Bryn Dentinger and colleagues placed these collections close to B.aereus, likely suggesting an ecological variant or subspecies rather than a distinct species. American mycologist Harry Thiers reported Boletus aereus from California in 1975; however, a taxonomic revision of western North American porcini boletes in 2008 formally established them as a separate species, Boletus regineus. These differ from B.aereus by nature of their more gelatinous cap skin (pileipellis), and belong in a different porcini lineage.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly <b>rooting</b> for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E
30|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>root</b> systems in plants, defined by their {{developmental}} origin and branching patterns: taproot systems and fibrous <b>root</b> systems. The taproot system occurs in dicot plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and pea (Pisum sativa), while fibrous <b>root</b> systems occur in monocots such as rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays) (Atkinson et al. 2014). In taproot systems, the primary <b>root</b> is the main <b>root,</b> and branching consists of secondary, smaller lateral <b>roots</b> (LRs) and <b>root</b> hairs. A fibrous <b>root</b> system, by contrast, consists of a dense mass of adventitious <b>roots</b> (also called crown <b>roots</b> in cereals) that arise from the stem, which are distinct from the primary <b>root,</b> LRs, and <b>root</b> hairs (Coudert et al. 2010). Because the primary <b>root</b> (embryonic <b>root)</b> dies as the monocots age, the adventitious <b>roots</b> are the main <b>root</b> tissues in the fibrous <b>root</b> system of monocot plants.|$|R
30|$|Later, {{adventitious}} postembryonic crown <b>roots,</b> {{also called}} nodal <b>roots,</b> {{emerge from the}} nodes on the stem and tillers arranged {{in one or two}} rows (Fig.  1 b). For example, more than 100 crown <b>roots</b> are present 40  days after germination in cv Nipponbare plants grown under hydroponic conditions, forming a fibrous <b>root</b> system (Fig.  1 b). <b>Root</b> ramification is also partially responsible for this fibrous architecture. Indeed, lateral rice <b>roots</b> can appear on any primary <b>root,</b> including embryonic and crown <b>roots,</b> and can be classified into two main anatomical types [77] (Fig.  1 a, c). Thin small lateral <b>roots</b> exhibiting determinate growth are by far the most numerous (Fig.  1 a). A few large lateral <b>roots,</b> which are thinner in diameter than primary <b>roots,</b> can also be observed. They display indeterminate growth and can also bear small lateral <b>roots</b> (Fig.  1 c). Moreover, the small lateral <b>roots</b> elongate laterally, whereas the large lateral <b>roots</b> elongate downward, suggesting that the small lateral <b>roots</b> do not respond to gravity. Higher orders of branching can also be observed in the large lateral <b>roots</b> of the crown <b>roots</b> that emerge at later growth stages [55]. Small lateral <b>roots</b> exhibit determinate growth and never bear lateral <b>roots,</b> whereas all other <b>root</b> types have indeterminate growth and bear numerous lateral <b>roots,</b> suggesting a different function for these two types of lateral <b>roots.</b>|$|R

Here we provide first insights into <b>root</b> hair {{development for the}} diverse <b>root</b> types of rice grown under different conditions, and show the first in situ images of rice <b>root</b> hairs in intact soil. <b>Roots</b> of plants grown in upland fields produced short <b>root</b> hairs that showed little responsiveness to P deficiency, and had a higher <b>root</b> hair density in the high P condition. These results were reproducible in rhizoboxes under greenhouse conditions. Synchrotron-based in situ analysis of <b>root</b> hairs in intact soil further confirmed this pattern of <b>root</b> hair formation. In contrast, plants grown in nutrient solution produced more and longer <b>root</b> hairs in low P conditions, but these were unequally distributed among the different <b>root</b> types.
