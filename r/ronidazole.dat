50|$|<b>Ronidazole</b> is {{currently}} not FDA approved in companion animals and banned {{for use in}} food-producing animals outside the United States due to human hazard. Because of this, veterinarians are advised to obtain informed consent prior to use of this drug in cats. Because is not FDA approved, its usage would be considered an off-label use.

5000|$|One {{treatment}} {{that has been}} effective in experimentally infected cats is <b>ronidazole.</b> (Note “experimentally,” therefore it is unknown exactly how the treatment would act in the field.) Neurotoxicity has occurred in some cats treated with ronidazole; sign include lethargy, ataxia, seizures, etc. These side effects usually resolve when the drug is withdrawn immediately; however, if the treatment is not withdraw for a couple weeks, resulting in costly and intensive emergency veterinary care.|$|E
50|$|Cats {{need to be}} {{monitored}} closely while on <b>ronidazole.</b> One good way to monitor if the cat suffers from the neurotoxic side effects is to engage the cat each day in a playful activity that involves coordination and agility (playing with laser point).

Continuing treatment after signs of toxicity is dangerous and life-threatening to the cat.|$|E
40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus is a flagellated {{protozoan}} parasite {{of domestic}} cats that {{resides in the}} lu-men of the colon and causes colitis and chronic, foul-smelling diarrhea. 1, 2 The infection is prevalent among cattery cats, 3 in which transmission via the fecal-oral route is suspected. Infected cats may have persistent diarrhea for up to 2 years and can remain infected for life. 4 The susceptibility of trichomonads to 5 -nitro-imidazole antiprotozoan drugs is caused by reduc-tive pathways that convert these drugs into autotoxic free-radical metabolites. 5, 6 Treatment of feline T foe-tus infection with metronidazole, a 5 -nitroimidazole drug, has not been successful. Cats treated with met-ronidazole have transient improvement in diarrhea but remain infected with the organism. 4, 7 A related nitroimidazole, <b>ronidazole,</b> is effective in eradicating infection from experimentally infected cats {{on the basis of}} PCR assay results. 8 Unfortunately, <b>ronidazole</b> is not approved by the FDA or commercially avail-able in the United States.

40|$|Abstract. The minimal {{inhibitory}} {{concentrations of}} carbadox, dimetridazole, lincomycin, <b>ronidazole,</b> and tiamulin against isolates of Treponema hyodysenteriae and Treponema innocens {{were determined by}} an agar-dilution method. The results obtained indicated that tiamulin was the most effective antimicrobial in vitro against T. hyodysenteriae, followed by carbadox. Dimetridazole, lincomycin, and <b>ronidazole</b> had poor efficacy in vitro against the T. hyodysenteriae isolates. Isolates of T. innocens were {{more sensitive to the}} various antimicrobials. Carbadox and tiamulin were the most effective in vitro, followed by <b>ronidazole,</b> dimetridazole, and lincomycin. Swine dysentery is an enteric disease of major eco-nomic importance in most countries where intensive swine rearing is practiced. The disease can occur in acute form with severe hemorrhagic diarrhea occa-sionally leading to death or as a more chronic form with soft mucoid feces.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>ronidazole</b> for treatment of Tritrichomonas foetus infection, 6 Tritrichomonas-free kittens were experimentally infected with a Korean isolate of T. foetus. The experimental infection was confirmed by direct microscopy, culture, and single-tube nested PCR, and all cats demonstrated trophozoites of T. foetus by day 20 post-infection in the feces. From day 30 after the experimentally induced infection, 3 cats were treated with <b>ronidazole</b> (50 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days) and 3 other cats received placebo. Feces from each cat were tested {{for the presence of}} T. foetus by direct smear and culture of rectal swab samples using modified Diamond's medium once a week for 4 weeks. To confirm the culture results, the presence of T. foetus rRNA gene was determined by single-tube nested PCR assay. All 3 cats in the treatment group receiving <b>ronidazole</b> showed negative results for T. foetus infection during 2 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks follow-up by all detection methods used in this study. In contrast, rectal swab samples from cats in the control group were positive for T. foetus continuously throughout the study.

40|$|Objectives The aims of {{the study}} were to {{determine}} the in vitro drug release of guar gum-coated capsules of <b>ronidazole,</b> and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of this formulation for the treatment of cats naturally infected with Tritrichomonas foetus. Methods The pharmacokinetics of <b>ronidazole</b> were evaluated in five healthy cats and five cats infected with T foetus. In a second step, the clinical efficacy of these capsules was evaluated by a controlled, randomised, double-blind clinical trial performed in 47 infected cats from French catteries. In this study, cats were randomly allocated to either the <b>ronidazole</b> treatment group (n = 25) or a placebo group (n = 22). <b>Ronidazole</b> (30 mg/kg) q 24 h for 14 days was administered to the treated cats. After 14 days of treatment, the presence of T foetus was tested by conventional PCR assay. Results In the pharmacokinetic study, a delayed peak plasma concentration was observed in healthy and infected cats, with no significant difference between these two groups (mean geometric mean of 9 h for time to maximum plasma concentration [T-max], 21. 6 mu g/ml for time to maximum plasma concentration [C-max] and 467. 4 g/h/ml for the area under the curve [AUC] in healthy cats; and 9. 4 h for T-max, 17. 1 mu g/ml for C-max and 481 g/h/ml for AUC in infected cats). In the clinical trial, T foetus was detected in 16 % of cats from the treated group and 82 % of cats from the placebo group {{at the end of the}} study (P < 0. 001). No clinical signs of adverse drug reactions were observed. Conclusions and relevance Oral administration of guar gum-coated capsules of <b>ronidazole</b> at a dose of 30 mg/kg once daily for 14 days delays the peak plasma concentration and eradicates infection in most cases...|$|E
40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} did not recur {{during a}} nine week period after withdrawal of medication in swine fed <b>ronidazole</b> {{at a level}} of 60 parts per million of feed for ten weeks or fed either carbadox at 55 ppm or lincomycin at 110 ppm of feed for six weeks. During this period swine dysentery was neither transmitted to accompanying sentinels after the withdrawal of the above medication or was Treponema hyodysenteriae isolated and cultured or observed in stained smears from rectal swabs and feces or from colonic scrapings at necropsy. Beginning three weeks after the withdrawal of medication, all swine were fed sodium arsanilate at a concentration of 220 ppm of feed for three weeks in an attempt to excite the carrier of swine dysentery into developing a swine dysentery diarrhea. A swine dysentery diarrhea did recur during the feeding of sodium arsanilate in swine previously fed <b>ronidazole</b> {{at a level of}} 60 ppm of feed for only six weeks. It was concluded: that swine dysentery was probably eliminated with the feeding of <b>ronidazole</b> for the longer duration and with the feeding of carbadox and lincomycin and that sodium arsanilate was of value in identifying the carrier state...|$|E

40|$|Infections {{with the}} {{intestinal}} protozoan parasite Giardia in {{dogs and cats}} are common. Clinical signs vary from asymptomatic to small bowel diarrhea and associated discomfort. The control of infections in dogs is frequently a frustrating issue for animal owners and veterinarians. Drugs with antiprotozoal activity such as fenbendazole and metronidazole are recommended, however, they do not show 100 % efficacy and superinfections occur regularly. <b>Ronidazole</b> is currently the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} Tritrichomonas foetus in cats and there is now limited information available about its efficacy against Giardia spp. In the kennel investigated, dogs regularly showed loose feces and the presence of Giardia (assemblage C, renamed as G. canis) cysts. An elimination strategy of this parasite involving strict hygiene management and disinfection of the enclosures with 4 -chlorine-M-cresol, oral treatment with <b>ronidazole</b> (30 - 50 mg/kg BW bid for 7 days) and two shampooings (containing chlorhexidine) at {{the beginning and the end}} of the treatments was implemented for a group of 6 dogs. As a control another group of 7 dogs was transferred to the disinfected enclosures and shampooed, but left untreated. Dog feces were tested for the presence of Giardia cysts (SAF concentration technique) or Giardia antigen with a commercial ELISA (NOVITEC(®)) and a quick immunochromatography-based test (SensPERT(®)) before and between 5 and 40 days after the last treatment. All ronidazole-treated dogs were negative for Giardia cysts and antigen up to 26 days after the last treatment, while between 1 and 5 of the control animals tested positive in each of the test series. At this point, also dogs of the control group were again moved into clean enclosures, shampooed twice and treated with <b>ronidazole.</b> Five, 12 and 19 days after the last treatment, the dogs in the control group tested negative for Giardia cysts and antigen. However, all animals had again positive results at later time points in at least one of the three applied diagnostic techniques within 33 - 61 days after treatment. Furthermore, all dogs had episodes of diarrhea (for 1 - 4 days) within 14 - 31 days after treatment and unformed feces during the whole experiment. The positive effect of <b>ronidazole</b> against Giardia infections in dogs could be confirmed in this study. In particular, the combination of <b>ronidazole</b> treatment combined with the disinfection of the environment and shampooing of the dogs was highly effective in reducing Giardia cyst excretion and may therefore constitute an alternative control strategy for canine giardiosis...|$|E

40|$|Case series summary Infection of the {{domestic}} cat by Tritrichomonas blagburni, previously referred to as T foetus, {{may lead to a}} disease called feline trichomonosis, which manifests clinically as large bowel diarrhoea. The disease has a wide geographical distribution, including numerous countries in Europe, North America and Australia/Oceania. Nevertheless, it has occasionally been reported in Asia, South Korea and Japan. A retrospective study was carried out to include all domestic cats with diarrhoea, presented to two veterinary clinics in Hong Kong, China, between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2014. A total of 29 cats with diarrhoea were diagnosed with Tritrichomonas species infection by means of quantitative PCR and direct microscopy. Tritrichomonas species was more frequently found in young (median age 10 months), male (66 %) and purebred cats (86 %). Giardia species was found in 31 % of Tritrichomonas species-positive cats. The recommended dose of <b>ronidazole</b> (30 mg/kg q 24 h for 14 days) resolved clinical signs in 83 % of diagnosed cats. Relevance and novel information This case series describes Tritrichomonas species as a cause for feline chronic diarrhoea in cats in China. The high rate of failure (17 %) in those cats receiving a standard regimen of <b>ronidazole</b> might be due to owner or patient compliance rather than protozoal resistance to the drug...|$|E
40|$|Dientamoeba fragilis is a {{commonly}} encountered trichomonad {{which has been}} implicated {{as a cause of}} gastrointestinal disease in humans. Despite the frequency of reports recording infections with this parasite, little research has been undertaken in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on four clinical strains of D. fragilis, designated A, E, M, and V, respectively. Molecular testing followed, and all strains were determined to be genotype 1. The activities of antiprotozoal compounds at concentrations ranging from 2 μg/ml to 500 μg/ml were determined via cell counts of D. fragilis trophozoites grown in dixenic culture. Minimum lethal concentrations (MLCs) were as follows: ornidazole, 8 to 16 μg/ml; <b>ronidazole,</b> 8 to 16 μg/ml; tinidazole, 31 μg/ml; metronidazole, 31 μg/ml; secnidazole, 31 to 63 μg/ml; nitazoxanide, 63 μg/ml; tetracycline, 250 μg/ml; furazolidone, 250 to 500 μg/ml; iodoquinol, 500 μg/ml; paromomycin, 500 μg/ml; and diloxanide furoate, > 500 μg/ml.

40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} cause of chronic diarrhoea in young cats. Up until recently, there was no effective treatment for T. foetus infection in cats. Recently, they have found that <b>ronidazole</b> (30 - 50 mg/kg q 24 h) for 14 days results in longterm elimination of T. foetus infection. Because of the serious adverse effects of <b>ronidazole,</b> a successfully diagnostic method is very important. The specific aims of the present study were to compare the different diagnostic methods (PCR at feces, fecal culture in the In Pouch TF® medium and PCR at In Pouch TF® medium), to determine the detection limits of our PCR and to determine the shedding pattern of the parasite through longitudinal follow­up study of infected cats. Based on the results of our study, we can conclude that PCR at In Pouch TF® medium is the most sensitive diagnostic method for detection of a T. foetus infection. Based on a comparison of the different diagnostic methods, we concluded a relative efficacy for the detection of T. foetus organisms to be as follows: PCR at feces < fecal culture in In Pouch TF® medium < PCR at In Pouch TF® medium. Results of our longitudinal follow­up study have shown that we can not detect T. foetus by PCR assay in all collected fecal samples and that we can speak of intermittent shedding of the parasite in measurable levels by PCR at feces.

40|$|OVERVIEW: Tritrichomonas foetus is a {{protozoan}} organism that {{is specific}} to cats {{and can cause}} large bowel diarrhoea. It is distinct from other Tritrichomonas species and {{not considered to be}} zoonotic. Infection is most common in young cats from multicat households, particularly pedigree breeding catteries. DISEASE SIGNS: Affected cats show frequent fetid diarrhoea, often with mucus, fresh blood and straining, but generally remain bright and do not lose weight. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of infection is usually based on direct microscopic examination of freshly voided faeces. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is more sensitive but may detect infections unrelated to diarrhoea and, therefore, requires care in interpretation. TREATMENT: The treatment of choice is <b>ronidazole,</b> which should be used with care as it is an unlicensed drug for cats with a narrow safety margin. Clinical signs are generally self-limiting in untreated cases, but may take months to resolve...|$|E

40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of fourteen prohibited medicinal additives in pig and poultry compound feed. These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in medicated feed. Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation.

Of particular concern is the aquatic contamination {{caused by the}} increasing use of antibiotics, which could give rise to superbugs. While researchers have mainly focused on improving the adsorption capacity of mostly activated carbon-based adsorbents, we have developed a non-conventional adsorbent (SiC nanoparticles) in the present work for the adsorptive removal of four different nitroimidazole antibiotics, namely metronidazole (MNZ), dimetridazole (DMZ), <b>ronidazole</b> (RNZ), and tinidazole (TNZ). In addition to the unique properties which are inherent to SiC, the present adsorbent not only possesses a high adsorption capacity, but also shows one of the highest adsorption rates; both of which are prerequisites for an efficient and cost-effective adsorption-based separation technology. Silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles, synthesized by a microwave-assisted method, were thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The adsorption isotherm data were accurately described by the Langmuir isotherm model.

40|$|Abstract Background Tritrichomonas foetus is an {{emergent}} {{and important}} enteric pathogen of cats, which causes prolonged diarrhoea in cats. Case presentation This study describes a T. foetus infection in a seven-month-old, entire male domestic shorthair kitten with a six-month history of persistent large intestinal diarrhoea, faecal incontinence, prostration, apathy and weight loss. Parasites were microscopically observed and confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Molecular analyses {{were carried out}} comparing the sequence obtained in this study with T. foetus and T. suis. Retrieved from GenBank. After treatment with <b>ronidazole,</b> the cat showed resolution of clinical signs. Conclusions This is the first clinical case of T. foetus infection in a chronic diarrheic cat in Brazil and South America, confirming {{the presence of this}} pathogen {{in this part of the}} world and highlighting the importance of this protozoa being considered in the differential diagnosis of cats presenting diarrhoea of the large intestine. Our case report enriches our knowledge on the geographical distribution of T. foetus in cats in Brazil and provides further understanding of the clinical significance of feline intestinal trichomoniasis in this country.

40|$|AbstractGiardia lamblia (syn. duodenalis, intestinalis) is a {{globally}} occurring micro-aerophilic human parasite {{that causes}} gastrointestinal disease. Standard treatment of G. lamblia infections {{is based on}} the 5 -nitroimidazole drugs metronidazole and tinidazole. In two other micro-aerophilic parasites, Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis, 5 -nitroimidazole drugs bind to proteins involved in the thioredoxin-mediated redox network and disrupt the redox equilibrium by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase and depleting intracellular thiol pools. The major aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether nitroimidazoles exert a similar toxic effect on G. lamblia physiology. The 5 -nitroimidazoles metronidazole and tinidazole were found to bind to the same subset of proteins including thioredoxin reductase. However, in contrast to E. histolytica and T. vaginalis, none of the other proteins bound are candidates for being involved in the thioredoxin-mediated redox network. Translation elongation factor EF- 1 γ, an essential factor in protein synthesis, was widely degraded upon treatment with 5 -nitroimidazoles. 2 -Nitroimidazole (azomycin) and the 5 -nitroimidazole <b>ronidazole</b> did not bind to any G. lamblia proteins, which is in contrast to previous findings in E. histolytica and T. vaginalis. All nitroimidazoles tested reduced intracellular thiol pools in G. lamblia, but metronidazole, also in contrast to the situation in the other two parasites, had the slightest effect. Taken together, our results suggest that nitroimidazole drugs affect G. lamblia in a fundamentally different way than E. histolytica and T. vaginalis...|$|E
40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus is the causative {{agent in}} {{intestinal}} feline infections. The current treatment, <b>ronidazole</b> (Rz), {{is the only}} 5 -nitroimidazole (5 -NI) drug shown {{to have an effect}} against T. foetus; however it has been observed to be less than 70 % effective. We, therefore, aimed to develop upon compounds that had a more potent efficacy against clinically isolated strains of T. foetus. In doing so, we screened a library of 630 5 -NI compounds, 52 (8 %) were found to be more effective than Rz in multiple strains in vitro. We developed a novel murine model of T. foetus infection to expand upon the efficacy of the compounds under in vivo conditions. Elucidating various parameters, antibiotic conditioning was observed to be an effective method in generating a sustainable T. foetus colonization. The infection was characterized by a high population of T. foetus within the cecum as well as histological evidence showing a host inflammatory response. Selected compounds which showed superior activity in vitro; were examined in our newly established in vivo model, providing a useful tool in understanding the pharmacokinetics within the host. One compound demonstrated effective capabilities in reducing and inhibiting the growth of T. foetus. This compound can be our lead for further development as a potential chemotherapeutic drug against intestinal T. foetus infectio...|$|E
40|$|Trichomonas gallinae, {{the cause}} of avian trichomonosis, is most {{commonly}} found in the order Columbiformes. Racing pigeons are often treated preventively with nitro-imidazoles which {{could result in the}} emergence of resistant isolates, and these isolates can be a treath to wildlife when exchanges occur. The sequence type of 16 T. gallinae isolates obtained from racing pigeons and 15 isolates from wild pigeons was determined based on the ITS 1 / 5. 8 S rRNA/ITS 2 region sequence. In addition, the resistance profiles of these isolates against five different nitro-imidazoles (metronidazole, dimetridazole, <b>ronidazole,</b> tinidazole and carnidazole) were determined. Two different Trichomonas sequence types were isolated. Sequence type A isolates were recovered from racing and wild pigeons, in contrast to sequence type B which was only isolated from wild pigeons. Isolates with sequence type B were all susceptible to the tested nitro-imidazoles, except for tinidazole-resistance in 3 isolates. Resistance to the nitro-imidazoles was observed more frequently in isolates obtained from racing pigeons than from wild pigeons, with most isolates belonging to sequence type A. A higher percentage of the sequence type A isolated from racing pigeons, in comparison with those isolated from the wild pigeons, were resistant to the nitro-imidazoles and displayed higher mean lethal concentration (MLC) values. Two isolates belonging to sequence type A, 1 recovered from a racing pigeon and 1 from a wild pigeon, displayed a similar resistance pattern, suggesting a potential exchange of resistant isolates between racing pigeons and wild pigeons...|$|E
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} - electrospray ionisation - tamdem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous detection and quantitation of 5 -notroimidazole veterinary drugs in lyophilised pork meat, the chosen format {{of a candidate}} certified reference material, has been developed and validated. Six analytes {{have been included in}} the scope of validation, i. e. dimetridazole, DMZ, metronidazole, MNZ, <b>ronidazole,</b> RNZ, hydroxy metronidazole, MNZOH, hydroxy ipronidazole, IPZOH, and 2 -hydroxymethyl- 1 -methyl- 5 -nitroimidazole, HMMNI. The analytes were extracted from the sample with ethyl acetate, chromatographically separated on a C 18 column, and finally identified and quantified by tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using matrix-matched calibration and d 3 -labelled analogues of the analytes (except for MNZOH, where d 3 -MNZ was used). The method was validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, by determining selectivity, linearity, matrix effect, apparent recovery, repeatability and intermediate precision, decision limits and detection capabilities, robustness of sample preparation method, and stability of extracts. Recovery at 1 ug/kg level was at 100 % (estimates in the range of 101 - 107 %) for all analytes, repeatabilities and intermedicate precisions at this level were in the range of 4 - 12 % and 2 - 9 %, respectively. Linearity of calibration curves in the working range 0. 5 - 10 ug/kg was confirmed, with r values typically > 0. 99. Decision limits (CCa) and the detection capabilities (CCß) according to ISO 11843 - 2 (calibration curve approach) were 0. 29 - 0. 44 and 0. 36 - 0. 54 ug/kg, respectively. The method reliably identifies and quantifies the selected nitroimidazoles in the reconstituted pork meat in the low and sub ug/kg range and will be applied in an interlaboratory comparison for determining the mass fraction of the selected nitroimidazoles in the candidate reference material currently developed at IRMM.

30|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} (mAb) has higher specificity {{and better}} repeatability than polyclonal antibody. Therefore, {{it is more}} suitable for the detection of the substance of a particular structure. By virtue of benefits drawn from their specific, sensitive, rapid, simple, and high-throughput characters, mAbs can be widely used in practical testing. Despite being useful, it also has some disadvantages. The approaches for preparing antibodies are mostly empirical and guided by nonstandardized protocols and individual experience [46]. During the experiment, great care has to be exercised to dilution factors and cultivation conditions {{such as the use of}} feeder cells [47]. Moreover, screening for single hybridoma cell clones that produce high-quality antibody is mainly done by ELISA. When using this method to isolate target cells, a large number of cells would be lost. This makes the whole process extremely time consuming and labor intensive [48]. Furthermore, the characteristic of antibody is vulnerable to be impacted by the feature of antigen. For example, the extent and yield of the antigen against protein’s chemical conjugation may be very important to mAb. Acevedo et al. [49] proved that combining double-chemically modified carrier proteins with hetero-functional crosslinkers allows preparing tailor-made hapten protein carrier conjugates. Wang et al. [50] prepared a generic mAb and developed a sensitive ic-ELISA for detecting phenothiazines in animal feed. The limit of detections of the method ranged from 1.1 to 15.3  μg/kg. Han et al. [51] produced an mAb with broad specificity to nitroimidazoles, dimetridazole, ipronidazole, <b>ronidazole</b> hydroxydimetridazole, and hydroxyipronidazole, with the IC 50 values of 4.79, 0.47, 5.97, 23.48, and 15.03  μg/L, respectively. Peng et al. [52] used arsanilic acid as a hapten, and produced the suitable mAb for simultaneously determining organoarsenic compounds including nitarsone, carbarsone, and arsanilic acid in animal tissue and feed.|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of eleven nitroimidazoles and also chloramphenicol in milk and honey samples. These compounds are classified as A 6 compounds in annex IV of council regulation 2377 / 90 and therefore prohibited for the use in animal husbandry. Milk samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of NaCl, while honey samples are first dissolved in water before a similar extraction. Honey extracts undergo a hexane wash to remove impurities. Both milk and honey extracts are evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. These are then injected onto an LC-MS/MS system and analysed in less than 9 minutes. The MS/MS is operated in MRM mode with positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and is capable of analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, <b>ronidazole,</b> ipronidazole and there hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI and IPZ-OH. The method is also able to analyse for carnidazole, ornidazole, ternidazole, tinidazole and chloramphenicol. A level of 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 (RL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ has been recommended by the community reference laboratory responsible for this substance group and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A minimum required performance level of 0. 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect. For nitroimidazoles the decision limits (CC) and detection capabilities (CC) range from 0. 41 to 1. 55 μg L- 1 and 0. 70 to 2. 64 μg L- 1 respectively in milk and from 0. 38 to 1. 16 μg kg- 1 and 0. 66 to 1. 98 μg kg- 1 respectively in honey. For chloramphenicol the values are 0. 07 and 0. 11 μg L- 1 in milk and 0. 08 and 0. 13 μg kg- 1 in honey. Validation criteria of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes in both matrices...|$|E
