25|$|From {{the early}} 1840s until the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, the cost of slaves had been rising steadily. Meanwhile, the price of cotton was experiencing market fluctuations typical of raw commodities. After the Panic of 1857, the price of cotton fell while the price of slaves continued its steep rise. At the 1858 Southern commercial convention, William L. Yancey of Alabama called for the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> the African slave trade. Only the delegates from the states of the Upper South, who profited from the domestic trade, opposed the <b>reopening</b> <b>of</b> the slave trade since they saw it as a potential form <b>of</b> <b>competition.</b> The convention in 1858 wound up voting to recommend the repeal of all laws against slave imports, despite some reservations.|$|R
