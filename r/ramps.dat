5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit <b>ramps</b> connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn <b>ramps</b> and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several <b>ramps</b> have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The <b>ramps</b> from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these <b>ramps,</b> the project will also add four <b>ramps</b> to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ramp</b> {{shooters}} are robots {{that use}} {{the height of the}} <b>ramp</b> to greatly reduce the distance that they must propel the ball. <b>Ramp</b> shooters drive up to their wall and fire balls through a high-mounted shooting mechanism that is statically aimed directly at the goal. <b>Ramp</b> shooters have a disadvantage from floor shooters as they must traverse the <b>ramp,</b> risking tipping, and can only shoot from one location {{directly in front of the}} goal. Defense against a <b>ramp</b> shooter is simply to sit in position on top of the <b>ramp,</b> or keep them from getting up the <b>ramp.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Ramp</b> meters {{are special}} traffic signals {{at the end}} of a freeway on-ramp that {{regulate}} the flow of traffic onto the mainline. The main purpose of <b>ramp</b> meters is to keep the mainline of the freeway from becoming overly congested, and to maximize the efficient use of freeway capacity. The first use of <b>ramp</b> metering was in Chicago, in 1963, and today <b>ramp</b> meters are becoming more popular in both the US and in Europe. Although the original <b>ramp</b> metering controllers used pre-timed <b>ramp</b> meters, nearly all modern <b>ramp</b> metering algorithms are traffic responsive. Traffic responsive <b>ramp</b> meters can be divided into two categories: local or coordinated. Local <b>ramp</b> metering algorithms only take into account traffic conditions near a single <b>ramp,</b> while coordinated algorithms try to optimize traffic over an area. Four algorithms are evaluated in this thesis...|$|R

5|$|MD32 {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-97 and MD3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD32 starts {{as a pair}} of two-lane flyover <b>ramps</b> that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD32 <b>ramps</b> head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of the northern end of MD3. After passing through its interchange with MD3, MD32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes {{to the north of the}} community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound <b>ramps</b> of MD32 that is unsigned MD32AA. The eastbound <b>ramps</b> connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD170 (Telegraph Road) and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{difference}} of <b>ramp</b> directions, <b>ramp</b> events can be generally divided into two basic types: up-ramp and down-ramp [6]. The characteristic of the up-ramps is sharply increasing. Strong low pressure air systems (or cyclones), low-level jets, thunderstorms, wind gusts or similar atmospheric phenomena will induce up-ramps [7]. Likewise when the wind power suddenly drops or high speed gusts of wind make wind turbines reach cut-out limits (usually 22 ~ 25 m/s), wind turbines would be shut down for protecting themselves from damages. All this phenomena could induce down-ramps [8]. Down-ramps are the reverse physical process of up-ramps [9]. Based on the property of each <b>ramp</b> event, <b>ramp</b> events are parameterized by the following variables: <b>ramp</b> start time, <b>ramp</b> duration, <b>ramp</b> rate, <b>ramp</b> swing, and <b>ramp</b> end time.|$|R

40|$|<b>Ramp</b> {{meters in}} the Twin Cities {{have been the}} subject of a recent test of their effectiveness, {{involving}} turning them off for 8 weeks. This paper analyzes the results with and without <b>ramp</b> metering for several representative freeways during the afternoon peak period, depending on data availability. Seven performance measures: accessibility, mobility, equity, productivity, consumer surplus, travel time variation and travel demand responses are compared. It is found that <b>ramp</b> meters are particularly helpful for long trips relative to short trips. On Route 169, trips more than 3 exits in length benefit, while those 3 exits or less are hurt by <b>ramp</b> meters. <b>Ramp</b> metering, while generally beneficial to freeway segments, may not improve trip travel times (including <b>ramp</b> delays). Travel time variation is reduced as another benefit from <b>ramp</b> meters. Non-work trips and work trips do respond to <b>ramp</b> meters, but via different ways. The results are mixed, suggesting a more refined <b>ramp</b> control algorithm which explicitly considers <b>ramp</b> delay is in order...|$|R
40|$|Receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (<b>Ramp</b> 2) is a {{single-pass}} {{transmembrane protein}} that heterodimerizes with several family B G-protein coupled receptors {{to alter their}} function. <b>Ramp</b> 2 has been primarily characterized in association with calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Calcrl, CLR), forming the canonical receptor complex for the endocrine peptide adrenomedullin (Adm, AM). However, we previously demonstrated that <b>Ramp</b> 2 +/- female mice display a constellation of endocrine-related phenotypes that are distinct from those of Adm+/- and Calcrl+/- mice, implying that <b>RAMP</b> 2 has physiological functions beyond its canonical complex. Here, we localize <b>Ramp</b> 2 expression in the mouse placenta, finding that <b>Ramp</b> 2 is robustly expressed in the fetal labyrinth layer, and then characterize the effects of loss of <b>Ramp</b> 2 on placental development. Consistent with the expression pattern of <b>Ramp</b> 2 in the placenta, <b>Ramp</b> 2 -/- placentas have a thinner labyrinth layer with significantly fewer trophoblast cells secondary {{to a reduction in}} trophoblast proliferation. We also find that absence of <b>Ramp</b> 2 leads to failed spiral artery remodeling unaccompanied by changes in the uterine natural killer cell population. Furthermore, we assess changes in gene expression of other <b>RAMP</b> 2 -associated G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), concluding that <b>Ramp</b> 2 loss decreases parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (Pthr 1) expression and causes a blunted response to systemic parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration in mice. Ultimately, these studies provide in vivo evidence of a role for <b>RAMP</b> 2 in placental development distinct from the <b>RAMP</b> 2 -CLR/AM signaling paradigm and identify additional pathways underlying the endocrine and fertility defects of the previously characterized <b>Ramp</b> 2 heterozygous adult females...|$|R

5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex {{operation}} that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, {{construction of new}} roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first improvement was {{the reconstruction of the}} I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991. The modern <b>ramps</b> from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695's ramp over these two <b>ramps</b> was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway <b>ramps</b> was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.|$|E

40|$|Receptor {{activity}} modifying proteins <b>RAMP</b> 1, <b>RAMP</b> 2, and <b>RAMP</b> 3 {{are responsible}} for defining affinity to ligands of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR). It has also been proposed that receptor activity-modifying proteins (<b>RAMP)</b> are molecular chaperones required for CRLR transport to the cell surface. Here, we have studied the respective roles of CRLR and <b>RAMP</b> in transporting CRLR/RAMP heterodimers to the plasma membrane by using a highly specific binding assay that allows quantitative detection of cell surface-expressed CRLR or <b>RAMP</b> in the Xenopus oocytes expression system. We show that: (i) heterodimer assembly is not a prerequisite for efficient cell surface expression of CRLR, (ii) N-glycosylated <b>RAMP</b> 2 and <b>RAMP</b> 3 are expressed at the cell surface and their transport to the plasma membrane requires N-glycans, (iii) <b>RAMP</b> 1 is not N-glycosylated and is transported to the plasma membrane only upon formation of heterodimers with CRLR, and (iv) introduction of N-glycosylation sites in the <b>RAMP</b> 1 sequence (D 58 N/G 60 S, Y 71 N, and K 103 N/P 105 S) allows cell surface expression of these mutants at levels {{similar to that of}} wild-type <b>RAMP</b> 1 co-expressed with CRLR.
