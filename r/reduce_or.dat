5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes. These interactions can be either reversible (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity) or irreversible (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme).|$|E
5|$|Pain's {{intensity}} {{is distinct from}} its unpleasantness. For example, it is possible through psychosurgery and some drug treatments, or by suggestion (as in hypnosis and placebo), to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> eliminate the unpleasantness of pain without affecting its intensity.|$|E
5000|$|In particular, if f is {{faithfully}} flat, then X <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal {{implies that}} Y is <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal, respectively. If f is faithfully flat and of finite presentation, {{then all the}} fibers of f <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal implies that X is <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Assume f is flat at x in X. If X is <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal at x, then Y is <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal, respectively, at f(x). [...] Conversely, if f is also of finite {{presentation}} and f&minus;1(y) is <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal, respectively, at x, then X is <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> normal, respectively, at x.|$|R

5|$|Sleep hygiene is {{a central}} {{component}} of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations {{have been shown to}} <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific sleep disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers.|$|E
5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs {{at the onset of}} alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity. Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|Recordings {{with the}} Parental Advisory label are often {{released}} alongside censored versions that <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> eliminate the questionable material. Several retailers will distribute all varieties of the product, occasionally {{with an increased}} price for censored versions, while some sellers offer the amended pressings as their main options and choose not to distribute the explicit counterparts. However, the label has been questioned for its perceived ineffectiveness in limiting the amount of inappropriate material that young audiences are exposed to.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, the Texas State Legislature {{passed a}} law {{implementing}} property tax reductions by increasing the homestead exemption to $25,000 and prohibiting localities from <b>reducing</b> <b>or</b> repealing any local option homestead exemption already on the books. After this law was passed, 21 school districts <b>reduced</b> <b>or</b> eliminated their local optional homestead exemptions.In 2016, Paxton intervened in a lawsuit challenging the practice of school districts <b>reducing</b> <b>or</b> repealing their local optional homestead exemptions.|$|R

5|$|Small-scale {{wind power}} is the name given to wind {{generation}} systems with the capacity to produce up to 50kW of electrical power. Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on diesel generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> eliminate their dependence on grid electric power for economic reasons, or to reduce their carbon footprint. Wind turbines {{have been used for}} household electric power generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, and the money from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} map, players may engage the enemy {{as soon as}} they enter Battle Mode, which uses a pausable {{real-time}} combat system, much like Square's Parasite Eve (1998). In Battle Mode, when the player taps the attack button, a spherical grid appears around Ashley. Individual body parts within this sphere can be targeted. The battle system involves the player chaining different attacks known as Chain Abilities to achieve large combos and deal damage to the enemy. This is done by pressing buttons in timely succession, making combat resemble a rhythm game. In addition to Chain Abilities, Defensive Abilities allow Ashley to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> reflect damage or avoid status ailments. Ashley also gains Break Arts, which exchange his hit points (HP) for increased damage.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Charter {{requires}} that an athlete {{be a national}} {{of the country for}} which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.|$|E

5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to <b>reduce</b> <b>or</b> curb it.|$|E
