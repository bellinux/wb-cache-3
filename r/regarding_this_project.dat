50|$|Until {{recently}} {{there had}} been plans {{for the construction of}} a wind farm within and around a Special protection Area (SPA) and Natura 2000 site in the Salonta region, Bihor County, Romania, which provides important wintering habitat for the great bustard. At the Second Meeting of Signatories it was acknowledged that the population trends were improving in Germany, Austria and Hungary. However, there was a concern that the population trends might be negative in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, the Russian Federation and Romania. Therefore, the planned wind farm could have negative effects on the great bustard populations in Romania and Hungary as well since the Salonta region is near the Hungarian-Romanian border. In July 2012 the CMS Secretariat has received good news <b>regarding</b> <b>this</b> <b>project.</b> The Romanian Ministry of Environment and Forests confirmed its commitment to relocate the wind farm to an alternative location, thereby limiting conflict with the great bustard populations in the region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{open-source}} {{process model}} {{is emerging as}} a new lightweight paradigm for software development and has already produced several successful products. This process is fundamentally different from more traditional analysis- and design-driven processes, which raises a set of interesting research questions: what activities are carried out in open-source projects and by whom? Are there typical or exceptional patterns? CVSChecker is a tool designed to analyze the performance of individual developers and the work-distribution patterns of teams based on historical source-code repository data. In this paper, we report on a case study conducted using CVSChecker to examine a small open-source project. We discuss the insights that the CVSChecker analysis produced <b>regarding</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> and compare them to results from previous case studies performed with senior student teams...|$|E
