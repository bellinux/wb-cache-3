40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} suppressing radio {{frequency}} interference (RFI) in discrete multitone (DMT) based very high bit <b>rate</b> digital <b>subscriber</b> line (VDSL) systems. The method operates in the frequency domain of a DMT system. First, we derive a model of how an unknown narrow-band RF signal is mapped onto the DMT carriers. Then, by measuring the RFI on a few unused DMT carriers {{we are able to}} subtract RFI estimates from every modulated subcarrier. Simulation results show that this method, applied to an RFI signal with the same average power as the VDSL signal, suppresses the RFI with 40 – 50 dB, which reduces the average SNR loss from about 20 to less than 0. 3 dB. Index Terms—Discrete multitone (DMT), radio frequency interference (RFI), subscriber loops, very high bit <b>rate</b> digital <b>subscriber</b> line (VDSL). I...|$|R

Access to broadband download speeds of 25 Mbps or greater allow for online streaming of Ultra HD video programming, which is of comparable quality to traditional Pay TV content.

30|$|In this analysis, we {{have assumed}} that the repeal of CLM is an exogeneous change. We realize that changes in {{legislation}} are not spurious: factors {{that have led to}} increases in in-couple <b>residence</b> <b>rates</b> may also have pushed states to repeal CLM laws. One of these factors may be social norms that are increasingly tolerant of cohabitation and accepting of an egalitarian division of labor within the household. The more egalitarian a society’s gender norms, the more households are formed (Sevilla-Sanz [2010]). CLM goes against that trend: by providing marriage-like protection to those who perform the household production (typically women), it discourages men from cohabitating.|$|R

Longitudinal data from the 1993 and 2000 panels of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old Study (AHEAD) were used to measure health and mental health outcomes of people over age 70 who volunteered at least 100 hours in 1993. The findings provide empirical support to earlier claims that volunteering slows the decline in self-reported health and functioning levels, slows the increase in depression levels, and improves mortality rates for those who volunteer.

40|$|We {{examined}} how self-determination, the subjective experience of one’s behavior as internally initiated and personally endorsed, depends on one’s standing in real-world social hierarchies. We predicted {{that those with}} the traits most relevant to status attainment would be those afforded the most opportunities to be self-determining. We examined the trait of physical attractiveness, given its documented association with social status and no known association with self-determination. First-year undergraduates living in same-sex <b>residences</b> <b>rated</b> their housemates’ social status, while an independent set of observers rated the participants’ physical attractiveness.

40|$|For higher {{data rate}} and {{attractive}} price level internet service Very High Data <b>rate</b> <b>Subscriber</b> Line  2 (VDSL 2) {{is a perfect}} option. VDSL 2 is a great achievement in Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology. It has a good impact in modern triple play (Voice, Data and Video) Internet service but for modern world applications required more data rate than the VDSL 2 system can provide {{but it should be}} inexpensive and easy to install. So the desired goal of this thesis work is to achieve higher bitrates for VDSL 2 system, by transmitting multiple VDSL 2 signal using Plastic Optical Fiber (POF) channel instead of copper channel. POF channel is a suitable solution for high data rate application. Moreover POF is very rugged and suitable for high data rate application because of optical based transmission and it’s also very easy to implement into the interior networking. Moreover POF doesn’t have any impact of Electro Magnetic Interference because of optical transmission. So several VDSL 2 signals are amplitude modulated to allocate specific frequency band and combined together which can be called as frequency division multiplexing and POF is used as channel to carry the combined signal which provide much higher bit rate than single signal and efficiently utilize the bandwidth of the channel. Then at the receiver end the combined signals are split and amplitude demodulate at the respective receiver to recover the expected frequency band for the receiver. ...|$|R
