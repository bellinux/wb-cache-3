40|$|Remotely {{operated}} underwater tool systems {{designed to}} operate in Nuclear Fuel Storage Basins {{can be applied to}} deep water, subsea oilfield applications. Spent nuclear fuel rods re stored underwater in large indoor swimming pool-like facilities where the water cover shields the workers from the radiation. This paper describes three specialized tooling systems that were designed and built by Sonsub for work at the Department of Energy`s Hanford site. The Door Seal Tool removed an existing seal system, cleaned a 20 ft. tall, carbon steel, underwater hatch and installed a new stainless steel gasket surface with underwater epoxy. The Concrete Sampling Tool was built to take core samples from the vertical, concrete walls of the basins. The tool has three hydraulic drills with proprietary hollow core drill bits to cut and retrieve the concrete samples. The <b>Rack</b> <b>Saw</b> remotely attached itself to a structure, cut a variety of steel shapes and pipes, and retained the cut pieces for retrieval. All of these systems are remotely operated with onboard video cameras and debris collection systems. The methods and equipment proven in this application are available to refurbish sealing surfaces and to drill or sample concrete in offshore oil field applications...|$|E
60|$|After a little, Joan {{arrived and}} was brought in. She <b>saw</b> the <b>rack,</b> she <b>saw</b> the attendants, {{and the same}} picture which I had been seeing must have risen in her mind; {{but do you think}} she quailed, do you think she shuddered? No, {{there was no sign of}} that sort. She {{straightened}} herself up, and there was a slight curl of scorn about her lip; but as for fear, she showed not a vestige of it.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s Kogelnik {{began to use}} life-size cutout paper stencils of her friends to produce her paintings. In 1965 these {{prototype}} cut-outs became vinyl hangings, presented on the same clothing <b>racks</b> that she <b>saw</b> pushed down {{the streets in the}} vicinity of her studio in New York’s garment district.|$|R
50|$|McDonald played {{basketball}} for Westchester Community College after his graduation from high school. After {{hearing about the}} young point guard, Texas A&M coach Shelby Metcalf travelled to Harlem in 1985 to see McDonald play on the playgrounds. Thoroughly impressed, Metcalf began recruiting McDonald to come to Texas and play for the Aggies. Fortunately for Metcalf, McDonald had already decided to leave New York. His neighbourhood in Harlem was very dangerous, and McDonald's brother had in fact been {{shot and killed by}} robbers in early 1985. After agreeing to attend Texas A&M, McDonald spent {{the first few days of}} his stay in College Station in his dorm room, convinced that the number of gun <b>racks</b> he <b>saw</b> on pick-up trucks throughout town meant the area was as dangerous as the place he had left.|$|R
60|$|Miriam {{took off}} her things and looked round. It was a bare, severe room. Her photo, Clara's, Annie's, were on the wall. She looked on the drawing-board {{to see what he}} was doing. There were only a few {{meaningless}} lines. She looked to see what books he was reading. Evidently just an ordinary novel. The letters in the <b>rack</b> she <b>saw</b> were from Annie, Arthur, and from some man or other she did not know. Everything he had touched, everything that was in the least personal to him, she examined with lingering absorption. He had been gone from her for so long, she wanted to rediscover him, his position, what he was now. But there was not much in the room to help her. It only made her feel rather sad, it was so hard and comfortless.|$|R
50|$|It was {{converted}} to a sawmill around 1879. The waterwheel was removed and replaced with a Thomson double-vortex turbine, built by Williamsons (now Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd) of Kendal. This {{is thought to be}} the only remaining working variety of its type. In its heydey, the 10 hp (7.46 kW) created by the turbine drove a range of woodworking machinery - a <b>rack</b> sawbench, circular <b>saw,</b> thicknesser (planer), and lathes - by a series of belts and pulleys off a central line shaft.|$|R
50|$|Melbourne United, {{then known}} as the Tigers, joined the National Basketball League in 1984. Throughout the {{majority}} of the 1980s, they saw limited success, despite the number of records which superstar Andrew Gaze, son of coach Lindsay, <b>racked</b> up. 1987 <b>saw</b> Andrew average 44.1 points per game, and set the clubs single game scoring record of 60 points against the Newcastle Falcons, however, the team still failed to make the playoffs. In fact, despite Gaze's point scoring the Tigers finished with a 3-23 record with all wins coming at their home court, the Albert Park Basketball Stadium.|$|R
25|$|Rack {{design on}} Panorama Elite, II and III {{contained}} window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate {{was used as}} trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection {{on each side of}} the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of <b>rack</b> and <b>saw</b> Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks utilized flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.|$|R
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the <b>Rack</b> from <b>Saw</b> III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pleasant Tackett, a Methodist minister, {{settled in}} Parker County in1854. Two {{years later he}} moved his family to Young County, and {{numbered}} among the first settlers of that section. The Tackett home was located on the old Fort Belknap and Austin Road, about nine {{miles south of the}} post, near Fish Creek: so named for the Tacketts broke the ice and caught fish during the severe winter weather.....in the evening of February 13, 1860, one of Mr. Tackett's milk cows came home through the sleet and snow with an arrow sticking in her side......Tackitt back-tracked the cows about three-fourths of a mile, to where they found moccasin <b>racks</b> and <b>saw</b> blankets hanging on the east end of Tackett Mountain. Tackett thought it unwise to make an open attack, but decided to advance upon the Indian's from the north......Almost instantly several Indians charged like wild demons. These Indians were under the leadership of Old Piny Chummy, who only a few months before lived on the Comanche Reservation, near old Camp Cooper. Tackett and his sons knew him well, and no doubt, Piny Chummy recognized the Tacketts......Old Piny Chummy charged Parson Tackett himself, and the old chief received a mortal wound from the discharge of the parson's gun......A white flag was found flying from the top of a tree on Tackett Mountain; and under it were found four bridles, four ropes, four bows, and four quivers of arrows, as well as blankets and other implements. A few days later, soaring vultures disclosed the graves of four warriors killed in this fight.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{for a while}} every man, {{knowing that}} it must come to that, and yet not daring to say it; till Sir Warham St. Leger, the marshal of Munster, spoke out stoutly: [...] "Foreigners had been scoffing them too long and too truly with waging these Irish wars as if they meant to keep them alive, rather than end them. Mercy and faith to every Irishman who would show mercy and faith, was his motto; but to invaders, no mercy. Ireland was England's {{vulnerable}} point; it might be some day her ruin; a terrible example must be made of those who dare to touch the sore. Rather pardon the Spaniards for landing in the Thames than in Ireland!"--till Lord Grey became much excited, and turning as a last hope to Raleigh, asked his opinion: but Raleigh's silver tongue was that day not {{on the side of}} indulgence. He skilfully recapitulated the arguments of his fellow-captains, improving them as he went on, till each worthy soldier was surprised to find himself so much wiser a man than he had thought; and finished by one of his rapid and passionate perorations upon his favorite theme--the West Indian cruelties of the Spaniards, [...] ". [...] . by which great tracts and fair countries are now utterly stripped of inhabitants by heavy bondage and torments unspeakable. Oh, witless Islanders!" [...] said he, apostrophizing the Irish, [...] "would to Heaven that you were here to listen to me! What other fate awaits you, if this viper, which you are so ready to take into your bosom, should be warmed to life, but to groan like the Indians, slaves to the Spaniard; but to perish like the Indians, by heavy burdens, cruel chains, plunder and ravishment; scourged, <b>racked,</b> roasted, stabbed, <b>sawn</b> in sunder, cast to feed the dogs, as simple and more righteous peoples have perished ere now by millions? And what else, I say, had been the fate of Ireland had this invasion prospered, which God has now, by our weak hands, confounded and brought to naught? Shall we then answer it, my lord, either to our conscience, our God, or our queen, if we shall set loose men (not one of whom, I warrant, but is stained with murder on murder) to go and fill up the cup of their iniquity among these silly sheep? Have not their native wolves, their barbarous chieftains, shorn, peeled, and slaughtered them enough already, but we must add this pack of foreign wolves to the number of their tormentors, and fit the Desmond with a body-guard of seven, yea, seven hundred devils worse than himself? Nay, rather let us do violence to our own human nature, and show ourselves in appearance rigorous, that we may be kind indeed; lest while we presume to be over-merciful to the guilty, we prove ourselves to be over-cruel to the innocent." ...|$|R
40|$|Pri svojem terenskem delu sem se velikokrat srečala s sušilnicami za sadje, ki so bile v času od 19. do ½ 20. stoletja, skoraj obvezen gospodarski objekt, na gorskih samooskrbnih kmetijah. Med leti 1950 in 1960 so sušilnice izgubile svojo primarno funkcijo, saj so v njih sušenje sadja opustili. Kljub temu pa so se sušilnice vse do danes ohranile v večjem številu. Evidententirala sem jih nad sedemdeset, vse so opuščene, le ena je še delujoča. V prehrani je imelo sadje na slovenskem zelo pomembno vlogo. Razvijalo se je skozi stoletja in desetletja, čeprav vedno v povezavi s poljedeljstvom in živinorejo. Zato je izročilo in dediščina o sadjarstvu pri nas pestra in bogata bodisi, da je povezana s sadjarskim poklicem ali dejavnostjo. Na sadjarsko dejavnost se navezujejo tudi objekti, ki jih uvrščamo med najmanjša gospodarska poslopja. To so sušilnice za sadje ali pajštve, ki pa sodijo med našo najbolj ogroženo stavbno dediščino, saj jih večina ni več v prvotni funkciji. V raziskavi sem se najprej usmerila v pregled virov in literature, ki predvsem obravnava sadne sušilnice in sušenje sadja. Pomembnejši avtorji so: P. Santonino, J. V. Valvasor, M. Pohlin, S. Rutar, A. Muznik ter Francijscejski kataster. Geografsko obravnavam Posočje. To je svet na zahodu Slovenije, kjer so razmere za gojenje sadnega drevja dokaj ugodne. Sušenje sadja, hrušk, sliv ter jabolk, v sadnih sušilnicah ali krušni peči, pa pretežno v uporabi do ½ 20. stoletja. Posebnost sušenja sliv in fig so Goriška Brda, kjer so sušili in žveplali sadje v t. i. kasonih ali na soncu (zraku). Sušenje na soncu je bilo značilno tudi za Vipavsko dolino. Sadne sušilnice sem evidentirala in inventarizirala med leti 1999 in 2002. Glede na zastavljene kriterije in obdelavo podatkov, pa jih razvrstila v tabele. Osrednji del raziskave pa je posvečen opisu ter tipologiji sušilnic /dimne, brezdimne, elektirične/, pripravam za shranjevanje suhega sadja in uporabi letega. From the {{historical}} {{point of view}} fruit has always had {{an important role in}} nutrition. Up to the mid 20 th century fruit-growing was a complementary activity to cultivation of crops and to stock-farming. The tradition and the heritage of fruit-growing are varied and rich, either those relative to the profession of the fruit-grower and to the activities of fruit-growing or to those relative to the buildings – drying-houses, which are the smallest farm-buildings in Slovenia. From 19 th century to the mid 20 th century the drying-house or "pajštva" was an indispensable part of mountain self-sufficient farms. Drying-houses lost their basic function between 1950 and 1960 when farmers stopped using them for drying fruit. In the introduction of my paper I present the sources and the literature that treat the subject of fruit-growing and drying-houses. Among the most important authors emerge P. Santonino, J. V. Valvazor, M. Pohlin, S. Rutar, A. Muznik and the 19 th century Austro-Hungarian cadastre. For the topography resp. for the recording of drying-houses I chose the region of Posočje. The land of Posočje is rather suitable for fruit-growing and the drying of fruit – – pears, prunes and apples – in drying-houses or ovens for baking bread was extensively practised till the mid 20 th century. A peculiar method of fruit-drying was in use in the area of Goriška Brda. There, fruit was dried and smoked with brimstone in "keson" or air-dried. Air-drying was in use also in the Vipava valley, for ex. apricots in the village of Budanje. I carried out the registration and the inventory of drying-houses between 1999 and 2002. After processing the data I classified the drying-houses and entered them in a table according to the set criteria. In order to make the survey more complete I entered the ruined and the partly ruined drying-houses as well. The table contains the following data: - EŠD (code number of the cultural heritage item if considered cultural heritage or a monument) - name of the drying-house - degree of preservation - typology - TTN (topographic plan) The paper is divided in several chapters. Besides the typology (drying with smoke, without smoke, electrically heated) I also described some old sorts of fruit trees, tools for gathering, picking, drying and storing of fruit and added some recipes for dishes with dried fruit. In the conclusion I describe the only drying-house still in use, namely the one belonging to the farm called "Pri Francu" in Kneške Ravne. The farm lies in an amphitheatre formed by the mountains Žabiški Kum, Vogel and Rodica and the slopes of Masovnik. The farm is situated higher than any other and its owners are proud and faithful to the traditional way of life. Their farm is a symbol of the past, perseverance, tradition and knowledge. The farm-buildings such as the "Kozolec toplar" (double roofed ridge top hay <b>rack),</b> the <b>saw</b> "venecijanka" (vertical frame one band blade saw), the wooden and the stone/brick barns, the basement with a smithy, the joiner 2 ̆ 7 s workshop and the drying-house are venerable buildings and conceal extraordinary technical achievements. The farm is surrounded by meadows, pasture-grounds and woods. At the border of the farm-grounds grow, scattered, old sorts of fruit trees of venerable age for the fruit-growing has been a tradition of the farm for centuries...|$|R
