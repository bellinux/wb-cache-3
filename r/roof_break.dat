50|$|Devil's Throat (pictured at right) {{is another}} good Hawaiian {{example of a}} pit crater, {{especially}} since {{we were able to}} observe its formation through collapse over time. It was first documented by Thomas Jaggar who estimated its dimensions as 15m x 10.5m x 75m. In 1923 William Sinclair was lowered into Devil's Throat on a rope. He found a cavern shaped like an upside down funnel which widened as he approached the bottom. He measured the floor as about 60m in diameter and the crater's depth around 78m. The crater's mouth widened over time and in 2006 the crater's dimensions were measured as 50m x 42m x 49m. This growth is explained by observing pieces of the overhanging <b>roof</b> <b>breaking</b> off and falling to the bottom. These shards gradually piled up on the crater floor, reducing its depth.|$|R

50|$|A {{hip roof}} is self-bracing, {{requiring}} less diagonal bracing than a gable roof. Hip roofs are thus much {{better suited for}} hurricane regions than gable roofs. Hip roofs have no large, flat, or slab-sided ends to catch wind and are inherently much more stable than gable roofs. However, for a hurricane region, the roof also has to be steep-sloped; at least 35 degrees from horizontal or steeper in slope is preferred. When wind flows over a shallow sloped hip roof, the roof can behave like an airplane wing. Lift is then created on the leeward side. The flatter the roof, the more likely this will happen. A steeper pitched hip roof tends to cause the wind to stall as it goes over the <b>roof,</b> <b>breaking</b> up the effect. If the roof slopes are less than 35 degrees from horizontal, the roof {{will be subject to}} uplift. Greater than 35 degrees, and not only does wind blowing over it encounter a stalling effect, but the roof is actually held down on the wall plate by the wind pressure.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAiming at the {{practice}} of the uniting of surface mining and underground mining and the interaction, the thin plate model of mined slope was established with the influence analysis of underground mining to slope, distortion and stress distribution law studied. Combining the rock characteristic in practice, the modified method was put forward. Basing on the <b>roof</b> <b>breaking</b> law of mined slope, the calculating method of slope stability coefficient and the minimum width of protecting coal pillar was elicited. Subsequently the paper took the united mining practice of AnJiaLing surface mine as example to study the subsidence law of roof and the influence of mined 902 working face to surface mine slope. The research conclusion indicated that the deformation and subsidence of overlying strata is obvious, and it has a clear lag. The distortion of mined slope under open-pit and underground mining was drew from strata angle alter evoked from ceiling distortion, which can be used as the theory sustainment to stabilization of mined slope under open-pit and underground mining...|$|R

She and Sunday begin to fight and Buffy is once again losing, in part because of her sore arm from their previous encounter, but seeing Sunday damage the Class Protector award she was given at her senior prom angers Buffy enough to regain her confidence and fight back soundly. The others show up to fight off and kill the rest of the vampires although two of them escape, and Buffy takes out Sunday with a backhand throw of a broken tennis racket. As Buffy and friends are returning to the dorm with her belongings, Giles makes a belated appearance with weapons, apologising for his earlier dismissal of her fears and promising that they will fight the evil together.|$|R

Once there, he meets and falls for a young self-destructive Creole, Louis ("Welcome to The New World"). Louis agrees to let Lestat make him a vampire. They live together for a time, but Louis becomes dissatisfied with the vampiric life ("Embrace It"). Lestat transforms Claudia, an orphan girl, which horrifies Louis, who nevertheless agrees to help raise her. Time passes. Claudia has a greater craving for blood, having been transformed at a young age ("I Want More"). She mourns the fact that she will stay a child forever ("I'll Never Have That Chance"). Lestat apologizes, and she tries to kill him. Louis burns down the house. Later, on a ship, Lestat is wounded and thinks of what his life has become ("Sail Me Away"). He returns to Armand and the theater, where he discovers Louis and Claudia as members of the troupe. Armand and the others kill Claudia for trying to kill Lestat despite his protests ("To Kill Your Kind"). Louis leaves ("Embrace It" [...] (reprise)).

40|$|Tornadoes {{can produce}} {{some of the}} strongest winds on earth; these highly {{localized}} storms can cause massive damage. Assessments of tornado wind speeds are done using post-event observations of damage via the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A very commonly observed failure occurs at the roof-to-wall connection where the <b>roof</b> <b>breaks</b> up or flies away, typically leaving the walls in place. However, once the roof is gone the walls are more vulnerable to the wind. If a wall subsequently fails, it {{increases the risk of}} injury or death for occupants. Significant research has been done for failures of roof-to-wall connections and roof failure wind loads. In contrast, little work has been done pertaining to how the walls perform when there is no roof in place. In the current study, experiments were performed on a full-scale, two storey residential structure with no roof. The objectives of the study were (i) to determine the wind loads and wind speeds required to cause exterior wall failure after the roof-to-wall connections had already failed, and (ii) to develop low-cost recommendations for strengthening wood-frame houses and, thereby, reducing risk to occupants during severe storms such as tornadoes. It was found that the capacity of the walls of the test house significantly exceeded Canadian (Ontario) design loads when clad in brick veneer. The interior wall placement and connections between the exterior and interior walls are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} overall capacity. For vinyl-clad houses, increasing the stiffness of the corners of the walls will also increase capacity – which appears to be the primary structural benefit of brick cladding...|$|R

50|$|In 2014, Tony (Terence Maynard) {{turns up}} at the Eileen's house, wanting to rekindle his {{relationship}} with Jason. He begins a relationship with Eileen's friend, Liz McDonald (Beverly Callard), and she is angry to discover that Tony is giving Liz more attention than he is his own son. Tony, still not convinced {{that he is a}} good enough father, decides to purchase the builder's yard from Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), who is desperately trying to pay off his £80,000 debt. When a £75,000 deal is reached, Tony signs the builder's yard over to Jason, to say sorry for not watching him grow up. He also buys the flat next door, which he rents to Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) and Steph Britton (Tisha Merry). Tony begins to work at the builder's yard with Jason, taking on an executive role. They later employ Jason's friend, Gary Windass (Mikey North) and Zeedan Nazir (Qasim Akhtar), as labourers. After Jason's brother, Todd, returns to Weatherfield, Tony employs him, as a secretary at the builder's yard, but he puts the company at risk, after ordering cheap materials to make a loft conversion for Jason's friend, Tyrone. Matters turn worse when Tyrone falls through the <b>roof,</b> <b>breaks</b> his ribs and sues 'Jason's Construction'. When Jason discovers what Todd has done and that Jason and Gary knew what he was up to, he fires all three of them, leaving only Zeedan working at the builder's yard and, unable to live in the same house as Todd, for what he has done, Jason moves into the flat above the kebab shop with Eva. After realising that what happened to him was not Jason's fault, Tyrone decides to accept Tony's £5,000 compensation and forgives Jason.|$|R

The young men would dust their hands with flour and try to enter a young girls house and smother their faces with flour. If doors and windows were closed, it meant they were not desired by the girl.
