40|$|The {{grain size}} (GS) and volume {{fraction}} of alumina have been systematically varied in composites with a zirconia matrix {{and the corresponding}} residual stresses have been assessed by means of piezo-spectroscopy. The compressive stress in alumina depends on the volume fraction and it is well predicted by a stochastic model based on information theory. No dependence with GS has been detected, except at the highest volume content (20 % vol. alumina). Conversely the stress distribution is independent from the volume fraction and depends on GS: intermediate values of GS exhibit the wider stress distribution. The tensile stress in zirconia shows no clear correlation with the volume fraction and increases with increasing zirconia GS. This latter behaviour has been compared with a model based on diffusional <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses.</b> The model reproduces correctly the stress change due to different alumina contents, but it diverges from the experimental data at smaller GSs, overestimating the residual stress.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{consider}} {{stress relaxation}} in a strongly segregated lamellar mesophase, where block copolymers {{are in the}} “brush ” state with junction points confined to the interface between the adjacent lamellae and blocks stretched out away from it. If the molecular weight of the blocks is large enough, they entangle with their neighbors {{as well as with}} blocks from the opposite brush. The number of entanglements of one particular chain with the opposite brush varies from chain to chain even in the monodisperse system. We demonstrate that this dispersion of the number of entanglements leads to a very broad spectrum of relaxation times and to an effectively power-law-like stress relaxation function log G- (log t) “ with CY = 1 / 2 (a = 2) in the strong (weak) chain-stretching limit. We analyze various disentanglement mechanisms for diblocks and triblocks and the onset of the diffusion of copolymers along the interface. Another relaxation mechanism is due to the displacement of a block across the interface into the “enemy ” phase. We conclude that for highly entangled copolymers it will be an important mode of stress relaxation (especially for triblock copolymers). For asymptotically long times the <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> along the perfectly ordered lamella will be liquidlike. In a system with defects in domain structure the <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> is controlled by the processes of equilibration of excess density along the layers.

Their thermal and mechanical properties were tested by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). By extrapolation of the R* relaxation process in DMA (arising from dynamics of the reversible UPy cross-links) to temperatures below the glass transition temperature (Tg), it was shown that the reversible cross-links contribute significantly to the <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> below Tg that was observed in creep measurements...|$|E
40|$|Residual stress, {{relaxation}} and recovery of stress during martensite {{transformation of the}} sputtering-deposited TiNi films were studied in this paper. Results showed that {{a wide range of}} residual stress levels (both tensile and compressive) were obtained with the change of Ti contents in the deposited films. After film deposition, the thermal and intrinsic stress in the film could be very large, but due to the differences in phase transformation stress and transformation temperatures, the real stress values under room temperature, and stress evolution with temperature during phase transformation were quite different. For the film with a Ti content of 50. 2 %, due to the significant <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> caused by the perfect martensite transformation, the residual stress under room temperature was very low (− 20 MPa) and recovery stress during heating was as high as 750 MPa. With both decrease and increase in Ti content in the deposited films, the tensile residual stress increased significantly. For the films with a Ti content of 51. 3 %, a two-step transformation was observed among martensite, R-phase and austenite. The recovery stress and average increase rate of stress during both heating and cooling were lower than those of film with 50. 2 % Ti. For the films with a Ti content of 47. 3 and 53 %, only partial <b>relaxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> occurred due to the existence of R-phase transformation at room temperature. Also, because of non-equilibrium contents of Ni and Ti in these films, shape memory effect and the recovery of stress due to the phase transformation was not so significant.
