50|$|During World War II Oreochromis mossambicus was {{introduced}} to Singapore by the Japanese, who had brought the fish from the island of Java. Hence the fishes' local names, Japanese fish and Java fish. Tilapia were once abundant in the fresh and brackish waters off the north coast of Singapore. Since the late 1980s however, populations of feral tilapia have declined. Recently introduced cichlid hybrids (<b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> O. mossambicus x O. niloticus, possibly also O. honorum and O. aureus) have crossbred with populations of Oreochromis mossambicus, possibly contributing to the decline. Inter-species hybrids tend to produce fewer fry per brood than spawning by fishes of the same species. In addition, hybrids classified as O. niloticus may have inherited a diminished tolerance for saline conditions, thus restricting the environments in which tilapia can be found.|$|E

An understanding of monogenean infection dynamics in tilapia fish may assist us in searching for some intervention measures in reducing the loss of fish caused by parasitic diseases. The present study aimed (1) to compare infection level of monogeneans between the wild and cultured Oreochromis niloticus, and between the cultured O. niloticus and cultured <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia,</b> and (2) to examine the spatial distribution of monogenean species over the gills of the different host species. From a total of 75 fish specimens, six species of monogeneans from two genera: Cichlidogyrus (C. halli, C. mbirizei, C. sclerosus, C. thurstonae, C. tilapiae) and Scutogyrus (S. longicornis) were identified. Data showed that the infection level of cultured O. niloticus was higher than that of the wild O. niloticus, however, the former was lower than that of the cultured <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia.</b> Higher species richness of monogeneans was observed in the cultured <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> as compared to the others.

30|$|This study {{revealed}} that same species of monogeneans probably distribute differently over the gills of different species of hosts (O. niloticus vs <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia)</b> as well as same species of host in different conditions (wild vs cultured O. niloticus) (Table  4). Our results also show that fish species with higher mean intensity and higher aggregation index may have higher chances to show preferences for specific gill arches (Table  4). For example, the numbers of C. halli were significantly higher in first three gills of <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia,</b> which have higher mean intensity and aggregation, but not in both the wild and cultured O. niloticus. Higher aggregation distribution of the monogeneans on the gills of <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> facilitates the opportunities for mating and led to higher infection level in fish (Tombi et al. 2014). The present study indicates that the first two to three gills were mostly infected by all the species of monogeneans, except for the monogeneans in the wild O. niloticus that distributed randomly over the four pairs of gills arches. Some researchers proposed that higher preferences of parasites on median arches II and III are due to two main factors: respiratory water currents and gill surface area (Gutiérrez and Martorelli 1999; Paling 1968). The authors suggested that greater respiratory water current flowing through the gills will facilitate the settlement of these parasites. However, further study is required to determine the factors affecting the distribution of Cichlidogyrus and Scutogyrus on the gills of fish hosts. In the present study, the gill arch IV was the least infected by monogeneans {{in most of the}} cases. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the gill arch IV has the smallest colonised surfaces area and the lowest number of gill filaments as compared to the first three gill arches (El-Naggar and Reda 2003; Gutiérrez and Martorelli 1999; Madanire-Moyo et al. 2011; Tombi et al. 2014).|$|R

Development of such symptoms was associated with the infection with Aeromonas hydrophila. The current study has shown that MAS could serve as the primary cause of severe infection not only in <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> but may also infected other freshwater fish species. The results of histological analysis of various tissues indicates a direct correlation between disease infection and histopathological disorders observed in the tissues. ...|$|R

In general, the cultured <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> have a higher monogenean infection rate than those of wild tilapia and cultured O. niloticus. Monogeneans prefer to harbour on the gill arches I and II but have no preference on {{the left or right}} side of the gills. The information obtained may provide strategies in aquaculture management to reduce potential economic losses of tilapia caused by parasitic infection.|$|R

40|$|Holothuria scabra are {{tropical}} {{sea cucumbers}} that are widely {{distributed in the}} Indo-Pacific Ocean and are consideredto be a delicacy in China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Since they can be easily harvested in the wild, populationsin sea beds around Thailand have been decreasing. This problem {{has led to the}} construction of hatcheries and growoutfacilities in order to effectively culture these high-priced species. However, there is a disadvantage in farm-grown productionof these species due to its slow growth as it usually takes two years from hatching to marketable size. To increase its growthrate, we have tried co-culturing H. scabra with <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> under 30 ppt seawater. We found that growth and survival of thesea cucumbers was significantly higher when being co-cultured than when being cultured alone, while the growth ratesof <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> showed no change or showed an increase. This co-culture would be a strategy to improve inland culture perfor-mance of H. scabra, during which income from growing <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> is achieved...|$|E
40|$|The trace metal {{concentrations}} in edible muscle of <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis spp.) sampled {{from a former}} tin mining pool, concrete tank and earthen pond in Jelebu were analysed with microwave assisted digestion-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results were compared with established legal limits and the daily ingestion exposures simulated using the Monte Carlo algorithm for potential health risks. Among the metals investigated, arsenic {{was found to be}} the key contaminant, which may have arisen from the use of formulated feeding pellets. Although the risks of toxicity associated with consumption of <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> from the sites investigated were found to be within the tolerable range, the preliminary probabilistic estimation of As cancer risk shows that the 95 th percentile risk level surpassed the benchmark level of 10 (- 5). In general, the probabilistic health risks associated with ingestion of <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> can be ranked as follows: former tin mining pool > concrete tank > earthen pond.

40|$|A {{complete}} diallel cross involving four {{strains of}} <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> (Oreochromis spp.) from Malaysia, Stirling, Taiwan and Thailand was performed with the aim to establish a foundation population for genetic improvement. The mating involved 16 parental breeders per sex per strain, producing 64 full-sib families in total. Statistical analyses were carried out on data consisting of records from 1280 individuals reared in both freshwater (0 ppt) and saline water (30 ppt) environments. Among the purebreds, and across the testing environments, the Malaysian strain exhibited the highest additive genetic performance for harvest weight. Whereas the Stirling strain was the poorest (7. 4 % above and 13. 4 % below the overall mean of pure strains, respectively). The average level of heterosis was generally low (4. 2 %) and the average of all crossbreds was not statistically different from {{the mean of the}} pure strains. Overall, the growth performance of <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> was significantly lower in saline than in freshwater environments (P less than 0. 001). The high correlation between additive genetic and total performance suggests that improvement of <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> can be effectively based on the exploitation of additive genetic variation (i. e. through selective breeding). A synthetic base population was therefore formed with the best performing individuals regardless of their genetic makeup and of the environments tested. Strategies for the future breeding program in <b>red</b> <b>tilapia</b> are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Studies on tilapias {{focused on}} the {{refinement}} of strain comparison methods, refinement and pilot-testing of broodstock improvement procedure, selective breeding and evaluation of <b>red</b> <b>tilapias,</b> genetic variability determination in hatchery-bred tilapia {{and the development of}} criteria for tilapia fingerling quality assessment. On carps, feeding of bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) to enhance reproductive performance was done and stunting was applied as a technique in broodstock development. Studies on the tolerance of bighead carp fry to low salinities were conducted. Free-living nematodes were tested as alternative larval food. The culture potential of grass carp in lake-based cages was also determined. Research on the native catfish (Clarias macrocephalus) focused on endocrine studies during the final stages of maturation. Hatchery techniques were refined by identification of factors that increase fry production. Practical diets were developed for broodstock, hatchery, nursery and grow-out phases. A collaborative project on the ecological impact of African catfish (C. gariepinus) introduction in natural waters was undertaken. The occurrence of EUS (epizootic ulcerative syndrome) among wild fishes in Laguna Lake decreases the marketability of both wild and cultured fishes from the lake. Hence, the bacteria and virus associated with EUS and their virulence, modes of disease transmission, developmental stages of dermal lesions and hematological changes in severely affected fish were studied. Laguna Lake, where fish catch and aquaculture production contribute significantly to the country s total freshwater fish production, {{has been the focus of}} extensive ecological research in collaboration with other local and foreign research and academic institutions...|$|R
40|$|Antibiogram {{and heavy}} metal {{resistance}} patterns of pathogenic bacteria isolated from moribund cage cultured silver catfish (Pangasius sutchi) and <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> (Tilapia sp.) from Sungai Manir, Terengganu, Malaysia were studied and characterized. Sungai Manir {{is one of}} the famous rivers in Terengganu for its wide variety of cage cultured freshwater fish. However, to date, the baseline information of antibiogram and heavy metal resistance patterns of the pathogenic bacteria attacking the freshwater fish cultured in Sungai Manir is still lacking. Therefore, this study was carried out, which may be useful for fish farmers as a guideline for fish prophylactic and treatment purposes. Furthermore, present studies also provide information on the safety level of consuming freshwater fish produced from Sungai Manir. In the present study, bacteria were isolated from 100 fish of each moribund silver catfish and <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> using seven media including tryptic soy agar (TSA), Mac Conkey, thiosulphate citrate bile salt (TCBS), eosin methylene blue (EMB), glutamate starch pseudomonas (GSP), xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD) and Baird Parker media. Identification of bacteria was carried out using conventional biochemical tests and confirmed by commercial bacterial identification kit. Antibiogram of the bacterial isolates against 18 antibiotics; oxolinic acid (2 μg), ampicillin (10 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), furazolidone (15 μg), lincomycin (15 μg), oleandomycin (15 μg), amoxicillin (25 μg), colistin sulphate (25 μg), sulphamethoxazole (25 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), doxycycline (30 μg), florfenicol (30 μg), flumequine (30 μg), kanamycin (30 μg), nalidixic acid (30 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), nitrofurantoin (50 μg) and spiramycin (100 μg) was carried out using disk diffusion method, whereas heavy metal resistance patterns (Hg 2 +, Cd 2 +, Cr 6 + and Cu 2 +) of the bacterial isolates was determined through twofold agar dilution method. The results showed that the percentage of sensitivity case of the 120 bacterial isolates to the tested antibiotics was 62. 7 %. This was followed by resistance (26. 9 %) and intermediary sensitive (10. 4 %) cases. In terms of the heavy metal resistance patterns, all bacterial isolates were resistant to Hg 2 + and Cr 6 +. However, only 27. 8 % and 16. 7 % of the bacterial isolates were sensitive to Cu 2 + and Cd 2 +, respectively. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices indicated that the cage cultured silver catfish and <b>red</b> hybrid <b>tilapia</b> were under high exposure to the tested antibiotic. Overall, {{the results of the present}} studies showed that Sungai Manir may be polluted with heavy metal and antibiotic residues...|$|R
