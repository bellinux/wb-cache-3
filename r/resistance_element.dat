Since their introduction in the 1960s, foil resistors have had the best precision and stability of any resistor available.

The TCR of foil resistors is extremely low, and has been further improved over the years.|$|E

2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a three-terminal resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} potentiometer {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (see drawing) is constructed of a flat <b>resistance</b> <b>element</b> (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E

In two element tanks the lower element provides recovery from standby losses and the upper element provides heating during periods of large hot water use.

40|$|Several {{types of}} {{hydraulic}} resistance factors {{may be present}} on upland agricultural areas. It is not known whether roughness contributions from individual elements are additive or if interactions between resistance factors may occur. In this study, Darcy-Weisbach roughness coefficients were measured on surfaces containing corn-soybeans, sorghum-cotton, and sunflower-wheat residue in addition to gravel cover. Varying rates of flow were introduced into a flume in which residue and gravel materials were securely attached. Roughness coefficients were calculated from measurements of discharge rate and flow velocity for Reynolds number values varying from approximately 1, 200 to 13, 000. The laboratory data were then used to identify the contribution to total hydraulic resistance provided by {{the different types of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>elements.</b> For most of the experimental treatments, the addition of smaller diameter residue materials (soybeans, cotton, or wheat) to surfaces containing larger <b>resistance</b> <b>elements</b> (corn, sorghum, or sunflower) did not significantly affect hydraulic resistance. However, smaller diameter residue materials did influence hydraulic resistance when they substantially increased the total volume of <b>resistance</b> <b>elements.</b> Existing roughness coefficient values were not significantly affected by the presence of gravel materials with diameters similar to the larger residue materials. The experimental results suggest that total hydraulic resistance cannot be predicted by simply adding the contributions provided by individual <b>resistance</b> <b>elements.</b> When estimating total hydraulic resistance on upland agricultural areas, the relative size, number, and volume of <b>resistance</b> <b>elements</b> must be considered...|$|R
