5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow <b>rapidly.</b> <b>As</b> the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E

5|$|On July 21, {{the storm}} {{deteriorated}} in organization as it continued northward. The lack of banding features indicated that by early on July 22, Becky was barely a tropical storm.

5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous.

They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed.|$|E

In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, {{the storm}} weakened <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> {{it began to}} move west-northwest. Later that morning, MFR downgraded the system into a severe tropical storm. By April 15, MFR downgraded the system into a tropical depression. That very day, the JTWC reported that winds of Helisaonia had fallen below hurricane-force. During the morning hours of April 17, the JTWC downgraded Helisaonina into a depression. Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E
5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn <b>rapidly,</b> <b>as</b> severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Bottling and {{shipping}} of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens <b>rapidly.</b> <b>As</b> it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall to the base of the plant.|$|E
