Equipotential bonding is done from the Service Panel consumer unit (also known as a fuse box, breaker box, or distribution board) to incoming water and gas services. It is also done in bathrooms where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including metal pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential.

50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a continuation of}} the investigation reported by Tawab et al. (2012). In the present investigation single and double layers of welded wire and X 8 expanded steel meshes are used to reinforce the U-shaped forms. In addition, three types of core material are used to fill the reinforced mortar forms namely; conventional concrete, autoclaved aerated lightweight concrete brick, and recycled concrete. Two types of connections between the precast permanent form and the core material are investigated namely; adhesive bonding layer between the two surfaces, and mechanical shear connectors. Because the volume fraction and specific surface area of the used <b>reinforcing</b> <b>meshes</b> in the present investigation are less than that specified by ACI (2006) and IFS (2001), the U-shaped forms were defined as reinforced mortar rather than Ferrocement forms to be consistent with the ACI and IFS definition.

30|$|Taken together, {{the tests}} {{described}} in this report highlight {{a number of important}} construction details and potential construction errors which may appear inconsequential to a building contractor, but which may have a profound impact on the structural fire response and integrity of a building during fire. Examples of this include integrity of fire stopping during large deformations, lapping of steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh,</b> anchorage of steel <b>reinforcing</b> <b>mesh</b> over shear studs on protected perimeter beams, use of deformed versus smooth bars for reinforcement (potentially leading to strain localization and tensile failure of deformed steel bars during fire), proper anchorage and grouting of hollowcore slabs, use of specific types of bolted steel connections to promote connection ductility and rotational capacity during fire, quality, uniformity, and robustness of structural fire protection materials (either passive or intumescent), and so on. Serious unknowns continue to surround many, if not all, of these issues, and {{there is a need for}} testing to support the development of best practice guidance which can be used to provide quality assurance programs on construction sites of so-called ‘fire engineered’ buildings.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the beams {{incorporating}} reinforced mortar forms had almost the same stiffness as the control beam upto its cracking load after which they were much stiffer than the control beam.

40|$|A ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{system was}} used to collect data over the {{different}} pavement sections of the Virginia Smart Road from June 1999 until December 2002. Three antennae at different frequencies were used for this research. The collected data were successfully {{used to evaluate the}} physical GPR detection limitations, to evaluate the GPR accuracy for pavement layer thickness determination, to control the installation of three different types of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>meshes</b> installed within the pavement, and to estimate the in-situ complex dielectric constant of several types of hot-mix asphalt (HMA). The data analysis results were verified by the well-documented structure and composition of each section of the road, in addition to the embedment of 35 copper plates (perfect electromagnetic reflectors) at the different layer interfaces during construction of the pavement. It was found that GPR is a feasible nondestructive tool to estimate the layer thicknesses of bound and unbound aggregate layers, HMA layers, and concrete slabs.
