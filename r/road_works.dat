At the Roe Highway interchange, an extra {{southbound}} lane is added, providing four lanes southbound and two lanes northbound, until the Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive interchange in Cockburn, where the freeway {{is reduced to}} two lanes in each direction until Pinjarra <b>Road.</b> <b>Works</b> are currently underway to add an extra lane southbound between Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive, and Russell Road in Hammond Park. The median strip of the freeway north of The Spectacles also houses the Mandurah railway line. A shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside the freeway.|$|E
50|$|Roadworks (called <b>road</b> <b>work</b> or <b>road</b> {{construction}} in the United States) occur when part of the road, or in rare cases, the entire road, has to be occupied for work relating to the road, most often {{in the case of}} road surface repairs. In the United States <b>road</b> <b>work</b> could also mean any work conducted in close proximity of travel way (thoroughfare) such as utility work or work on power lines (i.e. telephone poles). The general term of <b>road</b> <b>work</b> is known as work zone.|$|R

5|$|Works on {{the tram}} scheme were running two months ahead of {{schedule}} by September 2013, when Edinburgh Council announced the tramway would open by May 2014. All tram and <b>road</b> <b>works</b> were completed by 19 October with testing of the trams between the depot and Edinburgh Park commencing on 8 October 2013. This {{was followed by the}} energising of tram wires from Bankhead tram stop to York Place on 19 November, marking {{the first time that the}} route was completely energised. Testing along the full length of the route began on 5 December.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{ten years}} since its implementation, TfL {{reported}} that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network {{in order to improve}} the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in <b>road</b> <b>works</b> by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E
5|$|Nichols and Cooper {{came to an}} {{agreement}} about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in Knox County, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction. It was still paying off the bonds, but now the bridge was usable only by CEW workers. Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $25,000 annually for the bridge, of which $6,000 was {{to be used to}} maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on <b>road</b> <b>works</b> in Knox County.|$|E

25|$|A {{report by}} TfL in early 2007 {{indicated}} that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 before {{the introduction of the}} congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km, or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of <b>road</b> <b>works</b> {{in the latter half of}} 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned <b>road</b> <b>works</b> in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.|$|E

Elderly former BNCR Class I1 bogie brake tricomposite coaches dating from the 1890s supplemented the purpose built trailers and provided an interesting contrast between the latest technology and Victorian design.|$|E
25|$|The Eden House pub is {{situated}} on Grange Road near Marlay Park {{and is one}} of the highest pubs in Rathfarnham. The building was formerly Eden House, one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use by Patsy Kiernan who died in recent years. The pub was then sold in 2006 for €5.5m and is now run by owners of The Morgue Pub in Templeogue Village. The pub was completely renovated by the new owners, who awaited the completion of <b>road</b> <b>works</b> on the Grange Road before opening a new beer garden.|$|E

Holden, a Larne hotelier who had hired trains from the BNCR for his summer tours, {{approached}} the railway to provide him with a special train. York <b>Road</b> <b>works</b> built the all first class four-car train. Three of the coaches were saloons and the fourth was a restaurant car, all being furnished to a high standard. They were bogie vehicles with corridor connections; the lower body panels were finished in match boarding and the end doors were recessed {{in the manner of}} Pullman cars. Two six-wheel vans were fitted with corridor connections to work with the train.|$|E
