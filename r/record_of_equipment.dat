40|$|In a {{developing}} company or industry {{where there is}} availability of machines to keep the industry running effectively, a need always arise to consider the accessories and the spare parts which will enhance the production planning and also affects the economic growth of the company positively. An optimum model is developed to control the limited available budget that will be optimally allotted to accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous costs. This study considered the strategic decisions for budgeting, developed mathematical models for accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous, with considering the machines cost since it is available for the year under consideration. The models were tested and their performance evaluations carried out. A decision maker/project manager optimally allotted the limited resources to the considered strategic decisions to know exactly the amount that {{will be required to}} keep the machines functioning efficiently and effectively so that revenue can be generated. In allotting the limited resources for procurement, this study considered three major strategic decisions: accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous costs. Model for each strategic decision was developed. This study made it known that the highest value in any of these strategic decisions will definitely have the highest inventory in company’s stock for production. Information from the past procurement made by OLAM Cocoa Processing Industry (OCPI), Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria was used as case study to test the developed models for decisions making. Fifteen (15) years past <b>record</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> cost data was collected from this institute. A software was also developed for easy processing of this data using visual basic language because of its versatility and friendliness. Five million, five hundred thousand Naira (₦ 5, 500, 000) which is equivalent to more than Twenty – two thousand US dollar (US 22, 448. 98) was made available for the procurement of accessories, spare parts and miscellaneous costs and the amount allotted are ₦ 2, 190, 826. 18; ₦ 2, 861, 556. 10; and ₦ 447, 617. 71 respectively. This model is a strong decision tool for allocating available budget especially during the period of financial scarcity where equipment procurement for production needs must be carried out. This model is highly recommended to any manufacturing company, where equipment procurement affects their production in developed and developing countries...|$|E

40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} monitor the {{vibration}} levels of mining machinery and duration of exposure to vibration; to study work practices of operators of mining machineries and to predict health risk from vibration exposure to operators. Materials and Methods: Vibration levels <b>of</b> 157 mining <b>equipment</b> including dumpers, dozers, etc. in 10 opencast mines were measured through accelerometer and recorded in vibration analyzer. Root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration as well as vibration dose values along with duration of exposures per day were used to predict health risk in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997 standard. Video <b>records</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> operation were used to analyze job components. Results: Health risk was evaluated using RMS acceleration (0. 21 - 1. 82 m/s 2) and corresponding daily durations of exposure (2 - 7. 5 h). Forty two (27 %) <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> showed minimal health risk, 83 (53 %) equipment showed moderate and 32 (20 %) equipment showed high health risk to operators. While shovels and excavators showed minimal health risk, dozers and dumpers showed high health risk potential. x-axis was the dominant axis of vibration for loaders and dozers, whereas {{for the majority of}} dumpers and tippers, z-axis was dominant. Conclusion: Dumpers require engineering control for reducing the vibration in z-axis while measures are required for x-axis in loaders or dozers. Shovels or excavators do not require immediate attention except regular monitoring. Improvement in work practices are required to safeguard the workers from vibration related illness. It is recommended that proper guidelines for measurement and control of vibration at workplace should be formulated...|$|R
50|$|Field {{recording}} {{often involves}} {{the capture of}} ambient noises that are low level and complex, and, in response, the requirements from the field recordist have often pushed the technical limits <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> <b>equipment,</b> that is, demanding low noise and extended frequency response in a portable, battery-powered unit. For this reason, field recordists have favoured high-quality (usually professional) recorders, microphones, and microphone pre-amplifiers. The history <b>of</b> the <b>equipment</b> used in this area closely tracks the development of professional portable audio recording technology.|$|R

Objective: to characterize the maintenance management <b>of</b> biomedical <b>equipment</b> in emergency areas of medical institutions {{in the metropolitan area}} of Medellin during 2008 - 2009. Materials and methods: a survey was conducted with chiefs and maintenance technicians of eleven institutions classified at level 3, belonging to the health network of the municipality of Medellin. Results: among the medical institutions included in the present study, it was found that 80 % <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> failure was related with mishandling of the devices, and 70 % of maintenance work developed during the period of study was carried out by qualified Biomedical Technicians/ Technologist.

40|$|At {{requests}} from several insurance companies, more than 100 advisory opinions and expert conclusions on commercial vehicle driver's infringements {{in the field}} of compliance with the rules for working and resting times as well as for application <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> <b>equipment</b> (tachograph) in the local and international road haulage operations have been developed from 2008 to 2013. The aim of the research is to investigate the most common infringements of social provisions committed by commercial vehicle drivers involved in road transport accidents (RTA). The data included in this paper refer particularly to infringements committed by the drivers involved in driving vehicles which were registered in the Latvian registry. The paper summarizes and evaluates most common infringements of social legislation requirements for drivers involved in RTA in accordance with the Directive 2009 / 5 /EC of the European Commission and the corresponding Latvian Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 411 entered into force in 2008. Offences on drivers' allowed work and rest time periods, shortcomings at record keeping and inappropriate use <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> <b>equipment</b> (tachograph) by drivers of commercial vehicles are characterized in this paper based on findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies, advisory opinions and expert conclusions. The paper provides evaluation of infringements of social legislation requirements by their importance in relation to road safety, by type <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> <b>equipment</b> fitted to vehicles, by the quantity and type of offences committed simultaneously, as well as by other minor aspects. It was found that drivers have committed up to 10 different types of infringements at a single case. Most of the infringements discovered should be defined as very serious ones. Even in those cases when only one violation was found, in half of the cases it was defined as very serious infringement. The results of this paper will be further used in the next stage of research comparing the results obtained here with the data from regular roadside vehicle checks on the quantity and type of infringements of social legislation requirements...|$|R
