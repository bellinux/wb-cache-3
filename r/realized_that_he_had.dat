5|$|At 09:00, Washington {{arrived from}} Manhattan. He <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered {{more troops to}} Brooklyn from Manhattan. His {{location}} on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.|$|E
5|$|By 1854, Hindman <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{little room}} to {{maneuver}} in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics {{when he moved to}} Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Ground {{operations}} in Normandy were controlled by Montgomery at first, but SHAEF Forward headquarters moved to Jullouville in August, and on 1 September Eisenhower assumed control of Bradley's 12th Army Group and Montgomery's 21st Army Group. Smith soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made a mistake. The forward headquarters was remote and inaccessible, and it lacked the necessary communications equipment.|$|E

5|$|When Dave Toschi met Fincher, Fischer and Vanderbilt, the {{director}} {{told him that}} he was not going to make another Dirty Harry (which had been loosely based on the Zodiac case). Toschi was impressed with their knowledge of the case and afterwards, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> learned a lot from them. In addition, the Zodiac's two surviving victims, Mike Mageau and Bryan Hartnell were consultants on the film.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Poole {{announced}} the deletion of the /r9k/ ("ROBOT9000") and /new/ (News) boards, saying that /new/ had become devoted to racist discussions, and /r9k/ no longer served its original purpose {{of being a}} test implementation of xkcd's ROBOT9000 script. During the same year, the /soc/ board was created {{in an effort to}} reduce the number of socialization threads on /b/. /r9k/ was restored on October 23, 2011, along with /hc/ ("Hardcore", previously deleted), /pol/ (a rebranding of /new/) and the new /diy/ board, in addition to an apology by Poole where he recalls how he criticized the deletion of Encyclopedia Dramatica, and <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done the same.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> encountered {{a new phenomenon}} and {{was in a position}} to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to Stephen Tomašević's expectations, Bobovac fell within days. The King {{had already}} <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{no choice but}} to take refuge in the {{neighbouring}} Croatia or Dalmatia. Angelović tirelessly pursued him, and caught up with him in Ključ. The Ottoman army was reportedly about to pass the city's fortress, not suspecting that the King was hiding within its walls, when a local man revealed his whereabouts in return for money. A four-day-long siege of the fortress ensued. Eager to capture him, Angelović had his messengers solemnly promise the King that he would be done no harm if he surrendered, and sent him a document guaranteeing him freedom. With food supplies and ammunition running short, Stephen decided to surrender himself and his garrison to Angelović. Angelović, in turn, brought him, his uncle Radivoj and 13-year-old cousin Tvrtko before Mehmed in Jajce.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures and endeavors {{of the title}} {{character}} and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In the episode, SpongeBob is determined to have a perfect day. But much to his disappointment, however, the day refuses to go at all as he planned. Each of his friends has a different problem of his/her own, so he sets out to help them while spoiling his own agendas. As soon as SpongeBob <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> forfeited (and sacrificed) his perfect day to help his friends, they rally around him with their thanks and congratulations. Eventually, SpongeBob <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had his best day ever after all.|$|R

5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

25|$|When Apollo 12 {{launched}} on November 14, 1969, Aaron was on shift. Thirty-six seconds after liftoff, the spacecraft {{was struck by}} lightning, causing a power surge.

However, Aaron <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> previously seen this odd pattern of telemetry.|$|E

So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, a {{group of}} reform Republicans {{approached}} Roosevelt about running for Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife's resistance to being removed from the Washington social set. Soon after he declined, he <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career. He retreated to the Dakotas for a time; his wife Edith regretted {{her role in the}} decision and vowed {{that there would be no}} repeat of it.|$|E

Again, Pintarić was drunk when he committed the crime, and had no recollection of the event on the following day.
