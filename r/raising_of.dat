5|$|The {{wreck of}} the Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971. It was raised in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust, {{in one of the}} most complex and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E

5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even {{go so far as to}} be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E

The horses constituted an important element of the Baltic tribes' culture – men of the upper socioeconomic status were often buried with their horses and even together with their fancy horsemanship gear.|$|E
5|$|During peacetime and war, {{the command}} {{structure}} of the Northern Army remained the same. However, during times of great conflict and crisis, the <b>raising</b> <b>of</b> large militias required the appointment of many new officers with various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials during times of peace. Large divisions were led by a General (Jiangjun 將軍) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided {{into a number of}} regiments commanded by a Colonel, and sometimes by a Major. Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains, who ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, while companies were further divided into platoons.|$|E
