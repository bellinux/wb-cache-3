40|$|Public {{involvement}} {{is critical to}} the successful implementation of <b>reclaimed</b> water reuse programs. Based on the participatory research method, we studied the attitudes of the stakeholders who are involved in <b>reclaimed</b> water reuse in Beijing, China. Results showed that the general public&# 39;s knowledge on water resources was poor, while their awareness on <b>reclaimed</b> water reuse was high. The general public showed a strong acceptance of non-contact and non-potable <b>reclaimed</b> water reuse, but their acceptance of the three major water reuse types of river water supplement, park water supplement, and agriculture irrigation was not high. The beneficial use of <b>reclaimed</b> water was admired by water resource managers, industrial sectors, and researchers, and these stakeholders strongly supported the advancement of <b>reclaimed</b> water reuse. However, some of the stakeholders showed concerns about the potential risks from <b>reclaimed</b> wastewater reuse. Among them, risks from waste water treatment facilities were the biggest concern.

In this research, field {{study was conducted in}} 7 parks in Beijing with different histories of <b>reclaimed</b> water irrigation.

Results showed that soil nutrient conditions were ameliorated by <b>reclaimed</b> water irrigation, as indicated by the {{increase of}} soil organic matter content (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), and available phosphorus (AP). No soil salinization but a slight soil alkalization was observed under <b>reclaimed</b> water irrigation. Accumulation of heavy metals in soil was insignificant.

5|$|Relations {{between the}} Liao and the Song were {{initially}} peaceful, {{with the two}} dynasties exchanging embassies in 974. Following {{the collapse of the}} Tang dynasty, several territories formed small, independent states that were never reunified during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Additionally, several additional territories that were controlled by military governors during the Tang dynasty had fallen under the control of local warlords following the Tang collapse. Rather than focus on <b>reclaiming</b> land from the Liao dynasty, Zhao Kuangyin, who would take the title Emperor Taizu of Song, focused on <b>reclaiming</b> these smaller break-off territories. He would die in 976 having reestablished control over all but one of these territories, the Northern Han kingdom. Despite the Northern Han's status as a protectorate of the Liao dynasty, Emperor Taizu of Song launched an invasion of the kingdom in 976, only months before his death. The Northern Han received assistance from the Liao, and the invasion was repelled. Emperor Taizong of Song, brother of the founding emperor and the second emperor of the Song dynasty, launched a second invasion in 979. The Northern Han again received Liao assistance, but this invasion was successful; the Northern Han crumbled, and the Song were able to assume control of the territory. Emperor Taizong of Song immediately followed this victory with an attempted invasion of the sixteen prefectures, but the unrested and undersupplied Song troops were thoroughly routed by the Liao in the Battle of Gaoliang River.|$|E
