40|$|Mono summing {{is often}} used as a quality check in {{different}} audio industries. It’s used when sound engineers wants to get an appropriate estimation on how the material will behave in different kind of setups such as stores, radio broadcasting. One of the more recent mono devices is the smartphone and {{there are millions of}} users allover the world. "In 1961 US started to broadcast radio in stereo. The monophonic users were outnumbering the stereophonic users and this quality check was a necessity {{to make sure that the}} monophonic listener would be able to get the main message and/or the essence of the material that was broadcasted. One might say the situation reminds a bit of today's millions of smartphones when playing through the phones speaker. The method of mono summing, left channel + right channel, hasn’t changed since and the technique has been a standard for a long time. The standard is well established but it hasn’t been questioned in more recent time. "The aim with the study is to find out if there may be an alternative way to mono summing and if the conversion from stereo to mono can be done in way that would <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>in</b> a more authentic way. "Alternative mono conversions have been evaluated in listening tests. The results shows no major interest for an alternative mono conversion. It is still difficult to tell whether there might be a better way to mono summing and more research has to be done with other conversions, more songs and genres.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this section is to give some very brief and {{necessarily}} quite simplified background to Hilbert spaces with <b>reproducing</b> kernel. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>in</b> this section, proofs etc., can be found in [42, 77]. There are several studies {{in the literature of}} sampling {{to be found in the}} general area of reproducing kernel spaces, and we can ask whether results of the present paper might be given more general forms in that theory. For example, Nashed and his associates have given sampling theorems in certain Hilbert, Banach, Sobolev and translation invariant spaces, and addressed such probems as <b>the</b> construction of <b>reproducing</b> kernel Hilbert and Banach spaces with a given sampling set (see, e. g., [59]). Much of this work is quite technical and uses, e. g., iterative methods. Saitoh’s theory of linear transformations of Hilbert space offers another possibility for this kind of extension (see, e. g., [77]).|$|R

Besides their diffuse application in solid rocket nozzles, their use also {{emerges as a}} valid alternative in liquid rocket engines. Together with the growing interest in oxygen/methane liquid rocket engines, these materials have gained attention as possible insulator for small upperstage engines or in-space thrusters. In this framework, a validated approach {{for the study of}} carbon-based pyrolyzing and non-pyrolyzing materials, together with a novel boundary condition developed to analyze <b>the</b> silica-based <b>material</b> behavior, has been used to numerically <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highly oxidizing environment generated by the combustion of oxygen and methane. At first, the validation against experimental data of <b>the</b> silica-based <b>material</b> erosion model is presented. Subsequently, the behavior and the response of different ablators in a oxygen/methane environment is numerically investigated {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions. Commonly made assumptions in the simulation of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> response are thoroughly analyzed and a critical overview of the results is presented. © 2012 by Alessandro Turchi, Daniele Bianchi, Francesco Nasuti, Renato Marocco...|$|R

In the present work, a self-consistent (SC) model is used in order to predict the stress state at the microscopic scale (fiber and matrix) induced by the real and accelerated cycles.

40|$|A brief {{review of}} the {{technological}} advances of the Hopkinson bar technique in tension {{for the study of}} irradiated/non-irradiated nuclear <b>materials</b> and <b>the</b> development of this technology for large specimens is presented. Comparisons are made of the dynamic behaviour of non-irradiated and irradiated materials previously subjected to creep, low cycle fatigue and irradiation (2, 10 and 30 displacements per atom). In particular, complete results of the effect of irradiation on the dynamic mechanical properties of AISI 304 L steel, tested at 20, 400 and 550 ◦C are presented. These high strain rate tests have been performed with a modified Hopkinson bar (MHB), installed inside a hot cell. Examples of testing large nuclear steel specimens with a very large Hopkinson bar are also shown. The results overall demonstrate the capability of the MHB to efficiently <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> stress conditions <b>in</b> case of accidental internal and external dynamic loadings in nuclear reactors, thus contributing to the important process of their structural assessment.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} in computer-aided polymer processing have brought along {{the need for}} accurate description of the behaviour of viscoelastic <b>materials</b> under <b>the</b> conjugated effect of applied stress and temperature. In order to serve this purpose, in this study, experimental data provided by bubble inflation tests for flat circular thermoplastic membranes (CTPM) comprised of viscoelastic materials when subjected to combined effects of applied stress and temperature are coupled with numerical simulations to obtain the required parameters for the characterisation of such materials. First, pressure inside the bubble and height at the hemispheric pole are recorded during bubble inflation experiment. Thereafter, Christensen's theory of viscoelasticity is employed to define the constitutive model of flat circular thermoplastic membranes (CTPM) and nonlinear equilibrium equations of the inflation process are solved using finite difference method with deferred corrections. As a last step, a neuronal algorithm (ANN model) is employed to minimise the difference between calculated and measured parameters to determine material constants for Christensen viscoelastic model. Although the developed procedure {{can be applied to}} several polymeric <b>materials,</b> <b>in</b> this paper, this technique is successfully implemented for high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), at typical thermoforming temperatures, 150 and 145 °C, respectively. Using these coefficients, <b>the</b> <b>material</b> behaviours of HIPS and ABS with Christensen's constitutive law are <b>reproduced.</b> <b>The</b> <b>material</b> model obtained <b>in</b> this study for HIPS and ABS can be implemented into industrial and academic softwares for applications and design purposes...|$|R
40|$|Typically, for a fatigue {{strength}} {{assessment of a}} welded structure, the influence of welding residual stresses has to be considered. An easy applicable approach is given {{within the framework of}} the IIW recommendations; the design S-N curves can be upgraded in case of medium or low residual stresses. A relaxation or redistribution of tensile residual stresses, which is often accompanied by an increase in fatigue life, cannot be considered. To obtain a better understanding of the residual stresses and their influence on the {{fatigue strength}}, fatigue tests have been performed on longitudinal stiffeners in as-welded and stress relieved state with both stress ratios R = - 1 and R = 0. Local strains and stresses were measured using strain gauges and X-ray diffraction technique to get insight into <b>the</b> local <b>material's</b> response due to global loading close to the weld toe. The crack initiation and propagation phase was detected by a camera. FE models were set up to <b>reproduce</b> <b>the</b> observed <b>material</b> behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> notch for the crack initiation phase. By numerical analysis it could be shown that, due to sharp notches at the weld toe with an average toe radius of r = 0. 05 mm, a stress redistribution occurs during the first load cycle. This leads to a fatigue strength, which is, particularly at higher load amplitudes, independent from mean as well as from initial residual stresses. A comparison of fatigue data derived on longitudinal stiffeners from literature confirms this effect. For lower load amplitudes instead, mean and residual stresses gain more influence. In this investigation a reliable assessment of the crack initiation period could be performed with strain-based concepts using damage parameter PSWT for a mean stress assessment. All fatigue tests could be transformed into a single damage parameter P SWT-N curve with a low scatter if residual stresses as well as the distortion of the specimens are regarded...|$|R
