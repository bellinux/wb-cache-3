25|$|In {{hermetic}} {{and most}} semi-hermetic compressors, the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated, and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system.

25|$|The HVAC {{system uses}} an AC {{induction}} motor {{to drive a}} sealed-system scroll compressor, a design principle not usually used in automotive applications. Using a scroll compressor increases {{the efficiency of the}} system, while driving it with an AC induction motor makes the system more flexible, so the AC can run while the engine is off. Because the oil used with the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> also flows {{in the area of the}} high-voltage motor-windings, the fluid must be electrically insulating to avoid transmitting electric current to exposed metal parts of the system. Therefore, Toyota specifies a POE oil (designated ND11) is required for repairs. The system cannot be serviced with equipment normally employed for regular cars, which typically use PAG oils, as the equipment would contaminate the ND11 oil with PAG oil. According to SAE J2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1% PAG when filling. One percent PAG oil may result in an electrical resistance drop by a factor of about 10.|$|E

5000|$|At an {{environmental}} level, {{the impact of}} refrigeration is due to: atmospheric emissions of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases</b> used in refrigerating installations and the energy consumption of these refrigerating installations which contribute to CO2 emissions - and consequently to global warming - thus reducing global energy resources. The atmospheric emissions of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases</b> {{are based on the}} leaks occurring in insufficiently leak-tight refrigerating installations or during maintenance-related refrigerant-handling processes.|$|R

25|$|Phosgene {{may also}} be {{produced}} during testing for leaks of older-style refrigerant gases. Chloromethanes (R12, R22 and others) were formerly leak-tested in situ by employing a small gas torch (propane, butane or propylene gas) with a sniffer tube and a copper reaction plate in the flame nozzle of the torch. If any <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> was leaking from a pipe or joint, the gas would be sucked into the flame through the sniffer tube and would cause a colour change of the gas flame to a bright greenish blue. In the process, phosgene gas would be created due to the thermal reaction. No valid statistics are available, but anecdotal reports suggest that numerous refrigeration technicians suffered the effects of phosgene poisoning due to their ignorance of the toxicity of phosgene, produced during such leak testing. Electronic sensing of refrigerant gases phased out the use of flame testing for leaks in the 1980s. Similarly, phosgene poisoning is a possibility for people fighting fires {{that occur in the}} vicinity of refrigerant leaks from air-conditioning systems or refrigeration equipment, smoking in the vicinity of a freon refrigerant leak, or fighting fires using halon or halotron.|$|E

50|$|Making organic {{fluorides}} is {{the main}} use for hydrofluoric acid, consuming over 40% of it (over 20% of all mined fluorite). Within organofluorides, <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases</b> are still the dominant segment, consuming about 80% of HF. Even though chlorofluorocarbons are widely banned, the replacement refrigerants are often other fluorinated molecules. Fluoropolymers are less than one quarter the size of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases</b> in terms of fluorine usage, but are growing faster. Fluorosurfactants are a small segment in mass but are significant economically because of very high prices.|$|R
50|$|Freon {{was used}} as the {{original}} brand name for electronic gases produced and marketed by DuPont. With the depletion of the ozone layer and the subsequent phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gas compounds, the company rebranded this product line to differentiate from <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases</b> that had been using the same Freon brand name.|$|R
2500|$|Because of fluorine's tight bonding {{as well as}} the {{toxicity}} of hydrogen fluoride, the element resisted many attempts to isolate it. In 1886, French chemist Henri Moissan, later a Nobel Prize winner, succeeded in making elemental fluorine by electrolyzing a mixture of potassium fluoride and hydrogen fluoride. Large-scale production and use of fluorine began during World War 2 as part of the Manhattan Project. Earlier in the century, the main fluorochemicals were commercialized by the DuPont company: [...] <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases</b> (Freon) and polytetrafluoroethylene plastic (Teflon).|$|R
50|$|Refrigerant {{reclamation}} is the act {{of processing}} used <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> which has previously been used in some type of cooling loop such that it meets specifications for new <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas.</b> In the United States, the Clean Air Act of 1990 requires that used refrigerant be processed by a certified reclaimer, which must be licensed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the material must be recovered and delivered to the reclaimer by EPA-certified technicians.|$|E

50|$|Refrigeration {{compressors}} {{are essentially}} a pump for <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas.</b> The {{capacity of the}} compressor,and hence the chiller cooling capacity, is measured in kilowatts input (kW), Horse power input (HP), orvolumetric flow (m3/h, ft3/h). The mechanism for compressing <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> differs betweencompressors, and {{each has its own}} application. Common refrigeration compressors includereciprocating, scroll, screw, or centrifugal. These can be powered by electric motors, steam turbines, orgas turbines. Compressors can have an integrated motor from a specific manufacturer, or be open drive--allowing the connection to another type of mechanical connection. Compressors can also be eitherHermetic (welded closed) or semihermetic (bolted together).|$|E

Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|R

50|$|Evaporators can be {{plate type}} or {{shell and tube}} type.

50|$|Inside the building, the gas {{passes through}} a {{pressure}} valve into heat exchanger coils. There, the hot <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> condenses back to a liquid and transfers the stored latent heat to the indoor air, water heating or hot water system.

50|$|Condensers can be air-cooled, water-cooled, or evaporative. The {{condenser}} is a {{heat exchanger}} whichallows heat to migrate from the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> to either water or air.

40|$|Refrigerated road {{transport}} (RRT) vehicles are large users of energy, and reportedly have relatively high leakage of hydrofluorocarbon <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases,</b> {{both of which}} contribute to global warming. The experience obtained from widespread research in leak reduction in stationary refrigeration systems can be instructive in combatting leakage in RRT systems, which has received less focus to date. This paper will take an integrated approach to develop and describe a preliminary model for sustainable RRT systems. It will first review lessons learned about refrigerant leakage in stationary systems {{in an effort to}} identify problematic/leak prone components common to transport refrigeration systems. This will then be followed by a survey of recent studies conducted in modelling transport refrigeration systems to advance energy efficiency. Initial results from the model illustrate the need to improve the efficiency of the refrigeration system, together with preventative maintenance of the box structure and refrigeration system as a whole...|$|R
40|$|GE Global Research's overall {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} novel thermotunneling-cooling device. The end use for these devices is the replacement of vapor cycle compression (VCC) units in residential and commercial cooling and refrigeration systems. Thermotunneling devices offer many advantages over vapor cycle compression cooling units. These include quiet, reliable, non-moving parts operation without <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gases.</b> Additionally theoretical calculations suggest that the efficiency of thermotunneling devices can be 1. 5 - 2 x that of VCC units. Given these attributes {{it can be seen that}} thermotunneling devices have the potential for dramatic energy savings and are environmentally friendly. A thermotunneling device consists of two low work function electrodes separated by a sub 10 nanometer-sized gap. Cooling by thermotunneling refers to the transport of hot electrons across the gap, from the object to be cooled (cathode) to the heat rejection electrode (anode), by an applied potential. GE Global Research's goal was to model, design, fabricate devices and demonstrate cooling base on the thermotunneling technology...|$|R
50|$|Some CDM {{projects}} remove {{or destroy}} industrial gases, such as hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O).

The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units.|$|E
50|$|Coolant and {{refrigerants}} {{are found}} throughout the industrialized world, in homes, offices, and factories, in devices such as refrigerators, air conditioners, central air conditioning systems (HVAC), freezers, and dehumidifiers.

Mistreatment of these gases has been shown to deplete the ozone layer and is suspected to contribute to global warming.|$|E
50|$|Circulating <b>refrigerant</b> <b>gas</b> vapor (which {{also carries}} the {{compressor}} lubricant oil across the system along with it) from the evaporator enters the gas compressor {{in the engine}} bay and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser, usually {{in front of the}} car's radiator. Here the refrigerant is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils (originating from the vehicle's movement or from a fan, often the same fan of the cooling radiator if the condenser is mounted on it, automatically turned on when the vehicle is stationary or moving at low speeds) and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air.|$|E

The investigation was undertaken as an initial assessment of the viability of this process as a treatment option for waste mixtures of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and as a potential route for the synthesis of CH₂=CF₂ (VDF). During the reaction, CH₂=CF₂ is observed as the major product formed and a 43 % selectivity to CH₂=CF₂ is obtained at 1073 K. A detailed mechanism is developed based on the mechanistic analysis from kinetic modeling, with the initiation reaction involving the formation of CI radicals from CCI₂F₂.

50|$|In refrigeration, flash-gas is <b>refrigerant</b> in <b>gas</b> form {{produced}} spontaneously {{when the}} condensed liquid {{is subjected to}} boiling. The presence of flash-gas in the liquid lines reduces {{the efficiency of the}} refrigeration cycle. It can also lead several expansion systems to work improperly, and increase superheating at the evaporator. This is normally perceived as an unwanted condition caused by dissociation between the volume of the system, and the pressures and temperatures that allow the refrigerant to be liquid. Flash-gas must not be confused with lack of condensation, but special gear such as receivers, internal heat exchangers, insulation, and refrigeration cycle optimizers may improve condensation and avoid gas in the liquid lines.|$|R
