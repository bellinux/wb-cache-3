25|$|Observant Jews {{will eat}} only meat or poultry that is {{certified}} kosher. The meat {{must have been}} slaughtered by a shochet (ritual slaughterer) in accordance with Jewish law and is entirely drained of blood. Before it is cooked, it is soaked in water for half an hour, then placed on a perforated board, sprinkled with coarse salt (which draws out the blood), and left to sit for one hour. At {{the end of this}} time, the salt is washed off and the meat is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>cooking.</b> Today, kosher meats purchased from a butcher or supermarket are usually already kashered as described above, and no additional soaking or salting is required.|$|E
25|$|Rice is {{a staple}} food in Gullah {{communities}} {{and continues to}} be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>cooking.</b> The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that one would have to stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.|$|E

50|$|A private {{house in}} this {{neighbourhood}} rented at 4 a week {{was pointed out}} to me because its inmates had suffered a good deal of sickness, scarlet fever, measles, etc. Here in the back yard measuring about 10 ft by 5 ft I found that the privy was only separated from the scullery by a wall four and a half inches thick and that it stood nine inches higher than the scullery floor. By the privy and forming part of it was an open ashpit full of disgusting filth. The rain keeps this filth {{in a constant state of}} moisture, so that the excremental matter percolates through the rotting wall of the scullery, and yet against this wall there are shelves where cooking utensils are placed. On the morning of my visit, some potatoes, <b>ready</b> peeled <b>for</b> <b>cooking,</b> were piled up against that part of the wall which was permeated with the moisture from the privy. When it rains the amount of water coming through the wall from the privy and into the scullery is much greater and the scullery is only separated from the living room by a door which generally remains open.|$|R
40|$|Albania records 300 {{sunny days}} of typical sub tropical/Mediterranean climate. 70 % of the mountainous regions may pose not-so-suitability for typical {{cultivable}} agricultural food crops {{so there are}} possibilities to look at nonfood crop sectors to harness renewable biomass energy for better livelihood of Albanians, the country marching towards renewable biomasses and estimates that by 2025 the penetration of family market heaters alone shall be of an average of 80 % yield. On the contrary Albania is faced with soil erosion due to overgrazing and removal of forests through illegal logging in the hilly mountain regions. The authors after a crucial study suggest to go in for cultivation of thornless and flowerless Bamboo for sustainable renewable biomass energy as biofuels to harness not only electricity but also as gasification and as <b>ready</b> briquetts <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> and water heating purposes. As of now the country is progressing with reforestation programs with economically viable option. According the authors cultivation of bamboo has two other purposes as soil rejuvenation by the enormous leaf fall that undergo natural decomposition to re-make of forest soils and to enter into faster reforestation programs by employing rural communities having tradition knowledge (tk) for economically sustainable cottage industrial programs for economic as well as socio-cultural improvements.

60|$|Grahame lighted a {{cigarette}} and glanced about the square, for Rio Frio was waking up. Here and there a woman of mixed blood crouched beside a cast-iron pot, fanning the handful of charcoal in it, <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> the evening meal. A team of mules hauled a heavy load across the hot paving stones, a gaunt, dark-faced man in ragged cotton walking at the leaders' heads. Then came a pack train, with jingling bells, a cloud of flies following the burdened animals, and dusty, barefooted peasants plodding by their side. A group of women appeared {{from the mouth of}} a narrow street, their faces wet with perspiration and straps across their foreheads supporting the big cane baskets on their backs. After them came a negro with a great tray of fruit upon his head. Next, three or four lean, barefooted fellows with ragged palm-leaf hats seated themselves on the pavement in a strip of shadow. They sat there, silent and motionless, contemplating the scene with listless eyes. The crowd looked dully apathetic, there was languor in the air they breathed; but, after all, they claimed descent from Spanish stock and Grahame thought they could be roused. It does not need much fanning to wake the smoldering fire in the Iberian's veins.|$|E

50|$|A cooking apple is {{an apple}} {{that is used}} {{primarily}} <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> rather than eating raw. Cooking apples are larger, and can be tarter than eating varieties. Some varieties have a firm flesh that does not break down much when cooked. Culinary varieties with a high acid content become a froth when cooked, which is desirable for some recipes. The British grow a large range of apples specifically <b>for</b> <b>cooking,</b> but such varieties are used worldwide, although apples eaten raw are also used <b>for</b> <b>cooking</b> purposes.

It can then be served immediately, hot, or can be left to cool down {{so that it can be}} served cold.|$|E
