50|$|The {{techniques}} used by Bluegrass are particularly advantageous {{when applied to}} heavy industry. Diamond wire sawing allows for precise cutting of concrete and metal {{with the benefit of}} being free of vibration, debris and dust. It does not compromise the integrity of adjacent structures, leaves a smooth exposed surface, and can be deployed in confined spaces by using remote control operations and/or free-form saws. Also, and often the most significant factor, is the advantage of supporting project schedule by providing a predictable outcome. Examples of application to heavy industry include foundation removals and modifications, chest removals in the pulp and paper industry, brick and refractory removal primarily using robotic hammers, and boiler segmentation. In many industrial plants such as cememt, lime, copper, aluminum, and chemical, the kiln's <b>refractory</b> lining <b>wears</b> out and needs to be replaced, or is compromised by lime buildup which must be removed. For these demolition jobs, remotely operated robotic hammers are used to break up the refractory for removal, and for chipping off lime deposits.|$|R
40|$|When designing, {{engineering}} and constructing the hearth {{wall of a}} blast furnace, traditional thinking predicts that the hearth wall will erode to {{the locations of the}} 1, 150 ˚C isotherm. This philosophy is {{based on the fact that}} at elevated carbon content (> 2 %), iron solidifies at 1, 150 ˚C. In strict thermo-chemical theory, it is impossible for a carbon hearth wall <b>refractory</b> to <b>wear</b> beyond that point. Operators even use this theory in their online thermal models to estimate current wear by extrapolating the location of the 1, 150 ˚C isotherm from actual temperature measurements. As we will show examples of in this paper, the theory fails to explain why in reality, most large-block hearth walls experience much more severe wear over their lifetimes. It is often reported that block hearth walls have minimal refractory remaining, the carbon blocks are cracked and brittle, and that the wear dictated the end of the furnace campaign, or at least a major repair. Such results are inconsistent with the theory, yet its use continues without regard for its shortcomings. It is also well known that oxidation, thermal stress and chemical attack occur at such elevated temperatures in the blast furnace hearth wall. This paper discuss these root causes of hearth failure in more detail and suggest how these should be taken in consideration when selecting refractory materials and designing hearth walls for best performance in modern high productivity blast furnaces, in line with steel companies’ continuous drive for better results...|$|R

They suffer from acute wear due to the stringent chemical, thermal and mechanical conditions imposed. Although postmortem investigation of <b>worn</b> <b>refractories</b> is indispensable to study the degradation mechanisms, its application is often hampered by evaluation difficulties due to crystallisation phenomena occurring during in situ cooling. To study the actual microstructures at elevated temperatures, industrially <b>worn</b> and virgin <b>refractory</b> samples were reheated and quenched in a cylindrical single-mode microwave furnace. Usage of a tubular susceptor allowed reproducible hybrid heating of the samples up to 1800 degreesC, The quenched samples were analysed with SEM and EPMA-EDS.

40|$|The work {{discussed}} in this thesis is aimed at examining the formation of freeze layers and <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> on water-cooling elements within direct smelting processes {{through the use of}} computational modelling techniques. The motivation of performing this work is to examine the cooling of regions of the Smelt Reduction Vessel of the HIsmelt process closer to the molten bath material. HIsmelt is a novel process for the production of pig iron which has been under development by Rio Tinto and is now being ommercialised. The previous work performed in this are has been reviewed with particular focus on the <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms as the solidification algorithms have been thoroughly implemented within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework PHYSCIA used within this work. The governing equations along with the Finite Volume discretisations of these equations are set out within this thesis. Some comment is made about the solution methods used, and how boundary conditions are implemented. The Free-surface flow and Solidification governing relationships are also described as these are important for investigating the formation of freeze layers. The implementation of the <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms are {{discussed in}} some detail. The three mechanisms implemented are for the penetration of slag into the refractory, the corrosion of the refractory by this penetrated slag; and the erosion of the refractory by the bulk flow of slag within the furnace. To be able to reasonably predict <b>refractory</b> <b>wear,</b> it is necessary to make the properties of the materials within the system temperature dependent. During the pilot plant trials at the HIsmelt® Research and Development facility, located in Kwinana Western Australia, accretions formed {{on the end of the}} solids injection lances. These accretions have been termed Elephant's Trunks. With the imminent construction of the Development Plant which injects the iron bearing feeds at an elevated temperature rather than at ambient temperatures used on the pilot plant, the formation of these pipe-like accretions under both the cold and hot injection conditions have been examined. This work provides confidence that the freeze layers predicted from the model will reflect those formed within the furnace. To evaluate the effectiveness of the <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms, data from experimental and the HIsmelt pilot plant have been modelled. Sections of refractory samples from an induction furnace test and a rotary slag test have been modelled. The results are in agreement with the profile and affected regions of the sectioned refractory test pieces. A part of the HIsmelt pilot plant Smelt Reduction Vessel (SRV) has been modelled for the period of campaign 8 - 1 & 8 - 2 (just over 20 days). The predicted wear is in agreement with the measurements taken after the vessel had been cooled. To bring together freeze layer formation with the <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> mechanisms, a water-cooled element was modelled for the sloping slag section. The results show the growth of a small freeze layer that is consistent with the small freeze layer seen on the upper cooling panels of the pilot plant SRV. This model is an ideal tool to evaluate different water-cooling strategies for HIsmelt and other similar direct smelting processes. This work has developed models that predict the formation of freeze layers and <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> within direct smelting processes. The models have focused on slag-refractory interactions and further work would be needed to extend the <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> models to account for metal-refractory interactions. To examine spalling, stress calculations could be performed to determine when this may occur...|$|E

In the present work, worn bricks from different zones in the ladle have been analysed, {{and a set of}} interdependent degradation mechanisms is proposed. <b>Refractory</b> <b>wear</b> as a function of position in the ladle is discussed. Slag infiltration and MgO dissolution from the refractory were observed in all samples, whereas FeOx decomposition was seen at two levels in the high wear samples. First, partial decomposition of primary chromite crystals ((Mg) [Fe 3 +, Cr, Al](2) O- 4) occurred at the hot face of the brick. Three layers were distinguished in the reacted chromite crystals and a reaction mechanism is presented. Second, a decrease in the FeOx content of the magnesia phase occurred at the hot face of the brick. The negative effect of the presence of FeOx in magnesia-chromite refractories is discussed and the influence of the ferrostatic pressure is demonstrated.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of magnesia-chromite refractory by an alumina-rich (15 - 20 wt. %) stainless steelmaking stag is {{investigated by}} rotating finger tests {{in a vacuum}} induction furnace. The influence on the <b>refractory</b> <b>wear,</b> of the process temperature, corrosion time and, in particular, the high Al 2 O 3 content in the slag, is discussed. Two distinct mechanisms cause primary chromite degradation: FeOx and Cr 2 O 3 decomposition because of low oxygen potentials and dissolution by infiltrated slag due to the high Al 2 O 3 slag content. Upon decomposition, small metallic particles and pores are homogeneously generated inside the primary chromite. At the refractory/slag interface, a relatively continuous solid (Mg,Mn) [Al,Cr](2) O- 4 spinel layer is formed. Its density and stability decreases with higher temperatures and more turbulent conditions. The spinel formation arises through heterogeneous in situ precipitation from a slag rich in spinel forming compounds. Higher Al 2 O 3 levels in the slag promote the spinet layer formation, which may limit slag infiltration. Finally, it is shown that the present experimental procedure is an excellent tool to simulate <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> in industrial processes, diminishing {{the risks associated with}} plant trials.

Hence improved understanding of these interactions may have implications for the campaign life of the blast furnace hearth refractory materials. The interactions between the coke ash minerals and aluminosilicate hearth refractory have been assessed by heating samples of calcium aluminates (CA, CA 2 2 ̆ 6 CA 6) coupled with aluminosilicate refractory to temperatures representative of the blast furnace hearth (1450 degrees C to 1550 degrees C) in an inert atmosphere over a range of reaction times (4 - 24 hours).

The wear rate, Wr, of MgO-C bricks tested using steel at 1550 °C depends strongly on tuyere characters and increases with M*' until M*'=l, similar to the trends for the back attack and disk Wr.

40|$|Melting {{steel scrap}} and alloys in an {{electric}} arc furnace (EAF) {{is the first step}} in stainless steel production. Further processing of the liquid steel is then carrying out in an Argon Oxygen Decarburisation (AOD) converter. The main objective of the treatment in the AOD converter is to reduce the carbon content to a target value by injecting an oxygen-argon mixture. During this decarburisation step unavoidably some chromium and other alloying elements with high affinity to oxygen are oxidised and ends up in the slag. To obtain an acceptable yield of these alloying elements is necessary to reduce the slag in the AOD converter after the decarburisation with either aluminium or ferrosilicon. In the case of aluminium reduction, the final slag after reduction is generally composed of lime (CaO) and aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3). The denomination of the slag is Al-reduced AOD-slag and at the moment this has no practical use and is stored as landfill. Therefore, the slag ought to be recycled due to financial and environmental reasons. Within the present work, recirculation of Al-reduced AOD-slag to the EAF as slag former has been examined by theoretical analysis and practical trial using a small rotating kiln. The main aim of the thermodynamic calculations was to investigate how much of the Al-reduced AOD-slag is needed to reduce the activity of silicate in the slag and thereby depressing the loss of chromium to the slag. The second phase of the study was designed to investigate the effect of added Al-reduced AOD slag on <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> during trials in a rotary kiln. During these trials the kiln was lined with four different types of bricks, supplied by the three companies participating in this project – Vargön Alloys AB, Outokumpu Stainless AB Avesta and Sandvik Materials Technology. The thermodynamic calculations disclose that a significant decrease of the activity of SiO 2 could be observed with only 5 weights per cent addition of Al-reduced AOD-slag. Furthermore, the result showed that 15 weight per cent of Al-reduced AOD-slag in the EAF slag can be recycled to the EAF without a large impact on the refractory material.

We suspect a mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients to be the cause of crack initiation. These cracks lead finally to spalling of degraded refractory layers.

The ability of the tap-hole clay to form a protective layer on the brick, thereby limiting matte penetration was investigated by examining the interaction between platinum group metal (PGM) matte, tap-hole clay, and alumina-chrome refractory bricks on a laboratory scale. Samples containing clay and brick as well as samples containing clay, brick, and matte were heated to different temperatures to establish the clay-brick interaction and the extent of matte penetration. The greatest degree of physical contact between the brick and clay was achieved at curing temperatures of 600 °C. Poor clay-brick contact was observed in the sample that was heated to 900 °C. Matte displaced the clay in the clay-brick-matte sample that was heated to 1350 °C, with significant matte penetration into the brick.

Slag-refractory interaction was studied after two and four hours holding time at 1367 °C ± 1. 8 °C, 1464 °C ± 2. 1 °C and 1600 °C - 0. 6 °C /+ 0. 2 °C. Holding temperatures were verified through the wire-bridge method at the melting points of gold and palladium. Visual inspection, as well as optical microscopy and SEM, were utilized to examine the samples after heat treatment. During compatibility experiments, dissolution of refractory matrix due to solubility of oxide refractory binder phases in silicomanganese slags was observed, as well as disintegration of refractory particles due to gas formation at slag-refractory interface, or expansion as a result of phase transformations in refractory material. Direct reduction of manganese oxide from slags and iron oxide present in refractories by carbon and silicon carbide was also observed. Establishment of partial slag-metal equilibriums between iron oxide and silicon metal originally present in slag was observed, as well as formation of silicon carbide at the slag-refractory interfaces. The latter may serve to protect the refractory from wear caused by slags. Based on observations of extensive interaction between silicomanganese slag sample I and ramming paste at 1600 °C, the ramming paste investigated cannot be recommended for usage during tap block repair in an industrial silicomanganese furnace. Incipient electrode paste disintegration by slags and silicon carbide tap block slag interaction were observed after compatibility tests at 1464 °C, calling for further investigations of these refractory materials. Tap hole clay and carbon tap block showed minimal signs of interaction with process materials at 1464 °C. Refractory porosity seemed to have a larger effect on <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> than refractory ash content. Contrary to industrial observations, silicomanganese slag sample I was more corrosive towards the ramming paste and electrode paste investigated than silicomanganese slag sample II...|$|E
40|$|The {{gasification}} {{industry has}} identified improved performance of entrained flow gasifiers {{as a key}} item to reduce the technical and financial risk associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plants. Recent review papers by [Steigel et al, 2001] and [Holt, 2001 b] identified several items {{that could lead to}} improved Reliability, Availability and Maintainability of solid fuel gasifiers. Specific problem areas that were identified in these papers include fuel injector life, <b>refractory</b> <b>wear,</b> carbon conversion and slag management. A better understanding of these phenomena and how they are impacted by operational changes such as fuel type, slurry content and oxidant flow rate would be highly beneficial. As noted by Steigel and Holt, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of gasifiers could assist in building the required knowledge base. Over the last ten years, CFD modeling has {{played an important role in}} improving the performance of the current fleet of pulverized coal fired electric utility boilers. Likewise, CFD modeling can provide insights into the flow field within the gasifier that will lead to improved performance. Used correctly, a CFD model is a powerful tool that can be used to address many problems. Incorporated into the model is the gasifier geometry, operating conditions and gasification processes. The outputs, or predicted values, from the CFD model are quite extensive and can provide localized information at hundreds of thousands of points within the gasifier. An excellent review of recent CFD modeling studies for gasifier systems is available in [IEA, 2000]...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study of}} the Direct Current Electric Arc Furnace (DC-EAF) for steel-making {{has been carried out}} through the development of a rigorous mathematical model. The mathematical representation involves the simultaneous solution of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields, and the turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer equations. In solving the arc and bath regions it was assumed (and justified) that the arc-bath interactions are dominated by the behavior of the arc. In contrast to previous modeling investigations, this work relaxes some critical assumptions and provides a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the system. This work also examines and compares the relative merits of alternative electromagnetic and turbulence formulations, and addresses the role of induced currents and compressibility effects in the representation of the arc. Furthermore, due allowance was made to represent and analyze the effect of gas injection, the presence of a slag layer in the bath and changes in anode configuration {{at the bottom of the}} reactor. Because of a lack of experimental information on actual or pilot plant DC-EAF systems, different aspects of the model were validated using several sources of experimental data reported in the literature for related systems. These included measurements on welding arcs, laboratory scale high-intensity carbon arcs, electromagnetically driven metallic systems, and ladle metallurgy physical models. It was found that, in general, the agreement between measurements and predictions was good. A detailed analysis was carried out to examine the effect of process parameters (e. g., arc current, arc length, bath dimensions, anode arrangements, etc) on the behavior of the furnace (e. g., heat transfer to the bath, heating efficiency, mixing times in the bath, etc). Predictions from the arc model show that all the arc characteristics are strongly coupled and that the arc physics is governed by the expansion of the arc. From a parametric study it was found that when the arc region (defined by the 10, 000 K isotherm) is plotted in dimensionless form, a universal shape for the arc can be defined, regardless of the values of arc current or arc length. This universality was restricted to the range of conditions analyzed in this thesis, to arcs struck between graphite cathodes in air, and does not include the jet impingement region on the bath surface. This common arc expansion behavior suggested the universal nature of other arc characteristics. Universal maps of temperature, magnetic: flux density, and axial velocity are also reported in terms of simple analytical expressions. The practical effects of the two main process parameters of the arc region,. i. e. the arc current and the arc length, were analyzed. It was found that increasing the arc length significantly increases the arc resistance and, consequently, the arc power, although this behavior reached asymptotic values at larger arc lengths. Increasing the arc current, however, does not affect the arc voltage. Thus, it is found that increasing the arc power increases the amount of energy transferred into the bath, but the heat transfer efficiency decreases. Therefore, the shorter the arc the more efficient is the heat transfer to the bath. It is also recognized that heat transfer from the arc to the bath is controlled by convection, although radiation can become an important mechanism, especially for large arc lengths. Results of the bath model indicate that, in the absence of inert gas stirring and with no slag present in the system, electromagnetic body forces dominate and are responsible for the fluid flow patterns in the system. The effects of the arc determine the distributions of temperature and other mixing characteristics in the bath. The bath model was used to evaluate the effect of the main process parameters and design variables on mixing, <b>refractory</b> <b>wear,</b> temperature stratification, and heat transfer efficiency. An increase in the arc length is detrimental to mixing but increases the rate of heating in the melt as a result of the increased arc power. Increasing arc current improves mixing and the heat transferred to the bath, but is likely to be detrimental to the life of the bottom refractory. The results also suggest that high furnace aspect ratios (taller and thinner arc furnaces) are highly recommended because an increase in the aspect ratio increases mixing, prevents <b>refractory</b> <b>wear,</b> and promotes arc heating efficiency. The arc configuration in the furnace can be changed to control fluid flow patterns in the bath to meet specific needs, such as better mixing, or to prevent <b>refractory</b> <b>wear.</b> The presence of a top layer of slag reduces mixing and increases overall liquid temperatures. Injection of gases through the bottom in eccentric operations generates complex flow patterns that improve mixing in regions away from the symmetry axis. It is the author's belief that this model is a useful tool for process analysis in the DC-EAF. It has the capability to address many issues of current and future concern and represents one component of a fundamental approach to the optimization of DC-EAF operations. by Marco Aurelio Ramírez.

40|$|Gasifiers {{are high}} temperature, high {{pressure}} containment vessels used to convert carbon feedstock; such as coal or petcoke, into a synthesis gas (also called syngas) composed primarily of H 2 and CO. Syngas produced by gasification {{is used as}} a fuel in energy production, as a raw material feedstock for chemical synthesis, and can be a source of H 2 for a hydrogen based economy. Air cooled slagging gasifiers, one of several gasifier types used in industry, typically operate at temperatures between 1325 - 1575 o C, and at pressures between 300 - 1000 psi. They are lined on the hot face with high chrome oxide refractory materials; which may contain up to 95 wt pct chrome oxide, with possible additives of zirconia and alumina also present. Impurities in the carbon feedstock exist in many forms, and can be oxides of Si, Fe, Ca, Al, Na, and S in coal; with additional elements, such as Ni and V, present in petcoke. Depending on the feedstock source, the quantities of impurities generally range from one to over ten pct; leading to ash waste quantities reaching 100 tons/day, or more, in the operation of a single gasifier. Because of the high temperatures used during gasification, the ash by-products liquefy and react with, or penetrate the refractory liner pores; leading to <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> and corrosion, and ultimately, premature brick failure. This paper will discuss interactions between slag components and gasifier refractories, with post-mortem analysis of refractory liner failure being presented from systems using coal as a carbon feedstock...|$|E
40|$|The UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ freeze lining concept {{combines}} wall cooling {{with carbon}} and graphite refrac-tories of higher thermal conductivities to “chill ” the refractory lining by transferring {{heat from the}} refractory lining. Effective sidewall water cooling, together with {{the efficiency of the}} heat dissipating conductive refrac-tories, lowers the temperature of the lining to below that of the molten process materials. This causes a layer of slag and process metal to solidify or “freeze ” and form a protective “skull ” which completely coats the refractory hot face. Once formed, the slag skull insulates the refractories, reducing heat loss and protect the lining from erosion, chemical attack, thermal shock, and other stresses. The result: extended life and greatly improved refractory performance. The Ilmenite smelting process depends on the presence of a solidified slag skull to protect sidewall refrac-tory material from chemical attach by molten slag. No known refractory material is able to withstand this corrosive material. To date, UCAR has not applied their Chill Kote ™ technology in the ilmenite smelting industry. This paper revolves around the results obtained from conducting an ilmenite smelting campaign on a 500 kW DC open-arc furnace with a UCAR designed refractory system. The purpose of this test was to es-tablish the effects such a lining has on <b>refractory</b> <b>wear</b> and the reduction-smelting process. Proper thermo-couple management enabled the authors to monitor lining wear {{for the duration of the}} campaign. Prior to the pilot-scale campaign, modeling work was completed to evaluate the feasibility of applying UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ technology to ilmenite smelting furnaces. The successful operation of a pilot-scale furnace equipped with the UCAR ® CHILL-KOTE ™ lining as well as concise modeling suggest that it should be a viable option to consider for an industrial-scale furnace. 1...|$|E
