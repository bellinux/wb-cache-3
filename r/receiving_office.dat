25|$|The {{first light}} keeper at the Caloundra Head Lightstation was {{appointed}} {{when the light}} became operational in September 1896. One room of his cottage functioned as a postal <b>receiving</b> <b>office,</b> complete with telegraph facilities, with the light keeper appointed as the <b>receiving</b> <b>office</b> keeper. In 1910 the telegraph service was discontinued but {{was replaced by a}} telephone service in 1912. The post office remained at the lighthouse until 1934 and as a result, a rough track along the ridge was created by a steady stream of local residents, helping to foster closer settlement around the lighthouse in the immediate years after its erection. This rough track eventually became Canberra Terrace. As a married man with a large family, the arrival of the first lightkeeper also led to the establishment of the first Caloundra School, which for several months in the late 1890s was conducted at the light keeper's cottage.|$|E
