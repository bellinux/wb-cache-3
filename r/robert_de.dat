50|$|Local {{tradition}} {{since the}} Middle Ages {{has it that}} Joan of Arc, contrary to accepted wisdom, was not from Arc but that {{she was married to}} <b>Robert</b> <b>des</b> Armoises.

In 1871, two portraits were discovered when plaster was removed from a 15th-century chimney. The village mayor confirmed that his great great grandfather had covered the portraits on the orders of Monsieur des Armoises before the French Revolution and that they were of Joan and her husband, <b>Robert</b> <b>des</b> Armoises. Several books have been published on this theory.|$|R
