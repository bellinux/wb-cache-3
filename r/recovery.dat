5|$|Life on Earth {{seemed to}} recover quickly after the Permian extinctions, {{though this was}} mostly {{in the form of}} {{disaster}} taxa such as the hardy Lystrosaurus. Specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity, complex food webs, and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. Current research indicates that this long <b>recovery</b> was due to successive waves of extinction, which inhibited <b>recovery,</b> and to prolonged environmental stress to organisms that continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that <b>recovery</b> did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction; and some writers estimate that the <b>recovery</b> was not complete until 30M years after the P-Tr extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.|$|E

30|$|Phytophthora pluvialis was reisolated from 64 of {{the total}} of 324 inoculated needles (19.8 %), all of which had {{symptoms}} of disease.

40|$|This study {{examines}} average <b>recoveries</b> from distressed {{commercial real estate}} assets held by FSLIC receiverships, and explores differences in the relative efficiency of public versus quasi-private and private entities {{in the management of}} these assets. It finds that properties located in markets with rising per capita income and properties that were judged to be less difficult to manage and sell provided higher <b>recoveries,</b> while properties with smaller writedowns prior to government takeover provided lower <b>recoveries.</b> The analysis also provides evidence that quasi-private management by the Federal Asset Disposition Agency provided higher mean <b>recoveries,</b> while private management by contractors provided lower mean <b>recoveries</b> than did public management by FSLIC receivership staff.

40|$|Job {{polarization}} {{refers to}} the recent disappearance of employment in occupations {{in the middle of}} the skill distribution. Jobless <b>recoveries</b> {{refers to the}} slow rebound in aggregate employment following recent recessions, despite <b>recoveries</b> in aggregate output. We show how these two phenomena are related. First, job polarization is not a gradual process; essentially all of the job loss in middle-skill occupations occurs in economic downturns. Second, jobless <b>recoveries</b> in the aggregate are accounted for by jobless <b>recoveries</b> in the middle-skill occupations that are disappearing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of {{multiple}} distributed ontologies, we are often confronted {{with the problem of}} dealing with inconsistency. In this paper, we propose an approach for reasoning with inconsistent distributed ontologies based on concept forgetting. We firstly define concept forgetting in description logics. We then adapt the notions of <b>recoveries</b> and preferred <b>recoveries</b> in propositional logic to description logics. Two consequence relations are then defined based on the preferred <b>recoveries.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>recovery</b> of European wolf populations {{began after}} the 1950s, when {{traditional}} pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed {{the need to}} heavily persecute wolves.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{standardized}} questionnaires and assessments {{have been developed}} to try to assess aspects of an individual's <b>recovery</b> journey. These include the Milestones of <b>Recovery</b> (MOR) Scale, <b>Recovery</b> Enhancing Environment (REE) measure, <b>Recovery</b> Measurement Tool (RMT), <b>Recovery</b> Oriented System Indicators (ROSI) Measure, Stages of <b>Recovery</b> Instrument (STORI), and numerous related instruments.|$|E
25|$|Research {{that compares}} the {{prevalence}} of the different <b>recovery</b> patterns generally shows that the most common pattern of <b>recovery</b> is parallel <b>recovery,</b> followed by differential, blended, selective, and successive.

30|$|Depletion {{behavior}} {{associated with}} activating diffusion enhanced condensation evolution and <b>recoveries</b> {{for all the}} mixtures. Diffusion reduced the resistance applied against the flow of gas toward the flow channels, which excessively enhanced the depletion behavior. In addition, larger withdrawal was witnessed for both phases due to the domination of the diffusion mechanism over Darcy’s law. Gas <b>recoveries</b> for all the mixtures reflected notable increases because of diffusion domination. Mixture with the least volatile concentrations recorded higher condensate <b>recoveries.</b> The improved performance is owed to the activation of the multi-mechanistic flow to account for additional <b>recoveries</b> that are unable to be extracted under the Darcy’s law pressure gradient.|$|R

40|$|The {{taxability}} of <b>recoveries</b> of damages {{on account}} of emotional distress remains a complicated issue under the American federal income tax law. Recent developments due to a controversial decision by the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals have further added fuel to this debate. Even {{if one were to}} argue the justifications of exempting such <b>recoveries</b> from income taxation, courts {{do not appear to be}} the very appropriate kind of forum. Congress can, and in fact does tax such <b>recoveries</b> and the constitutional basis of such power can hardly be doubted. As a result, appropriate changes in the statute only can bring the desirable result of exempting such <b>recoveries</b> from income taxation...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, <b>recoveries</b> from recessions in the US have {{been plagued by}} weak {{employment}} growth. One possible explanation for these "jobless" <b>recoveries</b> is rooted in technological change: middle-skill jobs, often involving routine tasks, are lost during recessions, and the displaced workers take time to transition into other jobs (Jaimovich and Siu, 2014). But technological replacement of middle-skill workers {{is not unique to}} the US it also takes place in other developed countries (Goos, Manning, and Salomons, 2014). So if jobless <b>recoveries</b> in the US are due to technology, we might expect to also see them elsewhere in the developed world. We test this possibility using data on <b>recoveries</b> from 71 recessions in 28 industries and 17 countries from 1970 - 2011. We find that though GDP recovered more slowly after recent recessions, employment did not. Industries that used more routine tasks, and those more exposed to robotization, did not recently experience slower employment <b>recoveries.</b> Finally, middle-skill employment did not recover more slowly after recent recessions, and this pattern was no different in routine-intensive industries. Taken together, this evidence suggests that technology is not causing jobless <b>recoveries</b> in developed countries outside the US...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a {{critical}} incident survey with both {{qualitative and quantitative}} sections to investigate noncomplainers. Noncomplainers are customers who experience service failures but do not voice complaints. The qualitative study (n = 149) explored reasons why customers do not complain after experiencing service failures. In the quantitative study (n = 530), two kinds of noncomplainers who either (a) received organization-initiated <b>recoveries</b> or (b) exited the encounters without <b>recoveries</b> were compared with three kinds of complaining customers who received (a) satisfactory <b>recoveries,</b> (b) dissatisfactory <b>recoveries,</b> or (c) no <b>recoveries.</b> The five customer groups were compared across repurchase intentions, negative affect, perceived regret, and intentions to engage in negative word of mouth. The results of the comparative analyses challenge existing views of noncomplainers’ repurchase intentions and negative outcome levels.
