30|$|In biology, {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} function as important biomolecules in cellular metabolism (Roberfroid & Calderon 1995). The drying of alkyd paint follows a mechanism {{similar to the}} process in which lipids are oxidised in biological systems (Miccichè et al. 2006). Lipid peroxidation reactions occur in living systems, for instance in modification of DNA and proteins, radiation damage, aging and age pigment formation, modification of membrane structure, tumor initiation, and in the deposition of arterial plaque associated with low-density lipoprotein modification (Porter et al. 1995). While in food industry, the important parameter to measure the quality of oil and fat is the degree of oxidation (i.e., the extent of oil oxidation), since this process reduces the nutritional quality, produces <b>rancid</b> <b>flavours</b> and decreases safety {{in terms of its}} potential to develop disease (Muik et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|Suitability of sardine (lean and fatty), {{dolphinfish}} {{and blue}} whiting for cold-smoking was evaluated. Stable water-holding capacity {{was observed in}} dolphinfish and blue whiting, but this tended to decrease in sardine throughout the storage. The 2 -thiobarbituric acid index was not suitable for lipid oxidation measure in these smoked fishes and <b>rancid</b> <b>flavours</b> were only detected in sardine {{at the end of}} storage period. Total volatile basic nitrogen tended to increase in all three species. Lactic acid bacteria became the dominant microflora and Enterobacteriaceae did not show any growth. A bacteriostatic effect of at least 21 days was observable in all the smoked species. Sensory shelf life was 11 weeks for both types of sardine and 9 weeks for dolphinfish and blue whiting. Softening of muscle tissue and the development of bitter and off flavours were the main causes of rejection. Smoking as a processing technology can be used to add value to excess sardine and dolphinfish catches, due to sensory acceptability ratings. In contrast, the blue whiting was not suitable for smoking due to unacceptable soft texture, a characteristic of this species. © 2008 Institute of Food Science and Technology. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of automatic milking systems (AMS) initially caused a lowering of the milk quality regarding {{free fatty acids}} (FFA). A high level of FFA {{increases the risk of}} <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour</b> in dairy products. The objective of the present thesis was to evaluate different factors in AMS which could potentially cause an increased level of FFA. The stability of the MFG was studied by using model systems. A correlation (r 2 = 0. 54) was found between the average diameter of the milk fat globule (MFG) and the diurnal fat yield of cows. The activity of a MFG membrane enzyme was found to decline with increasing average MFG size. The results of this work indicate that the MFGs grow larger when the fat synthesis increases, probably because of a limitation in the production of MFG membrane. This new, obtained knowledge was used to produce milk with various average diameters of MFGs. Three groups of cows were fed concentrates with different fatty acid compositions; one high in saturated fat, another high in unsaturated fat and the last one stimulating high de novo synthesis. The feedings resulted in milk with fat contents of 5. 0, 3. 7 and 4. 0 %, respectively. The MFGs were significantly larger in the milk with the highes...|$|E

40|$|Pearl millet is a cereal crop {{cultivated}} by subsistence {{farmers in}} semi-arid parts of Africa and Asia. In Namibia, pearl millet porridge is a staple food for {{over half of}} the population. Healthful Harvest, a cooperative of subsistence farmers in a rural area in Namibia is developing a flour product with extended shelf life and a short cooking time comprising pearl millet and cowpea. This requires the application of simple technology. The pearl millet grain is small (3 - 15 mg) but has a proportionally larger germ than all other cereal grains, except perhaps maize. Therefore, it tends to contain a high content of triglycerides, which are rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Pearl millet flour is susceptible to rancidity within a few days due to lipolysis and subsequent oxidation of the de-esterified unsaturated fatty acids. To try to prevent rancidity and to pre-cook, pearl millet grain was subjected to toasting, boiling and toasting then boiling before reduction to flour. The effects of these different thermal treatments on fat acidity, peroxide value (PV) and conjugated diene and triene values of pearl millet flour before and after three months storage at ambient conditions were determined. The degree of cook of starch was determined on fresh flours. The porridges made from the flour of the treated grains were evaluated by a trained panel and by consumers. Analyses of energy demands and practicality of the thermal treatments and extrusion cooking as processing technologies in manufacturing pearl millet flour in rural parts of Namibia were made. Fat acidity for the untreated flour increased significantly from 0. 11 to 3. 72 g KOH kg- 1, whereas no significant increase observed in the flours of wet thermally-treated grains. This indicates that wet thermal treatments inhibited triglyceride hydrolysis. The PVs of the flours of the wet thermally-treated grain increased seven-fold, while the PV of the untreated flour decreased. A similar trend was observed for the conjugated diene values. The conjugated triene values increased significantly for all the samples. These results indicate autoxidation in the thermally-treated samples and that there was accumulation of hydroperoxides. The degree of cook of the wet thermally-treated grain (~ 40 %) was twice that of the untreated and toasted grains, indicating that the wet thermal treatment partially gelatinised the grain. Porridges prepared using untreated flours were associated with <b>rancid</b> <b>flavours,</b> while those of other treatments were not, indicating that the thermal treatments can prevent rancidity. Consumers preferred the porridge prepared using flour of the boiled grain, presumably because it was fully cooked, whereas others were not. Thus, the boiling treatment can be applied to extend the shelf life of and pre-cook pearl millet flour. The energy demands for boiling and extrusion cooking were estimated to be 0. 6 and 0. 2 kWh kg- 1, respectively. The energy demand for the boiling process can be minimised by sun-drying instead of using electricity. The cost of an extruder would be prohibitively costly for Healthful Harvest. Thus, boiling the grain is a suitable appropriate technology that can be applied in the Healthful Harvest situation by ordinary people, with no specialist skills.

40|$|Appendices for {{chapters}} 5 - 9 {{are with}} the hard copy. The shelf life of lipid based foods is often determined {{by the development of}} <b>rancid</b> <b>flavours</b> attributed to lipid oxidation reactions. These reactions are highly complicated and readily change when the reaction system is altered. As a result, researchers have struggled to make significant advances in their understanding of the mechanisms and rates of lipid oxidation. This thesis focuses on the generalised three step mechanism of lipid oxidation and develops understanding, through mathematical modelling exercises, about the factors that influence the rates of lipid oxidation. More specifically, this thesis focuses on bulk oils, bulk oils with added antioxidants, oil-in-water emulsions and the effects of oxygen supply and consumption rates in real food systems. For this thesis, methods were developed to identify and validate findings that suggest that lipid hydroperoxides are the rate defining reactant in lipid oxidation reactions. These methods were then used to measure the solubility of oxygen in oil and to define the role oxygen plays in determining the rates of lipid oxidation in a range of systems. The use of a newly developed batch oxidation apparatus led to the development and validation of models to predict the rates of oxygen consumption during oxidation. The model showed that the rates of oxygen consumption were half order with respect to the lipid hydroperoxide concentration. Through further validation experiments, it was shown that, during the initial stages of lipid oxidation before rancidity, each mole of lipid hydroperoxides formed required 5. 04 moles of oxygen to be consumed when there was oxygen present. The same model and methods were then used to predict the changes in rates of lipid oxidation triggered by changes in reaction temperature. From this work, {{it was found that the}} Arrhenius law was capable of predicting the rates of oxygen consumption. The addition of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) to mixed fish oil samples brought with it a reduction in the rates of lipid oxidation, the magnitude of which was proportional to the concentration of BHA added. It was found that the inclusion of a modifier into the half order model was capable of predicting the rates of lipid oxidation when antioxidants were added. Methods to quantify the modifier were supplied for future use. The dilution of bulk oils by the formation of oil-in-water emulsions was also studied. It was found that the rates of lipid oxidation were proportional to the concentration of lipids in the emulsion. It was shown that the extent of oxidation during a batch oxidation was inversely proportional to the concentration of lipids in the emulsions as the aqueous phase acted as sump of oxygen for reaction in the oil droplets. Through modelling and short validation exercises, it was shown that changes to the surface area to volume ratio of oil droplets in emulsions had no effect on the rates of oxygen supply/lipid oxidation and that any effects noted in literature are likely to be the result of other surface active compounds. Finally, a modelling exercise showed that the rates of oxygen consumption via reaction were likely to be significantly faster than the rates of oxygen supply in unmixed systems in polymer packaging and, to some extent, open to the atmosphere. The diffusion of lipid hydroperoxides was shown to be important in bulk oils stored in polymer packaging as it allowed for a greater proportion of the oil to react with the oxygen transferred, thus reducing the potential for the oxygen supplied to take part in secondary and tertiary product formation. It was suggested that it is better, for a given quantity of oxygen supplied, for the entire oil product to react as it would result in fewer tertiary products being formed than if the oxygen were to be consumed at the surface of the oil only. Following this, it was suggested that an oil-in-water emulsion should be less stable than a bulk oil. Short experimental work showed that storing bulk oils in the absence of oxygen brings with it a decrease in the rates of lipid oxidation caused by a decrease in the concentration of lipid hydroperoxides. This decrease, coupled with anecdotal evidence that products do become rancid over long periods of time, suggests that the radicals formed during lipid hydroperoxide breakdown can be used in two different sets of reactions. That is, the relative rates of reformation of lipid hydroperoxide via reaction with lipids and the formation of tertiary oxidation products will likely determine the rates of lipid hydroperoxide breakdown and rancidity in real food systems. An indepth analysis of lipid hydroperoxide breakdown rates in the absence of oxygen as well as a set of validation experiments for the storage of bulk oils and oil-in-water emulsions in polymer films was suggested as being the final piece of information needed to complete a comprehensive model capable of quantitatively predicting the rates of lipid oxidation reactions and the shelf life of lipid oxidation prone foods...|$|R
40|$|Oat is palatable, {{beneficial}} to one's health, it has advantageous lipid composition and valuable technical properties related to forming viscosity. However, {{due to the}} high fat content, a rancid and bitter flavour develop easily in oat during storage, and forms thus an obstacle for the use. A germination-drying process has shown nicely to adjust the perceived flavour (Heiniö et al. 2001), and was now applied before storing oat, the aim being to increase. the stability. Changes in sensory attributes determined by descriptive profiling, lipid composition and amounts of volatile and phenolic compounds of native and processed (germinated, dried) crushed oat were followed during a 12 month storage period. The influence of the chemical attributes on the sensory profiles of oats was analysed statistically by PLS regression. The sensory profiles of the native and processed oat groats changed significantly during the storage period, and chemical changes causing rancidity and bitterness developed more slowly in the processed oat {{as compared to the}} native oat (Heiniö et al. 2002). The most intensive changes due to deterioration had already occurred after one month of storage in native oat, whereas in processed oat these changes were perceived several months later. Stored, deteriorated oat was assessed as having musty, earthy odour and bitter, <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour.</b> These sensory attributes were closely correlated to free fatty acids and volatile compounds related to lipid oxidation. By contrast, total amount of phenolic compounds and volatile compounds derived mainly from protein degradation were highly related to favourable roasted odour and flavor. Thus, stability of oat groats can be significantly increased through germination and subsequent heat-treatment. Heiniö, R. -L. et al. 2001. Cereal Chemistry 6 : 707 - 714; Heiniö, R. -L. et al. 2002.

40|$|Besides having {{excellent}} nutritional value, oat has versatile enzyme machinery. However, the oat enzymes have seldom been {{utilized to}} carry out desired reactions in oat or in oat containing materials. Recently, the potential of oat enzymes has been apparent in enhancement {{of the quality of}} oat and in upgrading oat for novel food applications. Lipase activity in oat grain is high even without germination and the inactivation of this enzyme is a common practice for obtaining products with adequate shelf life. However, the existence of the lipase may also be seen as a positive feature and used as an aid in the manufacture of value added oat products. For example, the lipase reaction in crushed oat materials can be adjusted so that almost all fatty acids from storage lipids are hydrolysed to yield a mixture of free fatty acids rich in linoleic acid. This free linoleic acid, unlike its esterified form, is the favoured substrate for the microbial isomerization into the specific health-promoting conjugated linoleic acid isomer (Vahvaselkä et al., 2004). Native oat grain has also been found to contain an enzyme activity converting the secondary lipid oxidation products into non-volatile form, thus reducing perceived rancidity (Lehto et al., 2003). This heat-labile aldehyde dehydrogenase type activity has been shown to decrease the content of hexanal and other volatile short-chain aldehydes by oxidizing them into corresponding less-volatile carboxylic acids. Native oat flour can thus be used as a supplement in various food formulations to reduce <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour.</b> Consequently, possibilities for utilization of oat in the food industry may be much more abundant than previously thought.

40|$|In the {{previous}} report, it was confirmed {{that most of}} volatile carbonyl compounds found in fish flesh during storage was produced by the atmospheric oxidation of lipid fraction in the flesh. Studies on the autoxidation of fatty materials have revealed the facts that the primary products of autoxidation are the peroxide or hydroperoxide (PV), and that by the transformation or decomposition of the peroxide and the interaction of the peroxide with other materials of autoxidation and further oxidation of the peroxide, the secondary products may be formed, including various aldehydes, ketons and acids etc., some of which are responsible for <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour</b> and ordor. However, there has been probably little experimental evidence about the mechanism by which the lower products are formed. And then, in order to obtain some information on the process of the formation of lower carbonyl compounds by the oxidation, a preliminary experiment was carried out in considering the relationship between the formation of water-soluble carbonyl compounds (SC) and the quantity of the peroxide and between the formation of water-soluble and non-water-soluble carbonyl compounds (NC), adopting the oxidative action of soybean lipoxidase for linoleic acid. The formation of SC by the enzymatic oxidation of linoleic acid could hardly be perceived under the presence of smaller quantity of PV, while that of TC was appreciable in the same case. The addition of NC fraction to the mixture resulted in the acceleration of SC-formation and the inhibition of PV-formation. By some variations of the substrate concentration, the rate of PV-formation was considerably affected, while that of SC was hardly affected. Thus, SC produced by the oxidation of linoleic acid, {{was supposed to be a}} later product derived from NC consequent on the formation of PV...|$|E
40|$|Forage {{halophytes}} such as saltbush (Atriplex spp) {{are being}} widely used to revegetate Australian saline land {{and can also}} provide a medium quality fodder source. There is widespread anecdotal evidence that sheep grazing on saltbush are leaner, tastier and juicer. This thesis investigated the potential to produce a high quality carcass with improved eating quality from grazing sheep on saltbush on saline land. The first experimental chapter in this thesis details an animal house experiment investigating the carcass, eating and wool quality and physiological responses of sheep ingesting a 60 : 40 dried saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) :barley grain (S+B), ration verses a 33 : 25 : 42 lupin grain:barley grain:oaten hay ration (Control, C) for 10 weeks prior to commercial slaughter (Chapter 4). Subsequently, two field experiments were conducted {{to examine the effects}} of grazing saltbush on saline land compared to dry senesced pasture on carcass and eating quality of lambs (Goomalling 2003) and hoggets (Wickepin 2004) (both chapter 6) for 14 weeks. Both chapters demonstrated that the ingestion of saltbush resulted in significantly less fat and in the 2 field experiments the ingestion of saltbush resulted in more lean on the carcass compared to sheep grazing a stubble/pasture (control) ration. These are positive findings for processors as costs of fat denudation are high so the lower the fat content and for farmers because less fat is deposited on the carcass per unit of liveweight gain. The decreased deposition of fat was attributed to the higher protein:energy ratio available for production, secondary compounds in saltbush and lower circulating insulin and higher growth hormone of the S+B fed sheep compared to the control fed sheep. Further work is needed to determine if these beneficial improvements in carcass composition can be achieved without compromising animal production. The long term grazing of saltbush did not result in commercially desirable hot carcass weights unless the sheep were supplemented with a high energy source such as barley. The low growth rates are attributed to a decreased availability of energy substrates, low feed intake and increased energy output of sheep fed high salt diets. The low energy intake of the S+B fed sheep also resulted in an a significantly lower percentage of unsaturated fat and unchanged levels of saturated fat in the fat depots compared to the C treatment. Consumer taste tests conducted on meat from experiments in both chapter 4 and 6 indicated no difference between the treatments for any of the eating quality traits assessed. This can be considered a positive result as sheep can be finished on saltbush without any detriment to eating quality. High vitamin E levels in the meat may have also prevented the development of <b>rancid</b> <b>flavours</b> and aroma. It can be speculated that saltbush does not impart beneficial flavour and aroma volatiles as previously thought; instead the high vitamin E levels inhibit off-flavour and aroma development compared to meat from sheep grazed on dry pasture. The long term ingestion of saltbush also resulted in significantly lower urine specific gravity (USG), muscle dry matter and higher urine weights suggesting that the saltbush fed sheep had a better hydration status compared to control fed sheep. However, this finding did not correspond with higher hot carcass weight or dressing percentages. The increases in muscle fluid content of the saltbush fed sheep were attributed to changes in body composition. The saltbush fed sheep had a higher lean and lower fat content which corresponded with a greater body fluid content as found in the animal house study. Under conditions where the body composition of sheep remains the same, the use of short term strategic feeding of components of saltbush was investigated (mimicked in the form of salt and betaine) to reduce dehydration and subsequent reductions in carcass weight and dressing percentages (Chapter 7). Salt and or betaine were fed for 1 week either prior to a 48 h period of water deprivation or prior to 48 h commercial slaughter process where water was available in lairage from 24 - 48 h. Under both scenarios the diets did not result in improved dressing percentages, hot carcass weights, muscle dry matter or muscle weights. The ingestion of high salt diet prior to slaughter, did increase fluid retention in the extracellular spaces prior to slaughter however by 48 h both groups were at a similar physiological and therefore similar hydration status. Therefore similar levels of fluid were present in the muscles and no difference in carcass weight or dressing percentage could be expected. An important observation from the second experiment was that the high salt group drunk more water than the low salt fed sheep but the low salt group consumed fluid in lairage also. The low salt fed sheep may have been encouraged to drink water after observing the frequent drinking patterns of the high salt group. This thesis has also shown that saltbush contains high levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) (193 mg/kg dry matter). As a result the concentration of alpha-tocopherol in plasma, liver and muscle of the saltbush fed sheep was elevated compared to those grazing dry pasture. The high muscle concentrations of vitamin E in the saltbush-grazed sheep resulted in improved meat colour stability. The high vitamin E levels did not influence the drip and cooking loss of the meat despite a decrease in the muscle dry matter of the meat. The browning of meat and increased drip loss results in large losses to the meat industry due to value deterioration at the supermarket. There is also great potential for the high vitamin E content in saltbush to be used for the prevention of nutritional myopathy instead of using expensive and labour intensive synthetic supplements. In conclusion, this thesis has provided an insight into the carcass and eating quality of sheep grazed on saltbush based saline pasture systems. The most significant findings were that ingesting saltbush can reduce the carcass fat content, improve meat colour stability and not result in any detriment to eating quality. A potentially useful way to incorporate these results into an Australian farming system may be to use saltbush on a short term basis, not for the length of period grazed in this thesis. The short term use of saltbush should provide sufficient grazing time for an elevation of vitamin E levels in the muscle to improve meat colour stability, increase the amount of lean and decrease fat levels of a carcass all without changing eating quality and decreasing liveweight. Further work is needed to ensure that these benefits can be achieved without compromising animal production. The opportunity to utilise saltbush to produce leaner carcasses with better colour stability may encourage farmers to consider previously unproductive land planted to saltbush to be a highly useful enterprise...|$|R

Bread baked with roller-milled wheat was characterized by sweetness, juiciness, compactness and smaller slice area than bread baked with stone-milled wheat, which was characterized by saltiness, deformity and roasted cereals.

Consumers rated 5 of the 6 products above the central point (5 =neither pleasant nor unpleasant) for perceived liking, indi- cating their good eating quality. Both expected liking scores (FO and MO) were higher then perceived liking expressed in blind conditions (P< 0. 001) and above the central point, due to a satis- factory consumer trust in legislation transparency in the case of FO and local processing methods in the case of MO. Expected liking scores were higher for FO than for MO (P< 0. 001). Two products were rated very pleasant with blind scores similar to expected ratings (no disconfirmation). Surprisingly, for all products MO information produced a contrast effect as a consequence of a negative disconfirmation, which means that actual liking moved in the direction opposite to the expectations. Conversely, when FO information was given, in most cases no effect was found on actual liking, therefore sensory properties prevailed in orienting consumer liking...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative rancidity {{was found}} to be a problem in goat milk infant formula powder. Oxidative rancidity results from the lipid {{oxidation}} processes, where oxygen reacts with unsaturated fatty acids from milk powder to produce lipid hydroperoxides and radicals, the primary oxidation products. These primary oxidation products are odourless; however, they are very reactive to breakdown into hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones. Aldehydes have low flavour threshold limits and are responsible for causing the <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour</b> in the milk powder. Peroxide value (PV) {{is one of the most}} widely used tests for oxidative rancidity as it is a measure of the concentration of lipid hydroperoxides; however, it is difficult to provide a specific guideline relating PV to rancidity. A reliable test is needed to determine whether the goat milk infant formula powder is unacceptable due to oxidative rancidity to the consumer. It was found that oxygen was a useful parameter to monitor lipid oxidation. Oxygen is the main reactant in lipid oxidation, and the rate of oxygen consumption is a useful tool to track lipid oxidation. Hexanal was determined to be the main secondary oxidation product responsible for the off flavour of milk powder. An experiment of accelerated storage trials for two infant formula products (Powder A and Powder B) was conducted by using a range of higher temperatures from 37 °C to 57 °C over a period of 12 to 24 weeks. Headspace oxygen and headspace hexanal of the milk powder in the glass vials were measured over the storage period. Sensory analysis was also conducted in parallel with the storage trial to provide a relationship between the sensory score and hexanal concentration, ultimately determining the unacceptable flavour threshold limit for hexanal concentration. The chemical kinetic constants were estimated by fitting a general nth order reaction with an Arrhenius law model with the concentration of oxygen obtained experimentally. The model followed half order reaction for both products. The Arrhenius rate constant, k 0, and activation energy, E, were found to be 7. 8 × 109 % 0. 5 week- 1 and 62. 0 kJ mol- 1 for Powder A and 1. 34 × 107 % 0. 5 week- 1 and 45. 60 kJ mol- 1 for Powder B. It was discovered that oxygen and hexanal were highly correlated with R 2 of 0. 905 for Powder A and R 2 of 0. 918 for Powder B when fitted exponentially. It was predicted that Powder A would be unacceptable after a storage time of 40 weeks, and 31 weeks for Powder B under 25 °C storage temperature. Data tables were generated to outline the different maximum storage times allowed with different storage temperatures and different initial storage oxygen concentration...|$|E
40|$|Oat grain, {{being one}} of the major cereals in Australia, {{contains}} various macromolecules and microconstituents including protein, lipid, dietary fibre and phytochemicals that are beneficial to human health. Despite its advantageous attributes, inclusion of sufficient amount of finely milled oat powder in commercial food formulations is still limited due to undesirable organoleptic properties that might develop during storage prior to consumption. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} probe the influence of oat in model liquid and solid systems through an armoury of analytical and physicochemical techniques, i. e. chromatography, spectroscopy, rheology, calorimetry, microscopy and sensory evaluation. The first experimental chapter deals with the development of various analytical protocols to probe the presence of microconstituents in model liquid oat systems following UHT processing and subsequent storage. Compounds of interest included phenolic acids (ferulic and para-coumaric acids), avenanthramides, free fatty acids and volatile lipid oxidation products. Sample preparation involved a UHT treatment at 145 &deg;C for 5 s followed by a twelve-week storage at 22 and 30 &deg;C. Soluble and insoluble dietary fibre fractions (SDF and IDF, respectively) were extracted from defatted oat samples through sequential enzymatic digestion. In order to extract ester bound phenolic acids, alkaline hydrolysis and liquid&ndash;liquid partitioning steps were applied to SDF and IDF. Moderate enzymatic digestion temperature (50 &deg;C) and saponification (2 M NaOH for 6 hr) were found to produce the best separation of phenolic compounds analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chromatograms showed prominent ferulic and para-coumaric acids in both fractions, which were located mainly in IDF, and that was confirmed by the total phenolic content results obtained from Folin-Ciocalteau assay. Alkaline based extraction with methanol and an HPLC method were developed to analyse the avenanthramide content in oat samples. Results demonstrated that the protocols were able to detect the primary avenanthramides, i. e. A, B and C. In addition to phenolic compounds, the work examined oat lipids and their oxidation products which are the main culprit of <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour</b> in liquid oat systems. Free fatty acid determination involved fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis coupled with a comprehensive gas chromatography (GC&times;GC) technique. Chromatograms recorded three main fatty acids, i. e. palmitic, linoleic and oleic acids, which accounted for nearly 98 % of the total free fatty acids. In the case of secondary lipid oxidation compounds, head space solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis was developed to detect the presence of volatiles, which are predominantly hexanal and 2 -pentyl furan. Once the required analytical protocols were established, the focus in this work turned to the evolution of the aforementioned microconstituents during extended storage at 22 and 30 &deg;C. It was observed that ferulic acid decreases over time at both temperatures while para-coumaric acid remains more or less stable but at a much lower content. Reduction in ferulic acid suggested conversion into another compound called paravinyl guaiacol (PVG), and this is known as the process of thermal decarboxylation. The content of avenanthramides also remained unchanged over time at both experimental temperatures. In the case of free fatty acids, unsaturated moieties (oleic and linoleic acids) decreased with temperature indicating the occurrence of lipid oxidation. That was confirmed by an increase in the levels of volatiles (hexanal and 2 -pentyl furan) during storage, with the oxidation process being enhanced with increasing storage temperature. The second experimental chapter looked at off-flavour producing compounds, in particular PVG and hexanal, in relation to the sensory quality of model UHT liquid systems enriched with wholegrain oat during storage. In doing so, finely milled oat powder was mixed with skim milk powder and sucrose followed by UHT treatment and storage at ambient temperature. It was found that trained panellists were capable of differentiating the odours generated by the two compounds and identifying their intensity in the UHT samples as a function of storage time. Furthermore, a 9 -point hedonic test was conducted with semi-trained panellists to assess the acceptability levels of both odours in the UHT samples. Results suggest that hexanal is the main contributor to off-flavour development in oat based liquid systems, hence arguing for the importance of avoiding lipid oxidation in these materials. Following the study on model UHT liquid systems, the third experimental chapter focuses on UHT beverage formulations that closely resemble commercial oat products. Results unveil the importance of the particle size distribution of oat fibre on the overall acceptability of liquid foods, as well as on their consistency. Increasing the particle size distribution and concentration of these particles yields higher steady shear viscosity. Furthermore, prolonged storage at 22 &deg;C enhanced the beverages&rsquo; viscosity, whereas storage at 30 &deg;C produces the opposite trend. The former event is attributed to the swelling of fibre particles, whereas the latter is due to the hydration of starch molecules, which dissolve into the beverage matrix (particle erosion beyond swelling), hence being unable to suspend in solution the insoluble parts of the oat particle. Given the above effect of oat-particle addition on the consistency of beverages as a major ingredient in formulations, the study was expanded into a model solid system containing gelatin as the supporting matrix. Protein concentration was fixed at 2 % (w/w), with the level of oat particles varying from 0 to 4 % (w/w). Findings demonstrate phase separated systems, with gelatin and oat particles serving as the continuous and dispersed phases, respectively. Incorporation of oat particles weakened the mechanical strength of the protein gels, which is a new finding in the field of hydrocolloid gels. Besides concentration, the work explores the effect of different size distribution of oat particles on the composite gels and argues that smaller particles are able to disrupt swiftly the protein network compared to the larger counterparts. Outcomes from this PhD thesis provide valuable knowledge in understanding the causes of sensory and textural profiles that might be experienced in oat based food systems. Hence, the research can be used as a basis to develop palatable processed foods, over prolonged storage, which are enriched with high levels of wholegrain powders...|$|E
40|$|In Namibia, Omashikwa {{traditional}} fermented buttermilk {{made with}} the root of Omunkunzi (Boscia albitrunca) tree by local farmers {{is one of the}} most important rural food products. It provides nutrition, jobs and generates income for food security for the community. As a traditional fermented product, it is unusual as it has a viscous consistency and low syneresis. However, the quality of Omashikwa is inconsistent and is characterized by high acid taste, low pH, <b>rancid</b> <b>flavour,</b> root taste and smell and contains filth. In this research, the production process of Omashikwa, physico-chemical properties of the traditional and laboratory prepared Omashikwa and the role of the root of B. albitrunca tree in Omashikwa, viscosity, syneresis, microbiology and sensory properties were studied and compared in order to improve the quality of Omashikwa for wider community use and for poverty alleviation. Omashikwa was found to have a protein content of about 3. 3 %, fat 1. 6 %, moisture 90 %, lactose 4. 6 %, ash 0. 7 %, total solids 8. 7 %, lactic acid 0. 9 % and a pH of 3. 3 The quality of traditionally processed Omashikwa (TO) was compared with the laboratory processed Omashikwa (LO), which was made without the root. Traditional fermentation was carried out with raw milk and under rural conditions. After fermentation the milk was agitated vigorously to churn into butter, whereas LO was made with pasteurized (65 ºC/ 30 min) and filtered milk, and cream was scooped off after fermentation instead of churning. LO had a significantly (p < 0. 05) higher pH (4. 44) compared to traditional Omashikwa (pH 3. 25), lower acidity (0. 68 %) compared to 0. 92 % of TO. Fat content was higher in LO (2. 44 % fat) compared to 1. 56 % fat in TO. LO was free from filth and had higher viscosity (2. 98 Pa. s) compared to 2. 54 Pa. s and lower syneresis (14. 4 ml/ 24 ml) compared to 19. 6 ml/ 24 ml of TO. It was found that extract from B. albitrunca root showed a low pH of 4. 7 and exhibited bacterial inhibition properties on Total Plate Count Agar ring test. The root appear to specifically inhibit Escherichi coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium species. It also had a high content of soluble carbohydrates (hydrocolloids or gum) (19. 4 %). Significant difference (p < 0. 05) in total aerobic counts was observed in TO of 6. 62 log cfu/g compared to 8. 62 log cfu/g of LO and lower lactic acid bacterial counts, 6. 58 log cfu/g compared to 7. 87 log cfu/g of LO. Probably the most affected microorganisms in TO were the non acid formers, as lower pH of TO and inhibitory compounds in Omunkunzi root could have reduced them. Coliforms, yeasts and moulds counts were not significantly different (p< 0. 05). No pathogenic bacteria were found in either product. The lactic acid bacteria identified belonged to the genera Lactobacillus (Lb.) (Weissella), Leuconostoc (Leuc.), Lactococus (Lact.) and Streptococcus (Str.) Twenty representative strains of LAB isolates were identified to species level; three belonged to the species Lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis and two belonged to Lb. plantarum and two to Weissella confusa (former Lb. confuses). Three belonged to Str. salivarius thermophilus, three to Leuc. lactis, and two to Leuc. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides. Three belonged to Lact. lactis subsp. lactis and two belonged to Lact. lactis subsp. cremoris. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) in descriptive and consumer sensory attributes scores were observed between traditional and laboratory Omashikwa. Sensory attributes scores of TO on the levels of syneresis was 3. 4 compared to 2. 9 for LO, filth 3. 0 compared to 1. 8 in LO, rancidity scores were 3. 4 in TO compared to 1. 8 in LO, and bitterness 4. 2 in TO compared to 2. 5 in LO. Aroma scores were 2. 6 for TO and 4. 2 for LO, viscosity 2. 5 (TO) and 3. 8 (LO) and texture 2. 7 for TO compared to 4. 2 for LO. There was an 80 % preference score given to the laboratory Omashikwa by the young consumer panelists. The results of this study indicate justification of using B. albitrunca root in the processing of Omashiwa by the rural community to improve the quality of Omashikwa in terms of flavour, smell and consistency compared to other traditional fermented milk products and in the absence of modern technology. However, application of good manufacturing practices on unit operations, particularly heat treatment of milk prior to fermentation, use of lactic acid starter cultures, maintenance of good hygiene and sanitation including packaging, seem to be the effective methods to improve and sustain the quality and safety of traditional fermented buttermilk (Omashikwa) for a wider market and better price. Namibia Dairies Ltd, just like any other dairies in the region and elsewhere, manufactures buttermilk, a byproduct of butter that is fermented with mesophilic lactic acid cultures and branded as Omashikwa for the purpose of marketing. It has nothing to do with traditional Omashikwa as such; B. albitrunca root is not added and is processed by using modern industrial method. In addition, additives such as preservatives (potassium sorbate), stabilizers (pectin) and sugar are added and packed for distribution. This research project therefore investigated the processing technology, physico-chemical, microbiological, viscosity and sensory quality of traditional Omashikwa. The remedial measures to curb inconsistency and poor quality experienced in Omashikwa processed in Namibia were also investigated and scientific measures were proposed for production of quality Omashikwa for marketing to a wider community. Since laboratory processing method of Omashikwa gave a better quality product compared to traditional method in terms of microbiological quality, sensory attributes, viscosity, filth content, syneresis and general appearance, laboratory processing technique of processing Omashikwa is therefore recommended as an alternative and appropriate processing method for small scale production in the rural set up to improve the quality of Omashikwa.
