5|$|Harry Toulmin (sometimes called Henry Toulmin) (April 7, 1766 – November 11, 1823) was a Unitarian {{minister}} and politician. The son of noted Dissenting minister Joshua Toulmin, Toulmin fled his native England for the United States {{after he and}} his followers were persecuted for their beliefs. He arrived in Virginia in 1793, and aided by <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe, he was chosen president of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky. His Unitarian views, however, offended many of the orthodox Presbyterian members of Transylvania's board of regents, and Toulmin resigned after two years.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota's state {{government}} cannot operate without appropriations under law, as {{mandated by the}} Minnesota Constitution. However, state courts have determined that Priority One and Two Critical Services must continue {{in the event of}} a shutdown. Services that must remain uninterrupted to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One, and some additional services are designated Priority Two. Before the shutdown, a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget, based on <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> state agencies.|$|E
5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|The Joint Commission was tasked {{to report}} on the {{implementation}} of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> time to time to the president, the Treasury Secretary, and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include technological advances, the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. should continue to maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as may be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.|$|E
5|$|Acting on <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> Beckham's commission, legislators helped {{offset the}} lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of {{particular}} import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E
5|$|Before {{reaching}} movie audiences, hip-hop {{dance was}} already being broadcast on television. Soul Train was a , music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African-American soul, funk, and R singers. The show was broadcast in South Korea via the US Armed Forces Korea Network. Before officially becoming a crew, The Lockers made several appearances on this show. After becoming a crew, The Electric Boogaloos also {{appeared on the}} show. Soul Train premiered in 1970. During its 36 year run, the resident freestyle dancers were {{referred to as the}} Soul Train Gang. Auditions were held in 1971 when the show moved from Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California. Dancers who wanted to get on Soul Train after this time had to rely on word-of-mouth <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> dancers who were already employed by the show. A regular feature during the broadcast was the Soul Train Line. To participate in the Soul Train Line, the dancers formed two lines of equal length facing each other with a large space in between them. Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle.|$|E

5|$|Cooksey joined Oldham Athletic {{on trial}} in July 2003. At the age of 23, he stepped up three leagues into {{professional}} football permanently when Iain Dowie signed him on for financially troubled Oldham in August, {{who were in the}} Second Division. Bob Dowie, who was Cooksey's former manager at Chesham United, recommended the player to his brother, Iain. He followed in the footsteps of Fitz Hall and Wayne Andrews who also joined the club from Chesham as <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> Bob Dowie. Cooksey scored twice in Oldham's 3–0 home victory over Carlisle United in their FA Cup first round match on 8 November 2003. When the new season, 2003–04, started Cooksey was unable to make his debut due to suspension. He made 37 Second Division appearances for Oldham in the 2003–04 season, scoring four goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> the governor, the General Assembly enacted cost-saving {{reforms in the}} judicial system, including the abolition of criminal, chancery, and common pleas courts, dividing the state instead into 18 circuit court districts. The number of jurors required for certain cases was reduced, juror salaries were set at a fixed rate, and penalties were established for soliciting jury duty. Reimbursement amounts for transporting and caring for prisoners were capped to prevent inflation of costs by local law enforcement. Salaries of state officials were reduced by 20 percent. The state property tax was also increased from 40 to 45 cents per $100 of taxable property, and laws were strengthened to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{unsuccessful}} Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1992 Winter Olympics, {{ice hockey}} events were proposed played in Hamar and Gjøvik. However, in the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics, all ice events were moved to Lillehammer proper, after <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> the International Ice Hockey Federation, who wanted all the ice hockey events {{to take place in}} the same town. This would involve building two temporary ice rinks at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, and after the Olympics moving them to Gjøvik and either Moelv, Brumunddal or Kongsvinger. By 1989, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to include short-track speed skating, increasing the number of ice halls from two to three. In April, the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) therefore proposed building permanent ice rinks in Hamar and Gjøvik.|$|E

5|$|March 2009 <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> the USPSTF {{on the use}} {{of aspirin}} for the primary {{prevention}} of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought {{it back to the}} floor in the 1878 session. Prompted by <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, 1890, a new Mint director, Edward O. Leech, took office. Leech, aged 38 at the time, {{had spent}} his career at the Bureau of the Mint, and was an {{enthusiastic}} supporter of redesign. He took the precaution of obtaining <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> Barber as to suitable outside artists who might participate in a competition. Since most of the proposed artists were New York-based, Andrew Mason, superintendent of the New York Assay Office, was given the task of finalizing the list of invitees. Leading Mason's list of ten names was that of Saint-Gaudens. Mason sent Leech the recommendations on April 3, 1891; the following day, the Mint director announced the competition, open to the public, but he specifically invited the ten artists named by Mason to participate. Besides Saint-Gaudens, artists asked to compete included Daniel Chester French, Herbert Adams, and Kenyon Cox. Although Barber had warned the director that reputable artists would likely not enter a contest in which only the winner received compensation, Leech offered a $500 prize to the winner, and no payments to anyone else. He sought new designs for {{both sides of the}} dollar, and for the obverses of the half dollar, quarter, and dime—Leech was content to let the reverses of the Seated Liberty coins continue. By law, an eagle had to appear on the quarter and half dollar, but could not appear on the dime.|$|E

5|$|Owner Hugh Culverhouse, {{encouraged}} by <b>recommendations</b> <b>from</b> Vice President of Operations Ron Wolf and Alabama coaching legend Bear Bryant, chose John McKay, winner of four national championships with the USC Trojans, {{as the first}} Buccaneer head coach. Aided by a string of great tailbacks, including Heisman Trophy winners O. J. Simpson and Mike Garrett, McKay was credited with popularizing the I formation. Other candidates considered included Hank Stram, Ara Parseghian, and Joe Paterno. McKay was reportedly offered a five-year contract worth $750,000, plus cars, insurance, and real estate, and turned down an offer from the Seattle Seahawks and a counter-offer from USC to take the job. Critical of the NFL, he had turned down offers from professional teams in the past. McKay cited NCAA cutbacks in finances and recruiting as motivations for leaving the college ranks, saying simply that it was “time to try something else”. McKay’s only promise {{was that he would}} beat what he called “Pittsburgh’s timetable”, referencing the fact that it took the Steelers 41 years to win their first championship. Coach McKay would prove to be somewhat correct as Tampa Bay won the NFC's Central Division in 1979, the team's fourth year of existence, though it would take the team 27 seasons to win its first championship, which occurred in the 2002 season.|$|E
