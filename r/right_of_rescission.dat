She studied law at Stockholm University and carried out her studies in Uppsala where she, in 1970, {{successfully}} defended her dissertation in Commercial Law; Studies in the Law of Sale of Goods (Studier i Köprätt). Her doctoral thesis dealt {{with some of the}} problems concerning the right to treat a contract as of sale of goods as discharged – the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> – in various situations that may rise in the course of performance. Focus was put on those special considerations relevant to the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> which depended on how far performance had proceeded when the question of rescission came up. Five years later, in 1975, Anna Christensen was appointed Professor in Private Law at the Faculty of Law at Lund University.|$|E

The statute then gives the equity purchaser (or its successor) twenty days to reconvey the property on the condition of repayment of any consideration paid to the equity seller. HEPTA does not affect the rights of a bona-fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value if their conveyance occurred before the recording of the notice of rescission.|$|E

5000|$|Innocent {{misrepresentation}} {{occurs when}} the representor had reasonable grounds for believing {{that his or her}} false statement was true. Prior to Hedley Byrne, all misrepresentations that were not fraudulent were considered to be innocent. This type of representation primarily allows for a remedy <b>of</b> <b>rescission,</b> the purpose <b>of</b> which is put the parties back into a position as if the contract had never taken place. Section 2(2) Misrepresentation Act 1967, however, allows for damages to be awarded in lieu <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> if the court deems it equitable to do so. This is judged on both the nature of the innocent misrepresentation and the losses suffered by the claimant from it.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} enter into {{agreements}} with debtors, there is a disclosure requirement respecting fees and services to be offered, and {{the risks and benefits}} of entering into such a contract. The service must offer counseling services from a certified counselor and a plan must be created in consultation by the counselor for debt-management service to commence. The contents of the agreements and fees that may be charged are set by the statute. There is a penalty-free three-day <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> {{on the part of the}} debtor. The debtor may cancel the agreement also after 30 days, but may be subject to fees if that occurs. The service may terminate the agreement if required payments are delinquent for at least 60 days.|$|E
50|$|A mutual mistake {{occurs when}} the parties to a {{contract}} are both mistaken about the same material fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is {{a meeting of the}} minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. Collateral mistakes will not afford the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission.</b> A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be material (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, {{there is the question of}} the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.|$|E
50|$|For certain {{transactions}} {{secured by}} a borrower’s principle dwelling, TILA {{requires that the}} borrower be granted three business days following loan consummation to rescind the transaction. The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> allows borrowers time to reexamine the credit agreement and cost disclosures, {{as well as to}} reconsider whether they want to place their homes at risk by offering it as security for the credit. Each borrower and any person who has a vested interest in the property may exercise the right to rescind until midnight of the third business day following consummation, or delivery of all material disclosures, whichever occurs last. If the required rescission notice or material TILA disclosures are inaccurate or not delivered, the borrowers right to rescind may be extended from three days after consummation to up to three years.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type <b>of</b> {{application}} for <b>rescission,</b> however, is an application for <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> a default judgment.|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, {{one party}} {{will have the}} right to elect whether to annul the {{transaction}} or to affirm it.

5000|$|June 12, 1950: BOEING AIRPLANE CO. v. AERONAUTICAL INDUSTRIAL DIST. LODGE NO. 751, OF INTERNATIONAL ASSN. OF MACHINISTS et al. [...] This {{court case}} is address {{the fact that}} Lodge 751 broke the {{contract}} of not giving notice before going on strike. The verdict was when Boeing gave a letter to Lodge 751 that said “The strike which began last night and which is now continuing at the Seattle plants of the Company and which the union caused and sanctioned is in direct violation and repudiation of the collective Bargaining Agreement dated January 5, 1944, as amended March 16, 1946, between Boeing Aircraft Company and Aeronautical Industrial District Lodge 751 and International Association of Machinists.” [...] What this letter essentially did was nullify their contract. Which as discussed in BOEING AIRPLANE CO. v. AERONAUTICAL INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT LODGE NO. 751, INTERNATIONAL ASS'N OF MACHINISTS, et al. “The power of termination which accrues to the wronged party {{as a result of}} such a breach and was exercised by Boeing in this case is a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> which leaves neither party with any basis thereafter to complain of the conduct of the other as a breach of the contract.” [...] What this means is that the Union was not exactly guilty of going on strike since {{at that point in time}} there was no contract between Lodge 751 and Boeing.|$|E
40|$|It is {{commonly}} held that if getting a contractual remedy was costless and fully compensatory, rescission followed by restitution {{would not exist}} as a remedy for breach of contract. This claim, we will demonstrate, is not correct. Rescission and restitution offer more than remedial convenience. Rational parties, we argue, would often desire a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> followed by restitution even if damages were fully compensatory and costless to enforce. The mere presence {{of a threat to}} rescind, even if not carried out, exerts an effect on the behavior of parties. Parties can enlist this effect to increase the value of contracting...|$|E

50|$|On February 23, 2010, exactly {{three years}} after {{borrowing}} $611,000 from Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. to refinance the mortgage on their home, Larry and Cheryle Jesinoski mailed a letter to Countrywide to rescind the loan agreement. On March 12, 2010, Bank of America Home Loans sent a reply letter in which they refused to acknowledge the validity <b>of</b> the <b>rescission.</b> The Jesinoskis filed suit in federal district court on February 24, 2011 seeking a declaration <b>of</b> <b>rescission</b> and damages. The district court {{ruled in favor of}} Bank of America and concluded that the Truth in Lending Act requires borrowers seeking <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> a loan to file a lawsuit within three years of consummating the loan. Because the Jesinoskis filed their lawsuit four years after the loan's consummation, they were not entitled to <b>rescission</b> <b>of</b> the loan. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the decision of the district court. The Jesinoskis appealed again, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 28, 2014.|$|R
