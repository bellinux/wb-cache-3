40|$|In {{designing}} off-market (self-tender offer) share repurchases, Australian {{companies must}} consider the resulting potential tax benefits for different investor groups with consequent effects upon the supply of stock tendered by holders and the ultimate tender outcome. We develop and estimate {{a model of the}} stock supply curve which demonstrates less than perfect elasticity and incomplete tax arbitrage arising from “participation risk ” for potential arbitrageurs. We are able to estimate the extent of disequilibrium in prices involved in fixed <b>price</b> <b>repurchases,</b> and show that it is substantial. We show that Australian Tax Office restrictions on the tender price range for Dutch auctions have meant that non-participating shareholders have foregone some potential benefits through the transfer of. tax benefits to (primarily institutional, low tax rate) successful tender participants.

5000|$|A Christian {{prohibition}} on profit from money without working made banking sinful. Though Pope Leo the Great forbade charging interest on loans by canon law, {{it was not}} forbidden to take collateral on loans. Pawn shops thus operate {{on the basis of}} a contract that fixes in advance the 'fine' for not respecting the nominal term of the 'interest free' loan, or alternatively, may structure a sale-repurchase by the 'borrower' where the interest is implicit in the <b>repurchase</b> <b>price.</b> Similar conventions exist in modern Islamic banking. Various ways around the prohibition were devised, so that the lowly pawnshop contractors could bundle their risk and investment for larger undertakings. Christianity and Judaism generally ban usury, but allow usury towards heretics. Thus Christians could lend to Jews and vice versa. The only real necessity for a young man who desired a future in the financial world of the Middle Ages was the ability to read and write; the methods used for bookkeeping were carefully kept within families and slowly spread along trade routes. Therefore, this knowledge was available most readily to Jesuits and Jews, who consequently played a major role in European finance. Generally the Jesuits took the role of go-between with heads of state, while the Jews manned the low-end pawnshops. This explains the disproportionately large share of Jews in the goldsmith trade and early diamond market (diamonds being a lightweight alternative to gold).|$|E

40|$|Off-market (self-tender offer) share repurchases by Australian {{companies}} {{provide a}} valuable example of corporate capital management where {{the effects of}} shareholder tax heterogeneity can be readily identified. We develop {{a model of the}} Dutch auction tender process commonly used for such repurchases which enables us to test whether the supply of stock tendered is consistent with complete tax arbitrage. We estimate an upward sloping supply curve of stock tendered, confirming results of less than perfect elasticity found in studies in other environments, and find less than complete tax arbitrage. The model is used to examine the effect of price constraints on auction price outcomes and distribution of tax benefits between shareholders in different tax positions and to assess the mispricing resulting from fixed price tenders. The results provide support for recent legislative changes which removed constraints on the allowable range of <b>repurchase</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we have a}} {{research}} on the supply chain buy-back modes based on the consumer’s strategic returns with the competition. In the supply chain with the manufacturer and two competing retailers, discuss the three supply chain buy-back modes focusing on the consumer’s strategic returns {{from the point of}} the manufacturers: the manufacturers repurchasing the return products through the retailers; the manufacturers repurchasing the return products directly; the asymmetric return repurchasing mode. By analyzing the three models, the manufacturers’ and two retailers’ optimal decision and the optimal profits are obtained, which provides the suggestions for the members to choose the right supply chain buy-back mode. The results show that: in the different buy back mode, the players’ profits in the supply chain are different; the choice of the buyback modes depends on the consumers’ return rate, the proportion of the customers choosing to return and the <b>repurchasing</b> <b>price,</b> but the asymmetric buy back mode is non-optimal mode.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we build a {{theoretical}} model of corporate debt repurchases. First, {{we find that}} the firm that buys back its own debt from a creditor must pay a premium over the price at which the same creditor is willing to trade with third parties. This is because the repurchase by a firm leads to a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of cash or assets available to pay the remaining debt. Second, the <b>repurchase</b> <b>price</b> is lower when there are multiple bondholders because of cross-creditor externalities. Therefore, we challenge the view that restructuring more dispersed debt is always more costly to implement. Third, when bankruptcy costs are significant, there is a range of prices below face value at which debt can be repurchased. Fourth, we show that repurchases contribute to flexibility in firms capital structure and increase ex-ante firm value, but have limited power to mitigate debt overhang...|$|E

The cumulative return is positive and highly correlated with the repurchase premium, excepting pro-rated offers.

The study uses a unique dataset on initiation announcements and actual repurchases conducted by firms {{listed on the}} Stockholm Stock Exchange during the period 2000 - 2009. The results show that initiation announcements of open market repurchase programs exhibit a two-day abnormal return of approximately 2 %. The price impact on the actual repurchase days is positively correlated with the daily repurchase volume, and is both statistically and economically significant during the first 3 repurchase days in a repurchase program. The long-run abnormal stock performance is positively associated with the fraction of shares bought in the program and is approximately 7 % the first year following the initiation announcement. The results indicate that <b>repurchase</b> trading provides <b>price</b> support and that the market participants detect and perceive the initiation announcement and the first repurchase days in a repurchase program as a signal of undervaluation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a durable product retailing and recycling {{problem in a}} closed-loop supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and two competitive retailers, in which the manufacturer collects used products via retailers from the consumers and has sufficient channel power over the retailers {{to act as a}} Stackelberg leader; the retailers compete in retail products and recycling used products. In order to analyze the impact of retailing and recycling competitions on the profits of the manufacturer and the competitive retailers, two collection models (coordinated collection (Model C) and decentralized collection (Model D)) are established, respectively. Then, based on game theory, we derive the optimal retail price, the optimal <b>repurchase</b> <b>price,</b> and the optimal profits of the manufacturer and the retailers. The managerial insights demonstrate that more intense retailing competition induces the increase of the manufacturer's profits in both forward and reverse channels and retailers' profits in the forward channel and the decrease of retailers' profits in the reverse channel, while more intense recycling competition induces the decrease of the profits of the manufacturer and retailers in both forward and reverse channels. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} why rms {{buy back}} at prices below the average market price. The {{results of the}} empirical analysis suggest that contrarian trading is the major driver of the di erence between average monthly <b>repurchase</b> <b>price</b> and average monthly market price. There is also evidence {{in favor of the}} notion that at least some rms are able to time the market by exploiting private information. Moreover, contrarian trading and managerial timing are not exclusive explanations of why rms buy back at a bargain. The limit-order-hypothesis suggests that rms are able to buy back at bargain prices because they predominantly use limit orders for buying back their shares. By submitting limit orders at the prevailing bid, repurchasing rms are able to earn the spread. One of the implications of this hypothesis is that the exogenous bid-ask spread and bargains are positively correlated, i. e. a higher spread is accompanied by higher bargains. Furthermore, the bargains should be higher the more trades are executed at the ask. Therefore, an order imbalance towards trades at the ask price should as well increase the bargain. The empirical evidence presented in this paper is in line with these predictions...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect that {{consumer}} returns have on the coordination of a two-echelon supply chain with a single manufacturer and a single retailer that faces stochastic demand and a certain proportion of consumer returns for a single product. Returned goods command a full refund and result in reverse logistics costs for both retailer and manufacturer. ^ The manufacturer sets a wholesale price for the product and may also set a <b>repurchase</b> <b>price</b> at which she will buy any product left over at the retailer {{at the end of}} the selling season. The selling price for the product may be either given exogenously or a variable under the retailer 2 ̆ 7 s control given stochastic, price-dependent demand. The retailer sets the order quantity and in the latter case also the selling price. We analyze the optimal centralized and decentralized profit maximizing solutions and compare the optimal actions and profits with those associated with the classical model that ignores consumer returns. The results we obtain are counterintuitive: (1) higher profits and better coordination can be achieved when the players acting in a decentralized fashion do not consider any information about consumer returns as they make their pricing and ordering decisions, (2) retailer, manufacturer and total supply chain profits increase as the retailer faces a larger share of the logistics costs associated with consumer returns, (3) buy-back contracts may be detrimental to supply chain coordination if consumer returns are ignored in the decision-making process. ^ We also study the case in which the retailer postpones his pricing decision until after demand uncertainty is resolved when commercial returns are present in the system. We observe that also, under the presence of commercial returns, the price postponement strategy leads to larger expected profits for both, manufacturer and retailer, and thus, a better coordination of the supply chain. ^ In the last part of this dissertation, we study the Returns Allowance Credit Contract. This new type of contract is implemented when commercial returns are present in the supply chain and the retailer bears all the logistics costs associated with the returns. The manufacturer offers certain returns allowance credit in order not to lose retailer 2 ̆ 7 s good will. ...|$|E

We investigate implications of this difference for asset pricing models. In particular, the widely documented decline in the predictive power of dividends for excess stock returns in time series regressions in recent data is vastly overstated. Statistically and economically significant predictability is found at both short and long horizons when total payout yield is used instead of dividend yield. We also provide evidence that total payout yield has information in the cross-section for expected stock returns exceeding that of dividend yield and that the high minus low payout yield portfolio is a priced factor. The evidence throughout is shown to be robust to the method of measuring total payouts. ...|$|R

I suggest that asymmetry of information about opaque assets may cause instability. The widespread use of these assets as collateral contributed to a severe credit contraction during the recent crisis. In this context, I propose a theory of collateral re-use, a technique designed to overcome shortages of high quality assets to secure credit. The first chapter shows that information frictions generate liquidity uctuations whereby asset prices move endogenously. In the model, buyers meet sellers in a decentralized market and do not know their asset quality. Prices and volume increase with the average quality of sellers since buyers {{are more willing to}} trade. However, high trading volume depletes the pool of future high quality sellers. Cyclical equilibria in price and volume are thus sustained endogenously. Temporary asset purchase programs can revive the market and smooth out uctuations. Finally, I show that increasing market centralization may harm liquidity provision and reduce welfare. The second chapter introduces collateral re-use in an economy where agents face limited commitment and must pledge a durable asset to borrow. Lenders may then re-sell a pledged asset or re-pledge it to secure further borrowing. Since lenders may now default and fail to return the collateral, net gains from collateral circulation are ambiguous. I show that benefits are larger in decentralized markets when agents trade trough intermediaries. The third chapter, joint with Piero Gottardi and Cyril Monnet, complements this analysis, focusing on repurchase agreements. In a repo, the borrower sells an asset to raise income and commits to a <b>repurchase</b> <b>price</b> to limit exposure to future market risk. If defaulting borrowers incur a cost over and above the loss of collateral, re-use is beneficial and increases leverage. We show that intermediation now arises endogenously: trustworthy agents - those with high cost of default - re-use collateral to borrow on behalf of riskier counterparties. [...] 1.
