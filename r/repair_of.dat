He urged the <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of military engineering.|$|E

5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E

5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E

5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational <b>repair</b> <b>of</b> DNA damage.|$|E
