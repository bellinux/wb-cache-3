40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Insulin <b>resitance</b> plays a {{significant}} role in both morbidity and mortality of the general population. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance would help the identification of at-risk individuals in the presymptomatic stage, and the discovery of novel and more effective treatments. The transmemebrane glycoprotein ectonucleotide pyrophosphates phosphodiesterse 1 (ENPP 1) inhibits insulin receptor signalling and has recently emerged as a key player in the development of insulin resistance. This review will summarize data available on the relationship between ENPP 1 and insulin resistance. Recent findings Overexpression of ENPP 1 in insulin target tissues is an early, intrinsic defect observed in human insulin <b>resitance.</b> A missense ENPP 1 single nucleotide polymorphism, K 121 Q, has been recently described with the Q 121 variant being a stronger inhibitor than K 121 of insulin receptor function. In addition, the Q 121 variant has been repeatedly associated with insulin <b>resitance</b> and related abnormalities including body weight changes, type 2 diabetes and macrovascular complications, thus suggesting a pleiotropic role of the ENPP 1 gene on several metabolic abnormalities. Summary A deep undestanding of ENPP 1 mode of action and the mechanisms regulating its expression and function are likely to provide new tools for early identification and treatments of patients at risk for the devastating clinical outcomes related to insulin resistance...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{model of}} a {{multi-layer}} high-Tc superconducting (HTS) cable that computes the current distribution across layers as well as the AC loss is presented. Analyzed is the case of a four-layer cable, but the developed method can be applied to a cable with an arbitrary number of layers. The cable is modelled by an equivalent circuit consisting of the following elements: nonlinear <b>resitances,</b> linear self and mutual inductances, as well as nonlinear, hysteretic inductances. The first take into account the typical current-voltage relation for superconductors, the second introduce coupling among the layers and depend on the geometrical parameters of the cable, the third describe the hysteretic behaviour of superconductors. In the presented analysis, the geometrical dimensions of the cable are fixed, except for the pitch length and the winding orientation of the layers. These free parameters are varied in order to partition the current across the layers such that the AC loss in the superconductor is minimized. The presented model allows to evaluate rapidly the current distribution across the different layers and to compute the corresponding AC loss. The rapidity of the computation allows calculating the losses for many different configurations within a reasonable time. The model has so firstly been used for finding the pitch lengths giving an optimal current distribution across the layers and for computing the corresponding AC loss. Secondly, the model has been refined taking into account the effects of the magnetic self-field, which, especially at high currents, can sensibly reduce the transport capacity of the cable, in particular in the outer layers...|$|R

The results indicated that the expression of constructed genes was higher in transgenic plants driven by {{one or two of the}} rbcS promoter than by CaMV 35 S promoter. Increasing in freezinf tolerance was also founded in AF transformed plants. 環境因子是影響作物生長與分布最重要的因素，其中溫度的影響佔著重要的地位。過低的溫度，常造成幼苗或植株產生霜害或凍害。本試驗將分離自比目魚的抗凍蛋白基因(AF) 構築到攜帶有不同組合的CaMV 35 S及rubisco small subunit(rbcS) 啟動子的轉殖載體，並利用農桿菌將其轉移到青花菜(綠王) 及甘藍(初秋、和風) 的子葉或下胚軸。再生植株經南方墨點法分析檢驗，可在轉殖植株得DNA上偵測到雜交訊號。北方雜交墨點分析的結果顯示，存在轉殖植株體內的AF基因之表現量大都較接近構造基因的啟動子為CaMV 35 S啟動子之質體(pKcAn, pKccAn, pKrcAn) 之再生植株高。轉殖AF基因之再生植株進行生物檢定，可提高轉殖植物 2 5 ℃之抗凍能力...|$|E
40|$|The work of Eduardo Galeanohas had a {{huge impact}} in Latin America as well aselsewhere. It most {{impressive}} book, The OpenVeins of Latin America, published in 1971 the firsttime, has enjoyed over fifty editions in Spanishalready, plus other editions in several otherlanguages. This work whit memories of fire,represent a coherent wholw {{and they ought to}} beread together. Other writings have followed eversince such as the Book of Embraces and books onthe environment, women, football, neo-liberalismand so forth. In these publications Galeano presentsus with a powerful, altohough highly poetic, prosethat exposes the barbarities committed against ourcontinent in over 500 years. For Galeano, AmericaLatina is being made, has been made and it will becontinued to be made by the unavoidable strugglesof the oppressed. His message is, therefore, on ofpraise and encouragement of <b>resitance,</b> both passiveand active, against the horrors inflict upon so manyby so few. The need to maintain and perpetuate suchna unjust system is required by the mechanisms ofaccumulation the “system” has designed, perfect andmade ever more brutal with every cycle of capitalistaccumulation humanity has been forced to gothrough. This system has robbed of our own beingin the process and Galeano, with his simple butpowerful writings, has undertaken to recover thesources of our identity-to-be...|$|E
