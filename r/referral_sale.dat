50|$|According to Jay Levinson, guerrilla {{marketing}} emphasizes strongly on {{customer follow-up}} rather than ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on customer follow-up is a cheaper strategy because {{the cost of}} selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, {{it is important to}} focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat <b>sales,</b> <b>referrals</b> and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales.|$|R

Rexair's independent distributors and their independent dealers may use direct marketing techniques such as door to door lead generation, the use of referral gathering to get their leads. The main promotional tool it advocates is labeled as [...] "Talent Scouting" [...] which is recruiting a prospect to join the organization as a salesperson and a person who can [...] "scout (more) talent". Once a lead is generated, salespeople will attempt to contact this lead to schedule an appointment to show the Rainbow Cleaning System (sometimes called a vacuum, sometimes called an air filter). Rexair has been issued a certificate from AHAM, giving it the title of both a vacuum cleaner {{as well as an}} air filter.A prospect is offered a gift, if they offer to give the <b>sales</b> person more <b>referrals.</b> Rexair teaches <b>sales</b> and marketing techniques through corporate distributor developers and through training seminars.

The ready-mixed concrete franchise business in Thailand is business format franchise which Hoffman and Prebles (1993) explained the business format franchise that franchisees replicate in their local community an entire business concept, including product or service, trade name and methods of operation and Rubin (1978) stated that business format franchise controls by the franchisor may extend over products sold, price, hours of operation, condition of the plant, inventory, insurance, personnel and accounting and auditing. In driving franchise network competitiveness, there are two keys factors namely Franchisee Perceived Benefits and Franchisor Assistances were identified. The Franchisee Perceived Benefits consist of sales force enhancement, <b>sales</b> <b>referral</b> and tolling, asset networking, access to government projects, access to national and international contractors while Franchisor Assistances consist of commercial assistances, technical assistances, supplier relations and consultation assistances. Findings of key factors supporting the franchise network competitiveness and {{with the use of}} Structuring Equation Modeling (SEM) can explain the influence of the factors to the non-retail franchising business model. The result from the study can be applied to other non-retail businesses and also can be developed for further study in other non-retail franchise businesses...|$|R
40|$|Good metrics are {{well-defined}} formulae (often involving averaging) that transmute multiple {{measures of}} raw numerical performance (e. g., dollar <b>sales,</b> <b>referrals,</b> number of customers) to create informative summary statistics (e. g., average share of wallet, average customer tenure). Despite myriad uses (benchmarking, monitoring, allocating resources, diagnosing problems, explanatory variables), most uses require metrics that contain information summarizing multiple observations. On this criterion, we show empirically (with people data) that although averaging has remarkable theoretical properties, supposedly inferior nonaveraging metrics (e. g., maximum, variance) are often better. We explain theoretically (with exact proofs) and numerically (with simulations) when and why. For example, when the environment causes {{a correlation between}} observed sample sizes (e. g., number of past purchases, projects, observations) and latent underlying parameters (e. g., the likelihood of favorable outcomes), the maximum statistic is a better metric than the mean. We refer to this environmental effect as the Muth effect, which occurs when rational markets provide more opportunities (i. e., more observations) to individuals and organizations with greater innate ability. Moreover, when environments are adverse (e. g., failure-rich), nonaveraging metrics correctly overweight favorable outcomes. We refer to this environmental effect as the Anna Karenina effect, which occurs when less-favorable outcomes convey less information. These environmental effects impact metric construction, selection, and employment. metrics, metric selection, metric evaluation, summary statistics, environmental effects, natural correlations, forecasting, benchmarking, monitoring, statistical biases, choosing explanatory variables...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{studied the}} {{development}} and implementation of the conceptual Continuous Improvement Teamworking (CIT) Model for strategic performance improvement in retail banking operations. The investigation using of a dominant qualitative to a Less-dominant quantitative approach as a mixed-method strategy revealed the importance of the CIT Model realised through the CTIO (Concern-Task-Interaction-Outcome) Problem-Solving Cycle. The CTIO Cycle is a variant form of the traditional Deming-Shewhart PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) Cycle. With deregulation through financial reforms (FSRA Act) banking organizations are facing increased competition in the retail banking supply chain. There has been a new form and type of hybrid teamworking approach with banking organizations becoming virtual enterprises with sophistication of the financial management system and technological know how. With virtual meetings and interactive electronic communication people at work above their normal routine face-to-face teamworking activities are also having meetings, communication and sharing of information through a modernized Continuous Improvement Teamworking Approach using traditional teamworking, virtual team working (e-teamwork) and continuous improvement. In the mixed-method strategy used, the participant observation performed for 12 months in the retail banking operations confirmed the model. The two case studies implemented the CTIO Cycle with team members in two retail banking operations justified its problem-solving methodology to achieve strategic performance improvement of two key performance measures (<b>sales</b> <b>referrals</b> and customer satisfaction). The model tested in the two retail banking operations yielded desired and significant improvement. The 29 face-to-face interviews with managers using content analysis evaluated the validity of the model, and eventually the personal survey (149 questionnaires) with staff confirmed the reliability of the model. By doing the dominant qualitative research first, many hidden details and crucial parameters of the CIT Model were properly discovered by the researcher being closer to the scene. This would not have been successfully achieved if a quantitative methodology was firstly used. The findings provide insight into the triangulation of the knowledge domains of Continuous Improvement, teamworking and virtual teamworking from an integrated retail supply chain management perspective. The CIT Model is becoming increasingly important due to severe competition, economic down turn, increasing wave of technological know-how and quality information system. Considering the negative aspects of virtual teamworking, face-to-face teamworking is still being used with virtual interaction media. The research confirmed that teamworking in a modern service environment requires the use of both face-to-face and virtual interactions to deliver strategic productive performance of their retail supply chain. Thus, this study contributed for more than 29 papers with the Best Refereed Paper Award by the PhD Candidate at the Association of Qualitative Research (AQR) International Biennual Conference and two other awards from industry. This research is important to senior managers and first-line managers in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of teamwork as well as the overall operational activities of their businesses facing increasing competition, economic downturn, paradigm shift to e-Human Resources Management, e-quality management, e-Supply Chain Management, demanding customers for information system quality, and widespread waves of technology-driven innovations in information and communication technologies (ICT) in the retail banking supply chain...|$|R
