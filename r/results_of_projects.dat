40|$|Abstract—Despite the {{extensive}} use of eLearning systems, {{there is no consensus}} on a standard framework for evaluating this kind of quality system. Hence, there is only a minimum set of tools that can supervise this judgment and gives information about the course content value. This paper presents two kinds of quality set evaluation indicators for eLearning courses based on the computational process of three known metrics, the Euclidian, Hamming and Levenshtein distances. The “distance ” calculus is applied to standard evaluation templates (i. e. the European Commission Programme procedures vs. the AFNOR Z 76 - 001 Standard), determining a reference point in the evaluation of the e-learning course quality vs. the optimal concept(s). The case study, based on the <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>project(s)</b> developed in the framework of the European Programme “Leonardo da Vinci”, with Romanian contractors, try to put into evidence the benefits of such a method.
