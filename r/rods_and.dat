Hoping to create a vibrant community institution {{in what was then}} a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> spheres.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, {{to increase its}} surface area.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal <b>rods,</b> <b>and</b> an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E
5|$|The Saw Mill River, {{then known}} as the Nepperhan River, acted as a {{boundary}} between the Manhattan Indians and the Weckquaesgeeks, members of the Algonquian family who fished the region's streams and lakes with <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> nets. The Manhattans occupied present-day New York City north to the river, while the Weckquaesgeeks occupied the land from the river north to the Pocantico River. The Manhattans' principal village, Nepperamack, was {{on the site of}} present-day Yonkers where the Saw Mill River discharges into the Hudson River. The Weckquaesgeeks settled the site of today's Dobbs Ferry, and on the river's banks west of White Plains.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{assessment}} of verticality {{by means of}} <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame tests indicated that human subjects can be more (field dependent) or less (field independent) influenced by a frame placed around a tilted rod. In the present study we propose {{a new approach to}} these tests. The judgment of visual verticality (rod test) was evaluated in 50 young subjects (28 males, ranging in age from 20 to 27 years) by randomly projecting a luminous rod tilted between - 18 and + 18 ° (negative values indicating left tilts) onto a tangent screen. In the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test the rod was displayed within a luminous fixed frame tilted at + 18 or - 18 °. Subjects were instructed to verbally indicate the rod&# 8217;s inclination direction (forced choice). Visual dependency was estimated by means of a Visual Index calculated from <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test values. Based on this index, volunteers were classified as field dependent, intermediate and field independent. A fourth category was created within the field-independent subjects for whom the amount of correct guesses in the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test exceeded that of the rod test, thus indicating improved performance when a surrounding frame was present. In conclusion, the combined use of subjective visual vertical <b>and</b> the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test provides a specific and reliable form of evaluation of verticality in healthy subjects and might be of use to probe changes in brain function after central or peripheral lesions...|$|R

5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
5|$|The domes {{and drums}} {{typically}} incorporated wooden tension rings at several levels to resist deformation in the mortar {{and allow for}} faster construction. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie <b>rods,</b> <b>and</b> metal chains were also used to stabilize domed buildings. Timber belts at the bases of domes helped to stabilize the walls below them during earthquakes, but the domes themselves remained vulnerable to collapse. The surviving ribbed or pumpkin dome examples in Constantinople are structurally equivalent and those techniques were used interchangeably, {{with the number of}} divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Aided by the small scale of churches after the 6th century, such ribbed domes could be built with formwork only for the ribs. Pumpkin domes could have been built in self-supporting rings and small domical vaults were effectively corbelled, dispensing with formwork altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's long red schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two <b>rods,</b> <b>and</b> the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E

5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
