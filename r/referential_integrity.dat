40|$|National audienceThis chapter {{focuses on}} <b>referential</b> link <b>integrity</b> problems. In the {{industrial}} context, {{the life cycle}} of a document plays a central role in describing the “steps out” of a product. Users realize some manipulations like creation, edition, suppression and querying under a multi-user environment, risking possible destruction or the alteration of the document’s integrity. A classical impact is the infamous “Error 404 : file not found. ” However, the user needs a notification alert mechanism to prevent and warrant the coherence of manipulations over all the life cycle processes of a product. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a generic relationship validation mechanism to remedy this shortcoming. We believe in the combination of some standard features of XML, specifically XLL specification as a support for integrity management and Java-Triggers approach as an alert method. This study, compared with actual approaches, proposes a solution based on active functionalities...|$|R
40|$|A {{multilevel}} {{relational database}} represents {{information in a}} multilevel state of the world, which is {{the knowledge of the}} truth value of a statement with respect to a security level. The security semantics of a data classification scheme specifies the way that the classification of data in a multilevel relational database corresponds to the classification of statements in a multilevel state of the world. We formalize the security semantics of tuple-level and element-level data classification schemes, and show that they have the same expressive power. We derive entity, <b>referential,</b> and polyinstantiation <b>integrity</b> properties from the security semantics, and show that existing approaches to polyinstantiation integrity are inappropriate. Our results provide the foundation for the multilevel relational model, its integrity properties, its operational semantics, and its implementation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} support the work of {{researchers}} in the production, processing and interpretation of complex digital objects and the dissemination of valuable and diverse information to {{a broad spectrum of}} audience there is need for an integrated high performance environment that will combine knowledge base features with content management and information retrieval (IR) technologies. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of an integrated repository to ingest, store, manipulate, and export 3 D Models, their related digital objects and metadata and to enable efficient access, use, reuse and preservation of the information, ensuring <b>referential</b> and semantic <b>integrity.</b> The repository design is based on an integrated coherent conceptual schema that models complex metadata regarding provenance information, structured models, formats, compatibility of 3 D models, historical events and real world objects. This repository is not implemented just to be a storage location for digital objects; it is meant to be a working integrated platform for distant users who participate in a process chain consisting of several steps. A first prototype, in the field of Cultural Heritage, has already been implemented in the context of 3 D-COFORM project, an integrated research project funded by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013, no 231809) and the results are satisfactory, proving the feasibility of the design decisions which are absolutely new, ambitious, and extraordinarily generic for e-science...|$|R
2500|$|In {{information}} security, {{data integrity}} means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and {{completeness of data}} over its entire life-cycle. [...] This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.

2500|$|Recordset: A {{recordset}} is a {{group of}} records, and can either come from a base table or {{as the result of a}} query to the table. The RecordSet object contains a Fields collection and a Properties collection. The Fields collection is a set of Field objects, which are the corresponding columns in the table. The Properties collection is a set of Property objects, which defines a particular functionality of an OLE DB provider. The RecordSet has numerous methods and properties for examining the data that exists within it. Records can be updated in the recordset by changing the values in the record and then calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Adding new records is performed through the AddNew function and then by calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Records are also deleted in the recordset with the Delete method and then by calling on the Update method. However, if for some reason the deletion cannot occur, such as because of violations in <b>referential</b> <b>integrity,</b> then the recordset will remain in edit mode after the call to the Update method. The programmer must explicitly call on the CancelUpdate function to cancel the update. Additionally, ADO can roll back transactions (if this is supported) and cancel batch updates. Recordsets can also be updated in one of three ways: via an immediate update, via a batch update, or through the use of transactions: ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, Wang {{announced}} their first personal computers running Unix. Previously, Wang's {{presence in the}} UNIX and open systems markets had been modest. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, partially because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VSInteractive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran [...] "native" [...] on the VS hardware soon thereafterbut performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never {{a good fit for}} the inherently batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that [...] "tty" [...] style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent <b>referential</b> <b>integrity,</b> and speedy application development, {{was in the process of}} being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client server RDBMS model, built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were simply abandoned.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work proposed a standard framework for maintaining integrity in parallel database systems. A model {{consisting of two}} main modules has been successfully implemented. This framework is flexible and can be extended easily as the framework is designed in a modular fashion where each module has a clear function, input and output and interacts easily with the other modules. A constraint verification method is proposed to check the consistency between the integrity constraints in the constraint base. The proposed method {{is based on the}} construction of Modal Records to determine if a newly defined constraint is not contradicting with an existing constraint set. A constraint simplification approach is proposed to simplify the integrity constraints in the constraint base. Deriving and checking a simplified version of the integrity constraint called integrity tests can gain efficiency. Efficient maintenance of integrity is a critical problem, since checking the validity {{of a large number of}} integrity constraints against a large database is crucial to the database systems. The derivation of these integrity tests is not trivial, adding to the cost of integrity maintenance. The strength of the proposed approach is that it combines the advantages of the substitution as well as the theorem proving technique in the previous work. The proposed approach is based on substitution and requires no resolution search. It requires no complex transition axioms to describe the update operations. The proposed method is considered as a general one since it derives complete integrity tests for first order constraints. In addition, it derives sufficient tests for key, <b>referential</b> and semantic <b>integrity</b> constraints. The complete and sufficient integrity tests can be applied before the update operation is performed. Moreover, it can be extended to deal with transition integrity constraints, which are excluded from the previous approaches. Transition integrity constraints are important since they give relationships between the two states that an update or transaction is required to obey. As the research interest is in parallel database system, this research has proposed a virtual rule partitioning method for maintaining database integrity by dynamically partition the table(s) to accommodate with parallel integrity subsystem. Therefore, there will be no fixed partitions specified during the design process, which result in time consuming for the system to locate the proper partition of data, for fulfilling the requirement of the integrity test. The presented method is benefited from the direct access method because the tuples in each partition are indexed according to the test attribute during the execution of the integrity test. The test attribute is the attribute of the generated test that is substituted by the submitted update operation...|$|R
