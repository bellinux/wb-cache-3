40|$|Background: The {{reservoir}} of Plasmodium infection in humans {{has traditionally been}} defined by blood slide positivity. This {{study was designed to}} characterize the local <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in relation to the diverse var genes that encode the major surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum blood stages and underlie the parasite's ability to establish chronic infection and transmit from human to mosquito. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the molecular epidemiology of the var multigene family at local sites in Gabon, Senegal and Kenya which differ in parasite prevalence and transmission intensity. 1839 distinct var gene types were defined by sequencing DBL alpha domains in the three sites. Only 76 (4. 1 %) var types were found in more than one population indicating spatial heterogeneity in var types across the African continent. The majority of var types appeared only once in the population sample. Non-parametric statistical estimators predict in each population at minimum five to seven thousand distinct var types. Similar diversity of var types was seen in sites with different parasite prevalences. Conclusions/Significance: Var population genomics provides new insights into the epidemiology of P. falciparum in Africa where malaria has never been conquered. In particular, we have described the extensive <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> in local African sites and discovered a unique var population structure that can facilitate superinfection through minimal overlap in var repertoires among parasite genomes. Our findings show that var typing as a molecular surveillance system defines the extent of genetic complexity in the <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> to complement measures of malaria prevalence. The observed small scale spatial diversity of var genes suggests that var genetics could greatly inform current malaria mapping approaches and predict complex malaria population dynamics due to the import of var types to areas where no widespread pre-existing immunity in the population exists...|$|E

40|$|International audience—Managing spatial {{reservoirs}} {{of malaria}} infection plays {{a crucial role}} in effective disease control. In this paper, a <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> refers to one or more interconnected subpopulations that sustain the epidemic {{at the level of the}} metapopulation to which applying a (linear) control strategy suffices to eradicate the disease in the whole system. We propose a numerical method to explain the steps for identifying reservoirs of malaria infection within n connected regions with the explicit movement of human population from the previous theoretical results in order to design an efficient computational tool. Furthermore, we determine the minimal percentage (critical vaccination fraction) of susceptible individuals in the reservoirs that should be protected to eliminate malaria. The costs and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions were analysed considering two strategies of control. (i) protecting the minimal fraction of susceptible individual; (ii) protecting any fraction greater than the minimal fraction. Cost-effectiveness analysis shows that the less cost and more effective strategy is to vaccinate (or protect) the minimal fraction of susceptible human in the <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> to halt outbreak. A numerical example provides insight into the efficiency of this approach...|$|E

40|$|Emerging viruses {{cause a lot}} of {{fatalities}} as {{they jump}} to humans from other species. Here we develop a novel technique to computationally estimate an important parameter of within-host viral infection: the lifespan of infected cells. Our approach is general and can be applied to a large class of viruses and leverages experimental data from replicon studies. Current techniques have difficulties reliably estimating infected cell lifetimes due to parameter identifiability and correlation of parameters. The infected cell lifetime is an important parameter that gives an estimate of how fast virus levels will decline. Our method would also help determine if some infected cells are short-lived or have longer lifespans with the consequence that longer lived cells could be <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection.</b> This would give a mechanistic understanding of why particular cell types are <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and may motivate therapy targeted towards these cell types. We apply our technique to West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging disease of public health relevance related to Zika virus. Our analysis suggests that the most abundant infectible cells are short-lived and could motivate therapy that targets these particular cells. Our approach is very general and can be combined with more traditional methods of using differential equation models to simulate viremia in hosts: the combination of these two techniques will likely yield results that may not be achievable using the models in isolation. This will be of great interest especially in modelling emerging diseases...|$|R
