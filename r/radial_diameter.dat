The density of the fresh nuts (68. 8 % moisture content) was found to be about 0. 877 g/cm 3 while the nut thickness was 0. 067 cm. Full cracking of nuts increased with decreasing moisture content and increased drop height. The cracking energy was influenced by nut mass and <b>radial</b> <b>diameter</b> as well as shell moisture content. The nut and kernel moisture content have high linear relationship with the shell moisture content.

There was no available data about repeated-use of radial artery for coronary procedures. We evaluate the changes of <b>radial</b> arterial <b>diameter</b> and procedural outcomes of repeated transradial procedure. Materials and Methods：Of consecutive 1771 transradial coronary procedures, 117 patients received repeated transradial procedures through the same radial artery. <b>Radial</b> arterial <b>diameter,</b> vascular access time and procedural outcomes were evaluated in between the group of first-use and repeated-use of radial artery. Results：Among 117 patients of second transradial coronary procedure in the repeated-use group, 47 patients (41. 6 %) underwent coronary intervention and 66 patients (58. 4 %) underwent coronary angiography. The right radial approach was used in 82. 9 % of the cases.

MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data. Consecutive patients (n= 148) with chronic renal failure, needing vascular access for haemodialysis, were included if they underwent duplex ultrasound examination to evaluate preoperatively the vascular status and diameters for radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (RCAVF) construction. The associations between the <b>diameter</b> of the <b>radial</b> artery and cephalic vein and primary failure at six weeks, primary and secondary patency at one year were investigated.

40|$|AbstractAims and objectivesTransradial {{interventions}} are gaining popularity in recent years. However the radial artery being small, {{there is a}} limitation in using interventional devices through this route. We have measured radial and ulnar arteries size in adult patients at our tertiary care cardiology center in southern Rajasthan. MethodAdult patients > 30 years, who came for Echocardiography at a tertiary care center were included. Radial and ulnar arteries inner diameters were measured 2 – 3  cm above the Styloid process in both forearms with the Ultrasonography. Patient information about weight, height, diabetes and hypertension were collected. Body mass index and Body surface area were calculated. ResultsWe studied 204 patients, which includes 60. 8 % males. Mean diameter was 2. 325  ±  0. 4  mm mm for radial arteries and 2. 358  ±  0. 39  mm for ulnar arteries (p =  0. 24). Hypertensive and male patients had larger mean <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> than non hypertensive (2. 383  mm v/s 2. 272  mm, p =  0. 006) and female patients (2. 37  mm v/s 2. 26  mm, p =  0. 008) respectively. Diabetic patients (2. 305  mm) had nonsignificantly smaller <b>radial</b> arteries <b>diameters</b> than nondiabetics (2. 329  mm, p =  0. 6). We calculated correlations between <b>radial</b> arteries <b>diameters</b> and Body surface area, Body mass index, height and weight of patients, none of these correlations were statistically significant (r =  0. 30, r =  0. 28, r =  0. 07, r =  0. 031 respectively). ConclusionMean <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> (2. 325  ±  0. 4  mm) {{in the study was}} slightly smaller than ulnar artery (2. 358  ±  0. 39  mm).

We assessed in healthy volunteers, after oral administration of aspirin (500 mg), the effect of local infusion of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 8 mol/min for 8 minutes), an NO synthase inhibitor, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA; 9 mol/min for 8 minutes), a KCa channels inhibitor, and the combination of both on radial artery internal diameter, wall thickness (echo tracking), blood flow (Doppler), and pressure. The incremental elastic modulus and compliance were fitted as functions of midwall stress. L-NMMA decreased modulus and increased compliance at high levels of midwall stress (all P 0. 05) without affecting <b>radial</b> <b>diameter.</b> TEA reduced <b>radial</b> <b>diameter</b> from 2. 680. 07 to 2. 500. 08 103 m, increased the modulus, and decreased the compliance {{at all levels of}} stress (all P 0. 05). Combination of both inhibitors synergistically enhanced the increase in modulus, the decrease in diameter (from 2. 710. 10 to 2. 420. 09 103 m), and compliance compared with TEA alone (all P 0. 05). These results confirm that inhibition of NO synthesis is associated with a paradoxical isometric smooth muscle relaxation of the radial artery. They demonstrate the involvement of KCa channels in {{the regulation}} of the mechanical properties of peripheral conduit arteries, supporting a role for EDHF at this level in vivo. Moreover, the synergistic effect of L-NMMA and TEA shows that KCa channels compensate for the loss of N...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of seed source (isohyets and half-sib families) and irrigation intervals on the stem anatomy of Acacia senegal seedlings. Twelve seed sources representing the clay soil locations across the gum belt were selected according to differences in isohyets and discontinuity. Seeds were collected from seven trees from each seed source. Seeds were sown in clay soil under three irrigation regimes with intervals of 3, 6 and 12 days in three replicates. After six months wood samples were cut from randomly selected seedlings representing half-sib families, isohyets and irrigations. Microscopic sections were prepared from the stems of each seedling and mounted on slides. Both direct measurement and stereological count techniques were used to measure the vessel characteristics and volume fraction of different types of tissues. Significant variations were found between isohyets in tangential diameter and average vessel diameter of solitary vessels. For cluster vessels, isohyets had significant effect on <b>radial</b> <b>diameter,</b> tangential diameter and average vessel diameter. Significant differences were also found in radial multiple vessels in tangential diameter and average diameter. Significant differences were found between isohyets in the misomorphic ratio of vessels. There were also significant differences between isohyets in total number of solitary vessels/mm 2 and average number of vessels in one radial multiple vessels/mm 2. This in addition to the significant differences between isohyets in double cell wall thickness of solitary vessels. The variation among families and their interaction with irrigation were not significant for any of the studied variables.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1 B, there were {{significant}} differences in the cell wall ratio of tracheids among tree-density zones in June–August, although significant differences were not recognized in other seasons (ANOVA, p[*]<[*] 0.01; multiple comparisons tests, p[*]<[*] 0.01).

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the xylem of {{gymnosperm}} trees consists mainly of tracheids and that the dimensions of these cells change over the growth season in temperate regions. When looking at a micrograph of a cross section of a growth ring, {{it can be seen that}} early in the season tracheids have larger <b>radial</b> <b>diameters</b> and thin walls, while tracheids formed later in the growth season have smaller <b>radial</b> <b>diameters</b> and thicker walls. However, information on possible chemical differences between these two regions of the growth ring is less abundant. According to a few published studies, earlywood normally contains more lignin relative to cellulose compared to latewood. For studies based on traditional compositional analysis and with results given per gram dry matter, this result is hardly surprising, as it simply expresses that a larger part of earlywood cell wall material consists of lignin-rich middle lamella because cells have larger diameters and thinner walls. However, a few studies based on ultraviolet microscopy indicate that differences in biopolymer composition also are seen when individual cell wall layers are analysed. In this study, we used Raman microspectroscopy to assess the relative biopolymer composition of earlywood and latewood secondary cell walls from Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and compared the biopolymer composition to infrared spectroscopy performed on isolated earlywood and latewood from the exact same growth rings...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} whether reflex neurohormonal constrictor forces attenuate the vasodilator {{action of}} nitroglycerin on large peripheral conductance vessels. Background. Continuous nitroglycerin therapy {{is associated with}} the development of early tolerance with respect to its hemodynamic effects. It remains to be demonstrated whether vascular tolerance of large conductance vessels is an important contributory factor. Methods. <b>Radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> and forearm blood flow velocity were measured before and 24 and 48 h after continuous intravenous nitroglycerin infusion (0. 5 μg/kg body weight per min) in 10 patients with coronary artery disease (mean age ± SEM 59 ± 4 years) by using a high resolution ultrasound device. Blood flow (ml/min) was calculated from mean blood flow velocity and cross-sectional area. Results. Increasing concentrations of nitroglycerin led to a dose-dependent increase in <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> (maximal + 24 ± 2 %) and heart rate. Forearm vascular resistance and forearm blood flow were unchanged. After 24 and 48 h of treatment, additional nitroglycerin did not further increase <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter,</b> indicating that the nitroglycerin-induced dilation of the radial artery was maintained and was still maximal. In addition, <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> measured before and after 48 h of nitroglycerin infusion and after withdrawal of nitroglycerin in five additional patients showed that, after withdrawal, arterial diameter returned to baseline values within 35 min. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone and vasopressin levels increased significantly at 24 and 48 h, accompanied by a decrease in hematocrit. Conclusions. Continuous intravenous administration of nitroglycerin exerts a sustained vasodilator effect for 48 h in large conductance vessels. Neurohormonal activation and compensatory intravascular volume expansion do not attenuate the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin on peripheral conductance vessels during the 1 st 48 h of treatment...|$|R

Therefore, our purpose was to evaluate anatomical right-to-left differences of <b>radial</b> head <b>diameters.</b> We also compared conventional two-dimensional (2 D) with three-dimensional (3 D) measurements. We used bilateral CT-scans from 25 intact proximal radius pairs of right-handed adult subjects to obtain 50 3 D radial head models. After contralateral matching, diameters were calculated using a 3 D-based method using an automated circle-fit in standardized cross-sections at the widest level midway through the radial head. The 3 D-based diameters were compared to orthogonal line measurements in standard axial CT-slices. Three-dimensional analysis yielded a <b>radial</b> head <b>diameter</b> of 23. 0 ± 1. 7 mm. The dominant right side was significantly wider, with right-to-left differences of 0. 2 ± 0. 4 mm, with a maximum of 0. 9 mm.

It {{is assumed}} that roots are major sites of tZ production, and that trans-zeatin riboside (tZR) plays a role as a root-to-shoot acropetal signal [19]. Water deficit increased cytokinin oxidase and implied cytokinin degradation in Zea mays [24]. Plant responses with deficits of macronutrients or water showed some differences but also similarities, mostly involving hormonal long-distance signaling [25]. As previously described, water deficit induced formation of tracheid with small <b>radial</b> <b>diameter</b> in sugi trees [4]. If the results for tZ in Arabidopsis and Zea mays held true in sugi trees, deficit of water and macronutrient may affect degradation and inhibition of cytokinin synthesis, and the decreased amounts of cytokinins may affect tracheid differentiation in sugi trees. We hypothesize that tZ-type cytokinins may be the signal which transmits the information of water and macronutrients contents in the soil to the differentiating tracheid in sugi trees.|$|E

An optical imaging method called Ring Profiler was developed to determine what effect SilviScan’s resolution had on the measurements.

40|$|IntroductionVascular Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (vEDS) is an {{autosomal dominant}} inherited disorder of connective tissue. This syndrome results from mutations in the gene encoding type III procollagen. The patients can present with spontaneous arterial rupture or dissection. We had previously described that celiprolol stiffened large-sized elastic artery (common carotid artery) in vEDS. We tested {{the effects of}} celiprolol, a beta 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist with a beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist action in small-sized muscular artery (radial artery) in vEDS. Methods 47 vEDS patients with no previous beta-blocker were randomized to 5 years treatment. According to a PROBE design, they were allocated either to celiprolol (50 to 200 mg once a day, n= 23) or no treatment (n= 24). <b>Radial</b> internal <b>diameter,</b> intimamedia thickness (IMT) and distension were measured on the right arm with a 10 -MHz ultrasound system analyzing the radiofrequency signal. Radial blood pressures were obtained with applanation tonometry. Other radial parameters (wall cross-sectional area, wall-to-lumen ratio, distensibility, Young's elastic modulus and circumferential wall stress) were calculated from <b>radial</b> internal <b>diameter,</b> IMT, distension, mean blood pressure and pulse pressure. We used MIXED procedure of the SAS® System through the repeated statements to compare serial changes in blood pressure and arterial parameters in two groups. ResultsAfter 12 months, heart rate, radial systolic and mean blood pressure, pulse pressure, IMT, Young's elastic modulus and circumferential wall stress did not change in both groups. Radial diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (p= 0. 03) and {{to the same extent}} in both groups (− 5 % in the celiprolol group and − 6 % in the control group) (period effect). <b>Radial</b> internal <b>diameter,</b> wall cross-sectional area increased significantly (+ 5 %, p= 0. 04 and + 12 %, p= 0. 04 respectively) and wall-to-lumen ratio decreased significantly (− 2 %, p= 0. 04) in celiprolol group but not in control group (periodby-group interaction). Significant increase in distensibility was observed in celiprolol group (+ 18 %, p= 0. 04) but not in control group (group effect). Conclusionscompared to no treatment, celiprolol induced a moderate dilation and an important augmentation of elasticity of the radial artery with no change in radial blood pressure. The results proposed the pleiotropic effect of celiprolol in small-sized muscular artery...|$|R

40|$|Extract] Tree rings {{provide an}} {{indispensable}} tool for assessing a tree's response to variability in its environment, oftentimes also pro¬viding {{a means of}} reconstructing that variability beyond instru¬mental records. The wood that trees produce is laid down sequentially, creating an archive of temporally ordered material that is rich in physiological and environmental information. This is {{made all the more}} useful because trees are globally distrib-uted, can live for thousands of years and in some cases remain intact long after they die. Tree-ring archives are used {{in a wide variety of}} studies, including, but not limited to, climate recon¬structions (Cook et al. 2010), archaeological dating of ruins (Čufar 2007), reconstructions of fire history and recurrence intervals (Swetnam et al. 1999), and assessments of tree physiological responses to drought (McDowell et al. 2010). The number of applications for tree rings has grown steadily in recent decades, and the variety of measurements that can be made on tree rings has grown as well (Speer 2010). The simplest measurement that can be made is in-series whole-ring widths. From this starting point, additional information can be gained from measuring early-wood and late-wood widths, wood density, elemental abundances, microfibril angles, <b>radial</b> <b>diameters</b> of xylem conduits and stable-isotope ratios of the organic material in tree rings. A tree-ring record based on a single sample from a tree is referred to as a series, whereas a composite of many series is referred to as a chronology...|$|R
40|$|Leaf venation is diverse across {{plant species}} and has {{practical}} applications from paleobotany to modern agriculture. However, {{the impact of}} vein traits on plant performance has not been tested in a model system such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies analyzed cotyledons of A. thaliana vein mutants, and identified visible differences in their vein systems from the wild type (WT). We measured leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf), vein traits, and xylem and mesophyll anatomy for A. thaliana WT and four vein mutants. Mutant true leaves did not possess the venation anomalies previously shown in cotyledons, but varied quantitatively in vein traits and leaf anatomy across genotypes. The WT had significantly higher mean Kleaf. Across all genotypes there was strong correlation of Kleaf with traits related to hydraulic conductance across the bundle sheath, as influenced by the number and <b>radial</b> <b>diameter</b> of bundle sheath cells and vein length per area. These findings {{support the hypothesis that}} vein traits influence Kleaf, indicate the usefulness of this mutant system for testing theory primarily established comparatively across species, and support a strong role for the bundle sheath in influencing Kleaf...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Multi-wavelength {{observations}} of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4666 {{have led to the}} detection of an outflow cone associated with a galactic superwind, emanating from a central starburst with a <b>radial</b> <b>diameter</b> of about 6. 5 kpc. The outflow is traced up to 7. 5 kpc above the plane by optical emission line filaments, nonthermal radio continuum emission, associated magnetic fields perpendicular to the galactic plane, and soft X-ray emission from hot gas. Optical spectroscopy exhibits the kinematic signature of an outflow and the observed line ratios indicate that shock heating is the most likely excitation mechanism for the emission line gas. The outflow is well approximated by a 6. 5 kpc base (the extent of the central starburst) plus a cone with an opening angle of 30 ◦ ± 10 ◦. In the outer disk of NGC 4666 numerous luminous H ii regions were detected, which lead to additional outflows (galactic fountains or chimneys) of gas into the halo. Radially the radio halo is much more extended than the central outflow cone and it has an exponential z-scale height at 1. 43 GHz of 1. 7 ± 0. 28 kpc. NGC 4666 is in many respects very similar to NGC 4631, another edge-on galaxy with an extended gaseous halo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We related intra-annual {{patterns}} in radial growth rate and xylem density to foliar phenology and second growth flushes {{in a young}} Douglas-fir plantation in western Washington. Three foliar maturity classes were defined: (1) shoots and needles elongating; (2) elongation complete, needles maturing; and (3) needles mature. Diameter growth rate had two peaks, one {{about the time of}} budbreak and one when foliage was in maturity Class 2. There was a limit to the maximum periodic density of xylem formed at a given rate of diameter growth; as growth rate increased, maximum periodic density decreased. Although xylem density profiles varied widely among individual trees, xylem density differed significantly among foliar maturity classes, increasing 16 % from Class 1 to 2 and 60 % from Class 2 to 3. Diameter growth rate of second-flushing trees was significantly greater in July compared with trees with no second flush, but we detected no relationships between second-flushing and xylem density patterns or false rings. Although the young trees in this study did not show distinct earlywood–latewood transitions, fully mature foliage (Class 3) was associated with formation of xylem exhibiting characteristics of latewood: greater density, reduced diameter growth rate, reduced tracheid <b>radial</b> <b>diameter,</b> and less interannual growth variation...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the endothelium {{plays an important role in}} the control of human vascular tone by releasing endothelium-derived nitric oxide. The hypothesis that an impairment of this mechanism is involved in the increased peripheral vasoconstriction of patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) was tested. Acetylcholine and N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis from L-arginine, were infused in the brachial artery of healthy volunteer subjects (controls) and patients with severe CHF. The <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> was determined by a high-precision A-mode ultrasound device, using a 10 MHz probe. Forearm blood flow was calculated from vessel diameter and blood flow velocity measured simultaneously by Doppler. The blood flow response to acetylcholine was blunted in patients with CHF compared with that in control subjects. In contrast, the decrease in blood flow induced by L-NMMA was exaggerated in CHF, and the blood flow response to nitroglycerin was preserved. The changes in <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> induced by acetylcholine and L-NMMA were not significant in control subjects and CHF patients, but dilation of the radial artery by nitroglycerin was significantly reduced in CHF. The results demonstrate an impaired endothelium-dependent dilation of forearm resistance vessels in CHF, suggesting a reduced release of nitric oxide on stimulation. In contrast, the basal release of nitric oxide from endothelium of forearm resistance vessels is preserved or may even be enhanced, and may play an important compensatory role in chronic CHF by antagonizing neurohumoral vasoconstrictor forces in CHF...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to test the null hypothesis that an S-shaped surgical incision versus conventional (straight) skin incision in the creation of autogenous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas (RCAVFs) have no impact on the primary end-point of primary functional maturation and secondary end points of stenosis and thrombosis. Methods: A prospective observational comparative consecutive study with intention-to-treat on individuals undergoing only radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVFs) over a period of 12 months was conducted. Variables on patient's demographics, comorbidities, anesthesia type, mean arterial blood pressure, thrill, laterality, cephalic vein and <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> were collated. The test of probability was assessed through Chi-Square, Kaplan-Meier survival estimator and Log-Rank analysis. Results: Total of n =  83 individuals with median age of 67 years (IQR, 20 – 89) and male predominance 83 % during this period were subjected to RCAVF formation. Total of n =  45 patients in straight skin incision were compared to n =  38 individuals in S-shaped group. Despite equal prevalence of demographics, comorbidities, anesthesia type, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), thrill, laterality, cephalic vein and <b>radial</b> artery <b>diameter</b> (p >  0. 05) higher incidence of juxta-anastomotic stenosis was noted in the straight skin incision group (p =  0. 029) in comparative and survival analysis (Log-Rank, p =  0. 036). The maturation of the entire cohort was 69 % (S-shaped 76 % vs. straight group 62 %) (p >  0. 05). Conclusion: The outcome of this study demonstrates that S-shaped surgical skin incision is associated with a lower incidence of stenosis in comparison to straight incision type in RCAVF formation...|$|R
