40|$|The employ of vegetal fibers for {{textiles}} and composites represents a great potential in {{economic and social}} sustainable development. Some Malvaceae species are considered tropical cosmopolitans, such as from Sida genus. Several species of this genus provide excellent textile bast fibers, which are very similar in qualities to the jute textile fiber. The objective {{of the present study}} is present the physicochemical characterization of six Brazilian vegetal fibers: Sida rhombifolia L.; Sida carpinifolia L. f.; Sidastrum paniculatum (L.) Fryxell; Sida cordifolia L.; Malvastrum coromandelianum (L.) Gurck; Wissadula subpeltata (Kuntze) R. E. Fries. Respectively the two first species are from Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome and the four remaining from Brazilian Cerrado biome, despite of present in other regions of the planet. The stems of these species were <b>retted</b> <b>in</b> <b>water</b> at 37 oC for 20 days. The fibers were tested in order to determine tensile rupture strength, tenacity, elongation, Young’s modulus, cross microscopic structure, Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM), regain, combustion, acid, alkali, organic solvent and cellulase effects, pH of the aqueous extract, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). The obtained values were compared with those from fibers of recognized applicability in the textile industry including hemp. The results are promising in terms of their employment in thermoset and thermoplastic medium resistance composites.

40|$|Kenaf fiber—polyester {{composites}} incorporated with powdered {{activated carbon}} (PAC) were prepared using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) process. The product demonstrates the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding function. The kenaf fibers were <b>retted</b> <b>in</b> a pressured reactor {{to remove the}} lignin and extractives in the fiber. The PAC was loaded into the freshly <b>retted</b> fibers <b>in</b> <b>water.</b> The PAC loading effectiveness was determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis. A higher BET value was obtained with a higher PAC loading. The transmission energies of the composites were measured by exposing the samples to the irradiation of electromagnetic waves with a variable frequency from 8 GHz to 12 GHz. As the PAC content increased from 0 % to 10. 0 %, 20. 5 % and 28. 9 %, the EMI shielding effectiveness increased from 41. 4 % to 76. 0 %, 87. 9 % and 93. 0 %, respectively. Additionally, the EMI absorption increased from 21. 2 % to 31. 7 %, 44. 7 % and 64. 0 %, respectively. The ratio of EMI absorption/shielding of the composite at 28. 9 % of PAC loading was increased significantly by 37. 1 % {{as compared with the}} control sample. It was indicated that the incorporation of PAC into the composites was very effective for absorbing electromagnetic waves, which resulted in a decrease in secondary electromagnetic pollution...|$|R
40|$|Jute retting {{process is}} one of the {{important}} responsible factors for quality of jute fiber. Scarcity of jute <b>retting</b> <b>water</b> <b>in</b> some areas of Bangladesh {{is one of}} the major issues. The main purpose of this study was provided information about the status of present jute retting process as well as mentioned the advantages and disadvantages of different jute retting processes. Data about traditional jute retting process and ribbon retting process were collected through personal interview from the jute growers. The farmers are involved in jute cultivation and majority of them use the traditional method and time consuming approach of <b>retting</b> <b>in</b> ponds/canals. The traditional method hampers the quality of the jute fiber, fish cultivation and pollutes the environment as it decomposes bio-mass. For minimizing the problems of jute retting process, the farmers are now more interested on ribbon retting process. Therefore, for getting quality jute fiber, a low cost ribbon retting technique is essential and farmers could able to produce high quality jute fiber...|$|R
40|$|The {{product of}} the RET {{proto-oncogene}} is a protein belonging to the receptor-like tyrosine kinase superfamily. <b>RET</b> is expressed <b>in</b> several neural crest-derived cell lineages and has been implicated in the correct development of the peripheral nervous system. To gain further insight into RET function, we investigated the presence of active <b>RET</b> <b>in</b> adult rat tissues. We show, by immunoblotting, that {{the products of the}} RET proto-oncogene (p 155 (<b>ret))</b> are present <b>in</b> specific regions of adult rat brain, including the cerebellum, striatum, brainstem, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Moreover, in the cerebellum, p 155 (<b>ret)</b> is phosphorylated <b>in</b> tyrosine residues, thus indicating that this brain structure contains p 155 (<b>ret)</b> <b>in</b> an activated state. Finally, the presence of <b>RET</b> <b>in</b> motoneurons prompted us to analyze the effects of hypoglossal nerve section on its expression. We observed a dramatic increase <b>in</b> p 155 (<b>ret)</b> <b>in</b> the motoneuron nuclei, thus suggesting that RET tyrosine kinase plays a role in the neuronal response to axotomy and/or during nerve regeneration...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{resonance}} energy transfer (<b>RET)</b> <b>in</b> a nanostructure {{influenced by a}} vicinal, nonabsorbing third body is studied {{within the framework of}} molecular quantum electrodynamics. Direct RET and the influence of neighboring matter have been studied previously, mainly for molecules. However, a complete study or unified understanding of direct and indirect <b>RET</b> <b>in</b> nanostructures with different dimensionalities is still lacking. Therefore, there is a strong need for a complete theory that models RET for the cases of quantum wells, nanowires, and quantum dots. We construct a detailed picture of excitation energy transfer in nanostructures and how it is affected by another quantum object, which includes the derivation of quantum amplitudes based on second- and fourth-order time-dependent perturbation theories, and the derivation of transfer rates and distance dependencies, providing a complete picture and understanding of <b>RET</b> <b>in</b> nanostructures. The results of the derivations indicate that the dimensionality of the nanostructure determines the controllability of the RET rate. Furthermore, third-body mediation leads to a nonvanishing <b>RET</b> <b>in</b> the coupling of nanowire to nanowire and quantum dot to quantum dot...|$|R
40|$|The RET gene encodes a {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor for neurotrophic molecules.

40|$|The {{abundant}} {{resources of}} Sindh province for RE (Renewable Energy) such as wind, solar, etc. can be tapped through RETs (Renewable Energy Technologies) to fulfil energy needs. But RETs {{are still not}} able to make major breakthrough in individual?s life to enhance it. Even though individuals began to use solar panels to conquer power deficiencies, more endeavours are required to diffuse <b>RETs</b> <b>in</b> Sindh. This research paper explores the present situation for the dissemination of <b>RETs</b> <b>in</b> masses. A survey is conducted to achieve the said task. It measures the opinion difference of respondents regarding awareness creation towards RETs, needs for funding, provision of incentives and role of community engagement required for promotion of <b>RETs</b> <b>in</b> Sindh. The opinion difference was measuredregarding stakeholders? individual perception and chances of occurring the same (societal perception). The outcome of the survey identifies an entirely opposite opinion of stakeholders regarding their individual and social perceptions. Thus, predicting the real situation for <b>RETs</b> diffusion <b>in</b> Sindh. It indicates that despite much enthusiasm for RETs, lesser possibilities are accessible for their fruitful dispersion in Sindh in current conditions. Lack of awareness regarding RETs, few funding opportunities and absence of incentives from government resulted in the low engagement of communities to utilise RETs. Hence, due to hurdles identified, <b>RETs</b> face hindrances <b>in</b> their popularisation, which can be addressed through appropriate policy decisions...|$|R
