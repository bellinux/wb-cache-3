40|$|ARCO Metals Company (Formerly Anaconda Aluminum Company) is {{proceeding}} as scheduled {{with the construction}} of a $ 400 Million aluminum processing complex in Logan County, Kentucky. When the initial construction phase is completed in the Fall 1983, the complex will be capable of producing 400 million pounds per year of aluminum, sheet and foil using highly automated, computer controlled equipment that will maximize end product quality and minimize the consumption of energy. This paper will describe the basic processes used in the Logan complex and several design features that are being incorporated to reduce energy consumption. Large reverberatroy melting furnaces will <b>remelt</b> <b>scrap</b> aluminum and <b>ingots</b> will be cast on site to supplement those delivered to the site from ARCO Metal's reduction plants. The melting furnaces are expected to achieve a high efficiency which will be further enhanced by the utilization of exhaust gases to preheat the scrap as well as the combustion air. A coreless induction furnace will be used to reduce the melt loss normally associated with light gauge <b>scrap.</b> The <b>ingots</b> will be heated prior to rolling in the hot mill in direct fired preheating furnaces with variable speed fans that minimize cycle time. Flue gasses from these furnaces will be used to generate steam In a waste heat boiler. Motor loads in the hot mill and cold mills, along with other electrical loads, will be monitored by a computer system to minimize peak loading on the TVA power system. Annealing of aluminum coils will be accomplished in radiant tube furnaces with variable speed fan drives in an inert atmosphere produced by an electric powered air separation plant. These furnaces will use recuperative burners. The HVAC system incorporates a feature that will recover stratified hot air for use {{in other parts of the}} complex for ambient temperature control...|$|R
50|$|The first rails {{made from}} steel {{were made in}} 1857, when Robert Forester Mushet <b>remelted</b> <b>scrap</b> steel from an {{abortive}} Bessemer trial, in crucibles at Ebbw Vale ironworks, and were laid experimentally at Derby railway station on the Midland Railway in England. The rails proved far more durable than the iron rails they replaced and remained in use until 1873. Henry Bessemer supplied 500 tons of steel blooms to the London and North Western Railway's rail mill at Crewe in 1860. Several other companies began producing steel rails in the following years. The transition to steel rails was hastened {{by the introduction of}} open hearth steelmaking. William Siemens set up his Landore steelworks partly to supply rail to the Great Western Railway. A boom in rail production followed, but a banking crisis in America slowed the rate at which railways were built there and orders to British rail producers. The British iron and steel industry went into a recession, which particularly affected the wrought iron sector. When demand for rails began to grow again, it was largely for steel rails, which were more durable than those of iron.|$|R

The objective of this project is to investigate energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in secondary aluminum cast house through process analysis. The result offers a comprehensive overview to aid decision-maker to compare energy consumption and environmental impacts caused by different product or process. This project {{has been done in}} collaboration with SAPA Heat Transfer. This project consists of two tasks. First task is aimed to give an overview of annual energy distribution and carbon footprint of per ton aluminum slab in SAPA cast house. In order to analyze energy distribution, mass and energy conservation has been applied for calculation. Meanwhile, International standard method, life cycle assessment, has been used to evaluate greenhouse gas contribution of the whole production process. The second task intends to investigate two effects (melting furnace type, raw material type) on products’ energy consumption and carbon footprint.  Melting furnace’s effect is compared by selecting electric induction furnace and oxy-fuel furnace. On the other hand, raw material’s effect is studied by comparison of four different cast house products which have different raw material recipe. Calculation and analysis results indicates that per ton Sapa cast house aluminum slab consumes energy 3826 MJ and contributes to 306 kgCO 2 eq. green house gas. Meanwhile, comparison results show that oxy-fuel melting furnace has higher energy efficiency than electric induction furnace, however, it contributes much more GHG due to consumption of propane fuel.

40|$|The {{development}} of reliable, high powered plasma generators {{has resulted in}} many plasma processes being proposed as alternatives to existing pyrometallurgical technologies. This work evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of plasma systems by reviewing plasma generators, their integration with reactors and the process economics. Many plasma systems were shown to be technically and economically superior to existing technologies, but some of the plasma system advantages quoted in the literature were found to be impractical because of other system constraints. Process applications were limited by the power inputs available from plasma generators compared to AC electric furnaces. A series of trials were conducted where chromite and steelplant baghouse dusts were smelted in the Tetronics' 2. 0 MW transferred arc/open bath reactor to confirm the operating characteristics of the plasma system and its economics. Chromite smelting was technical superior to submerged arc furnace technology, but the economics were unfavourable because of the limited power available from the water-cooled plasma torch and the high electrical energy consumption. A DC graphite electrode plasma furnace using preheated and prereduced chromite concentrates will compete economically with the submerged arc furnace. Ni, Cr and Mo were economically recovered from high alloy content steelplant dusts for recycling. Five Electric Arc Furnace dusts were smelted to produce a non-toxic residue and recover the contained zinc to an enriched zinc oxide product for recycling. It should be possible to condense the zinc vapour directly in a zinc splash condenser to increase the value of the product.

40|$|When <b>remelting</b> {{aluminium}} <b>scrap,</b> metal losses due to dross {{generation is}} a common problem. Reduction of these losses will give substantial economic and environmental benefits. Dross is generated when aluminium metal oxidizes and films of oxide envelope molten metal. When a cold metal object is immersed in a melt, {{the heat of the}} melt around this is transferred so rapidly into the object that a shell of melt often solidifies {{to the surface of the}} object. When scrap with low bulk density is charged to a melt, solidification of melt on the cold scrap prevents melt from entering the cavities in the bulk of the scrap, and the bulk density remains low. Thus the scrap tends to float on the melt surface. Submersion of this scrap is important to avoid oxidation and subsequent dross generation. One solution to this is to roll scrap to a strip and feed it into the melt. This system has been examined by studying feeding of a continuous, thin aluminium plate into molten aluminium. Also, the effect of lacquer was considered, as well as feeding the plate into a launder with melt flowing along the surface of the plate. An analytical, one-dimensional, steady-state model has been developed to describe the melting and the melting mechanisms. It is based on a shell solidifying on the plate surface and a gap introducing a thermal resistance 1 /hg between the shell and the plate. The thermal resistance 1 /hl of the boundary layer of the melt is included. Depending on these resistances, the initial temperature of the plate and the melt temperature, a shell will form, and the plate will penetrate a distance P into the melt before it melts away. An experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to feed aluminium plate from a coil into a melt bath at a specified velocity. The plate could be withdrawn rapidly to “freeze” the situation like it was below the melt surface. The penetration depth P of the plate could be measured and shell formation observed. More than 200 experiments were performed, and by comparing the penetration depth at different feeding velocities and melt temperatures to model predictions, the two heat-transfer coefficients hl and hg could be determined by curve fitting. They agree reasonably well with values found in the literature and calculated from boundary-layer theory. In a few experiments, the plate feeding was recorded on video tape, and the cross section of some plates was studied in a microscope. Feeding of somewhat thicker plates was also tried. This gave valuable background information for comparing the experiments to the model. We believe that snap-off of the plate due to low mechanical strength around the melting temperature may affect the measurement of the penetration depth of the plate. Attempts were also made to measure the temperature in the plate by attaching thermocouples to its surface. The obtained temperature profiles in the plate were compared to the model predictions, but the method needs improvement. A criterion for formation of a shell is formulated and tested against experimental observations. Qualitative agreement is achieved. Even if there is no shell formation, it seems that there will be an air film with thermal resistance 1 /hg. This indicates that the melting rate will be independent of whether a shell is formed or not. Two additional models with only one heat-transfer coefficient are also developed in order to challenge the main model. From this analysis it is found that the use of two heat-transfer coefficients is necessary to describe the system. The model should be of direct interest when feeding rolled scrap into molten aluminium. Improvement of the model can be attained by reconsidering the assumptions made, but then numerical methods must undoubtedly be applied. These new models should include the snap-off mechanism. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|Starting from {{existing}} challenges and limitations in light metal recycling (in particular aluminium and magnesium alloys), this PhD thesis aims {{to address these}} and explore new opportunities by sustainable metal management and solid-state recycling (SSR) methods. This PhD also quantifies the potential environmental benefits of the explored strategies and SSR techniques by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). More specifically: During pyro-metallurgical recycling of aluminium alloys, the refining/melt purification options of aluminium alloys, restricted by thermodynamic barriers, are very limited compared to other base metals such as steels. As the removal from the melt of most elements is problematic, {{it is crucial to}} control their concentration in the scrap streams prior to <b>remelting.</b> Thus, <b>scrap</b> sorting is important to avoid additional (eventually impossible) refining, quality degradation (down-cycling), and dilution of the residual elements with primary aluminium addition. It is therefore described that establishing of well-optimised, harmonised recycling loops is of prime importance from an environmental perspective. Based on these arguments, Chapter 2 addresses this issue by developing a decision support model that aids in the direction of environmental conscious metal clustering. It aims: i) to express and quantify in a LCA framework, dilution and quality losses that occur during open loop recycling, and ii) to determine the optimal material input for the recycling process based on the input/output metal composition. By compositionally closing the recycling loops, it is feasible to minimise primary resource addition (primary aluminium and alloying elements) by maximising the scrap utilisation. A multi-objective optimisation approach (goal programming) is selected as the most appropriate method to prioritise the optimisation goals. After performing the environmental modelling of the secondary aluminium production as a reference route, Chapter 3 moves on to ‘meltless’ or ‘solid state recycling’ techniques for high grade aluminium production scrap. This approach is studied to achieve a significant material and energy savings by omitting/bypassing the conventional recycling step. Annually more than 40 % of liquid aluminium is scrapped during the initial production-fabrication-manufacturing steps. Especially for fine form scrap from material removal processes, their very high surface-to-mass ratio results in significant unrecoverable oxidation losses during remelting. In this context, this work investigates the applicability of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) as an alternative SSR technique for aluminium alloy chips (Chapter 3). This allows the direct fabrication of bulk, near-net shape and semi-finished products directly from machining chips. The improved consolidation achieved via SPS is associated with the combined action of plastic deformation and the electric field during SPS processing. Microstructural investigations as well as the mechanical behaviour of the SPS blanks confirm successful solid state chips welding. Furthermore, this work also investigates applications of SPS in scrap consolidation and binding. Chapter 4 examines the use of atomised aluminium powder as a binding material/matrix for the machining chips. Chapter 5 describes the consolidation via SPS of larger scrap types (sheet metal scrap). After developing a reliable SPS route for SSR of aluminium alloy scrap, Chapter 6 analyses the environmental performance of the SPS route along with major SSR routes for aluminium alloys (recycling via hot extrusion and via screw extrusion). For this reason a LCA study was conducted where the examined SSR routes are compared with their corresponding remelting routes as reference. Mg alloys confront similar challenges in recycling as aluminium alloys. Taking also into account the wide range of magnesium applications and their higher scrap value compared to aluminium scraps; Chapter 7 focuses on broadening the material palette of SSR via SPS into Mg alloys. In this respect, this work studies the consolidation of machining chips for two Mg systems (i. e., pure Mg and AZ 31 Mg alloy). This includes the microstructural evolution in different metal recycling steps (initial ingot, chips, SPSed samples) as well as the mechanical behaviour of the recycled samples versus their parent material. Finally, the conclusions, the contributions to {{the state of the art}} as well as proposed future research topics are discussed in Chapter 8. nrpages: 180 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{global demand}} for {{aluminium}} and aluminium products is progressively increasing. However, {{the production of}} primary aluminium is an energy intensive process and emits at the world average ~ 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) per tonne metal. However, aluminium recycling is attractive because one can save up to 90 % of the energy, as well as 95 % of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aluminium recycling industry is facing several challenges, such as treatment and disposal of by-products, emissions control and requirements related to energy efficiency. A {{state of the art}} remelting furnace requires 2. 5 GJ/tonne metal, which is more than twice the theoretical energy consumption. Also, <b>remelting</b> of fine <b>scrap,</b> such as turnings and chips leads to significant metal loss. However, solid state recycling methods not involving remelting might offer higher metal yield and lower energy consumption than conventional recycling based on remelting. In the present study, solid state recycling of aluminium turnings and sawing scrap was investigated by cold compaction and subsequent hot extrusion and Cyclic Extrusion and Compression (CEC), respectively. Degreasing of aluminium scrap by thermal treatment or acetone treatment was compared with respect to the recycled metal products. In addition, ECAP of hot extruded materials was used for evaluating the internal bonding and deformation behaviour during severe plastic deformation. Mechanical properties and microstructures of the extruded and ECAPed materials were carefully investigated. Also, characterization of aluminium scraps, e. g. automotive aluminium scrap and aluminium primary dross was performed using state of the art techniques, such as EPMA and XRD with Rietveld refinement. Finally, the energy requirement for solid state recycling processing was calculated and discussed. Characterization of aluminium scraps revealed that impurities were quite common in industry scraps. Also contaminations, e. g. metallic iron and its oxides, lead and TiO 2 were observed in the automotive scrap collected from a commercial shredder. Aluminium dross has a complicated composition, containing metallic aluminium particles, corundum, spinel etc. The EPMA results showed that iron and manganese and their oxides were widely distributed in the dross fines. Metallic aluminium in dross tended to solidify as large size particles. The leachate from aluminium dross water leaching exhibited a high content of fluoride and H 2 gas bubbles after leaching for 72 hours. The results from the TG/DTA-MS analysis indicated an optimal thermal degreasing temperature, e. g. ~ 428 C. High temperature thermal treatment of turnings resulted in a significant increase of scrap surface oxide films. However, the combustion peak for the lubricants was ~ 374 C, corresponding to the second DTG peak at ~ 350 C. In addition, the thermal treatment time should be optimized so as to complete the decomposition and combustion of the lubricants. CEC processed aluminium sawing scrap turned out to be fully dense. However, room temperature tensile properties after CEC revealed high variability, indicating the presence of material inhomogeneity. Besides, microstructure observations showed that the scrap from sawing contained a mixture of different aluminium alloys. This could be part of the explanation versus the inhomogeneity. Also, a fully dense material was obtained for the aluminium turnings processed by hot extrusion at 500 C at an extrusion ratio of 15 : 1. The corresponding hardness and room temperature tensile strength values constituted 95 - 98 % of the properties of conventional reference material. To be noticed, the thermal treatment of feedstock turnings at 350 C for 30 minutes did not introduce obvious differences in mechanical properties of the recycled extruded materials as compared to acetone treated feedstock. Post extrusion ECAP showed improved mechanical properties and enhanced internal interface bonding. Oxides produced at the feedstock surfaces could be broken and redistributed upon hot extrusion and especially after ECAP applying a high number of passes at elevated temperatures, e. g. 8 passes at 100 C or 200 C. As a consequence, the key mechanical properties, such as the fracture elongation and the UTS, could be nearly as good as the conventional material counterparts. Energy requirement estimations for solid state recycling revealed that the precompaction process uses less than 7 % of the energy required for the world’s best practice conventional remelting, and resulted in a 93 % carbon dioxide equivalent emission reduction.
