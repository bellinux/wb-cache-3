25|$|Because of the {{geography}} of Bradford, the station was built as a terminus, with the lines in a 'Y'-formation, so trains must <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of the station to continue their journey.|$|R
5000|$|... 13 years later, in May 2017, a RASE {{logistics}} lorry {{got stuck}} underneath the arch; after letting down the tyres, {{it was able}} to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> with no apparent damage to the structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{bus station}} {{is set on}} large and open forecourts and the buses park facing the pickup point on arrival and <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> on departure. The {{pedestrian}} areas are under cover, although not strictly 'inside'.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Viborg {{station was}} a terminal station, and trains arriving {{there had to}} end their journeys (terminate) or <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of the station. In 1896, however, the station was moved to its present location and the current station building was built.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately 20 {{vehicles}} {{entered the}} tunnel {{during the next}} few minutes. Most drivers managed to <b>reverse</b> <b>out,</b> prompted by the smoke moving towards them. However, four vehicles were trapped behind the burning tanker: a private car, a beer truck and two [...] pickups.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the station}} {{was at the end}} of a branch, trains had to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> before {{continuing}} eastwards along the NER line (the former eastern part of the Cleveland Railway) to Loftus, or to Saltburn (from 1878 to 1917 on the Priestcroft Curve or via Brotton).|$|R
25|$|Plans for {{a tunnel}} southward {{underneath}} the CBD to Mt Eden {{and even to}} Morningside were debated for nearly a century. With Britomart in operation since 2003, the tunnel would allow trains to run through the station {{rather than having to}} <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> over the same set of tracks.|$|R
6000|$|Winston laughed. [...] "Can't {{we leave}} my virtues, or the <b>reverse,</b> <b>out</b> of the question? I feel that I am right, and {{want you to}} dissuade your uncle. It would be even better if, when I return to Winnipeg, you would empower me to buy wheat for you." ...|$|R

5000|$|From 22 March 1904 {{the line}} from [...] to Southport was {{electrified}} using a third rail to provide an electric service {{all the way to}} Liverpool. From 15 February 1909, electrification was extended to most electric trains between Southport and Crossens called at Meols Cop and <b>reversed</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
50|$|While <b>reversing</b> <b>out</b> of the minefield, Neptune {{struck a}} third mine, which {{took off her}} {{propellers}} and left her dead in the water. Aurora was unable to render assistance as she was already down to 10 kn and needed to turn back to Malta. Penelope was also unable to assist.|$|R
5000|$|The station's {{terminal}} layout has posed {{some problems}} in its operation, since all trains {{have to change}} directions and <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of the station to continue on to their destinations. This can cause long turn-around times and it places the passengers {{in the opposite direction}} of where they had been facing.|$|R
50|$|Harrie {{was often}} heard to quip that it paid his examinees to be civil. Those who were {{inclined}} to adopt a high and mighty attitude would more than likely find themselves down a narrow alley in the city's busy centre and asked to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> or lose their chance of getting a licence.|$|R
50|$|In the Wiesbaden {{suburb of}} Breckenheim a double line connects to Wiesbaden, partly {{next to the}} A66 and then next to the Ländchesbahn. Trains run into the Wiesbaden {{terminal}} station and can then <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> to go to Mainz and Mannheim. The 13.2-kilometer-long Wiesbaden branch has a maximum speed of about 160 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} {{designed}} as a terminal station, with railways branching off of the main line and ending at the station. This has made some of the lines passing through Isfahan to bypass the station altogether, to save 1 to 2 hours of time wasted on going in the branch and <b>reversing</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Japan, double {{strikethrough}} is conventionally used (rather than single strikethrough) when striking <b>out</b> <b>text.</b> This is {{for added}} clarity, as in complex kanji a single strikethrough may be missed or confused with a stroke in the character.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Illustration of {{signaling}} by semaphore in 18th century France. The operators {{would move}} the semaphore arms to successive positions to spell <b>out</b> <b>text</b> messages in semaphore code, {{and the people}} in the next tower would read them.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally whales {{have become}} {{trapped in the}} narrow Clachan Sound. In 1835 a whale {{measuring}} 24 m with a lower jaw of 7 m was stranded having become trapped in shallow water and unable to <b>reverse</b> <b>out.</b> In 1837, 192 pilot whales were caught in a similar fashion, the largest being 8 m long.|$|R
50|$|Laura {{manages to}} restart the bus and <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of {{the path of the}} {{speeding}} charger, causing the car to fly off of a cliff and drop down the into the quarry. The car lands in a small storage building full of explosives, resulting a spectacular and satisfying explosion which incinerates the car and the driver.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} decades there was a {{structural}} and operational oddity at Kaiserslautern West station: the part handling passenger services was built as a terminal station so that passenger trains to Lauterecken had to reverse into the station. Trains running {{in the opposite direction}} had to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> the station and run backwards to Kaiserslautern Central Station (Hauptbahnhof).|$|R
50|$|The {{station at}} Skibbereen {{was built on}} a cramped site {{adjacent}} {{to that of the}} Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway. The S&S trains had to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of the station into a headshunt, before proceeding towards Schull. (A similar reversing operation is still required at Killarney railway station on Iarnród Éireann's line from Mallow to Tralee).|$|R
5000|$|Hence {{organisations such as}} the Cyclists Touring Club {{are usually}} opposed to all {{proposed}} echelon parking schemes, though there are some alternatives, such as [...] "back in" [...] angle parking (slanted the [...] "wrong" [...] way, with the driver reversing into the space, rather than <b>reversing</b> <b>out),</b> which can overcome {{many of the issues}} of safety.|$|R

50|$|During 1863-5 both M&G and the Cleveland Railway were {{absorbed by}} NER {{and the old}} Cleveland line was {{abandoned}} south of Ormesby. NER then connected the line east of Guisborough to the M&G line before Guisborough, meaning trains had to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of the terminal before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until its closure in 1960.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the line}} from Hamburg, the Blankenese-Wedel {{extension}} {{is connected to the}} eastern end of the station, so trains have to <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of the station to continue their journey. The line then runs to the stations of Iserbrook, Sülldorf, Rissen and finally, the terminus at Wedel. Unlike the section east of Blankenese, the extension to Wedel is mostly single track.|$|R
50|$|Until 2006, {{the station}} {{was the only one}} in Spain in which trains heading towards Canfranc and the Pyrenees had to enter the station before then <b>reversing</b> <b>out</b> again to take the {{junction}} to Canfranc, around 500 metres outside the station. In 2007, Adif finished the Huesca rail bypass. Since then, regional trains from Zaragoza to Jaca and Canfranc reverse in the station.|$|R
50|$|The nearest {{railway station}} is to Claggan Park is Fort William railway station which is around a 12-minute {{walk from the}} ground. The station {{is located on the}} West Highland Line between Glasgow Queen Street railway station and Mallaig railway station. Trains from Glasgow Queen Street {{terminate}} at Fort William before <b>reversing</b> <b>out</b> the station and continuing on to Mallaig.|$|R
5000|$|Often, in car {{parking lots}} using {{perpendicular}} parking, {{two rows of}} parking spaces may be arranged front to front, with aisles in between. If no other cars are blocking, a driver may perform a [...] "pullthrough" [...] by driving through one parking space into the connecting space {{to avoid having to}} <b>reverse</b> <b>out</b> of a parking space upon their return.|$|R

When the MIME parser detects a HTML part, it invokes the HTML parser to separate <b>out</b> <b>text,</b> style-sheets, hyperlinks, and scripts. For the purpose of building PLSA model, both text and hyperlinks are considered.|$|R

5000|$|One of Canada's wrestling exports, Chris Benoit took on Al Snow in what Styles {{predicted}} {{would be}} a fantastic scientific matchup. The two men exchanged holds and counters early on before midway through the contest a German suplex/pin attempt has an impact Snow's neck. Benoit follows up with a hooking clothesline and taunts Snow to get up before continuing with suplexes and slams. Benoit asks the crowd [...] "is this the best the United States has to offer?" [...] A diving headbutt and powerbomb both garner two counts. Another German suplex gets a nearfall before Snow <b>reverses</b> <b>out</b> of a dragon suplex and into a Snow Plex. Snow is now in control, hitting a superkick for two and an Exploder suplex for a nearfall. Benoit <b>reverses</b> <b>out</b> of another suplex attempt into a German suplex that wipes out both men. Benoit reverses into a dragon suplex and maintains the bridge for the pinfall. Benoit continues his assault after the match and powerbombs Snow, which brings out the medics and Snow has {{to be carried out}} on a stretcher.|$|R
