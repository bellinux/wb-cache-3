This result goes against recent findings in the political economy literature. In the state Senate I find a significant discontinuity in the tax level, but I also find a discontinuity in the density of the forcing variable - which implies that we can not interpret the discontinuity in the Senate as a causal relation.

30|$|In {{multiple}} regressions, using a {{large number}} of independent variables may cause the dependent variable to be regressed against {{a large number}} of covariates. Retaining all covariates will likely lead to severe multicollinearity or non-identifiability of regression coefficients. Variable selection techniques are not often very effective, and we are interested in including information from all of the covariates. Based on these considerations, we conducted principal component analysis. Principal component analysis enables us to find a small set of linear combinations of the covariates, which are uncorrelated with each other, to avoid the multicollinearity problem. It also ensures that the linear combinations chosen in our <b>regression</b> <b>design</b> have the maximal variance.|$|E

These discontinuities violate the assumptions underlying the <b>regression</b> discontinuity <b>design,</b> which are crucial for identification. Consequently, IV estimates of class size effects are likely to be seriously biased.

The election significantly increased the gap between the opposition to different-race immigration, which did not change, vs. same-race immigration, which significantly decreased. The finding, robust to a large set of checks, is shown to be substantially shaped by socioeconomic and partisan identities. In particular, the causal effect of Donald Trump’s unexpected win on the willingness to report racist attitudes is stronger among old men living in urban areas. Moreover, the aggregate effect is driven by extreme right-wing units with high level of political interest. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{modeling}} the linear elastic {{behavior of a}} polycrystalline material on the microscopic level, a special problem is to determine a so-called discrete orientation distributions (DODs) which satisfy the isotropy condition. A DOD is a probability measure with finite support on SO(3), the special orthogonal group in three dimensions. Isotropy of a DOD {{can be viewed as}} an invariance property of a certain moment matrix of the DOD. So the problem of finding isotropic DODs resembles that of finding weakly invariant linear regression designs. In fact, methods from matrix and group theory which have been successfully applied in linear <b>regression</b> <b>design</b> can also be utilized here to construct various isotropic DODs. Of particular interest are isotropic DODs with small support. Crystal classes with additional symmetry properties are modeled by stiffness tensors having a non-trivial symmetry group. There are six possible non-trivial symmetry groups, up to conjugation. In either cases we find isotropic DODs with fairly small support, in particular for the cubic and the transversal symmetry groups...|$|E
