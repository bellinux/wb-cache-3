No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E

Hutchinson {{indicated}} that Borah confided this [...] "in words that <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> a prayer." [...] McKenna noted, [...] "It was fortuitous that the march of events prevented Borah from joining those pacifists and liberals... who trudged up the hill to Berchtesgaden to lay before the Fuehrer their plans for world peace".|$|E

2500|$|Although Penney and Cook {{had very}} {{different}} temperaments, they forged a good working relationship. Under Cook, [...] "the establishment <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> clockwork... everything was well-documented; {{there was a}} lot of open discussion; and everything operated on a very short time scale." [...] Cook kept a tight rein on the work through the Weapons Development Policy Committee, which he created in April 1956. The consensus of scientists who worked on the project was that Britain would not have developed the hydrogen bomb without Cook, although Cook gave the credit to Penney. Cook was present as the scientific director of the Operation Grapple nuclear tests at Malden Island in May and June 1957, and the successful thermonuclear test at Christmas Island in November 1957. He was created a knight bachelor in the 1958 New Year Honours.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of Buena Vista the war essentially was over for the Arkansas volunteers. [...] On June 7, with their one-year enlistment nearly completed, the Arkansas troops were paid and mustered out of the service. [...] Many of the Arkansans, eager to return home as quickly as possible, took passage on a steamer to New Orleans and then up the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers to Little Rock. [...] William F. Pope, who lived in Little Rock at the time, later wrote in his memoirs that one young man from Colonel Roane's forces was greeted by his father who said: “I hear you all fought like hell at Buena Vista”. [...] But the young veteran replied with a loud laugh: “We <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> hell at Buena Vista.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Clásico Tapatío, {{as it is}} known, is {{the oldest}} derby in Mexican {{football}} {{since its inception in}} 1916, being a game that is lived with great passion on the part of supporters of both Chivas and Club Atlas. In {{the early stages of the}} rivalry Guadalajara supporters started to dub players of Atlas by calling them [...] "Margaritas". In reaction to the name, a group of Atlas supporters reacted by claiming that their rivals <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Chivas Locas" [...] (Crazy Goats) and to the Chivas players it was considered an insult. Over time the meaning of [...] "Chivas" [...] changed due to the popularity of the club and it became a term of endearment upon the Chivas fans. They used to share [...] Estadio Jalisco, which caused controversies with the fans until, in 2010 Chivas moved to the Estadio Chivas.|$|E

2500|$|Michigan won, 19–0, in a {{game that}} The New York Times wrote had [...] "crowned the {{greatest}} day in mid Western football history." [...] Harry Kipke and Paul Goebel were the stars of the game, scoring all 19 points for Michigan – two touchdowns and a field goal by Kipke and a field goal and an extra point by Goebel. [...] Both also played important roles in smothering Ohio State's vaunted passing game. [...] Ohio State attempted 20 passes, 10 of which were incomplete and three of which were intercepted. [...] Kipke intercepted [...] two passes, and his first touchdown came on a 45-yard interception return. [...] The New York Times wrote that [...] "he fleet, agile Kipke intercepted passes and tore through Ohio's scattered defense for long gains." [...] Dick Meade, sports editor of The Toledo News-Bee, wrote that Yost had [...] "his great ace in the hole, the brilliant Kipke, who booted for distance and accuracy, who <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> the wind and who was a marvel of efficiency in sensing pass plays and breaking them up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Out of ammunition, {{and facing}} {{what he was}} sure would be yet another {{determined}} assault by the Alabamians, Col. Chamberlain decided upon a most unorthodox response: ordering his men to fix bayonets, he led {{what was left of}} his outfit in a pell-mell charge down the hill, executing a combined frontal assault and flanking maneuver that caught the 15th Alabama completely by surprise. [...] Unbeknownst to Chamberlain, Oates had already decided to retreat, realizing that his ammunition was running low, and worried about a possible Union attack on his own flank or rear. [...] His younger brother lay dying on the field, and the blood from his regiment's dead and wounded [...] "was standing in puddles on some of the rocks". Hardly had Oates ordered the withdrawal than Chamberlain began his charge, which combined with fire from [...] "B" [...] company and the hidden sharpshooters to cause the 15th to rush madly down the hill to escape. [...] Oates later admitted that [...] "we <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> a herd of wild cattle" [...] during the retreat, which took those surviving members of the 15th (including Oates) who weren't captured by Chamberlain's men up the slopes of Big Round Top and toward Confederate lines.|$|E

On her Twitter feed, she stated that the music video [...] "was shot guerrilla style, no crew, 1 take, no closed set, no warning, 2 min., Downtown Dallas, then <b>ran</b> <b>like</b> hell". Badu was inspired by indie rock duo Matt & Kim's video for the song [...] "Lessons Learned", viewing it as [...] "the bravest, most liberating thing I’ve ever seen two people do... I wanted to dedicate this contagious act of liberation and freedom to them. I hoped it would become something contagious that people {{would want to do}} in some way or another". Badu has expressed that her video is a criticism of the psychological concept groupthink. On the video's location, Badu expressed that Matt & Kim's video and its [...] "monumental" [...] Times Square setting influenced her to film in Dealey Plaza, which is known as the site of President John F. Kennedy's assassination. She viewed the historic district's grassy knoll as a monumental place in Dallas and that she [...] "tied {{it in a way that}} compared that assassination to the character assassination one would go through after showing his or her self completely.
