N. rufipes infests dried or smoked meats, especially those products that are stored unwrapped for long periods of time.

N. rufipes has been recorded to have fed upon a large variety of items ranging from hides and dried figs to Egyptian mummies.

40|$|Dry cured hams {{often become}} infested with {{arthropod}} pests during the aging process, which include ham mites, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, <b>red-legged</b> <b>ham</b> <b>beetles,</b> Necrobia rufipes, cheese skippers, Piophila casei, and larder beetles, Dermestes lardarius. Methyl bromide {{has been used}} to fumigate dry cured ham plants and is the only known fumigant that is effective at eradiating ham mite infestations at this time (EPA, 2010). However, methyl bromide is classified as a Class 1 ozone depletion substance and will be phased out for all industries by 2015 (EPA, 2006). A survey of 34 dry cured ham indicated that 22 of plants surveyed used methyl bromide fumigation one to five times a year based on the severity of the infestation (Rentfrow, et al., 2008). It is crucial for the dry cured ham industry to discover and research potential alternatives to methyl bromide. Phosphine is considered to be the most widely used fumigant alternative for methyl bromide (Fields and White, 2002) due to its easy application, effectiveness, low cost and lack of residue (Zuryn et al., 2008). The density of phosphine is 1. 17 times that of air and it is a gas at above- 88 °C, which makes it disperse easily during fumigation (Nath et al., 2011). Phosphine works as a strong reducing agent in the mitochondrial electro...|$|R

50|$|The adult beetles are 3.5 - 7.0 mm long, convex, {{straight}} sided, and {{the surface}} has indentations called punctures. They are shiny metallic green or greenish blue in colour. The legs and antennae are red (dark clubs). They feed on the meat-infesting larvae of Calliphora or blow flies, Dermestidae and Piophilidae. The adults are surface feeders; the larvae bore into dry or smoked meats and do most damage. The <b>red-legged</b> <b>ham</b> <b>beetle</b> also attacks bones, hides, copra, dried egg, cheese, guano, bone meal, dried figs, and palm nut kernels. Although refrigeration has reduced {{the impact of the}} beetle on meats, they are a significant destructive pest of dried and salt fish including herring. It was well documented as a threat to agriculture by 1925.|$|E
40|$|The specie Necrobia rufipes is {{commonly}} known as the copra beetle in tropical countries and <b>red-legged</b> <b>ham</b> <b>beetle</b> in the United States. According to Nwana, 1993 and Simmons and Ellington (1925) the <b>red-legged</b> <b>ham</b> <b>beetle</b> is a cosmopolitan pest, causing considerable dam-age to stored commodities such as copra (dried coconut), cheese, dried fish, ham and other products rich in protein content. In India, it is also recorded as a serious pest of cashew nuts (Sengupta et al., 1984). These beetles can subsist on a diet of copra alone but their development is slow; their diet is almost cer-tainly a supplement by predation on other insects and can promote cannibalism when there is a superpopulation (Ashman 1963).

Experiments were conducted with low oxygen (O 2) achieved with low pressure under a vacuum, high carbon dioxide (CO 2), and ozone (O 3). Results showed that both low O 2 and high CO 2 levels required exposures up to 144 h to kill 100 % of all stages of <b>red-legged</b> <b>ham</b> <b>beetle,</b> Necrobia rufipes (De Geer) (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and ham mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Sarcoptiformes: Acaridae) at 23 °C. In addition, both low O 2 and high CO 2 had no significant mortality against the ham beetle and ham mites at short exposures ranging from 12 to 48 h. Ham beetles were more tolerant than ham mites to an atmosphere of 75. 1 % CO 2 and low pressure of 25 mm Hg, which imposed an atmosphere estimated at 0. 9 % O 2. Both low O 2 and high CO 2 trials indicated that the egg stages of both species were more tolerant than other stages tested, but N. rufipes eggs and pupae were more susceptible than larvae and adults to high concentration ozone treatments. The results indicate that O 3 has potential to control ham beetles and ham mites, particularly at ≈ 166 ppm in just a 24 h exposure period, but O 3 is known from other work to have poor penetration ability, thus {{it may be more}} difficult to apply effectively than low O 2 or high CO 2. would be.

40|$|Methyl bromide is {{commonly}} utilized as a fumigant {{in the dry}} curing of hams to prevent the infestation of <b>ham</b> <b>beetles</b> (Necrobia rufipes), cheese skippers, dermestid <b>beetles,</b> and <b>ham</b> mites(Tyrophagus putrescentiae) (EPA 2006). Although methyl bromide is the only known fumigant that is effective at preventing these arthropod infestations, it depletes the stratospheric ozone layer (Marriott and Schilling 2004). From audits and surveys performed by our research group, {{it was determined that}} there is somewhere between 60 and 100 dry cured ham processors, with 20 - 25 of these processors producing the majority of the product (Rentfrow et al. 2006). The request for the use of methyl bromide has been granted at 18, 000 - 20, 000 kg since the lack of availability of methyl bromide in dry cured ham processing would result in significant market disruption and this amount of methyl bromide currently meets the needs of the industry (EPA 2006).

The insect species associated with the carcass of C. domesticus found that the blow flies, Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) and house fly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus, 1758) {{were found in the}} fresh, bloat and active decay stages. However, the blow fly, C. megacephala (Fabricius); flesh fly, Parasarcophaga ruficornis (Meigen) and the hornet wasp, Vespa orientalis (Linnaeus) were existed in the fresh and bloat stages. Moreover, cheese fly, Piophila casei (Linnaeus) was found bloat and active decay stages. Further, the hide beetle, Dermestes maculates (Geer), clown beetle, Hister sp. (Gullenhal); <b>ham</b> <b>beetle,</b> Necrobia rufipes (Fabricus) and skin beetle, Trox sp. (Harold) completed their life cycle in active decay, advance decay and dry stages. Furthermore, the jummper ant, Myrmecia pilosula (Smith) was collected from only fresh stage. The specimens of insect species were collected minimum 0. 8 % of V. orientalis and maximum 21. 3 % of 2 species, i. e., C. rufifacies and M. domestica. The temperature, humidity and rainfalls were found affected insect larvae, pupae and adults, and rate of decomposition of C. domesticus. The average temperature, humidity and rainfalls were 35. 34 ± 1. 54, 38. 8 % and 3. 8 mm, respectively, of 11 experimental days.
