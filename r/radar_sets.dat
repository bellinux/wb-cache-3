5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{he worked}} in the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney, where he {{produced}} a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron. In September 1942, he returned to Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, where he continued the development of cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons for <b>radar</b> <b>sets.</b> In May 1944, he became one of three Australian physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project, which created the first atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to improve the {{situation}} and hamper British operations, a number of experienced night fighter commanders and pilots suggested restarting intruder operations over England. In 1940–41, German night fighters, lacking airborne <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> and a means to locate them over Germany, had flown to British bomber bases and attempted to destroy RAF bombers as they returned from their missions. Adolf Hitler had ordered a cessation of these activities for propaganda and practical reasons but these operations had met with reasonable success in 1941 and it was felt they may do so again.|$|E
50|$|An AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar {{joined the}} site in 1963. In 1964 an AN/FPS-27 search <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> was installed, and in 1965 the AN/FPS-20A was retired from Air Force service. Reportedly, the FAA {{retained}} this <b>radar</b> <b>set.</b> In 1968 the AN/MPS-14 height-finder radar was removed.|$|R
5|$|During their {{modernization}} {{under the}} 600-ship Navy program, the Iowa-class battleships' radar systems were again upgraded. The AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system {{was replaced with}} the AN/SPS-49 <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> {{was replaced by the}} AN/SPS-67 search radar.|$|R
50|$|The SARH {{system needs}} only one <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> {{to a wider}} pattern.|$|R
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an outpost of the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own <b>radar</b> <b>sets.</b> The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As luck would have it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|Success was {{forthcoming}} in 1942. Later, in February 1942, Coastal Command {{identified the}} Luftwaffe Würzburg <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> in France. Eager to evaluate them, the British Army carried out Operation Biting, a commando raid to capture, dismantle and transport {{an example of}} the mobile radar to Britain. The force increased to 70 aircraft in eight flights as the year progressed. Operations were carried out in the Atlantic, over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. In November, PR units operated from Gibraltar in support of Operation Torch, the Allied landing in French North Africa. It was detailed to keep watch on the movements of the Vichy French Fleet at Toulon, France. One of the most active squadrons at this time operated Spitfires. No. 540 Squadron RAF was particularly busy in 1943, over Norway.|$|E

The <b>radar</b> <b>set</b> and launchers (with missiles) are mounted on M860 semi-trailers, which are towed by Oshkosh M983 HEMTTs.|$|R
5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of their losses to night fighters, and began a rush program to {{introduce}} a new radar operating on different frequencies. This led to the lower-VHF band FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, which began to reach operational units in small numbers between August and October 1943, with about 50 units in use by November. In February 1944, No. 80 Sqn noticed a marked decrease in FuG 202 transmissions. By this time the Germans had produced 200 SN-2 sets, and this had reached 1,000 by May. This set deliberately selected a frequency close to that of their ground-based Freya <b>radar</b> <b>sets,</b> {{in the hopes that}} these sources would swamp any wide-band receiver set used on RAF aircraft. Early Serrate units were effectively useless by June 1944, and their replacements were never as successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{converted}} carrier aircraft were heavier {{versions of}} their land-based predecessors and this required {{a host of}} changes to Graf Zeppelins original design: the existing catapults needed modernization; stronger winches were necessary for the arresting gear; the flight deck, elevators and hangar floors also required reinforcement. Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E

25|$|A {{pioneer in}} radar, Colonel William Blair, {{director}} of the Signal Corps laboratories at Fort Monmouth, patented the first Army radar demonstrated in May 1937. Even before the United States entered World War II, mass production of two <b>radar</b> <b>sets,</b> the SCR-268 and the SCR-270, had begun. Along with the Signal Corps' tactical FM radio, also developed in the 1930s, radar {{was the most important}} communications development of World War II.|$|E
25|$|With an {{operational}} system now online, tactical considerations were developed. The first was airborne <b>radar</b> <b>sets,</b> installed on fighters. German pilots complained {{about this as}} it created drag and reduced {{the performance of their}} aircraft. They preferred to acquire the target visually once ground control had guided them onto the bomber stream. A second change involved the removal of AAA installations and searchlights from the line and grouping them around cities for their defence.|$|E
25|$|The cavity {{magnetron}} tube was significantly improved by John Randall and Harry Boot in 1940 at the University of Birmingham, England. They invented a valve that could produce multi-kilowatt pulses at 10cm wavelength, an unprecedented discovery. The high power of pulses from their device made centimeter-band radar practical for the Allies of World War II, with shorter wavelength radars allowing detection of smaller objects from smaller antennas. The compact {{cavity magnetron}} tube drastically reduced {{the size of}} <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> {{so that they could}} be more easily installed in night-fighter aircraft, anti-submarine aircraft and escort ships.|$|E

25|$|The weak {{absorption}} of radio waves by the medium through which it passes is what enables <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> to detect objects at relatively long ranges—ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light, are too strongly attenuated. Such weather phenomena as fog, clouds, rain, falling snow, and sleet that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or atmospheric gases (especially oxygen) are avoided in designing radars, except when their detection is intended.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} several 'Window attacks', the Luftwaffe {{started to}} change its tactics. With radar neutralised by Window, German night fighters {{found it difficult to}} intercept the bombers. However, German ground controllers no longer used <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> to guide German fighters and track individual enemy bombers in order to intercept. Instead, they gave a running commentary on the stream as a whole. No individual aircraft were tracked unless caught in searchlights. These changes did not produce immediate success, but pointed the way to a method of loosely controlled cat's eye interception. The success of the new tactics were indicated in increasing bomber losses.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsibility}} for siting the six early warning stations and 30 gun position <b>radar</b> <b>sets</b> {{over a wide}} area fell to 80th AA Bde's Instructor Fire Control (Radar), Captain William Adams, and his assistant, Staff Sergeant B.T. Bayne. They travelled extensively, training the operators and troubleshooting problems on the new radar. The effectiveness of the early warning system steadily improved, {{so that by the}} end of the campaign it was operating at almost 100 per cent efficiency. Captain Adams was awarded the US Bronze Star and S/Sgt Bayne the Belgian Croix de Guerre for their work.|$|E

The main {{difference between these}} two radars is the addition of a second traveling wave tube (TWT), which gives the −65 radar increased search, detection, and tracking capability. The radar antenna array consists of over 5,000 elements that [...] "deflect" [...] the radar beam many times per second. The radar antenna array also contains an IFF interrogator subsystem, a TVM array, and at least one [...] "sidelobe canceller" [...] (SLC), which is a small array designed to decrease interference that might affect the radar. Patriot's radar is somewhat unusual in that it is a [...] "detection-to-kill" [...] system, meaning that a single unit performs all search, identification, track, and engagement functions. This is in contrast to most SAM systems, where several different radars are necessary to perform all functions necessary to detect and engage targets.|$|R
