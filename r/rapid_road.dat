40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a survey of}} literature about road feature extraction, giving {{a detailed description of}} a Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) system (RIEGL VMX- 450) for transportation-related applications. This paper describes the development of automated algorithms for extracting road features (road surfaces, road markings, and pavement cracks) from MLS point cloud data. The proposed road surface extraction algorithm detects road curbs from a set of profiles that are sliced along vehicle trajectory data. Based on segmented road surface points, we create Geo-Referenced Feature (GRF) images and develop two algorithms, respectively, for extracting the following: 1) road markings with high retroreflectivity and 2) cracks containing low contrast with their surroundings, low signal-to-noise ratio, and poor continuity. A comprehensive comparison illustrates satisfactory performance of the proposed algorithms and concludes that MLS is a reliable and cost-effective alternative for <b>rapid</b> <b>road</b> inspection.

40|$|The {{use of a}} Mobile Mapping System (MMS) {{to quickly}} collect large amounts of data has been {{proven to be a}} cost {{effective}} and very beneficial technology for Road Authorities around the world. Early in the development of MMS technology the Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW (RTA) recognised the benefits of utilising such a system in the management and maintenance of their state road network and developed the first generation GIPSICAM system. GIPSICAM, which is an acronym for “Global and Inertial Positioning Systems with Image Capture for Asset Management”, is the RTA’s in-house developed, operated and maintained vehicle-mounted MMS. The first generation GIPSICAM system (GCv 1) had no stable configuration and was modified for each project it was used for. Then in 1999 the second generation GIPSICAM system (GCv 2) was developed for the lead up to the 2000 Olympic Games. Development of GCv 2 continued after the Olympic Games and its operation was institutionalised in the annual surveys of NSW state roads from 2001 onwards. In July 2004 a strategic report on RTA Pavement Condition Monitoring Equipment was released that identified GIPSICAM data as an important RTA corporate dataset. However, the report also identified serious reliability issues with GCv 2 due to the ad-hoc nature of its development and the age of some of its technology and equipment. In early 2005 {{the decision was made to}} develop the third generation GIPSICAM system (GCv 3), also known as “GIPSICAM Version 3 ”. The objective of the development work was to take advantage of the experience from previous generation GIPSICAM systems in order to design a MMS that utilises current technology to ensure that the RTA has a reliable, safe, efficient, accurate, high quality GIPSICAM capability for the purpose of <b>rapid</b> <b>road</b> asset data capture and other applications of MMS technology. GCv 3 was completed in mid- 2006 and officially commenced operations in September 2006, at the start of the 2006 / 2007 GIPSICAM survey season. This thesis outlines the development of GCv 3, from the selection and modification of the vehicle, the selection and integration of component technologies, and the development of operational procedures for <b>rapid</b> <b>road</b> asset data capture...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} {{coupled with}} heavy axle loading {{is the key}} factor in <b>rapid</b> <b>road</b> deterioration in Pakistan. The serviceability loss is further accelerated {{by the fact that}} truck drivers and owners consider overloading as a profitable practice unaware of the adverse effects of this practice. Weigh-in-motion data from two stations located between two major cities of Pakistan (Peshawar and Rawalpindi) on Grand Trunk Road (N- 5) were collected and analyzed. Analysis of variance and comparison of actual and designed truck factor were performed to identify the most damaging axle truck type. It was found that axle truck type 3 (single/tandem axle) is most damaging among all truck types. The actual truck factor for axle truck type 3 is 6. 4 times greater than design truck factor. Regression expressions of different forms were also investigated to determine the relationship between truck factor and gross vehicular weight for the specified truck types. An optimum generalization strategy was used to prevent over-generalization and ensure accuracy. For data analysis, 75 % of data was used to develop regression models and remaining 25 % was to validate those models. The results show that the polynomial expressions performed best and provide a robust relationship that can be employed by the highway authorities to estimate truck factor from gross vehicular weight {{with a high degree of}} confidence. It was also observed that damaging effect of various types of trucks was very severe and quite high...|$|E

40|$|Background: Fine {{particulate}} matters with aerodynamic diameters smaller than 2. 5 micrometers (PM 2. 5) {{have been a}} critical environmental problem in China due to the <b>rapid</b> <b>road</b> vehicle growth in recent years. To date, most methods available to estimate traffic contributions to ambient PM 2. 5 concentration are often hampered by the need for collecting data on traffic volume, vehicle type and emission profile. Objective: To develop a simplified and indirect method to estimate the contribution of traffic to PM 2. 5 concentration in Beijing, China. Methods: Hourly PM 2. 5 concentration data, daily meteorological data and geographic information were collected at 35 air quality monitoring (AQM) stations in Beijing between 2013 and 2014. Based on the PM 2. 5 concentrations of different AQM station types, a two-stage method comprising a dispersion model and generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was developed to estimate separately the traffic and non-traffic contributions to daily PM 2. 5 concentration. The geographical trend of PM 2. 5 concentrations was investigated using generalized linear mixed model. The temporal trend of PM 2. 5 and non-linear relationship between PM 2. 5 and meteorological conditions were assessed using GAMM. Results: The medians of daily PM 2. 5 concentrations during 2013 - 2014 at 35 AQM stations in Beijing ranged from 40 to 92 mu g/m(3). There was a significant increasing trend of PM 2. 5 concentration from north to south. The contributions of road traffic to daily PM 2. 5 concentrations ranged from 17. 2 % to 37. 3 % with an average 30 %. The greatest contribution was found at AQM stations near busy roads. On average, the contribution of road traffic at urban stations was 14 % higher than that at rural stations. Conclusions: Traffic emissions account for a substantial share of daily total PM 2. 5 concentrations in Beijing. Our two-stage method is a useful and convenient tool in ecological and epidemiological studies to estimate the traffic contribution to PM 2. 5 concentrations when there is limited information on vehicle number and types and emission profile...|$|E
