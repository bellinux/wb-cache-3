40|$|Background and aims. The {{majority}} of failures in Class II amalgam <b>restorations</b> {{occur in the}} first primary molar teeth; in addition, use of compomer instead of amalgam for primary molar teeth <b>restorations</b> {{is a matter of}} concern. The aim ofthe present study was to compare the success rate of Class II compomer and amalgam <b>restorations</b> in the first primary molars. Materials and methods. A total of 17 amalgams and 17 compomer <b>restorations</b> were placed in 17 children based on a split-mouth design. <b>Restorations</b> were assessed at 12 - and 24 -month intervals for marginal integrity, the anatomic form and recurrent caries. Data were analyzed with SPSS 11. Chi-squared test was applied for the analysis. Statistical significance was set at P< 0. 05. Results. A total 34 <b>restorations</b> of 28 <b>restorations</b> (14 pairs) of the total <b>restorations</b> still survived after 24 months. Compomer <b>restorations</b> showed significantly better results in marginal integrity. Recurrent caries was significantly lower in compomer <b>restorations</b> compared to amalgam <b>restorations.</b> Cumulative success rate at 24 -month interval was significantly higher in compomer <b>restorations</b> compared to amalgam <b>restorations.</b> There was no statistically significant difference in anatomic form between the two materials. Conclusion. Compomer appears to be a suitable alternative to amalgam for Class II <b>restorations</b> in the first primary mo-lars...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: More {{than five}} hundred million direct dental <b>restorations</b> are placed each year worldwide. In about 55 % of the cases, resin {{composites}} or compomers are used, and in 45 % amalgam. The longevity of posterior resin <b>restorations</b> is well documented. However, data on resin composites that are placed without enamel/dentin conditioning and resin composites placed with self-etching adhesive systems are missing. Material and Methods: The database SCOPUS was searched for clinical trials on posterior resin composites without restricting the search {{to the year}} of publication. The inclusion criteria were: (1) prospective clinical trial with at least 2 years of observation; (2) minimum number of <b>restorations</b> at last recall = 20; (3) report on dropout rate; (4) report of operative technique and materials used; (5) utilization of Ryge or modified Ryge evaluation criteria. For amalgam, only those studies were included that directly compared composite resin <b>restorations</b> with amalgam. For the statistical analysis, a linear mixed model was used with random effects {{to account for the}} heterogeneity between the studies. P-values under 0. 05 were considered significant. Results: Of the 373 clinical trials, 59 studies met the inclusion criteria. In 70 % of the studies, Class II and Class I <b>restorations</b> had been placed. The overall success rate of composite resin <b>restorations</b> was about 90 % after 10 years, which was not different from that of amalgam. <b>Restorations</b> with compomers had a significantly lower longevity. The main reason for replacement were bulk fractures and caries adjacent to <b>restorations.</b> Both of these incidents were infrequent in most studies and accounted only for about 6 % of all replaced <b>restorations</b> after 10 years. <b>Restorations</b> with macrofilled composites and compomer suffered significantly more loss of anatomical form than <b>restorations</b> with other types of material. <b>Restorations</b> that were placed without enamel acid etching and a dentin bonding agent showed significantly more marginal staining and detectable margins compared to those <b>restorations</b> placed using the enamel-etch or etch-and-rinse technique; <b>restorations</b> with self-etching systems were between the other groups. <b>Restorations</b> with compomer suffered significantly more chippings (repairable fracture) than <b>restorations</b> with other materials, which did not statistically differ among each other. <b>Restorations</b> that were placed with a rubber-dam showed significantly fewer material fractures that needed replacement, and this also had a significant effect on the overall longevity. Conclusion: <b>Restorations</b> with hybrid and microfilled composites that were placed with the enamel-etching technique and rubber-dam showed the best overall performance; the longevity of these <b>restorations</b> was similar to amalgam <b>restorations.</b> Compomer <b>restorations,</b> <b>restorations</b> placed with macrofilled composites, and resin <b>restorations</b> with no-etching or self-etching adhesives demonstrated significant shortcomings and shorter longevity...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Clinical {{evaluation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} the one-bottle-adhesive Excite (EX) combined with the composite Tetric Ceram (TC) versus the multi-step adhesive Scotchbond MP (SB) combined with Z 100 (Z) in Class II <b>restorations</b> after three years. Methods: 72 class II <b>restorations</b> were made in 41 patients by one operator. Approximal cavity-margins were located in dentin (41 <b>restorations)</b> or in enamel (31 <b>restorations).</b> The cavities were filled either with Excite/ Tetric Ceram or with Scotchbond MP/ Z 100. Excite was applied in two modi, one time following the manufacturers instruction (MI) and one time with excess (E), so that four groups were obtained: group A 1 - EX/TC MI(14 <b>restorations),</b> group B 1 - EX/TC (E) (24 <b>restorations),</b> group A 2 - SB/Z (14 <b>restorations)</b> and group B 2 - SB/Z (20 <b>restorations).</b> At baseline, 6, 18 and 36 month recalls, the <b>restorations</b> were evaluated clinically by two examiners using modified USPHS criteria. Results: Both types of adhesive-composite-combination performed well clinically after 6, 18 and 36 month. In group A 1 - hypersensitivities occurred in three <b>restorations,</b> so that they had to be displaced. The <b>restorations</b> showed no significant difference (p< 0, 05) by the chi square test in all other criteria. Recurrent caries was not detected.

40|$|Objective: Despite the {{incremental}} build-up of resin composite <b>restorations,</b> their polymerization shrinkage during curing presents a serious problem. Indirect composite resin systems represent an alternative in overcoming {{some of the}} deficiencies of direct composite <b>restorations.</b> The hypothesis {{of the present study}} states that the clinical performance of <b>restorations</b> may be affected by different generation and application techniques. Study Design: Sixty <b>restorations</b> (20 DI system (Coltène/Whaledent AG, Altstätten, Switzerland) composite inlays, 20 Tescera ATL system (BISCO Inc. Schaumburg, Illinois, USA) composite inlays, and 20 direct composites) were applied to premolar teeth in 49 patients. <b>Restorations</b> were clinically evaluated by two examiners. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks, and X 2 tests. Results: The Tescera ATL system performed significantly better than both direct composite <b>restorations</b> (p< 0. 001) and DI system (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this 3 -year clinical study, indirect resin <b>restorations</b> showed better scores than direct <b>restorations.</b> In addition, the Tescera ATL system was found to be more successful than the DI system and direct composite <b>restorations...</b>|$|R
5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} <b>restoration</b> {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci {{suggests}} was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous <b>restoration.</b> Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The <b>restoration</b> concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: to provide <b>restorations</b> using the ART approach to pre-school children in Southern China in a kindergarten environment, using a high-strength glass-ionomer restorative material; to assess the acceptability of this approach and to evaluate on a longitudinal basis the <b>restorations</b> placed. Sample and methods. A total of 170 ART <b>restorations</b> were placed in 95 children, aged 5. 1 + 0. 7 years, by seven final-year dental students using standard ART procedures and hand instruments. The <b>restorations</b> were evaluated every six months thereafter by two calibrated independent examiners using explorers and mouth-mirrors. Results. 93 % of the children reported {{that they did not}} feel pain during treatment and 86 % were willing to receive ART <b>restorations</b> again. The cumulative 12 - and 30 -month survival rates of Class I <b>restorations</b> were 91 % and 79 %, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{this study}} were to compare 2 -year {{cumulative}} survival rates of amalgam and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) <b>restorations</b> in primary molars and to investigate the determinants of the survival rate of <b>restorations.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A controlled clinical trial using a parallel group design was carried out on 258 children aged 6 - 7 years old, allocated to two treatment groups: conventional restorative treatment using amalgam and ART using high-viscosity glass ionomer. A total of 364 amalgam <b>restorations</b> and 386 ART <b>restorations</b> were placed by three pedodontists in 126 and 158 children, respectively, and were evaluated after 0. 5, 1, and 2 years. <b>Restorations</b> were placed in vital primary molars with neither pain nor signs of pulp involvement. The survival analysis was conducted using the proportional hazard rate regression model with frailty correction. RESULTS: The 2 -year cumulative survival rates for all amalgam (77. 3 %) and ART (73. 5 %) <b>restorations</b> were not statistically significantly different, but there was an effect of "type of surface" (single/multiple) and "cavity filling time" on the survival rates. Both amalgam and ART single-surface <b>restorations</b> had higher survival rates than multiple-surface <b>restorations</b> of the same material. Secondary caries was responsible for 36 and 38 % of failures in amalgam and ART <b>restorations,</b> respectively. Mean time for restoring all type of cavities with amalgam and ART <b>restorations</b> was 13. 6 and 13. 7 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Amalgam and ART <b>restorations</b> presented similar survival rates over a 2 -year period for all, single-surface, and multiple-surface <b>restorations.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the cause of finding alternatives to amalgam, ART <b>restorations</b> using high-viscosity glass ionomer might be a suitable option for managing cavitated dentine carious lesions in vital primary molars...|$|R
