Mr Yarrow will <b>rephrase</b> it to make the success clearer to the Admiralty. The admiral is now a peer, his deepest wish, {{and he is a}} happy man. Aubrey dines with Laura Fielding and her husband, Lieutenant Fielding, who is now satisfied that his wife is true to him and thanks Aubrey for bringing her from Malta to Gibraltar (though it is Maturin who brought her to the ship, saving her from two assassins). Maturin receives news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, confirming high level infiltration of British intelligence by the French. Maturin's wife Diana has heard rumours of his pretended infidelity in Valletta, Malta, with Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends her a letter via Andrew Wray, unsuspecting of Wray's role as a French agent. Maturin learns of his success in Malta, destroying the French intelligence network based there, all but André Lesueur taken.|$|E

500|$|Statements which {{imply that}} nature has goals, for example where a species {{is said to}} do {{something}} [...] "in order to" [...] achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to <b>rephrase</b> such sentences {{so that they do}} not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention. John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Packet {{classification}} categorizes incoming packets into multiple forwarding {{classes in}} a router based on predefined fil-ters. It {{is important in}} fulfilling the requirements of differentiated services. To achieve fast packet classification, a new approach, namely “filter <b>rephrasing,</b> ” is proposed to encode the original filters by exploiting the hierarchical property of the filters. Filter <b>rephrasing</b> could dramatically reduce the search and storage complexity incurred in packet classification. We incorporate a well-known scheme–rectangle search–with filter <b>rephrasing</b> to improve the lookup speed by at least a factor of 2 and decreases 70 % of the storage expenses. As compared with other existing schemes, the proposed scheme exhibits a better balance between speed, storage, and computation complexity. Consequently, the scalable effect of filter <b>rephrasing</b> is suitable for backbone routers with {{a great number of}} filters.

40|$|Comprehensible {{legal texts}} – utopia or a {{question}} of wording? On processing <b>rephrased</b> German court decisions This paper presents {{a study on the}} comprehensibility of <b>rephrased</b> syntactic structures in German court decisions. While {{there are a number of}} studies using psycholinguistic methods to investigate the comprehensibility of original legal texts, we are not aware of any study looking into the effect resolving complex structures has on the comprehensibility. Our study combines three methodological steps. First, we analyse an annotated corpus of court decisions, press releases and newspaper reports on these decisions in order to detect those complex structures in the decisions which distinguish them from the other text types. Secondly, these structures are <b>rephrased</b> into two increasingly simple versions. Finally, all versions are subjected to a self paced reading experiment.

2500|$|Within {{the jazz}} band, phrases known as [...] "comping patterns" [...] have {{included}} {{elements of the}} clave since the very {{early days of the}} music. The word [...] "comping" [...] comes from the words [...] "accompany" [...] and [...] "complement", and, in terms of how it applies to music, comping is support of other musicians, often soloists, and echoing or reinforcement of the composition. A phrase known as [...] "The Charleston" [...] (which originated as part of the dance of the same name) is a common example of an application of the clave in jazz, specifically comping. It is a pattern almost identical to that of the two beat measure of the son clave, one version of the clave from Cuba. Another method of integrating the clave with jazz is to <b>rephrase</b> a composition rhythmically to correspond with it.|$|E

[...] The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled a [...] "clear error" [...] when the district court found that Garibay had [...] "knowingly and intelligently waived his Miranda rights" [...] due to the defendant’s low I.Q. and poor English language skills. The court investigated many facets of his waiver and discovered that Mr. Garibay was missing all items that they were looking for: he never signed a waiver, he only received his warnings verbally and in English, and no interpreter was provided although they were available. With an opinion that stressed [...] "the requirement that a defendant 'knowingly and intelligently' waive his Miranda rights", the Court reversed Garibay's conviction and remanded his case.|$|E
2500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule, in his {{volume on}} U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken [...] "became the first American medalist {{to apply the}} principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince". He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand [...] "like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials." [...] Mermeule noted that [...] "the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello" [...] and that [...] "the coin {{as a whole is}} a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted."

2500|$|Filled pauses {{consist of}} repetitions of syllables and words, {{reformulation}} or false starts where speakers <b>rephrase</b> their speech {{to fit the}} representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for the right words in one's lexicon to carry across an intended meaning. There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur. Although a schwa-like quality , {{appears to be the}} most commonly used, some speakers consistently using the neutral vowel [...] instead, and others use both vowels in the same sentence, depending {{on the quality of the}} previous word last vowel. Filled pauses vocalizations may be built around central vowels and speakers may differ in their preferences, but that they do not appear to behave as other words in the language. The lengthening of words ending in a coronal fricative, for instance, could be obtained by prolonging the entire rhyme and/or the fricative only. Most of the time, however, the neutral vowel [...] is appended to achieve the desired effect.|$|E

His prediction (and its formulation) became famous: the New York Times called it [...] "an enduring quotation" [...] and [...] "an unforgettable line," [...] and Comcast SportsNet called it [...] "one of the greatest rallying cries ever uttered." [...] As it turned out, the Sixers only lost one playoff game (Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the Bucks) en route to making Malone a world champion for the first time, sweeping the Knicks in the first round and the Lakers in the finals. This led some to <b>rephrase</b> Malone's prediction as [...] "fo, fi, fo" [...] (four, five, four). The inside of that year's championship ring was inscribed with [...] "fo' fi' fo."
