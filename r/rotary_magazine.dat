2500|$|The {{eventual}} configuration {{was rare}} {{in terms of}} contemporary fighter aircraft design, with only the preceding Fokker G.1, the contemporary Focke-Wulf Fw 189 Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, and the later Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter having a similar planform. The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbo-superchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two [...]50-caliber (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 200rounds per gun (rpg), two [...]30-caliber (7.62mm) Brownings with 500rpg, and a T1 Army Ordnance 23mm (.90 in) autocannon with a <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> {{as a substitute for}} the non-existent 25mm Hotchkiss aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville. In the YP-38s, a 37 mm (1.46 in) M9 autocannon with 15 rounds replaced the T1. The 15 rounds were in three five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight. Further armament experiments from March to June 1941 resulted in the P-38E combat configuration of four M2 Browning machine guns, and one Hispano 20mm (.79 in) autocannon with 150 rounds.|$|E

50|$|The rimfire {{line of the}} Ruger American shares similar {{features}} and designs with its centerfire brethren, including the Power Bedding, the Marksman trigger and the tang safety, although it uses a unique stainless steel rimfire bolt and feeds exclusively from the BX series <b>rotary</b> <b>magazines</b> from the Ruger 10/22 rifles.|$|R
25|$|Green Mace was the Rainbow Code {{assigned}} to the QF 127/58 SBT X1 during its development. The original specifications were for a 5-inch gun with water-cooled barrel, firing folding-fin discarding sabot dart projectiles. Two <b>rotary</b> <b>magazines,</b> each holding 14 rounds, would allow for {{a high rate of}} fire on the order of 75 rounds per minute (RPM).|$|R
50|$|The rotary or spool {{magazine}} {{consists of}} a star-shaped rotor, or sprocket, actuated by a torsion spring. The magazine may be fixed or detachable. Cartridges fit between {{the teeth of the}} sprocket, which is mounted on a spindle parallel to the bore axis, with a torsion spring providing the pressure necessary to rotate the rounds into the feeding position. Rotary magazines are usually of low capacity of ten rounds or less, depending on the cartridge used. John Smith patented a <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> in 1856. Another <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> was produced by Sylvester Roper in 1866 and was also used in the weapons by Anton Spitalsky and the Savage Model 1892. The M1941 Johnson rifle also uses a <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine.</b> The design is still used in some modern firearms, most notably the Ruger American, the Ruger 10/22 and the Steyr SSG 69.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 1997, the Ruger 77/44 {{uses the}} same <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> design with a short bolt stroke and three {{position}} safety but is chambered in [...]44 Magnum.|$|E
50|$|The bolt-action Krag-Jørgensen rifle, {{designed}} in Norway in 1886, used a unique <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> {{that was built}} into the receiver. Like Lee's box magazine, the <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> held the rounds side-by-side, rather than end-to-end. Like most rotary magazines, it was loaded through a loading gate one round at a time, this one located {{on the side of}} the receiver. While reliable, the Krag-Jørgensen's magazine was expensive to produce and slow to reload. It was adopted by only three countries, Denmark in 1889, the United States in 1892, and Norway in 1894.|$|E
5000|$|Umarex air pistols are firearm replicas {{that are}} {{operated}} by disposable carbon dioxide (...) cylinders. They fire [...]177 caliber airgun pellets or steel BBs. Depending on the model, these air pistols use removable 8-round or 10-round <b>rotary</b> <b>magazines</b> or drop-out magazines that eject {{from the bottom}} of the grip. Velocity ranges from 295 - 500 ft/s depending on model and ammo type. They are generally accurate to 25 yd and can be dangerous to 300 yd.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{feature is}} the {{standard}} <b>rotary</b> 5-round <b>magazine.</b> A 10-round staggered box is available as an accessory. Both are transparent-backed, immediately showing remaining capacity.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Ruger {{released}} the SR-22 Rifle model, a 10/22 receiver {{embedded in a}} chassis that mimics the dimensions of an AR-15 style rifle such as their own SR-556. The SR-22 Rifle uses standard 10/22 <b>rotary</b> <b>magazines,</b> in addition to most aftermarket 10/22 magazines. The positions of the magazine release, the safety and the charging handle are all more similar to a standard 10/22 than an AR-15. The SR-22 Rifle competes directly with other AR-15 style rimfire rifles such as those made by Colt and Smith & Wesson. The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail. Threaded holes on the handguard provide the customization of optional attachment rails.|$|R

50|$|The Sport-22 {{featured}} a non-threaded barrel and a 10-round <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> {{to comply with}} the now expired 1994 U.S. firearms legislation which forbade the sale of the original TEC-22 model.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of {{magazines}} for the Ruger 10/22. The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine,</b> the BX-1. Ruger has also produced a clear polycarbonate ("40th-anniversary edition") BX-1CLR magazine, {{as well as a}} five-round <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> (for states or countries that restrict magazine capacities). In 2011-2012 Ruger came out with the Ruger BX-25, a 25-round box magazine with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round BX-15 box magazine for states that restrict magazine capacities. Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round drum magazines.|$|E
5000|$|Many lever {{actions have}} a tubular {{magazine}} under the barrel. To operate safely, cartridges for these have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rim-fire primers rather than center-fire primers. The safety {{problem is that}} long-range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine the points can accidentally fire center-fire cartridges. A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. So, some lever actions such as the Savage Model 99 can be fed from either box or <b>rotary</b> <b>magazines.</b> The Winchester Model 1895 also uses a box magazine, and is chambered for [...]30-06 and other powerful military cartridges. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.|$|R
5000|$|The ARWEN 37 is a {{non-lethal}} launcher which fires 37 mm non-lethal rounds (foam or wooden or {{tear gas}} payload) designed for riot control. It has a 5-round <b>rotary</b> drum <b>magazine.</b> [...] "ARWEN" [...] is {{an acronym for}} [...] "Anti Riot Weapon ENfield".|$|R
25|$|The Armsel Striker was {{designed}} by a Zimbabwean national, Hilton R. Walker, in 1981. Walker subsequently emigrated to South Africa, bringing with him the design for the Striker shotgun. His shotgun became a success, and was exported to {{various parts of the}} world. Even though it was successful, the shotgun still had its flaws. The <b>rotary</b> cylinder-type <b>magazine</b> was bulky, had a long reload time, and the basic action was not without certain flaws.|$|R
5000|$|The Ruger 77/357 {{uses the}} same <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> design with a short bolt stroke and three {{position}} safety but is chambered in [...]357 Magnum. It features an adjustable rear sight and a gold bead front sight.|$|E

5000|$|Ironically, Steyr-Mannlicher {{currently}} manufactures a rifle {{known as}} the [...] "Classic Mannlicher", which it bills on its website as [...] "a direct descendant of the world famous MANNLICHER sic Schoenauer models". In fact, this rifle is available in almost every modern caliber except the original 6.5×54mm cartridge. Although the modern [...] "Classic" [...] Steyr-Mannlicher rifles still incorporate some original features, like the butter-knife bolt handle, the distinctive actions and <b>rotary</b> (spool) <b>magazines</b> of the original Mannlicher-Schönauer rifles are no longer used.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} basic design, the Evans repeating rifle {{is similar to}} the Spencer Repeating Rifle. However, the Evans has a <b>rotary</b> helical <b>magazine</b> in the buttstock, and {{cartridges}} are fed into the breech by cycling the cocking lever/trigger guard. Also, the magazine of the Evans has a much higher capacity than that of the Spencer, up to 34 rounds. The Evans holds four rows of cartridges which are loaded through a trapdoor in the buttplate. Each time the action is cycled, the magazine feeds the next cartridge to the breech in a helical pattern.|$|R
50|$|The Ultra is also {{available}} in multi-shot version. This uses the BSA standard 10-shot <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine.</b> The MMC system allows the shooter to reload the rifle without taking the eyes or the rifle off target, thereby allowing the shooter quick follow-up shots.|$|E
5000|$|The Model 44 {{featured}} a solid-topped receiver, while the modern Deerfield has an open-top design more resembling the M1 Carbine, which is stronger and simpler. Unusual {{for a modern}} centerfire firearm, the Deerfield uses a <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> {{similar to that used}} on Ruger's [...]22 LR 10/22 rifle.|$|E
5000|$|The Ruger 77/22 is a bolt-action rimfire rifle {{chambered}} for the [...]22 Long Rifle, [...]22 WMR, or [...]22 Hornet. It has {{a removable}} <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> {{which allows the}} magazine to fit flush with {{the bottom of the}} stock. The 77/22 was introduced in 1983 and was based on the centerfire Model 77 Mark II. Each rifle comes with scope rings and a lock.|$|E

40|$|Radioisotopes {{for medical}} and {{industrial}} use are produced at the NAC with a 66 MeV proton beam, which is {{shared with the}} NAC’s neutron therapy programme. Production targets are bombarded regularly during the week nights from Monday to Thursday. In addition to these allocated shifts of 8 hours each idle beam during the neutron therapy sessions resulting from the various patient set up procedures is also utilised for radioisotope production. Only one shielded bombardment station 1, suitable for batch-type productions, was available for this pur-pose during the past 10 years of operation. Recently a second shielded target station for the bombardment of semi-permanent targets was designed and installed. This addition allows the bombardment of targets requiring services such as gas and liquid connections at high beam currents without the danger of exces-sive neutron activation and radiation damage to sensitive components in the vault. The new target station enables much larger quantities of 18 F to be produced with our Ne-gas target system 2. This presentation outlines the main design features of the <b>rotary</b> target <b>magazine</b> and its neutron shield and describes how the assembly interfaces with the beam line. In {{order to determine the}} effectiveness of the neutron shield a Bonner Multisphere Spectrometer was used to measure the neutron fluence spectra i...|$|R
50|$|Drum {{magazines}} are used primarily for light machine guns. In one type, a moving partition within a cylindrical chamber forces loose rounds into an exit slot, with the cartridges being stored {{parallel to the}} axis of rotation. After loading of the magazine, a wound spring or other mechanism forces the partition against the rounds. In all models a single staggered column is pushed by a follower through a curved path. From there the rounds enter the vertical riser either from a single or dual drums.Cylindrical designs such as <b>rotary</b> and drum <b>magazines</b> allow for larger capacity than box magazines, without growing to excessive length. The downside of a drum magazine's extra capacity is its added weight. Many drum-fed firearms can also load from conventional box magazines, such as the Soviet PPSh-41 submachine gun, RPK light machine gun and the American Thompson submachine gun.|$|R
50|$|The fledgling Savage Arms Company became {{well known}} after the {{development}} of its popular hammerless Models 1895 and 1899 (which became named the Model 99) lever-action sporting rifles. The Models 1899/99 were produced from introduction in 1899 until the expense of producing the rifle, and declining interest in lever-action rifles from the 1950s on, resulted in dropping the Model 99 from production in 2000. Unlike most Winchester and the Marlin lever-action rifles, which used a tubular magazine requiring round-nose or flat-nose bullets, Arthur Savage designed his rifle using a <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine.</b> This allowed the 99 to use cartridges with spitzer pointed bullets for increased ballistic performance. The 99 was produced in many different cartridges and several different model variations. The final models eliminated the very expensive-to-produce <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine,</b> using a detachable box magazine instead. But the 99 was still very expensive to produce {{when compared to the}} other lever-action rifles, and the Savage bolt-action rifles and economics determined the fate of the rifle.|$|E
5000|$|The Ruger 10/17 was {{essentially}} a Ruger 10/22 WMR model modified to fire the [...]17 HMR round. Similar to the 10/22 WMR model, the 10/17 had a hardwood stock, a steel receiver with integrated scope mounts, and a nine-round <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine.</b> The 10/17 has a slightly longer barrel than the 10/22 WMR model (20" [...] vs. 18.5") but a shorter overall length (37.25" [...] vs. 38.5").|$|E
50|$|Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher (January 30, 1848 - January 20, 1904) was an Austrian {{engineer}} and small arms designer. Along with James Paris Lee, Mannlicher was particularly noted for inventing the en-bloc clip charger-loading magazine system. Later, while making improvements to other inventors prototype designs for rotary-feed magazines, Mannlicher, {{together with his}} protégé Otto Schönauer, patented a perfected <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> design, the Mannlicher-Schönauer, which was a commercial and military success.|$|E
50|$|The 1895, {{as well as}} {{the later}} Model 1899 and early Model 99, used a <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine</b> to hold the cartridges. The {{rotating}} magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. The Savage 1899 took advantage of the spool to include a counter to indicate how many shots are left. The Model 99 continued using this system for many years, until its replacement with a detachable magazine.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1905 used a short recoil {{action with}} a tilting locking block. This was same {{principle}} Mannlicher {{used in his}} 1901 pistol-caliber carbine. However, for the rifle he scaled it up to 8mm Mauser, the standard German military rifle cartridge. The rifle also used a Schönauer <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine,</b> and sights copied from the Mauser Gewehr 98. Although his company patented the design in 1905, Mannlicher's death in 1904 ended any further development of the design.|$|E
50|$|John H. Blake of New York {{constructed}} {{his rifle}} {{in response to}} the fact that very few domestic designs were submitted to US Army rifle trials (1890-93). The rifle used a unique, 7-round <b>rotary</b> <b>magazine.</b> It was unique because it was detachable, whereas other rifles at the time using similar type of feed used non-detachable rotary magazines (Savage M1892). As such the detachable magazine was often described as a packet, or en-bloc clip, {{due to the lack of}} a more proper term at the time.|$|E
