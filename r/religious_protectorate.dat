The Allies {{also decided to}} make the UK responsible for putting into effect its own Balfour Declaration of 1917. France required the continuation of its <b>religious</b> <b>protectorate</b> in Palestine but Italy and Great Britain opposed it.

5000|$|At the San Remo conference (19-26 April 1920), the Mandate for Palestine was {{allocated}} to Great Britain. France required {{the continuation of}} its <b>religious</b> <b>protectorate</b> in Palestine but Italy and Great Britain opposed it. France lost the <b>religious</b> <b>protectorate,</b> but, thanks to the Holy See, continued to enjoy liturgical honors in Mandatory Palestine until 1924, when the honors were abolished. The precise boundaries of all territories, including that of the British Mandate for Palestine, were left unspecified, to [...] "be determined by the Principal Allied Powers". During that time, the British were in control of Palestine and the French took control of Syria, for which France {{had been given a}} mandate.|$|E
40|$|Between the 19 th and 20 th century, while {{international}} relations intensified, the Catholic Church became a “global” institution {{and at the}} same time grow up the crisis of the multi-religious and multi-ethnic empires, such as the Ottoman Empire. Nationalisms threaten imperial unity, while the Catholic Church – a supranational institution - developed its own "eastern policy" aimed at preserving the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, which is conceived as a space of pluralism. In this way the Catholic Church established new contacts with the Ottoman Empire and the eastern Christianity. The representative of the pope in Istanbul tried to establish direct diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the Sublime Porte, overcoming <b>religious</b> <b>protectorates</b> imposed by France and Austria. Vatican policy towards the Ottoman Empire was very innovative, a mix of diplomacy, cultural initiatives, religious projects. The Ottomans, on the other hand, began to see the Catholic Church and its supranational feature as a favourable factor to the maintenance of the Empire. The history of relations between the Vatican and the Ottoman Empire represents an unknown chapter in the contemporary history that enlighten many aspects of the current situation in the Middle East. The paper aims to present, on the basis of research carried out at the Vatican, European and Ottoman archives, the history of relations between the Holy See and the Ottoman Empire in a crucial area in which politics and religion have played - and still play - an important role...|$|R

40|$|In most of {{its long}} history, the Albanian Catholic Church has {{developed}} relationships with most Catholic states in Italy. Furthermore she set connections with Austria. Its impact on Albania was realized through <b>religious</b> <b>protectorate</b> that lasted until 1918. Until that time, the Holy See had set a specific status in relations with the Catholic population outside Europe, or the Muslim countries. With the same status, the Holy See dealt with the Albanian Catholic population. For a predominantly Muslim country like Albania, the Vatican directive was to keep active the Catholic institutions with the help {{and the protection of}} the Italian state. Meanwhile in Albania, an aggravated climate was being outlined between the Albanian politics and Catholic Church that became apparent in the movement of Dukagjini in November 1926. He promised to begin defining the modalities for signing a Concordat, and establishing diplomatic relations with the Holy See. Later, King Zog declared a law regarding religious communities that ran into strong resistance from Catholic communities which refused to recognize it. This law was inspired by the wildest jurisdictions. The State considered the Church an illegal organization deprived of all legal rights. The King Zog said it will make changes, but he then dragged. In conclusion we can say that it wasn’t reached the signing of the Concordat between the Holy See and the Albanian State, and therefore not even diplomatic relations was established between them. Only in 1991, for the first time there are established diplomatic relations between Albania and the Vatican...|$|E
