50|$|Venus Express was {{a mission}} by the European Space Agency {{to study the}} {{atmosphere}} and surface characteristics of Venus from orbit. The design was based on ESA's Mars Express and <b>Rosetta</b> <b>missions.</b> The probe's main objective was the long-term observation of the Venusian atmosphere, which it is hoped will also contribute {{to an understanding of}} Earth's atmosphere and climate. It also made global maps of Venerean surface temperatures, and attempted to observe signs of life on Earth from a distance.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission</b> {{included}} generational team management; {{this allowed}} mission continuity {{over the long}} period of the mission and for special knowledge to be maintained and passed on to future team members. In particular, several younger scientists were brought on as principal science investigators, and regular training sessions were conducted.|$|E
25|$|Several GC-MS {{have left}} earth. Two {{were brought to}} Mars by the Viking program. Venera 11 and 12 and Pioneer Venus {{analysed}} the atmosphere of Venus with GC-MS. The Huygens probe of the Cassini–Huygens mission landed one GC-MS on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. The material in the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko will be analysed by the <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission</b> with a chiral GC-MS in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Rosetta was {{launched}} on 2 March 2004 from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket and reached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 7 May 2014. It performed {{a series of}} maneuvers to enter orbit between then and 6 August 2014, when it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It was one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consisted of the Rosetta orbiter, which featured 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine additional instruments. The <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission</b> orbited Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko for 17 months and was designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft was controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for {{the operation of the}} scientific payload, together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, was performed from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain. It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} European Space Agency's media {{campaign}} {{in support of the}} <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission,</b> both the Rosetta and Philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled Once upon a time.... The series depicts various stages in the <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission,</b> involving the personified Rosetta and Philae on [...] "a classic road trip story into the depths of our universe", complimented with various visual gags presented in an educational context. Produced by animation studio Design & Data GmbH, the series was initially conceived by the ESA as a four-part fantasy-like series with a Sleeping Beauty theme that promoted community involvement in Rosettas wake up from hibernation in January 2014. After the success of the series, however, the ESA commissioned the studio to continue producing new episodes in the series throughout the course of the mission. A total of twelve videos in the series were produced from 2013 to 2016, with a 25-minute compilation of the series released in December 2016, {{after the end of the}} mission. The characters featured in Once upon a time..., designed by ESA employee and cartoonist Carlo Palazzari, became a central part of public image of the <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission,</b> appearing in promotional material for the mission such as posters and merchandise, and often credited as a major factor in the popularity of the mission among the public. ESA employees also role-played as the characters on Twitter throughout the course of the mission.|$|E
2500|$|To {{promote the}} spacecraft's arrival at comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and the landing of Philae in 2014, a short film was {{produced}} by the European Space Agency with Polish visual effects production company Platige Image. Titled Ambition, the film, shot in Iceland, stars Irish actor Aidan Gillen, known for his roles in Game of Thrones and The Wire, and Irish actress Aisling Franciosi, also of Game of Thrones fame, and was directed by Oscar-nominated Polish director Tomasz Bagiński. Set in the far future, Ambition centers around a discussion between a master, played by Gillen, discussing the importance of [...] with his apprentice, played by Franciosi, using the <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission</b> {{as an example of}} such. Ambition was premiered at the British Film Institute's Sci-Fi: Days of Fear and Wonder film festival in London on 24 October 2014, three weeks before the landing of Philae on 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. British science fiction author and former ESA employee Alastair Reynolds spoke about the film's message at the premiere, stating to the audience that [...] "our distant descendants may look back to Rosetta with the same sense of admiration that we reserve for, say, Columbus or Magellan." [...] The film's conception {{was the result of the}} BFI's inquiry to the ESA for a contribution to their celebration of science fiction, with the ESA taking the opportunity to promote the <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission</b> through the festival.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{instruments}} on the orbiter, including the camera systems and some spectrometers, reuse designs from the failed launch of the Russian Mars 96 mission in 1996 (European countries had provided much of the instrumentation and financing for that unsuccessful mission). The design of Mars Express is based on ESA's <b>Rosetta</b> <b>mission,</b> on which a considerable sum was spent on development. [...] The same design was also used for the Venus Express mission {{in order to increase}} reliability and reduce development cost and time. [...] Because of these redesigns and repurposings, the total cost of the project was about $345 million- less than half of comparable U.S. missions.|$|E

We characterize the UV/VIS properties of water-ice-rich features observed on the nuclei {{of these three}} comets. When compared to the average surface of each comet, our analysis shows that the water ice deposits seen on comet 9 P are similar to the clustered water-ice-rich features seen on comet 67 P, while the water ice deposit seen on comet 103 P is more akin to two large isolated water-ice-rich features seen on comet 67 P.

40|$|Rosetta is an {{international}} mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with key support and instrumentation from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Rosetta is currently on a ten-year mission to catch comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (C-G); throughout its voyage, the spacecraft has performed flybys of two main belt asteroids (MBA) : Steins and Lutetia. Data on the physical, chemical, and geological properties of these asteroids are currently being processed and analyzed. Accurate interpretation of such data is fundamental {{in the success of}} <b>Rosetta's</b> <b>mission</b> and overall objectives. Post-flyby data analyses strive to correlate the size, shape, volume, and rotational rate of Lutetia, in addition to interpreting its multi-color imagining, albedo, and spectral mapping. Although advancements in science have contributed to the examination of celestial bodies, methods to analyze asteroids remain largely empirical, not semi-empirical, nor ab initio. This study aims to interpret and document the scientific methods currently utilized in the characterization of asteroid (21) Lutetia in order to render these processes and methods accessible to the public. Examples include a standardized technique for assessing the age of an asteroid surface, complete with clickable reference maps, methodology of grouping surface characteristics together, and a standardized power law equation for the age. Other examples include determining the density of an object. Context for what both density and age mean is a bi-product of this study.
