Methods for joint localization and mapping constitute the basis for (semi-) autonomous cooperative action, in particular when navigating in GPS-denied areas. As communication losses may occur, a decentralized solution is required. With these challenges in mind, we designed a submap-based SLAM system that relies on inertial measurements and stereo-vision to create multi-robot dense 3 D maps. For online pose and map estimation, we integrate the results of keyframe-based local <b>reference</b> <b>filters</b> through incremental graph SLAM.

We propose a novel graph topology for a decoupled integration of local filter estimates from multiple robots into a SLAM graph according to the filters' uncertainty estimates and independence assumptions and evaluated its benefits on two different robots in indoor, outdoor and mixed scenarios. Further, we performed two extended experiments in a multi-robot setup to evaluate the full SLAM system, including visual robot detections and submap matches as inter-robot loop closure constraints...|$|R

These structures carry the inherent bilinear transformation of their doubly resistively terminated ladder reference filters. This one to one correspondence between the 's-domain' and the 'z-domain' results in the Nyquist criterion being the only limitation on the sampling frequency. This eliminates the necessity for oversampling and VIS filters can be designed for high operating rates. Filters based on VIS principle were analysed in previous literatures in the 'phi-domain'.

40|$|This M. Sc. thesis {{intends to}} {{evaluate}} various algorithms based on Bayesian statistical theory and validates with both synthetic data {{as well as}} experimental data. The focus is given in comparing the performance of new kind of sequential Monte Carlo <b>filter,</b> called cost <b>reference</b> particle <b>filter,</b> with other Kalman based filters {{as well as the}} standard particle filter. Different filtering algorithms based on Kalman filters and those based on sequential Monte Carlo technique are implemented in Matlab. For all linear Gaussian system models, Kalman filter gives the optimal solution. Hence only the cases which do not have linear-Gaussian probabilistic model are analyzed in this thesis. The results of various simulations show that, for those non-linear system models whose probability model can fairly be assumed Gaussian, either Kalman like filters or the sequential Monte Carlo based particle filters can be used. The choice among these filters depends upon various factors such as degree of nonlinearity, order of system state, required accuracy, etc. There is always a tradeoff between the required accuracy and the computational cost. It is found that whenever the probabilistic model of the system cannot be approximated as Gaussian, which is the case in many real world applications like Econometrics, Genetics, etc., the above discussed statistical <b>reference</b> <b>filters</b> degrade in performance. To tackle with this problem, the recently proposed cost <b>reference</b> particle <b>filter</b> is implemented and tested in scenarios where the system model is not Gaussian. The new filter shows good robustness in such scenarios as it does not make any assumption of probabilistic model. The thesis work also includes implementation of the above discussed prediction algorithms into a real world application, where location of a moving robot is tracked using measurements from wireless sensor networks. The flexibility of the cost <b>reference</b> particle <b>filter</b> to adapt to specific applications is explored and is found to perform better than the other filters in tracking of the robot. The results obtained from various experiments show that cost <b>reference</b> particle <b>filter</b> is the best choice whenever there is high uncertainty of the probabilistic model and when these models are not Gaussian. It can also be concluded that,contrary to the general perception, the estimation techniques based on ad-hoc references can actually be more efficient than those based on the usual statistical reference...|$|R

The operation of APF is verified using the simulations in Matlab/Simulink. Artificial neural network (ANN) control based shunt APF is compared to proportional-integral (PI) controller in order to regulate the DC-bus voltage and hysteresis current controller is employed to generate signal for switching purpose.
