40|$|A {{new concept}} in breakup ice control is presented. Current {{state-of-the-art}} breakup ice control structures (ICS) consist of piers that retain the breakup {{ice in the}} main river channel while passing <b>relief</b> <b>flow</b> via an adjacent floodplain. The ability to bypass flow around the structure is critical because it reduces upstream stage rise, the potential for ice blowout at the piers and ice jam failure. A major drawback with {{this approach is that}} many rivers with ice jam problems lack upstream sites with floodplains suitable for bypass flow. This paper introduces the concept of in-channel <b>relief</b> <b>flow</b> for ice retention at sites without floodplains. An L-shaped pier configuration is used, with transverse piers to stop the breakup ice run and longitudinal piers to maintain an ice-free flow relief channel along one side of the jam. The concept was developed as a possible means of preventing under-ice scour associated with ice jams that form naturally in the lower Grasse River (McShea et al., 2005). The DynaRICE ice-hydraulic numerical model (Shen et al., 2000) was used assess the feasibility of the concept and optimize general design parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{relaxation of}} ground-state molecular oxygen (O 2, X 3 S g -) has been observed, following stimulated Raman excitation {{to the first}} excited vibrational level (v= 1). Time delayed laser-induced fluorescence probing of the ro-vibrational population distribution {{was used to examine}} the temporal relaxation behavior. In the presence of water vapor, the relaxation process is rapid, and is dominated by near-resonant vibrational energy exchange between the v= 1 level of O 2 and the n 2 bending mode of H 2 O. In the absence of H 2 O, reequilibration proceeds via homogeneous vibrational energy transfer, in which a collision between two v= 1 O 2 molecules leaves one molecule in the v= 2 state and the other in the v= 0 state.

40|$|In this study, we used {{an archive}} of {{borehole}} logs from the British Geological Survey {{to collect information}} on the spatial structure of weathering that extends from the surface to competent bedrock across the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone Group outcrop (750 [*]km 2), in the East Midlands, UK. The borehole logs were used to estimate {{the thickness of the}} soil (n = 280) and soil and saprolite (S&S) to competent rock (n = 500). The weathering profile of the sandstone consisted of soil (median thickness ∼ 1 · 5 [*]m) overlying a transition zone of compacted and weakly cemented weathered sandstone saprolite over bedrock. Topographic analysis using a NEXTMAP 5 [*]m × 5 [*]m digital elevation model (DEM) revealed no significant relationships between slope properties (<b>relief,</b> <b>flow</b> length, flow accumulation or slope angle) and soil or S&S thickness. A weak, but statistically significant correlation was found between the thickness of the soil and S&S (rs = 0 · 25, p < 0 · 001, n = 192). The variation in soil thickness may be related to changes in current and historic and land-use, variation in sandstone properties and the influence of glacial/peri-glacial processes. The thickness of the saprolite was more variable towards {{the southern part of the}} study area, where it increased to a maximum 40 [*]m. We hypothesize and provide evidence that the greater weathering thickness is related to the occurrence of increased faulting in this part of the study region, allowing increased access to meteoric waters.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Tracheal gas {{insufflation}} (TGI) {{can increase}} total positive end-expiratory pressure (total-PEEP) when flow is {{delivered in a}} forward direction, necessitating adjustments to maintain total-PEEP constant. When TGI is delivered throughout the respiratory cycle, additional adjustments are needed to maintain tidal volume (VT) constant. OBJECTIVE: Determine if bidirectional TGI (bi-TGI) (simultaneous flows toward the lungs and upper airway) in combination with a <b>flow</b> <b>relief</b> valve eliminates the increase in total-PEEP and maintains a constant V T, thus simplifying TGI administration. METHODS: Using an artificial lung model and pressure control ventilation, we studied the effect of TGI at 10 L/min on inspired V T, total-PEEP, and CO 2 elimination during 6 conditions: (1) control (no TGI, no catheter in the airway), (2) baseline (catheter in the airway but no TGI), (3) continuous TGI, (4) expiratory TGI, (5) reverse TGI, and (6) bi-TGI. Each condition was studied under 3 inspiration-expiration ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 2 : 1). A preset <b>flow</b> <b>relief</b> valve was inserted into the ventilator circuit during all TGI conditions with continuous flow. SETTING: University research laboratory. RESULTS: CO 2 elimination efficiency was similar under all conditions. Total-PEEP increased with continuous TGI and expiratory TGI, decreased during reverse TGI, and was unchanged during bi-TGI. With the <b>flow</b> <b>relief</b> valve in place, and no adjustment in mechanical ventilation, the change in minute ventilation ranged from 0 % to 10 %, with the least change during bi-TGI (0 - 5 %). During bi-TGI, gas flow was equivalent in both directions during dynamic conditions and the <b>flow</b> <b>relief</b> valve consistently removed gas at 10 L/min under various pressures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data from an artificial lung model support that continuous bi-TGI minimizes the change in total-PEEP seen during other TGI modalities. The <b>flow</b> <b>relief</b> valve compensated for the extra gas volume delivered by the TGI catheter, thereby eliminating {{the need to make}} ventilator adjustments.

40|$|Abstract — A grey-level image may be visualized as a {{topographic}} relief, {{where the}} grey-level of a pixel is thought as its height in the relief. Supposing that {{a drop of}} water falls on a topographic <b>relief,</b> it <b>flows</b> along a path to finally reach a local minimum. The watershed of a relief corresponds to the limits of the adjacent catchment areas of the drops of water. In image processing, different types of watershed lines can be computed. In graphs- watershed lines can be defined on the nodes, on the edges, or hybrid lines on both nodes and edges. Watersheds can also be defined in the continuous domain. There are also many different algorithms to compute watersheds. Watershed algorithm is used in image processing primarily for segmentation purposes.

40|$|Submarine {{channels}} are ubiquitous on the seafloor and their inception and evolution {{is a result}} of dynamic interaction between turbidity currents and the evolving seafloor. However, the morphodynamic links between channel inception and flow dynamics have not yet been monitored in experiments and only in one instance on the modern seafloor. Previous experimental flows did not show channel inception, because flow conditions were not appropriately scaled to sustain suspended sediment transport. Here we introduce and apply new scaling constraints for similarity between natural and experimental turbidity currents. The scaled currents initiate a leveed channel from an initially featureless slope. Channelization commences with deposition of levees in some slope segments and erosion of a conduit in other segments. Channel <b>relief</b> and <b>flow</b> confinement increase progressively during subsequent flows.

50|$|The Great Depression struck Sacramento {{alongside}} {{the rest of}} the United States in 1929, driving approximately 15,000 Sacramentans into unemployment by 1932. The local canning industry was affected first as demand for canned goods dropped drastically, laying off workers; a freeze later destroyed half of the Sacramento area's citrus trees in December 1932. Hoovervilles, or large shantytowns created without official authority by homeless people, began appearing across the city. The city of Sacramento in itself did not have to deal with transient vagrants since that was handled by the county government. However, since both entities relied on charities to supply their relief programs, most of the Sacramento area's government-funded programs were discontinued after local charitable organizations began to collapse.

The paper focuses on distribution, and argues that lack of clear guidelines for distribution may complicate and delay the resolution process and induce undue uncertainty about the predictability and viability of the restructuring outcome.
