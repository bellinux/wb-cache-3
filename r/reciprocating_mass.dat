25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass.</b> A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E
25|$|Wankel {{engines are}} {{considerably}} lighter and simpler, containing far fewer moving parts than piston engines of equivalent power output. Valves or complex valve trains are eliminated by using simple ports {{cut into the}} walls of the rotor housing. Since the rotor rides directly on a large bearing on the output shaft, there are no connecting rods and no crankshaft. The elimination of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> and the elimination of the most highly stressed and failure prone parts of piston engines, gives the Wankel engine high reliability, a smoother flow of power, and a high power-to-weight ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{came the}} idea of having {{multiple}} groups of cylinders and driven wheels mounted in one rigid frame. A [...] "duplex" [...] version of a 4-8-4 would be a 4-4-4-4, with the eight driving wheels split into two groups of four, each with its own set of cylinders and valve gear. The <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> of both sets would be substantially less than the single set on the 4-8-4, since they would be under less stress and gentler piston thrusts. The cylinders could be smaller yet have larger, more efficient valves. The most obvious tradeoff was that in Baldwin's proposed design, the rigid wheelbase was longer since the second set of cylinders had to be between the two sets of drivers. This was sufficiently concerning for many roads, for whom current locomotives were taxing enough, to reject the duplex idea.|$|E
50|$|The <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> of all {{configurations}} {{are still}} only imbalanced at 6th-order and {{up in their}} plane of motion, but the balance of kinetic energy exchange between pistons has improved to a residual 6th-order-and-up inertial torque oscillation compared with the four-stroke design being imbalanced at 3rd-order and up.|$|R
50|$|Double-expansion (usually {{known as}} compound) engines {{expanded}} the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated or {{the work of}} the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other, giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same, making the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> easier to balance.|$|R
50|$|Double-expansion (usually just {{known as}} 'compound') engines expand the steam in two stages, {{but this does}} not imply that all such engines have two {{cylinders}}. They may have four cylinders working as two LP-HP pairs, or the work of the large LP cylinder can be split across two smaller cylinders, with one HP cylinder exhausting into either LP cylinder, giving a 3-cylinder layout where the cylinder and piston diameter of all three are about the same, making the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> easier to balance.|$|R
2500|$|The LFA's {{engineers}} {{selected a}} V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 engine {{for its ability}} to rev higher, and over a V12 for its lower <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> allowing for more rapid engine response. Lexus claims their engine can rev from idle to its redline in 0.6seconds and an analog tachometer needle could not accurately track the LFA's changes in engine speeds. This necessitated the use of a digital tachometer which can instantly display engine speed. The engine reportedly weighs less than the manufacturer's own 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine. Engineers attempted to make the engine sound like that of a Formula One car with high revs, {{while at the same time}} maintaining reliability and vibration control. Along with other manufacturers such as Ferrari, Toyota had produced their own F1 engines and chassis designs. The exhaust note has been described by Toyota engineers as the [...] "roar of an angel", and a US television spot later used the engine sound to shatter a champagne glass via resonance frequency.|$|E

40|$|For {{aircraft}} engines the three principal operating conditions are idling speed, cruising speed, and diving {{with the engine}} stopped. In what follows, we will discuss a method which affords {{a good idea of}} the course of pressure for the above mentioned operating conditions. The pressures produced in the driving gear are of three kinds; namely, the pressure due to gases, the pressure due to the inertia of the rotating masses, and the pressure due to the inertia of the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses...</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{transferred}} to the track by the driving wheels of many steam locomotives. It is an out-of-balance force on the wheel (known as overbalance). It {{is the result of}} a compromise when a locomotive's wheels are unbalanced to off-set horizontal <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses,</b> such as connecting rods and pistons, to improve the ride. The hammer blow may cause damage to the locomotive and track if the wheel/rail force is high enough. 'Dynamic augment' is the US term for the same force.|$|R
50|$|In {{multi-valve}} engines, {{the conventional}} two-valves-per-cylinder setup is complemented by {{a minimum of}} an extra intake valve (three-valve cylinder head) or, more commonly, with an extra intake and an extra exhaust valve (four-valve cylinder head), the latter meaning higher RPM are, theoretically, achievable. Five valve designs (with three inlet and two exhaust valves) are also in use. More valves per cylinder means improved gas flow and smaller <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> may be achieved, leading to improved engine efficiency and, ultimately, higher power output and better fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{efficiency}} of squeeze films at the pins, an increase in <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> plays a much less important role.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} fairly {{conventional}} but unusual in some aspects. One goal was reducing <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> {{which could not}} be completely balanced. This was the reason for the high boiler pressure of , which allowed smaller pistons. <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> of the connecting rods was also reduced with the use of four, rather than the more usual six, driving wheels. The main rods connected to the first pair of driven wheels rather than the (more conventional) second; again, this reduced the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> as well as providing more even power throughout the stroke. The large 84 in diameter driving wheels reduced piston speed and made high speed less taxing on the machinery. The streamlined casings were designed to open easily for servicing; the front end had clamshell doors ahead of the smokebox.|$|E

50|$|At {{speed the}} {{locomotive}} {{will tend to}} surge fore-and-aft and nose, or sway, from side to side. It will also tend to pitch and rock. This article looks at these motions that originate from unbalanced inertia forces and couples in the 2 steam engines and their coupled wheels (some similar motions {{may be caused by}} irregularities in the track running surface and stiffness). The first two motions are caused by the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> and the last two by the oblique action of the con-rods, or piston thrust, on the guide bars.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{pressure}} due to expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space {{at the top of}} the cylinder which generate thermal stresses due to presence of heat involved on the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses.</b> The present work {{deals with the}} use of different materials for IC engine piston and a comparative study is made to achieve the best possible result. Piston parameters are taken using the conventional formulas and are constant throughout the analysis. Moreover the boundary conditions are chosen such that the piston does not moves sideways except in the direction of line of action of the piston itself...|$|R
50|$|By about 1920 the US {{version of}} the Mallet as a huge slow-speed pusher had reached a plateau; {{the size of the}} LP {{cylinders}} became a limiting factor even on the large loading gauge permitted in the US, and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> posed serious dynamic problems above walking pace. Moreover, there were adhesion stability problems where the front engine tended to slip and then stall uncontrollably because of an imbalance of tractive effort and axle load, accentuated by the drawbar reaction, and inability of the intermediate steam receiver to accommodate the sudden pressure change. This was further worsened by dynamic instability of the front end in running.|$|R
50|$|The Synchro-Balanced Engine - This 1966 {{innovation}} {{was designed}} to attenuate vibration caused by the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> of a single-cylinder engine. The design {{was a series of}} counterweights opposing the crankpin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> - Piston mass {{needs to}} be {{accelerated}} and decelerated, resisting a smooth rotation of a crankshaft. In addition to the up-down movement of a piston, a {{connecting rod big end}} swings left and right and up and down while it rotates. In order to simplify the motion of a crank slider mechanism, the connecting rod/piston assembly is generally divided into two mass groups, a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> and a rotating mass. The big end of the rod is generally said to be rotating while the small end is said to be reciprocating. In truth, however, both ends both reciprocate and rotate.|$|E
50|$|Inline five {{cylinder}} (L5) engine, {{with crank}} throws at 72° phase shift to each other, {{is the common}} five cylinder configuration. Exceptions are Honda racing V5, and Volkswagen VR5 engine. These typical L5 engines have 13. Evenly spaced firing and perfect 3. Phase balance on <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> with 4. Plane imbalance on <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> 6. Plane imbalance on rotating mass, 14. Plane imbalance on torque generation, and 16. Plane imbalance on compression. Just like in inline 3 engines above, these first order rocking couples can be countered with heavy counterweights, and the secondary balance is comparable to, or better than an ordinary inline 6 {{because there are no}} piston pairs that move together.|$|E
5000|$|The {{final three}} or four years saw a small fleet of 9F 2-10-0 {{locomotives}} working on the heaviest passenger trains, including 92220 [...] "Evening Star", the last steam engine to be built by British Railways. These locomotives proved ideal for the S&D, delivering considerable power, good steaming, and high adhesion. These heavy freight locomotives had relatively small wheels, and had never previously run with passenger trains, but with the Pines Express they were easily able to reach, and perhaps exceed, the 70 mph line speed limit on the better, downhill parts of the route. After a review of the velocities of the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> and coupling rods, a 60 mph maximum speed was urgently imposed.|$|R
5000|$|The whole {{locomotive}} {{tends to}} move {{under the influence}} of unbalanced inertia forces. The horizontal motions for unbalanced locomotives were quantified by M. Le Chatelier in France, around 1850, by suspending them on ropes from the roof of a building. They were run up to equivalent road speeds of up to 40 mph and the horizontal motion was traced out by a pencil, mounted on the buffer beam. The trace was an elliptical shape formed by the combined action of the fore-and-aft and swaying motions. The shape could be enclosed in a 5/8" [...] square for one of the unbalanced locomotives and was reduced to a point when weights were added to counter revolving and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{other aspect}} that affects {{drivetrain}} smoothness is {{the variation in}} rotational speed arising from the sharing of piston kinetic energy amongst the different phases. There are only three piston phases in a four stroke inline six and, whilst {{the nature of the}} piston motion can never result in a 3rd-order imbalance (the pistons have no oscillation at that rate), it does appear in the kinetic energy exchange between the pistons and crankshaft (mathematically because of the squaring of velocity resulting in a specific intermodulation of frequencies). This means that a constant kinetic energy level for the rotating and <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses</b> will result in the flywheel rotation speeding up and slowing down three times per revolution. This will in turn result in a cyclic so-called inertial torque being overlaid onto the combustion torque output from the crankshaft, which also has three pulses per revolution.|$|R
50|$|A single cylinder, 360°-crank {{parallel}} twin, or a 180°-crank inline-3 engine normally vibrates up {{and down}} {{because there are no}} counter-moving piston(s) or there is a mismatch in the number of counter-moving pistons. This is a 3. phase imbalance of <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the later}} {{developments}} of the engine compression ratios were lowered, then raised. Pistons were lightened 20 percent along with connecting rods to reduce the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> inside the engine. Aluminum pistons are slightly domed with valve pockets. Pistons have three rings installed, two compression and one oil control ring.|$|E
50|$|Straight-three engines {{generally}} {{employ a}} crank angle of 120°. This gives perfect {{first and second}} order balance on <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> but an end-to-end rocking motion is induced {{because there is no}} symmetry in the piston velocities about the middle piston. The use of a balance shaft reduces this undesirable effect.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines can contain {{any number of}} combustion chambers (cylinders), with numbers between one and twelve being common, though as many as 36 (Lycoming R-7755) have been used. Having more cylinders in an engine yields two potential benefits: first, the engine can have a larger displacement with smaller individual <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses,</b> that is, the mass of each piston can be less thus making a smoother-running engine since the engine tends to vibrate {{as a result of}} the pistons moving up and down. Doubling the number of the same size cylinders will double the torque and power. The downside to having more pistons is that the engine will tend to weigh more and generate more internal friction as the greater number of pistons rub against the inside of their cylinders. This tends to decrease fuel efficiency and robs the engine of some of its power. For high-performance gasoline engines using current materials and technology, such as the engines found in modern automobiles, there seems to be a point around 10 or 12 cylinders after which the addition of cylinders becomes an overall detriment to performance and efficiency. Although, exceptions such as the W16 engine from Volkswagen exist.|$|R

40|$|The {{globalization}} and economic reforms {{have changed the}} face and pace of world economy {{in the last two}} decades. The main thrust is on product quality, faster design and development and finally cheaper product. At the same time, for optimal use of these technologies, one has to converge them in a better way. To sustain in the competitive market, industries have to update their knowledge, acquire new skills to offer world-class products. Design and analysis of complex components has reached new heights with the application of Finite Element Method. Automobile Industry has benefited a lot with the development of CAD/CAM technologies, from engine performance to aesthetic appeal. The lead time to manufacture automobiles has drastically reduced in the recent times, because of advancements in Geometric modeling and Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM). Design of Internal Combustion (IC) Engine parts plays a crucial role in improving the functioning of an automobile. Design and modifications of all the important components are carried out to increase the performance and thereby efficiency. Many redesign concepts have been emerged for cylinder head, connecting rod,crankshaft, piston, carburetor, Fuel injection pump and other engine components. specially redesign of Crankshaft is carried out to get enough strength to sustain the gas pressure and to have the better thermal stability. Also new researches are going on to select an alternate material to cope up with the existing load cases, to get higher compression ratio, to reduce the inertia forces to increase the speed of the vehicle (by reducing the weight of the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>masses).</b> Keywords:Hardness,finite element method,materials...|$|R
5000|$|When {{comparing}} {{piston engines}} with different configurations {{in the number}} of cylinders, the V angle, etc., the term [...] "inherent balance" [...] is used. This term often describes just two categories in the above list that are 'inherent' in the configuration, namely, 3. Phase balance on <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> and 13. Phase balance on torque generation.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of this imbalance is determined by 1. <b>Reciprocating</b> <b>mass,</b> 2. Ratio of connecting rod length to stroke, and 3. Acceleration of piston movement. So small displacement engines with light pistons show little effect, and racing engines use long connecting rods. However, the effect grows exponentially with crankshaft rotational speed. See crossplane article for unusual inline-four configurations.|$|E
50|$|Straight-twins {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being more compact, relatively simple, and cheaper to make in comparison to V- or flat-twins. They may be prone to vibration, either because of the irregular firing interval present in 180° crank engines or the large uncountered <b>reciprocating</b> <b>mass</b> in 360° crank engines. Inline-twins also suffer further from torsional torque reactions and vibration.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the mass}} leakage through the piston rings in <b>reciprocating</b> engines, the <b>mass</b> of the working medium {{decreases}} and thereafter {{the temperature of the}} gas cannot be calculated accurately by an equation of state.

50|$|For {{car engines}} the rocker arms are {{generally}} steel stampings, providing a reasonable balance of strength, weight and economical cost.

For this reason, aluminum is often used for high performance, aftermarket rocker arms for pushrod engines {{as well as many}} OEM rocker arms on OHC engines. Aluminum rockers on OHC engines often have a steel pad or roller where the cam contacts the rocker arm in order to reduce wear. Truck engines (mostly diesel) use stronger and stiffer rocker arms made of cast iron (usually ductile), or forged carbon steel.|$|R
