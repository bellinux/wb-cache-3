5|$|A {{former lover}} of Mariko {{and head of}} the Black Ninja Clan, sworn to protect the Yashida family. Lee said that he {{underwent}} <b>rigorous</b> sword training for the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Forward {{published}} Starquake, {{a sequel}} to Dragon's Egg. Lambourne, Shallis and Shortland consider Starquake’s scientific background as <b>rigorous</b> as Dragon's Eggs.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{alprazolam}} {{was originally}} a Schedule 4 (Prescription Only) medication; however, as of February 2014, {{it has become}} a Schedule 8 medication, subjecting it to more <b>rigorous</b> prescribing requirements.|$|E
5|$|Standards- and science-based—in {{the sense}} that the public can have {{confidence}} that all facilities meet <b>rigorous,</b> objective, and consistently-applied standards of safety and environmental protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{commutativity}} and associativity {{of rational}} addition {{is an easy}} consequence {{of the laws of}} integer arithmetic. For a more <b>rigorous</b> and general discussion, see field of fractions.|$|E
5|$|A {{maximum of}} three Nobel laureates and two {{different}} works may be {{selected for the}} Nobel Prize in Physics. Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and <b>rigorous.</b> This is a key reason why it has grown in importance {{over the years to}} become the most important prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Adderall {{has been}} {{banned in the}} National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). In leagues such as the NFL, {{there is a very}} <b>rigorous</b> process {{required}} to obtain an exemption to this rule even when the athlete has been medically prescribed the drug by their physician.|$|E
5|$|Andrei {{was played}} by Gabriel Huian (untrained actor, {{previously}} appearing {{in a video}} clip that caught the director's attention). He was Cristian Nemescu's preferred choice from the beginning, however a <b>rigorous</b> casting still took place. Apparently attracted to Mădălina Ghiţescu, Huian showed a different attitude than that of other candidates, which only convinced the director further.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1920, the Piber Federal Stud, near Graz, Austria, {{became the}} main stud for the horses used in Vienna. Breeding became very selective, only {{allowing}} stallions that had proved {{themselves at the}} Riding School to stand at stud, and only breeding mares who had passed <b>rigorous</b> performance testing.|$|E
5|$|Between April 1918 and May 1919, the Spanish Flu killed {{approximately}} 25 {{million people}} worldwide, {{far more than}} {{had been killed in}} four years of war. A <b>rigorous</b> quarantine policy was implemented in Australia; although this reduced the immediate impact of the flu, the nation's death toll surpassed 11,500.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1980s and the 2000s, {{with the}} rise of {{databases}} such as Compustat and EDGAR and software such as SAS, articles became mathematically more <b>rigorous</b> with increasingly sophisticated statistical analyses, and accounting practitioners comprised a decreasing proportion of authors in the journal.|$|E
5|$|Ehlers' {{research}} {{was in the}} field of general relativity. In particular, he made contributions to cosmology, the theory of gravitational lenses and gravitational waves. His principal concern was to clarify general relativity's mathematical structure and its consequences, separating <b>rigorous</b> proofs from heuristic conjectures.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for his {{willingness}} to apply an equal degree of scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to <b>rigorous</b> analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his own position.|$|E
5|$|His <b>rigorous</b> {{mathematical}} {{analysis of the}} structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery {{of the structure of}} DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.|$|E
5|$|In those days, Europe {{produced}} {{a great many}} child prodigies, inspired by the phenomenal success of the young Czech virtuoso Jan Kubelík and formed by <b>rigorous</b> teaching and enthusiastic parents. The Hubay studio was no exception; Szigeti and his fellow wunderkinder performed extensively in special recitals and salon concerts during their study at the Liszt Academy.|$|E
5|$|International Baccalaureate (IB) is a <b>rigorous,</b> internationally {{accepted}} {{academic program}} required of all 21st century Baltimore City College students. The IB Middle Years Program {{is intended to}} teach freshman and sophomore students to understand how core subjects are interrelated, how to master critical thinking processes, and to increase intercultural awareness. As juniors and seniors, students engage in the <b>rigorous</b> two-year IB Diploma curriculum that requires a comprehensive study of world topics, literature, languages, science, and math. City College's IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Jack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, {{but their}} {{acquaintance}} {{is all too}} brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day. Undaunted, the two men endure a <b>rigorous</b> training period, where they go from being enemies to best friends. Upon graduating, they are shipped off to France to fight the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Jain {{vegetarian}} diet is practised by {{the followers of}} Jain culture and philosophy. It {{is considered one of}} the most <b>rigorous</b> forms of a spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian, and it also excludes potatoes, onions and garlic, like the shojin-ryori cuisine of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more <b>rigorous</b> techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on <b>rigorous</b> mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the new {{values were}} still {{higher than the}} levels that Vespasian and Titus had {{maintained}} during their reigns. Domitian's <b>rigorous</b> taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years. Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2012, all {{cars were}} {{required}} to pass their mandatory FIA crash tests before being allowed {{to take part in}} pre-season testing. Previously, passing the crash tests was only a requirement prior to the first race of the season. Crash tests for the 2012 season will also be more <b>rigorous</b> than in previous years.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Cleopatra notwithstanding, Etty {{remained}} {{a student at}} the RA and continued with a <b>rigorous</b> programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences the last time he left England.|$|E
5|$|The use of Newton's Second Law as a {{definition}} of force has been disparaged {{in some of the}} more <b>rigorous</b> textbooks, because it is essentially a mathematical truism. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include Ernst Mach and Walter Noll.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{is easy to}} visualize, with little danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics; for the <b>rigorous</b> definition it inspires, see Natural numbers below. However, it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.|$|E
5|$|Đurić {{lives in}} Holland Village, Singapore. As {{part of his}} <b>rigorous</b> fitness regime, he runs 15km around his {{neighbourhood}} every morning. He does not drink, smoke or do late nights. He avoids chili and limits his intake of greasy food like prata and chicken rice, and keeps up with his fitness regime in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{elementary}} school in 1893, Kafka {{was admitted to the}} <b>rigorous</b> classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinský Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the one hand, it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically <b>rigorous</b> manner.|$|E
5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, {{it might be}} observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore. However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to <b>rigorous</b> statistical testing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the month}} of August begins, special stalls, fun fairs and shops are set up across {{the country for the}} sale of {{national}} flags, buntings, banners and posters, badges, pictures of national heroes, multimedia and other celebratory items. Vehicles, private buildings, homes, and streets are decorated with national flags, candles, oil lamps, pennants and buntings. Businesses engage in <b>rigorous</b> marketing, as do leading designer fashion outlets which stock independence-themed clothing, jewellery and self-adornments.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{finds the}} action and higher pay rejuvenating; he begins <b>rigorous</b> {{training}} while awaiting more work from Mirage {{for the next two}} months. Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits superhero costume designer Edna Mode. Mode, assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, makes new suits for the entire family. However, she rejects Bob's request for a cape, citing the large number of Supers who perished when their capes got caught in something.|$|E
5|$|Former Waffen-SS men {{who wished}} to join the Bundeswehr still faced {{heightened}} scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the <b>rigorous</b> vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested {{to the government and}} its military planners, but to no avail. As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{three years}} after his Oscar win, The Last of the Mohicans was released. Day-Lewis's {{character}} research for this film was well-publicised; he reportedly underwent <b>rigorous</b> weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived, camping, hunting and fishing. Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills and {{learned how to make}} canoes. He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character and learned how to skin animals.|$|E
5|$|In Pensacola, Brown and Nix {{married in}} secret, as Naval Cadets {{were not allowed}} to marry until their {{training}} was complete, under threat of immediate dismissal. Nix took a room in Pensacola, and the two visited one another on weekends. In spite of overt racism from at least one instructor and several classmates at this posting, Brown completed the <b>rigorous</b> training in August 1947.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to <b>rigorous</b> security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{committed}} 18 {{errors in}} 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman {{and his staff}} saw Jeter's defense as an area {{that needed to be}} addressed. At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a <b>rigorous</b> training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness. Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{was shipped}} to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943. He was {{assigned}} to Company B, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, which trained {{under the command of}} Major General Lucian Truscott. He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in <b>rigorous</b> training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily. He was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July.|$|E
