40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} the effects of a taper period on stroke <b>rate</b> and <b>distance</b> per stroke in competitive swimmers, ten highly trained Ball State University swimmers were involved in three separate trials of 300 yards (274. 4 m) at 80 percent of their best time for that distance. The trials took place during the pre-taper phase of training, post taper phase of training, and the post removal of body hair phase of training. The stroke <b>rate</b> and <b>distance</b> per stroke were judged using Sportline stopwatches. The swimmers' were timed every fourth arm cycle at the 175 yard and 275 yard mark of the 300 yard distance.

The lack of decreased stroke <b>rate</b> and increased <b>distance</b> per stroke may be attributed to the intensity of the trials. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

This paper has presented optical wireless links which offer ultra multi gigabit per second data rates and low system complexity. For ground space and or terrestrial communication systems, these links suffer from atmospheric loss mainly due to fog, and scintillation. Optical wireless links provide high bandwidth solution to the last mile access bottleneck. However, an appreciable availability of the link is always a concern. Wireless optical links are highly weather dependent and fog is the major attenuating factor reducing the link availability.

We used re-sightings of European Shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis colour-ringed as chicks on the Isle of May (IoM), UK, to quantify rates, distances and directions of dispersal from natal to subsequent breeding sites both within IoM (within-colony dispersal) and across 27 other breeding colonies covering 1045 km of coastline (among-colony dispersal).

40|$|The shear {{response}} of soft solids can be modeled with linear elasticity, provided the forcing {{is slow and}} weak. Both of these approximations must break down when the material loses rigidity, such as in foams and emulsions at their (un) jamming point – suggesting that the window of linear elastic response near jamming is exceedingly narrow. Yet precisely when and how this breakdown occurs remains unclear. To answer these questions, we perform computer simulations of stress relaxation and shear start-up tests in athermal soft sphere packings, the canonical model for jamming. By systematically varying the strain amplitude, strain <b>rate,</b> <b>distance</b> to jamming, and system size, we identify characteristic strain and time scales that quantify how and when the window of linear elasticity closes, and relate these scales {{to changes in the}} microscopic contact network...|$|E

40|$|Electrospinning is an {{inexpensive}} technique {{that is used}} to produce nanofibers for a variety of applications. In electrospinning, a polymer solution is dispensed from a hypodermic-like syringe where an intense electric field attracts the solution to a collector while drawing the polymer into a very thin fiber.

In this paper we describe results from electrospinning poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a likely candidate for applications involving scaffolding for tissue engineering.

40|$|Abstract—A {{number of}} prefix delegation-based schemes have been {{proposed}} to solve the route optimization problem in NEMO, {{where a group of}} hosts move together as a mobile network. The schemes trade off between inefficiency of routes and various overheads. With the rapid growth of mobile computing, this overhead will give rise to the scalability issue of these schemes. However, there has been no quantitative study on the asymptotic scalability analysis of these schemes. In this paper, we have developed analytical models for scalability analysis of these schemes in terms of network size, mobility <b>rate,</b> <b>distance</b> between mobility agents, and traffic rate. Our analysis shows that the prefix delegation-based schemes exhibit asymptotically identical overhead on the network, and they show better asymptotical scalability in terms of number of mobile routers. The analytical framework for scalability analysis presented in this paper will help in visualizing the effects of future network expansion on the performance of these route optimization schemes of NEMO.
