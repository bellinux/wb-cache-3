40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{reliability}} of a cooling seawater pumping station which pumps seawater to refineries and petrochemical plants in Kuwait mainly for cooling purposes. Owing to the harsh operating climate {{and the lack of}} other alternative sources of water, high reliability of the pumping system is crucially important. The reliability of a system can be considered from different views. The one taken in this study is to measure the reliability of the cooling seawater arriving to the consumer at the required pressure and flow rate while observing the operational constraints on the system. A reliability model has been developed and applied to the actual data from the pumping station. The preliminary results indicate that the model could be a useful tool to assess the current condition of the system and to find ways of improving system reliability and availability.

40|$|Based upon a well-acknowledged {{concept that}} the {{viability}} of a preserved organ exclusively depends upon the maintainance of mitochondrial function, this study was performed using variable damaged dog kidney by warm ischemic intervention from 0 to 120 minutes (warm ischemic time, WIT). The isolated kidney subjected to WIT was perfused with cold fibrinogen-free plasma on the machine for 18 hours and reautotransplanted for {{the judgment of the}} graft function. During preservation, several common enzymes, such as LDH, GOT, GPT, Al-P and CPK were determined at 3 occasions, e. g. at 3 hrs, 6 hrs and 18 hrs of preservation. With regard to LDH, the isozyme pattern was analysed as well as total activity. All data for each enzyme was surveyed in the relationship with WIT and interpreted focusing on its <b>relibility</b> as a parameter of viability based on a function of re-autotransplanted graft. Consequently, the following results were confirmed in the work. LDH and LDH isozyme were the most sensitive according to both preservation time and length of WIT in several enzymes which escaped into the perfusate from preserved kidney after warm ischemia. Though GOT in perfusate was not so sensitive as LDH and LDH isozyme, GOT elevated in proportion to the length of WIT. But the other enzymes in the perfusate did not so elevate remarkably compared to WIT 0 and 120 minutes as control groups. Comparing the results between the graft function and the LDH activity in wash-out sample, author decided that LDH activity value was 12 I. U/g (graft weight) as the critical value in wash-out sample. Thus, an analysis of the LDH activity and LDH isozyme in the wash-out sample can provide considerable and precise information about kidney viability as a graft...|$|E
40|$|The main {{challenge}} of this Thesis is to reliably preserve {{quality of service}} (QoS) contracts in component-based software systems under changing conditions of system execution. In response to this challenge, the presented contribution is twofold. The first is a model for component-based software applications, QoS contracts and reconfiguration rules as typed attributed graphs, and the definition of QoS-contracts semantics as state machines in which transitions are performed as software reconfigurations. Thus, we effectively use (formal) models at runtime to reliably reconfigure software applications for preserving its QoS contracts. More specifically, we show the feasibility of exploiting design patterns at runtime in reconfiguration loops to fulfill expected QoS levels associated to specific context conditions. We realize this formal model through a component-based architecture and implementation {{that can be used}} as an additional layer of SCA middleware stacks to preserve the QoS contracts of executed applications.   The second contribution is the characterization of adaptation properties to evaluate self-adaptive software systems in a standardized and comparable way. By its own nature, the adaptation mechanisms of self-adaptive software systems are essentially feedback loops as defined in control theory. Thus, it results reasonable to evaluate them using the standard properties used to evaluate feedback loops, re-interpreting these properties for the software domain. We define the <b>relibility</b> of our formal model realization in terms of a subset of the characterized adaptation properties, and we show that these properties are guaranteed in this realization.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze four psychological tests which are frequently used in the Guidance and Research Centers and in the guidance services of the schools according to the standards for educational and psychological testing of APA (American Psychological Association) and test adaption standards of ITC (International Testing Commission). The tests were determined based on the goal- oriented sample selecting method and were selected from the most frequently used psychological tests in Guidance and Research Centers and school’s guidance centers. These tests are: Scale of Academic Self-Concept (Akademik Benlik Kavramı Ölçeği-ABKÖ), Evaluation of Early Childhood Development Tool (Gazi Erken Çocukluk Gelişimi Değerlendirme Aracı-GEÇDA), Primary Mental Abilities 7 - 11 (TKT 7 - 11), and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised Form (WISC-R). In this research, the chapters related to the validity, reliability and test development and revision of “Standards For Educational And Psychological Testing” (APA, 1999) and the adaptation standards developed by ITC were translated into Turkish and a checklist was created by using these documents. The checklist has got two forms as short and long form. The tests were analyzed according to the short form of the checklist by researcher. In order to examine the reliability of these analyses, the analyses were repeated in three weeks’ time. Data of these analyses were exported to the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 20. 0 and descriptive analysis was perfomed. As a result of this research, the meeting levels of the psychological tests to the test standards in the checklist and the features of the tests which should be improved according to the validity, reliability, test development and revision and test adaptation were determined. In conclusion, the standards analyzed have not been met satisfactorily by ABKÖ and GEÇDA, and according to the analyses of the realibility of ABKÖ, it has been found that more <b>relibility</b> analyses should be done for ABKÖ. As for the results that obtained for the adapted tests, it has been found that most of the adaptation standards have been met for WISC-R and there are many standards that have not been met by for Primary Mental Abilities 7 - 11...|$|E
40|$|In {{minimization}} {{problems with}} uncertain parameters, cost savings {{can be achieved}} by solving stochastic programming (SP) formulations instead of using expected parameter values in a deterministic formulation. To obtain such savings, it is crucial to employ high quality probabilistic scenarios for the uncertain parameters. A convincing way to assess the quality of a scenario generation method is to simulate employing the resulting scenarios when solving the SP problem while measuring the costs incurred when the solution is implemented and observed parameter values occur. Simulation studies to assess the quality in this way are computationally very demanding. This research is aimed at developing faster methods to assess the quality via statistical metrics. <b>Relibility,</b> which is defined as the statistical consistency between scenarios and observation, is a prerequisite for quality. The dissertation is presented in a three-paper format. The stochastic unit commitment problem in electric power system operation is an application of SP that motivated this study. In power systems with high penetration of wind generation, probabilistic scenarios for the available wind energy are generated for use in stochastic formulations of day-ahead thermal unit commitment problems. To minimize the expected cost of dispatching the committed units, the wind energy scenarios should accurately represent the stochastic process for available wind energy. In the first paper, aiming to assess the reliability of probabilistic scenarios for wind energy time series, we employ some existing forecast verification approaches and introduce a mass transportation distance rank histogram to assess the reliability of unequally likely scenarios. In the second paper, we examine the relationship between the statistical reliability assessment metrics and the cost results of solving SUC using the assessed scenario generation method. Based on this relationship, we understand the importance of scenario reliability to ensure scenario quality for the SUC problem. In the third paper, we extend this work to make it more robust and general enough to be applied to any two-stage SP problem that is repeatedly solved and for which observational data exist for some historical period. Focusing on scenario quality, we develop two novel approaches: expected value based and perfect information based scenario generation assessment. With the proposed approaches, we can assess the quality of scenario sets without having to repeatedly solve the related SP problem. Instead of comparing scenarios to observations directly, these approaches take into consideration the impact of each scenario on the solution to the SP problem...|$|E
