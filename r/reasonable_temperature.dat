In addition to regulation of power line variations, the computer also contained the circuitry required to permit a warm-up stage. This warm-up stage minimized thermal shock to tubes to ensure long component life.

50|$|Other {{entirely new}} {{provisions}} in the Act of 1895, later strengthened by the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, were the requirement of a <b>reasonable</b> <b>temperature</b> in workrooms, the requirement of lavatories {{for the use of}} persons employed in any department where poisonous substances are used, the obligation on occupiers and medical practitioners to report cases of industrial poisoning; and the penalties imposed on an employer wilfully allowing wearing apparel to be made, cleaned or repaired in a dwelling-house where an inmate is suffering from infectious disease. Another provision empowered the secretary of state to specify classes of outwork and areas with a view to the regulation of the sanitary condition of premises in which outworkers are employed. Owing to the conditions attached to its exercise, no case was found in which this power could come into operation, and the act of 1901 deals with the matter on new lines.|$|E

The manufacture of lucifer matches by means of white phosphorus was forbidden and the export, importation and sale was regulated by a law of 28 May 1901. By a regulation of 16 March 1904 provisions for safety and health of women and young workers were strengthened in processes where lead compounds or other poisons are used, and their employment at certain dangerous machines and in cleaning machinery or near driving belts was prohibited. No penal provision against truck exists in the Netherlands, but possibly abuses of the system are prevented by the existence of industrial councils representing both employers and workers, with powers to mediate or arbitrate in case of disputes.|$|E

5000|$|High {{performance}} {{buildings are}} designed and constructed to maximize operational energy savings and minimize {{environmental impacts of}} the construction and operation of the buildings. Building construction and operation generates {{a great deal of}} ‘externalized costs’ such as material waste, energy inefficiencies and pollution. High performance buildings aim to minimize these and make the process much more efficient and less harmful. New York City Department of Design & Construction put out a set of guidelines in April 1999 on High performance buildings that have broad application to sustainable urbanism as a whole worldwide. [...] The amount of energy use of a building is determined by two types of heating/cooling loads or in other words the amount of heating or cooling needed to keep the interior at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>temperature.</b> Internal loads: the lighting, people, equipment, and ventilation system used inside the building, and external loads: the construction of the walls, roofs, and windows and how that influences energy flow. [...] By incorporating environmentally sound materials and systems, improving indoor air quality and using natural or high efficiency lighting, it minimizes a building impact on its natural surroundings; additionally, those who work or live in these buildings directly benefit from these differences. Some building owners have even reported increased worker productivity {{as a result of the}} improved conditions. However, because these other benefits are more difficult to quantify than direct energy savings, the real value of high performance buildings can easily be underestimated by traditional accounting methods that do not recognize ‘external’ municipal and regional costs and benefits. The cost evaluations of high performance building should account for the economic, social, and environmental benefits that accompany green buildings.|$|E
50|$|As the {{population}} grew, {{so did the}} need for a large function room. The necessary funds for building were found by public subscription. In order to secure generous patronage from wealthy residents, Jones needed to make it look as grand as possible. Also, he needed to span a reasonably wide expanse of area without recourse to vertical roof supports. Jones solved both requirements by basing the roof construction on medieval 14th century baronial architecture. It features wall-posts supporting moulded hammer-beams, and curved braces. The king post are hidden above the ceiling, which is on the level of the horizontal ties, these stop the roof collapsing in upon itself. By this means, Jones was able to span a width of 45½ feet. The hall is some 74 ft long; with a stage at one end. Around the top of the room are the shields and emblems of the various parishes and former municipal councils which amalgamated to form the present borough. The window are glazed with stained glass. As usual for halls of this type, a room, was also built below (the Princes room), not just for the economic advantage of using the same land footprint, but also to ensure that the room above could be held at a <b>reasonable</b> <b>temperature.</b> Otherwise the sudden increase in moisture from a large crowd of people would cause heavy condensation to form upon the chill floor. It is built onto the back of the town hall's municipal buildings. The wall facing the street are in the same Gothic style to match that of the town hall. It was named Victoria Hall to celebrate Queen Victoria's 1887 Golden Jubilee.It was officially opened on 15 December 1888 by Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). Adjoining town hall, {{it is part of the}} same Grade II listed structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{foremost}} {{provisions are}} those {{relating to the}} sanitary condition of the workplaces and the general security of every class of worker. Every factory must be kept in a cleanly condition, free from noxious effluvia, ventilated {{in such a manner}} as to render harmless, so far as practicable, gases, vapours, dust or other impurities generated in the manufacture; must be provided with sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences separate for the sexes; must not be overcrowded (not less than [...] during the day, 400 during overtime, for each worker). In these matters the law of public health takes in workshops the place of the Factory Act, the requirements being substantially the same. Although, however, primarily the officers of the district council enforce the sanitary provisions in workshops, the government factory inspectors may give notice of any defect in them to the district council in whose district they are situate; and if proceedings are not taken within one month by the latter, the factory inspector may act in default and recover expenses from the district council. This power does not extend to domestic workshops which are under the law relating to public health so far as general sanitation is concerned. General powers are reserved to the secretary of state, where he is satisfied that the Factory Act or law relating to public health as regards workplaces has not been carried out by any district council, to authorize a factory inspector during a period named in his order to act instead of the district council. Other general sanitary provisions administered by the government inspectors are the requirement in factories and workshops of washing conveniences where poisonous substances are used; adequate measures for securing and maintaining a <b>reasonable</b> <b>temperature</b> of such a kind as will not interfere with the purity of the air in each room in which any person is employed; maintenance of sufficient means of ventilation in every room in a factory or workshop (in conformity with such standard as may be prescribed by order of the secretary of state); provision of a fan to carry off injurious dust, gas or other impurity, and prevent their inhalation in any factory or workshop; drainage of floors where wet processes are carried on. For laundries and bakehouses there are further sanitary regulations; e.g. in laundries all stoves for heating irons shall be sufficiently separated from any ironing-room or ironing-table, and the floors shall be [...] " [...] drained in such a manner as will allow the water to flow off freely [...] "; and in bakehouses a cistern supplying water to a bakehouse must be quite separate from that supplying water to a water-closet, and the latter may not communicate directly with the bakehouse. Use of underground bakehouses (i.e. a baking room with floor more than 3 ft. below the ground adjoining) is prohibited, except where already used at the passing of the act; further, in these cases, after 1 January 1904, a certificate as to suitability in light, ventilation, &c., must be obtained from the district council. In other trades certified by the secretary of state further sanitary regulations may be made to increase security for health by special rules to be presently touched on. The secretary of state may also make sanitary requirements a condition of granting such exceptions to the general law as he is empowered to grant. In factories, as distinct from workshops, a periodical lime washing (or washing with hot water and soap where paint and varnish have been used) of all inside walls and ceilings once at least in every fourteen months is generally required (in bakehouses once in six months). As regards sufficiency and suitability of sanitary accommodation, the standards determined by order of the secretary of state shall be observed in the districts to which it is made applicable. An order was made called the Sanitary Accommodation Order, on 4 February 1903, the definitions and standards in which have also been widely adopted by local sanitary authorities in districts where the Order itself has no legal force, the local authority having parallel power under the Public Health Act of 1890.|$|E
