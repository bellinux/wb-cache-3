40|$|Intussusception {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{surgical}} emergencies in childhood although many patients will present initially to paediatricians. Imaging has a major role both in the diagnosis and management of this condition. Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel invaginates into an immediately adjacent segment, often likened to a telescope. The proximal, inner (inverting) seg-ment of bowel is called the intussusceptum, and the outer distal (<b>receiving)</b> <b>segment</b> the intussuscipiens. The intussusceptum is propagated distally by bowel peristalsis leading to compression and angulation of the mesenteric vessels which causes reduced perfusion, venous congestion and bowel wall oedema, leading to ischaemia and eventuall...|$|E

When developing a wireless communications system, it is useful to perform simulations of the radio context in which the system has to operate. A radio link is substantially composed by three parts: transmitting segment, transmission channel and <b>receiving</b> <b>segment.</b> We focus our attention on the radio channel propagation.

We have analyzed the congestion window size with different methods. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the congestion control algorithms implemented by TCP. The article presents a number of scenarios to examine these algorithms. We have tested the scenarios for FTP that transfers files of 1 MB and 10 MB sizes. The simulation results show the performance and effect of the file’s size.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in adaptive HTTP streaming of 3 GPP have {{paved the way}} to the development of media streaming over HTTP. The traditional HTTP streaming relies on a series of request <b>segments</b> and <b>receive</b> <b>segments</b> sequentially. In the current Internet media segments can be delivered through distributed networks. In such a scenario, the traditional series request-receive based adaptive HTTP streaming method is, however, unable to provide optimum streaming since the distributed networks resources are not fully utilized. In this paper, we present a novel parallel adaptive HTTP streaming method. Compared to the traditional series of adaptive HTTP streaming technique, our method a) enables the receiver to request multiple segments in parallel b) provides a solution to maintains a limited number of HTTP sessions for <b>receiving</b> <b>segments</b> in parallel and to determine when to start a new HTTP session to request the next segment c) can adapt media bitrates while <b>receiving</b> previously requested <b>segments.</b> Simulation results show that the proposed parallel adaptive HTTP streaming method outperforms the traditional series of adaptive HTTP streaming with respect to providing a higher playback media quality and decreasing the interruption frequency of media playing...|$|R

30|$|Further {{suppose that}} the TCP {{receiver}} <b>received</b> two <b>segments</b> with sequence numbers of N = 500 and N + 2560, {{which means that the}} four segments having sequence numbers between N = 500 and N + 2560 are missing. After <b>receiving</b> the <b>segment</b> N + 2560, the receiver will ask for the retransmission of the segment N + 512 in ACK. Thus, the receiver confirms that it has <b>received</b> the <b>segments</b> with sequence numbers less than N + 512. Although the receiver has also <b>received</b> the <b>segment</b> of sequence number N + 2560, it does not provide any information to the sender about this segment. In contrast, the SACK has an option that allows the TCP receiver to acknowledge that it has received non contiguous data segments. Thus, {{in the case of a}} lost segment(s), the sender can infer from the SACK which segment(s) has(have) been lost and should be retransmitted. In the above example, the SACK can indicate that segments with sequence numbers N = 500 and N + 2560 have been received. As a result, the sender will be able to infer that the segments between these two (i.e. segments of sequence numbers N + 512, N + 1024, N + 1536 and N + 2048) have been dropped.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{complexity}} of finding cost-optimal communication trees for rooted, irregular gather and scatter collective communication operations in fully connected, one-ported communication networks under a linear, but not necessarily homogeneous transmission cost model. In the irregular gather and scatter problems, different processors may specify data blocks of possibly different sizes. Processors are numbered consecutively, and data blocks shall be collected or distributed from some (given) root processor. Data blocks from and to processors can be combined into larger segments consisting of multiple blocks; but individual data blocks cannot be split. We distinguish between ordered and unordered problems and algorithms. In an ordered, irregular gather tree algorithm all non-leaf processors <b>receive</b> <b>segments</b> of data blocks for consecutively numbered ranges of processors. An unordered tree algorithm permits <b>received</b> <b>segments</b> to consist of blocks for processors in any order. We show that the ordered problems can be solved in polynomial time, and give simple dynamic programming algorithms to construct optimal communication trees for both gather and scatter problems. In contrast, we show that the unordered problems are NP-complete. We have implemented the dynamic programming algorithms to experimentally evaluate {{the quality of a}} recent, simple, distributed algorithm which constructs close to optimal trees. Our experiments show that it is indeed very close to the optimum for a selection of data block distributions, and likely sufficient for all practical purposes...|$|R

We propose a novel networking paradigm for the railway system. The architecture realizes spatial diversity and trans-parency to mobile devices. A link-layer design approach of the architecture, {{with the use of}} erasure coding, is investigated. Two general transmission schemes are proposed. In the information raining approach, all repeaters in the train vicinity blindly broadcast segments, and each vehicle antenna tunes to one of the repeaters in attempt to <b>receive</b> <b>segments.</b> In the second approach, we seek for the optimal transmission scheme, in terms of system throughput, by controlling power and matching between repeaters and antennas. Individually, power control and matching problem are both shown to be NP-complete; three matching and two power allocation heuristics are proposed. Simulations show that information raining is inferior to heuristics, particularly in interference-limited environment. ii Acknowledgement...|$|R

40|$|Streaming live video over {{peers in}} the Internet is gaining popu-larity since it has the {{advantage}} of reducing the load on the server and enable the server to perform other specialized services more effectively It also helps reduce the server bandwidth and is there-fore no more a limiting factor for the number of clients served. In this paper we propose a architecture for ’streaming stored video’ over peer-to-peer network. While a given peer continues to <b>receive</b> <b>segments</b> of the stream, simultaneously caching these segments lo-cally renders this peer to inturn act as a source for other peers. These peers are highly transient in nature and the exit of a peer from the network results in loss of video segments. We overcome this in our architecture by exploiting the inherent redundancy of FEC encoding of video streams. Through simulations we establish the novelty of our architecture and show that our proposed solu-tion incurs minimum overhead on the peers and does not increase the playback latency much more than the jitter buffer latency. ...|$|R
