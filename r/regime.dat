We consider equivalence across <b>regimes,</b> showing that monetary <b>regimes</b> are equivalent to {{one or both of}} two alternative types of social security <b>regimes.</b> Two implications emerge. One is that financing a real expenditure by increasing the inflation rate is equivalent, across <b>regimes,</b> to financing the expenditure by increasing the tax rate on social security benefits. In addition, our results imply that a wide range of monetary policy actions are equivalent, across <b>regimes,</b> to fiscal policy actions that change the scale of the social security system and the tax rates on social security benefits and/or bank deposits...|$|R

Although ultimately states create and sustain <b>regimes,</b> once institutionalized, <b>regimes</b> can exert influence in world politics that is practically independent of state sovereignty.

5|$|In the 19th century, the {{official}} view was increasingly questioned. The aristocratic Ancien <b>Régime</b> had been weakened severely during the Napoleonic Wars, when the Confederacy {{had been a}} French satellite state. The episode of the Helvetic Republic, short-lived as it had been, had instilled democratic ideals in the population. The restauration of the Ancien <b>Régime</b> {{after the end of}} the Napoleonic era proved to be only temporary, until Switzerland became a federal state in 1848 when its first democratic constitution was passed. During the restoration, democratic publishers instrumented and interpreted the history of the peasant war as an allegory on the then current struggle for democracy, seeing the peasant war of 1653 as an early precursor of their own efforts to overcome the authoritarian <b>regime.</b> Well-known examples are the illustrations by Martin Disteli from 1839/40, who used scenes from the peasant war in such allegoric ways.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{potential}} of the weather types classification method to study synoptic features, this study proposes the application of such methodology for the identification of the main large scale patterns related with weather in Central America. Using ERA Interim low-level winds in a domain that encompasses the intra-Americas sea, the eastern tropical Pacific, southern North America, Central America and northern South America; the K-means clustering algorithm was applied to find recurrent <b>regimes</b> of low-level winds. Eleven <b>regimes</b> were identified and good coherency between the results and known features of regional circulation was found. It was determined that the main large scale patterns can be either locally forced or a response to tropical-extratropical interactions. Moreover, the local forcing dominates the summer <b>regimes</b> whereas mid latitude interactions lead winter <b>regimes.</b> The study {{of the relationship between the}} large scale patterns and regional precipitation shows that winter <b>regimes</b> are related with the Caribbean-Pacific precipitation seesaw. Summer <b>regimes,</b> on the other hand, enhance the Caribbean-Pacific precipitation contrasting distribution as a function of the dominant <b>regimes.</b> A strong influence of ENSO on the frequency and duration of the <b>regimes</b> was found. It was determined that the specific effect of ENSO on the <b>regimes</b> depends on whether the circulation is locally forced or lead by the interaction between the tropics and the mid-latitudes. The study of the cold surges using the information of the identified <b>regimes</b> revealed that three <b>regimes</b> are linkable with the occurrence of cold surges that affect Central America and its precipitation. As the winter <b>regimes</b> are largely dependent of mid-latitude interaction with the tropics, the effect that ENSO has on the Jet Stream is reflected in the winter <b>regimes.</b> An automated analysis of large scale conditions based on reanalysis and/or model data seems useful for both dynamical studies and as a too...|$|R

We use {{the relationship between the}} de jure IMF classification and the de facto Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) classification as an indicator of the discrepancy between announced <b>regimes</b> and actual <b>regimes.</b> The main results are as follows: (1) countries with a “fear of announcing a peg” policy (i. e., the policy that countries actually adopt pegged <b>regimes</b> without actually claiming to have pegged <b>regimes)</b> have a significantly higher probability of currency crises than countries with consistent pegs (i. e., the policy that countries claim to have pegged <b>regimes</b> and actually adopt the announced pegged regimes);(2) countries with a “fear of pegging” policy(i. e., the situation in which countries actually adopt floating <b>regimes</b> but claim to have pegged <b>regimes)</b> have a significantly higher probability of currency crises than those with consistent pegs;(3) countries with consistent floats(i. e., the policy that countries claim to have floating <b>regimes</b> and actually adopt the announced floating <b>regimes)</b> have a significantly higher probability of currency crises than those with consistent pegs; and(4) countries with consistent pegs have the lowest statistically significant risk of currency crises as compared with other exchange rate policies. These results are robust {{to a wide variety of}} samples.
