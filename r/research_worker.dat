500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great <b>research</b> <b>worker</b> and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{purpose in}} the present study is to compare {{personality}} structure of women from four occupational groups (teachers, <b>research</b> <b>workers,</b> actresses and business women). Personality structure was measured using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory based on five-factor model of personality. Five-factor model illustrates that personality consists of five relatively independent dimensions (Neuroticism,Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), which provide a meaningful taxonomy for studying individual differences. We supposed that personality structure of women from various occupational groups would differ. We found following statistically significant differences between women. Businesswomen scored significantly lower on Neuroticism and higher on Extraversion in comparsion with <b>research</b> <b>workers,</b> actresses, and teachers. Teachers scored significantly higher on Extraversion in comparsion with <b>research</b> <b>workers.</b> Teachers scored significantly lower on Openness to experience in comparsion with actreses and <b>research</b> <b>workers.</b> No significant differences on Agreeableness were found between groups of women. Businesswomen scored significantly higher on Conscientiousness in comparsion with teachers...|$|R
