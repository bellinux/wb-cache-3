500|$|After {{the success}} of Parachutes, Coldplay {{returned}} to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, once again with Ken Nelson producing. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single {{because it was the}} track that made them want to record a second album, following a [...] "strange period of not <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> what we were doing" [...] three months after {{the success of}} Parachutes. According to Martin [...] "one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming." ...|$|E
500|$|England's next match pitted {{them against}} the United States—an {{opponent}} {{they were expected to}} easily overcome—at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, [...] inland. The selectors again picked Ramsey, but left star winger Stanley Matthews out on the grounds that England could beat the Americans without him, ignoring Winterbottom's protests. England dominated the first half. [...] "I'm not making excuses when I say that in the first 45 minutes we had a year's bad luck," [...] Ramsey wrote in 1952. [...] "Shots which appeared certain to score missed by the width of a coat of paint. The American goalkeeper, much to his astonishment, found himself stopping the ball with his body, and on occasions his face, without <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> what it was all about." [...] The US grabbed a shock lead on 37 minutes when a long shot towards England's penalty area flew into the net off the head of American forward Joe Gaetjens.|$|E

500|$|The band started {{recording}} the album in London {{a week after}} the September 11 attacks in the United States, during which their [...] "poignant songs ... garnered larger audiences". Coldplay had never stayed in London for an extended period before and were bombarded by problems focusing on the production process. They decided to relocate to Liverpool, where they had recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Lead singer Chris Martin said that once there they [...] "became obsessed with recording".

500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E

2500|$|After the war Clarissa Spencer-Churchill {{worked at}} London Films for the {{producer}} Sir Alexander Korda, who she thought made [...] "terrible mistakes without <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> what has happened", {{and as a}} reviewer for the fashion magazine Vogue. She met the actor Orson Welles, who became a dining companion, {{on the set of}} the film The Third Man (1949), and escorted actress Paulette Goddard, who played Mrs Cheverley in Korda's production of Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (1947), on a [...] "rather wild trip" [...] to Brussels. During the latter excursion Goddard expressed a wish to attend a pornographic show, but, although Korda's representatives made arrangements for this, she shied away when she and Clarissa, having climbed [...] "a flight of shabby stairs", were greeted by two men in black suits.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need to face the fact we live in a country where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 1965, David J. Miller {{burned his}} draft card {{at a rally}} held near the Armed Forces Induction Center on Whitehall Street in Manhattan. He spoke briefly to the crowd from atop a sound truck and then tried but failed to burn his card with matches—the wind kept blowing them out. A lighter was offered by the crowd and it worked. Miller was arrested by the FBI three days later in Manchester, New Hampshire while setting up peace {{literature}} on a table. The 24-year-old pacifist, member of the Catholic Worker Movement, became the first man convicted under the 1965 amendment. In April 1966 {{with his wife and}} breast-feeding baby in attendance, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. The case was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June. Miller's attorney held that [...] "symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible." [...] The court did not agree. The case was decided later that year in October: Miller's conviction was confirmed and his sentence upheld. Loudon Wainwright, Jr. wrote in Life magazine that Miller, [...] "without <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> it, might be embarking on a lifelong career of protest." [...] Miller remained free on bail until June 1968 at which time he served 22 months in federal prison.|$|E

5000|$|Critias' {{suggestion}} that sophrosyne is self-knowledge spurs Socrates {{to a discussion}} of the relation between medicine and science. He says that medicine is the science of health and disease, and that a person who does not understand these things is {{not in a position to}} distinguish a real physician from a quack (171c). He says that if wisdom <b>really</b> is <b>knowing</b> what you know and knowing what you don't know, no one would ever make a mistake, and we would pass through life without erring.

60|$|Poor Armine was {{not getting}} much comfort {{out of his}} friend, who was too much preoccupied to attend {{to what he was}} saying, and only {{mechanically}} assented at intervals to the proposition that it was an inscrutable dispensation that the will and the power should so seldom go together.

60|$|Wayland, without <b>really</b> <b>knowing</b> {{anything}} about it, suspected that he owed {{his life to}} her intervention, and this belief deepened the feeling of admiration which he had hitherto felt toward her.

[...] Her lead on the single verse in [...] "Train and the River" [...] comes as a revelation, since it best shows off the gorgeous tones in Linda's voice that drove her career to great heights in years to come - perhaps because Linda did not have to carry the whole song.

40|$|When {{the debate}} over whether to fund a human genome project flowered in the late 1980 s, one of the {{scientific}} arguments offered in opposition was that {{only a small part of}} the genome was <b>really</b> worth <b>knowing</b> — the 3 – 5 % that was then estimated to lie in and close to protein-coding regions 1, 2. The alternative approach to a genome project was molecular genetics as usual: first identify a region of the genome that is of functional interest, then target it for sequencing. Calls to continue this traditional model for dealing with genotyping were rapidly swept aside, and the Human Genome Project was realized in a few years. Over the past 15 years, many authors have proposed that phenomics — large-scale phenotyping — is the natural complement to genome sequencing as a rout...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} actions and {{influences}} that can undermine these efforts. Problems tend to revolve around existing social {{expectations for the}} 'devalued' person. Often society at large will anticipate that this person is not <b>really</b> worth <b>knowing,</b> and has little to offer - but {{that they might be}} helped through paid services or with the assistance of volunteers. Working in an environment where such expectations are the norm, it becomes easy for an organisations practice to drift towards fitting in with them. An organisation might instead find themselves creating relationships where the 'valued' person is seen to be (or sees themselves to be) a volunteer, at which point the activity has become a fundamentally different one. In this case the effects of the work may even be to add to the devaluation of the 'devalued' person (however effectively the 'volunteer' helps the individual with particular problems or issues in their life).|$|R

In contrast, tabular multiplication sequences in a combined multiplication table can, through appropriate teaching practices, enable the discovery of multiple relationships beyond multiplication or arithmetic, resulting in significant mathematics that spans the grade levels.
