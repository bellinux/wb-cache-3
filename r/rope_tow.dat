25|$|A stone cottage {{was built}} at Mount Hotham in 1925 to cater {{for a growing}} {{interest}} in sport of skiing and a Club was built in 1944 with the first ski tow installed in 1951. A ski hut was erected at Mount Baw Baw, just 120km East of Melbourne, in 1945 and a ski <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> added in 1955. The first ski lift went into service at Mount Buller in 1949, {{and in the same}} year a <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> was installed at Falls Creek. In 1957, Australia's first chairlift was installed at Falls Creek, and the area is today the largest ski resort in Victoria.|$|E
500|$|The alpine skiing {{events were}} split between Norefjell and Rødkleiva. The slalom courses were at Rødkleiva, {{located on the}} same {{mountain}} as Holmenkollen and Frognerseteren. The course had an elevation difference, from start to finish, of [...] and was [...] in length. [...] A <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> had to be built to bring the skiers from the bottom {{to the top of}} the hill. The downhill race and the giant slalom—which made its Olympic deput in 1952—were held at Norefjell, which was [...] from Oslo and the only venue located away from the capital city. [...] Work had to be done to make the area suitable for Olympic competition. A bridge across Lake Krøderen was built to help alleviate transportation congestion. A new hotel, two ski lifts, and a new road were also constructed.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the {{original}} Magic Mile began in mid-1938, {{a few months after}} Timberline Lodge opened for business with a portable <b>rope</b> <b>tow.</b> (The tow [...] remained in operation for at least several years.) The chairlift was the first built by the Riblet company, which drew heavily on its designs for aerial trams for mining companies.|$|E
5000|$|Surface lifts, {{including}} T-bars, magic carpets, and <b>rope</b> <b>tows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides, {{there are}} several surface lifts for beginners (<b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> and magic carpet).|$|R
5000|$|... 1977: Six {{chairs and}} four <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> operate. They are {{referenced}} by name instead of number.|$|R
2500|$|Skiing is {{a popular}} {{activity}} in the winter. The surrounding Chugach Mountains provide excellent back country ski slopes. The Mt. Eyak ski area operates a single chair ski lift and <b>rope</b> <b>tow.</b> It is the oldest working ski lift in North America. The heliskiing company Points North [...] operate out of Orca Adventure Lodge in Cordova. [...] Snowshoeing and ice skating are very popular sports around the Cordova area when conditions are right.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934 Jim and Pat Brewster leased {{the cabin}} from the CPR and began {{offering}} ski vacations. They bought the lodge in 1936. [...] In 1939 they hired Swiss guide Bruno Engler {{as the first}} ski instructor. In 1941 a <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> was built. [...] The Brewster's owned the area until 1951 when it was sold to George Encil, who also owned nearby Mt. Norquay. He added [...] "Village" [...] to the name and made numerous improvements including {{the addition of a}} [...] "Ski-Kuli" [...] lift.|$|E
2500|$|Ski fields up by Kosciuszko's {{side were}} also {{established}} during this period, though their existence is now little realised. The Australian Alpine Club {{was founded in}} 1950 by Charles Anton {{with a view to}} establishing a chain of lodges for ski touring across the Australian Alps. Huts were constructed in the [...] "Back Country" [...] close to Mount Kosciuszko, including Kunama Hut, which opened for the 1953 season. A <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> was installed on Mount Northcote at the site and opened in 1954. The site proved excellent for speed skiing, but the hut was destroyed in an avalanche, which also killed one person, in 1956.|$|E
50|$|Snow Valley {{was opened}} in 1961 {{by members of}} the Eskimo Ski Club. The {{original}} lodge was built in 1972 with two <b>rope</b> <b>tows.</b> In 1981 a T-bar replaced one of the <b>rope</b> <b>tows,</b> and limited snow making was added to extend the ski season. In 1988 a Triple chairlift was installed, along with expanded snow making capability. A significant amount of landfill was completed on the North Hill, where present-day terrain park is located.|$|R
25|$|Scattered {{throughout}} Tahoe {{are public}} and private sled parks. Some, such as Granlibakken are equipped with <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> to help sledders get up the hill.|$|R
50|$|Erewhon - The four <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> {{were removed}} {{and it is}} now run as a backcountry area {{accessible}} only via helicopter. Now called Mount Potts.|$|R
2500|$|The first Kosciuszko Chalet {{was built}} at Charlotte Pass in 1930, giving {{relatively}} comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain. In 1964, Australia briefly boasted the [...] "World's Longest Chairlift" [...] , designed to carry skiers from the Thredbo Valley to Charlotte Pass, but technical difficulties soon closed the facility. At 1760m, Charlotte Pass {{has the highest}} village base elevation of any Australia ski resort and can only be accessed via over-snow transport in winter. The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led {{to the establishment of}} a cafe at Smiggin Holes around 1939, where horse-drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to be begin the arduous ski to the Kosciusko Chalet. It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts. [...] The Construction of Guthega Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> was installed there in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the {{township}} remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing {{for over a}} century. The Kiandra courthouse closed as a police station in 1937, and was for a time used as a private residence, before becoming the Kiandra Chalet (until 1953) and later the Kiandra Chalet Hotel, The owner of the Chalet ran a ski <b>rope</b> <b>tow.</b> The Chalet closed in 1973 and the building became a Roads Depot building. Australia's first T-Bar was installed on Township Hill in 1957, but in 1978, Kiandra's ski lift operations re-located permanently to nearby Mount Selwyn (Selwyn Snowfields). Selwyn is the most northerly of Australia's ski resorts with a base elevation of 1492m and a top elevation of 1614m. Selwyn is well suited to families and first timers, with 88% of terrain catering to beginners and intermediates, however the steeper gradient of the Racecourse Run provides some more challenging terrain for advanced skiers and boarders. The longest run at Selwyn is the 800m [...] "Long Arm Run".|$|E
5000|$|The next {{improvement}} came in 1966, {{when a car}} chassis {{was modified}} to drive the <b>rope</b> <b>tow.</b> There is still a <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> located {{in the same spot}} but it has been upgraded numerous times over the years. The <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> works the current [...] "bunny hill" [...] and transports skiers from the main lift to the rental room and the other buildings.|$|E
50|$|Located 19 {{miles east}} of Chinook Pass, the ski area had a base {{elevation}} of 3,100 ft and a peak elevation of 3,600 ft above sea level serviced by two <b>rope</b> <b>tows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{beginner}} area, {{which has}} the easiest trails goes only {{about a quarter of}} the way up the hill, it is served by 3 <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> and four Sun-Kid conveyor belt lifts. The longest trail is 1400 feet.|$|R
50|$|The {{summit of}} McCauley Mountain {{is at an}} {{altitude}} of 2200 ft. The hill features a 633 ft vertical drop, 21 ski trails of between three and 5000 ft, two T-bar <b>tows,</b> two <b>rope</b> <b>tows,</b> and one double chairlift.|$|R
50|$|Bousquet {{was also}} the {{inventor}} of the <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> gripper which protected the arms and hands of skiers using <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> lifts. Bousquet marketed and subsequently sold 500,000 of his grippers. They were first to have night skiing.|$|E
50|$|The town {{operated}} a small ski area at JB Williams {{up until the}} 1970s. A <b>rope</b> <b>tow</b> run by an old jeep brought skiers {{to the top of}} one main trail and several smaller woods trails. Now overgrown with a narrow hiking trail running up the main slope, one can still see the old <b>rope</b> <b>tow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Crabbe has 1 Quad chair lift, 1 T-bar lifts and 1 <b>rope</b> <b>tow.</b>|$|E
50|$|Volunteers, generous donors, and fundraisers have, {{over the}} decades, {{provided}} {{improvements to the}} hill. <b>Rope</b> <b>tows,</b> snow making equipment, a Sno-Cat, snowmobiles, warming hut (with outdoor fire pit), hillside sound system, and a first aid station {{are now part of}} the hill. Recent additions include terrain features for a snowboard park. As of the end of 2010, the hill maintained 5 <b>tow</b> <b>ropes</b> and 7 groomed runs.|$|R
50|$|Catamount {{first opened}} for {{business}} in 1939 with three <b>rope</b> <b>tows.</b> Decades later, Bill Gilbert and Don Edwards took over management, purchasing Catamount in 1974.

5000|$|The {{ski area}} opened [...] in 1949 as Skyline, with two <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> and a warming hut. A Poma lift was {{installed}} in 1958, and another in 1960. The first chairlift (double) {{was installed in}} 1966 which opened steeper terrain, and the current day lodge was built in 1968.|$|R
50|$|On its {{northern}} side is an abandoned skifield. In 2005 the <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> were removed and {{shifted to the}} nearby Rainbow Ski Area. A lack of snow was cited {{as one of the}} reasons for removing the tows. At times a helicopter shuttle was used for access to the skifield.|$|R

50|$|The {{air flow}} into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest, so the frontmost <b>ropes</b> <b>tow</b> against the airflow. When gliding, however, the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow meets the parafoil head on. This makes it {{difficult}} to achieve an optimum gliding angle without the parafoil deflating.|$|R
50|$|John Jay (1915-2000) was a {{pioneering}} American ski filmmaker. He helped fashion the ski film into its modern form, and shared his unique style in travel adventure lectures, books, and magazine articles for over sixty years. Jay {{was an early}} promoter of skiing, and his films captured {{the growth of the}} sport from early <b>rope</b> <b>tows</b> to helicopter skiing.|$|R
50|$|After {{watching}} the 1948 Winter Olympic tryouts in nearby Sun Valley, Bob Frostenson and his friend, Harry Durall, decided they couldn’t turn {{their backs on}} the sport of skiing. That summer they raised $10,000, began work on a base lodge, and purchased two <b>rope</b> <b>tows,</b> the first powered by a 1938 Chevrolet engine. They cut timber, installed lifts, and built lodges by hand.|$|R
