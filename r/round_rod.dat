Because of limited volume of the furnace chamber special models for technological trials were designed and constructed to fit in the mould of dimensions 170 x 95 x 100 mm.

Horizontal <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> test was useful for evaluation of fluidity of hypoeutectic silumin, however in case of nickel superalloy the mould cavity was completely filled in each test because of high required pouring temperature.

50|$|Electric griddles are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface.

More than one element per linear foot is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a griddle plate of any given width. Electric griddles tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most electric griddle control systems.|$|E

40|$|The true {{shape of}} a double-helical {{geometry}} in a rope cross-section is needed {{for the design of}} ropes to predict the interstitial voids that need to be filled with water-blocking material. Commercially-available software such as AutoCAD, Inventor, Ideas, Mechanical Desktop, etc. are unable to develop this geometry. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop the parametric equations needed to produce scaled rope cross-section plots. Two fundamental mathematical tools are used to describe the cross-section of helical wire rods. The premier tool is the equation of the "Pencil of Spheres" where coordinates of the second helix centerline in a global coordinate system is found. To establish the centerline, coordinates of the helical path geometric transformations are developed. The equation of the "Pencil of Spheres" for the second helix is then intersected with a plane perpendicular to the rope axis. This results in the true shape of the helical <b>round</b> <b>rods.</b> The objective of this research is to derive a mathematical model that describes the exact geometry of double-helical <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> in a plane perpendicular to the rope axis.

40|$|Modulation of the {{voltages}} {{applied to}} a quadrupole mass filter (QMF), either RF or RF and DC, leads to splitting of the stability region into islands of stability. The ion optical properties, such as transmission, resolving power and peak tails of the first upper stability islands have been investigated by numerical simulation of ion trajectories. The dependence of the location of this island on the amplitude of the modulation and the parameter ν = ω/Ω = Q/P where ω is modulation frequency, Ω is main angular radio frequency, and Q and P are integers, is calculated in detail. Different methods of adjusting the QMF resolution are examined. It is found that operation at {{the upper and lower}} tips of the stability islands created by amplitude modulation of the RF voltage is preferred, because of the technical simplicity of this method and a reduction of the required separation time. Amplitude modulation improves the performance of a QMF constructed with <b>round</b> <b>rods,</b> in comparison to perfect quadrupole fields. For example, with amplitude modulation of the RF, to reach a resolution of R 0. 1 = 1200 requires only about 75 RF cycles of ion motion in a quadrupole field created by <b>round</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|R
