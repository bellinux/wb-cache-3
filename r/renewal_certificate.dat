This qualitative dissertation investigated first-hand experiences of nine tenured teachers, from one elementary school district in northern Illinois, engaged in the mandated Illinois teacher <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> process. The study was designed to explore the perceptions of their professional growth as related to impact on their teaching practices and affecting student achievement. Teachers shared their experiences and perceptions of the recertification process through respondent profiles, individual in-depth interviews, focus group interviews, and reflective statements. Data was collected from May 2002 through January 2003. Analysis of the data revealed three common themes: (1) the mandated teacher <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> process provided a uniform framework for teacher professional development; (2) the process afforded the teachers the opportunity to establish focus and ownership of their professional development plan; and (3) the <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> process created minimal impact on their day-to-day teaching activities. Consistent with the research on professional growth and development, these teachers asserted that successful professional development must support day-to-day teaching practices. They concurred that "theory based" coursework had little or no impact on their daily teaching practices. Instead they perceived the need for professional development to be job embedded, envisioning themselves as engaged learners, to broaden their repertoire of methods of teaching to ensure effective student learning. This study suggests that the mandated Illinois <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> process has the potential for overall positive effects, as it encourages teachers to keep up with current trends in education and discourages complacency. However, for the teachers in this study, the mandated recertification plan lacked measurable impact on student learning. The fundamental goal of the mandated Illinois <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> plan should encompass participation in continued professional development opportunities that are job embedded, sustained, more in-depth, and ultimately enhance student learning...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION OF Nancy Negley Brodbeck, for the Doctor of Philosophy {{degree in}} Educational Administration, {{presented}} on (DATE) at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: TEACHER RECERTIFICATION: A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ILLINOIS PROCESS MAJOR PROFESSORS: Brad Colwell, Ph. D., J. D. and Patrick Dilley, Ph. D. License renewal and recertification {{have long been}} standard practice in service professions. Ten years ago, a new law called for policy revision and mandated that Illinois teachers acquire continuing professional development to maintain certification. This study provides a historical perspective of the Illinois teacher recertification process, exploring its genesis and its metamorphosis. The nine stakeholders interviewed in this study represent different levels of responsibility in state education agencies, ranging from state to local level involvements. An online search {{of each of the}} fifty states 2 ̆ 7 department of education websites yielded certification information or contact information to state certification divisions. Each state 2 ̆ 7 s <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> requirements were secured and printed, and when not available online, were solicited through telephone contact and received by mail. A review of literature led to the comparison of <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> to that of other professional relicensure practices. The American Medical Association and the American Bar Association were researched to determine what types of continuing education are required to maintain licensure in the fields of medicine and law. Telephone interviews were conducted with nine people, six of whom helped design and write the Illinois <b>Certificate</b> <b>Renewal</b> Manual (2000). The other three interviews were conducted with representatives of those responsible for implementing and overseeing the teacher recertification process at the regional and local levels. Study participants were selected from urban, suburban, and rural areas from northern, southern, and central Illinois. Two dominant themes emerged from the interviews. First, the initial recertification plan was time consuming. Teachers were spending considerable time with paperwork, which took time away from instructional preparation. Second, the process was labor intensive, involving layers of increased bureaucracy, reporting, and record keeping. The research completed in this study confirms the need for change to the initial recertification process that occurred in 2004. While these changes were viewed positively by teachers and the state agencies responsible for monitoring the process, they lessened the connection between classroom instruction and relevant professional development activities. Implications for administrative roles in teacher recertification are noted, and recommendations for a best practice model of teacher recertification are suggested...|$|R

30|$|Based on {{the advice}} of several {{education}} councils in the Cabinet and the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education began to reform teacher and children’s education continuously from the 1980 s. These reforms were also a response to changes in society, children’s social environments, and the conditions of children’s education. These measures can be summarized as follows: (1) enhanced professional studies in teacher education programs; (2) new post-graduate courses with reorganized master courses offered at Type A institutions; and (3) a teacher <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> system. These measures addressed virtually every aspect of teacher education and teacher certificates. Tables 1 and 2 show the pre-service teacher education curriculum of professional studies required by the Ministry of Education, focusing on secondary school science teachers (not elementary school teachers). The elementary school teacher is known as a homeroom teacher in Japan and instructs students in all subjects (such as science, mathematics, and home economics). Therefore, in pre-service teacher education, prospective teachers who become elementary school teachers must acquire content/subject matter knowledge and teaching methods for every elementary school subject, while secondary school science teachers need to only study science.|$|R

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} {{are a new}} paradigm of wireless communication for mobile hosts. Hosts are always represented as different nodes in the mobile ad hoc networks. There {{are a lot of}} differences between mobile ad hoc networks and traditional networks. We have studied the characteristics of ad hoc networks and pointed out the importance of its security. The main challenge in the design of mobile ad hoc networks is their vulnerability to security attacks. Like many distributed systems, security in ad hoc networks widely relies on the use of key management mechanisms. Specific key management systems have to be developed to suit the characteristics of mobile ad hoc networks because traditional key management systems are not appropriate for them. In this presentation, we propose an authentication services that combined with the concept of trust level. In our trust model, we assumed that each node has a trust value to its neighbouring nodes. This value is used on <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal</b> and it can be combined on a trust path.

40|$|ABSTRACTCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Only a {{few studies}} have focused on the main reasons for {{consultations}} at primary healthcare units within the Family Health Program. The aim here was to describe the reasons that led patients to seek assistance at four primary healthcare units in the city of Recife, Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study at primary healthcare units in the city of Recife. METHODS: Among adult patients who were consecutively attended at four primary healthcare units in the city of Recife, their two main reasons for going there were recorded by medical students. The students did not interfere in the consultation dynamics. The data were gathered between September 2010 and March 2011 and between November 2012 and August 2013. The reasons for the consultations were grouped into broader categories in accordance with the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC- 2). RESULTS: 478 patients were included. Their mean age was 45. 9 years (± 16 years) and 71 % were female. Pain was the main reason for seeking medical attention (34 %), followed by evaluation of tests, prescription <b>renewal</b> and medical <b>certificates</b> (17. 6 %). The most frequent types of pain were musculoskeletal pain (15. 7 %), headache (10. 4 %) and abdominal pain (8 %). The main reasons for consultation according to ICPC- 2 were in the general and nonspecific, musculoskeletal, nervous system-related and digestive tract categories. CONCLUSION:Pain was the most frequent reason for seeking medical attendance at these primary healthcare units...|$|R
40|$|The Grid {{computing}} {{paradigm is}} becoming a well established method for high performance computing. While {{the first generation of}} Grid computing solutions implemented their own proprietary interfaces, the introduction of the service-oriented computing paradigm and the corresponding web service standards into the field of Grid computing through the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) increased the interoperability of the Grid. This paved the way for a number of national and international Grid projects, which now host a large number of academic {{and a growing number of}} business applications requiring on-demand provisioning and use of Grid resources. In an on-demand Grid environment, Grid users and applications change frequently, and the value of software and data is much higher than in traditional Grid environments with academic open source applications. To facilitate on-demand Grid computing, it is essential that users are able to install and use their applications autonomously in a timely and secure fashion, even though the software may contain third party components and requires root privileges to install. This would also enable the Grid to act as a base technology for the new Cloud computing paradigm, in which similar on-demand business constraints are present. Consequently, there are much higher demands for both administrative measures and security mechanisms to enable on-demand Grid computing. Like most complex IT systems, Grid middlewares exhibit a number of security problems which are further compounded by the new on-demand Grid usage scenario. Not only do these security problems expose the heterogeneous Grid resources to a homogeneous attack vector, but they also threaten existing cluster resources and their users, who up till now have worked in a local and secure environment. Furthermore, in an on-demand Grid scenario, cluster administrators are exposed to a large number of unknown users with a great variety of usage patterns. This makes the detection of malicious behavior an extremely complex task. As a consequence, Grids are increasingly becoming an attractive target for attackers, since they offer standardised access to a large number of machines storing potentially valuable data which can be misused in various ways. For example, the considerable computing power of clusters exposed via the Grid could be misused to break passwords, and their large storage capacity could be misappropriated to store and share illegal software and data. The generous bandwidth of the Internet connection can be used for launching Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or for hosting file-sharing services. However, far more critical than these resource attacks are attacks against customer data: crash test model data of a new prototype car, a custom fluid simulation suite or customer billing data all represent intellectual property of considerable monetary value and need to be protected. If a Grid resource provider cannot ensure the end-to-end integrity and safety of customer software and data, an industrial adoption of Grid technology will not be possible. However, at the same time, easy to use administration capabilities must exist to enable on-demand installation and usage of custom applications. These are usually diametrically opposite requirements, and careful balancing is required to satisfy both requirements. This thesis presents novel security and usability approaches for service-oriented on-demand Grid computing. They enable users to install and use custom software autonomously (both service-oriented and traditional) on shared computer systems on demand, while at the same time they protect software, data and business process information from other Grid users and external attackers. The core solution proposed in this thesis is based on operating system virtualisation to offer dynamic virtual image creation and deployment in a secure environment. An automated dynamic firewall mechanism provides a user based network security setup and creates secure user network regions on demand. In addition, the Grid environment is separated into several zones to protect local cluster resources from illegal access of Grid users. The Grid headnode and the image creation station are both confined to separate compartments in a Grid demilitarised zone. To enable the secure integration of this Grid environment into existing business workflows, an extension to the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) and workflow execution engine is presented which allows the execution of secure Grid services in combination with existing business web services. The workflow engine handles the issues of proxy certificate creation transparently and, in the case of long running applications, <b>certificate</b> <b>renewal.</b> The approach allows both fine-grained service-oriented applications and legacy Grid applications to run in the same environment by integrating the Grid sandboxing system into existing cluster scheduling solutions. Furthermore, a novel server rotation mechanism is introduced to protect the Grid headnode from unknown stealth attacks by refreshing the headnode transparently using virtualised images. This reduces the time an attacker can operate in the system to no more than a few minutes. In addition to these attack prevention mechanisms, a novel intrusion detection system using a streaming database system is presented to detect attacks, which could not be prevented. Since developing service-oriented applications for a Grid environment is a complex and error prone task, the final contribution of this thesis is a design for an automated, model driven development process for secure Grid services. An implementation of the new Grid environment based on the Globus Toolkit 4, the Sun Grid Engine and the ActiveBPEL Engine is presented. The model driven development concepts are implemented in Eclipse for the Globus Tookit 4. Experimental results and an evaluation of the critical components of the new Grid setup are presented. The proposed security mechanisms are intended to promote the next phase in the evolution of Grid computing and to enable the Grid to act as a secure basis for the business-oriented Cloud computing endeavor...|$|R
