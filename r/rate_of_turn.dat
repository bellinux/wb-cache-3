25|$|AVAir Flight 3378 {{took off}} from Raleigh–Durham International Airport at 21:25 local time and climbed to a height of 300 feet. Shortly after, the last {{transmission}} from the aircraft to the air traffic control was heard. The aircraft maintained an appropriate climb speed but at an excessive <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn,</b> 40 to 45 degrees; a standard turn rate would have been 22 degrees. Due to the turn, the plane started to descend. The aircraft then struck {{the water in a}} reservoir 100 feet from the shoreline, at a point 5100 feet west of runway 23R. The wreckage then continued onto land and into a forest. Some post-crash fires also were seen at the crash site, but were quickly extinguished.|$|E
25|$|A {{licensed}} {{pilot and}} President of the British Light Aviation Centre, Prince William owned several aircraft and competed in amateur air show races. In August 1972, he was {{competing in the}} Goodyear International Air Trophy at Halfpenny Green, near Wolverhampton, with Vyrell Mitchell—a pilot with whom the prince had often raced—listed as a passenger. Shortly after their takeoff and at a very low altitude, the Piper Cherokee banked abruptly to port, with an extreme increase in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> and corresponding loss of altitude; the wing hit a tree and sheared off, and the out-of-control plane flipped over and crashed into an earthen bank, bursting into flames. Prince William and Mitchell were killed. The crash happened before 30,000 spectators, the fire took two hours to control, and the bodies were identified at inquest the next day from dental records.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the ancient}} {{descriptions}} suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might {{have been used to}} fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was {{on the outside of the}} curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn.</b> The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we give a {{complete}} {{proof of a}} theorem, which states that `for a weak shock, the shock ray velocity {{is equal to the}} mean of the ray velocities of nonlinear wavefronts just ahead and just behind the shock, provided we take the wavefronts ahead and behind to be instantaneously coincident with the shock front. Similarly, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> the shock front is also equal to the mean <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> such wavefronts just ahead and just behind the shock'.

[...] "I don't think I have ever flown a fighter that could match the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turn</b> of the Zero. The Zero had ruled the roost totally and was the finest fighter in the world until mid-1943." [...] American test pilots found that the Zero's controls were [...] "very light" [...] at , but stiffened at faster speeds (above 348km/h, or 216mph) to safeguard against wing failure. The Zero could {{not keep up with}} Allied aircraft in high-speed maneuvers, and its low [...] "never exceed speed" [...] (VNE) made it vulnerable in a dive. While stable on the ground despite its light weight, the aircraft was designed purely for the attack role, emphasizing long range, maneuverability, and firepower at the expense of protection of its pilot. Most lacked self-sealing tanks and armor plating.|$|E

40|$|SummaryG-protein-mediated {{signaling}} {{is intrinsically}} kinetic. Signal output at steady {{state is a}} balance <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> GTP binding, which causes activation, and of GTP hydrolysis, which terminates activation. This GTPase catalytic cycle is regulated by receptors, which accelerate GTP binding, and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which accelerate hydrolysis. Receptors and GAPs similarly control the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> signal initiation and termination. To allow independent control of signal amplitude and <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> the signal on and off, the activities of receptors and GAPs must be coordinated.

40|$|Every {{manufacturing}} unit {{wants to}} maximize its production rate because production rate directly affects the profit {{and the growth}} of the manufacturing unit. There are many approaches for achieving the same, some of the methods are experimental and some are based on very lengthy and time consuming statistical techniques.

In this research paper, a geometric programming based approach to maximize the production <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>turning</b> process within in some operating constraints is proposed. It is achieved by taking production time as the objective function of the optimization problem and then minimizing the same.

30|$|The {{previous}} study by Warren et al. [68] {{shows that in}} the case of impassable obstacles, the pedestrian makes gradual turns when walking in the environment by changing his heading direction over several steps rather than abrupt switching direction. Furthermore, they found that pedestrians do not walk in a continuous arc to the destination but turn onto a linear segment that aligns the heading direction with the destination. They also stated that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>turning</b> is dependent on both the distance to the destination or the obstacle and its respective angle with respect to the heading direction.

30|$|Now, If we try {{to place}} each VM from the {{redesigned}} VM migration list(after clustering) on a host from hostlist, where the increase of power consumption is maximum, then VMs will occupy the hosts where available power would be minimum and turn on as much host as they can at the very beginning.
