50|$|The main {{advantage}} of a fixed target experiment is the large acceptance. Due to the Lorentz boost, most of the final states and the scattered particles are created along the beam axis.

5000|$|Since {{the neutron}} is not charged {{it does not}} {{interact}} via the Coulomb force and therefore does not ionize the scintillation material. It must first transfer {{some or all of}} its energy via the strong force to a charged atomic nucleus. The positively charged nucleus then produces ionization. Fast neutrons (generally >0.5 MeV [...] ) primarily rely on the <b>recoil</b> <b>proton</b> in (n,p) reactions; materials rich in hydrogen, e.g. plastic scintillators, are therefore best suited for their detection. Slow neutrons rely on nuclear reactions such as the (n,γ) or (n,α) reactions, to produce ionization. Their mean free path is therefore quite large unless the scintillator material contains nuclides having a high cross section for these nuclear reactions such as 6Li or 10B. Materials such as LiI(Eu) or glass silicates are therefore particularly well-suited for the detection of slow (thermal) neutrons.|$|E

The photoproduction of neutral [pi] mesons from hydrogen {{has been studied}} at the California Institute of Technology Synchrotron Laboratory by detecting <b>recoil</b> <b>protons</b> from a liquid hydrogen target irradiated by the synchrotron bremsstrahlung beam. The <b>recoil</b> <b>protons</b> were detected by a five counter telescope which comprised a standard three scintillation counter range telescope plus an additional dE/dx counter for more positive identification of the proton and a Cerenkov counter in anticoincidence to eliminate events due to multiple electrons. The effect of <b>recoil</b> <b>protons</b> from pion pair production was reduced by lowering the bremsstrahlung endpoint energy to about 100 mev above that of the photons producing the desired events. Even so, contamination was significant at forward proton angles and correction for this effect was necessary.
