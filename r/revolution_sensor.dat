40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the experimental development of once per <b>revolution</b> <b>sensor</b> chatter. In milling operation, self excited vibrations also called the chatter {{are one of the}} main factors that limit productivity. The project is used sensor chatter and non-sensor chatter to measure the variance of the signal sampled at a once per revolution rate. The sensor chatter {{is one of the main}} factors that lower the productivity. Higher efforts tend to accelerate tool wear and can lead to tool breakage. This project used the accelerometer to measures vibration and proper acceleration. The mounting of an accelerometer is easy but it is location must be carefully chosen. Indeed, if the sensor is close to a vibration node, signal amplitude would be very low. It is very difficult to put accelerometer on a rotating part. Beside that, the sensor tachometer (RPM gauge) is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a tool milling machine. The device usually displays the revolutions per minute (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but for this project the software of DasyLab that used can convert to revolution per second (RPS). A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and it is inverse. The result means the FFT operation, periodic functions will include changing the peak is not one, but two places. However, both these components are symmetric, so it was only necessary to see one to obtain frequency information. And providing information about the frequency, the FFT can be used to apply signal processing techniques such as filtering the signal and image compression is much easier to implement in the frequency domain. Detection of chatter, non-chatter and marginal chatter clearly can see in accelerometer, FFT and once per revolution signal. According to the results of machining experiment, it was proven that different parameter like spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut producing chatter vibration...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} of turbomachinery blades is {{an important}} phenomenon to understand, observe and predict and {{is the reason for}} developing a tip timing measurement system. Vibration leads to High Cycle Fatigue (HCF), which limits blade durability and life. HCF can result in blade failure, having expensive consequences for the engine involved. The traditional method for monitoring blade vibration under test conditions is to use blade mounted strain gauges. However, strain gauges are costly and time consuming to install. They have a limited operating life as they are subjected to the harsh on-engine conditions. Only a limited number of blades can be monitored with strain gauges as the number that can be used is limited by the number of channels in the slip ring or telemetry. They can also interfere with the assembly aerodynamics. Consequently non-intrusive alternative techniques such as tip timing are sought. Capacitance probe based clearance measurement systems see widespread use in turbomachinery applications to establish rotor blade tip clearance. This thesis reports investigations into an alternative and additional use in aero-engine rotor blade tip timing measurement for these commercially available systems. Tip clearance is of great importance in the gas turbine industry; this is clear from the fact that gas turbine efficiency has an inverse relationship with tip clearance. Large tip clearance leads to large leakage flows, hence low efficiency, thus the common use of the capacitance probe clearance measurement technique in monitoring turbomachinery. Optical systems have been successfully used to measure rotor blade tip timing on test rigs with several optical probes mounted equally spaced around the turbomachine casing. However, there are practical problems associated with mounting such monitoring systems on in-service jet engines. Optical probes require high maintenance to keep the lenses clean, probably incorporating a purge air system to keep the lenses from fouling. Such impracticalities and added weight make it unlikely that an optical probe based tip timing system will be fitted on an in-service engine in the foreseeable future. In this thesis the scope for a dual use sensor to measure both turbomachinery tip clearance and tip timing is investigated. Since it is impractical to measure blade tip clearance with an optical probe, then the obvious choice for such a sensor is a capacitance probe. Therefore, a commercially available FM capacitance probe based blade tip clearance measurement system is used in a series of tip timing practical investigations. The equipment and instrumentation designed, assembled and produced to facilitate this investigation is documented. These include the development of an optical once per <b>revolution</b> <b>sensor</b> and the design of an independent vibration measurement system based on blade mounted strain gauges. Through an extensive body of experimental work the practicalities in this alternate use of the tip clearance measurement equipment have been assessed. System responses pertaining to tip timing measurement have been investigated, characterised and quantified. The accuracy by which tip timing can be measured using the system has been reported through the findings of an experimental programme carried out on a full-sized, low-speed compressor. Specifically, dual capacitance probe tip timing derived vibration amplitudes have been compared to those derived from blade mounted strain gauge signals. Sources of error have been identified and quantified. Amplitudes were found to agree within the calculated error bands. Instantaneous resonant blade vibrations measured through single capacitance probe tip timing have been correlated with strain gauge derived vibration levels. This has also been done as the rotor traverses blade resonant speed. In this case the vibration phase change across resonance expected from theory was successfully detected through tip timing. Also, the accuracy by which blade time of arrival can be determined by using capacitance probe tip timing has been assessed using a precision OPR sensor and a non-vibrating compressor rotor blade. The characteristics of a DC capacitance probe based clearance measurement system's response to movement in 3 D space in proximity to a blade tip have been mapped. Detection of small vibrations have also been investigated in a series of static impulse tests. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{increasing}} research interest in structural health monitoring (SHM). Among the many advances in SHM research, “smart” wireless sensors capable of embedded computing and wireless communication have been highly attractive. Wireless communication in SHM systems was originally proposed to significantly reduce the monetary and time cost for installing lengthy cables in an SHM system. Besides wireless sensing, the next <b>revolution</b> in <b>sensor</b> networks has been predicted to be mobile sensor networks that implant mobility into traditional wireless sensor networks. This research explores decentralized structural model updating and damage detection using mobile and wireless sensors. In {{the first stage of}} this research, mobile sensing nodes (MSNs) are developed for SHM purposes. The MSNs can maneuver upon structures built with ferromagnetic/steel materials, conduct measurement, and communicate with pears or remote servers wirelessly. The performance of the MSNs is validated through laboratory and field experiments. To further investigate the mobile sensing strategy, a decentralized structural damage detection procedure is proposed herein for the MSNs using transmissibility functions. Laboratory experiments are conducted on a steel portal frame where various structure damage scenarios are emulated. Besides experiments with MSNs, this study also investigates the nature of transmissibility functions for damage detection in an analytical manner based on a general multi-DOF spring-mass-damper system. Finally, this research also explores substructure model updating through minimization of modal dynamic residuals, which can best benefit from dense mobile or wireless sensor data concentrated in one area. Craig-Bampton transform is adopted to condense the structural model, and minimization of the modal dynamic residuals is determined as the optimization objective. An iterative linearization procedure is adopted for efficiently solving the optimization problem. The presented substructure updating method is validated through a few numerical examples. For comparison, a conventional approach minimizing modal property differences is also applied, and shows worse updating accuracy than the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed substructure model updating approach is further investigated on the effects of substructure location and size. Ph. D...|$|R

The sun is used as an inertial reference to measure the pitching and yawing motions of the projectile. An FM telemetry package transmits the sensor data to a ground receiving station for analysis. The standard yawsonde package is housed in an M 577 -type artillery fuse body. The spinning motion of the projectile serves as the sampling rate for the measurements. When the spin rate is not significantly higher than the yaw rate, multiple sets of sensors must be used to effectively increase the sampling rate. The pinhole yawsonde sensor was developed for projectiles that require multiple sets of sensors in a very limited space.

40|$|The huge {{advances}} in communication technologies and Micro Electrical and Mechanical Systems (MEMS) have triggered a <b>revolution</b> in <b>sensor</b> networks. One major application of sensor networks {{is in the}} investigation of complex and uninhabited under water surfaces; such sensor networks are called the Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN). UWSN comprises of a number of sensors which are submerged in water and one or several surface stations or a sinks at which the sensed data is collected. In some underwater sensor applications, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) could be used. The underwater sensor nodes communicate with each other using acoustic signals. Applications for this type of networks include oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration and tactical surveillance applications. The novel networking paradigm of UWSN is facing a totally different operating environment than the ground based wireless sensor networks. This introduces new challenges such as huge propagation delays, and limited acoustic link capacity with high attenuation factors. These new challenges have their own impact on the design of most of the networking layers preventing researchers from using the same layers used for other networks. The most affected layers are the Physical, Medium Access Control (MAC), Routing and Transport layers. This work will introduce novel routing and MAC layers’ protocols for UWSNs. The routing protocol will adopt the minimum spanning tree algorithm and focus on maximizing the connectivity of the network, which means maximizing the total number of nodes connected to the root or the sink in this case. The protocol will try also to provide a minimum hop connection for all the nodes in the network taking into account the residual energy, location information and number of children at the next hop node. The other contribution of this work is a MAC Protocol which will incorporate the topology information provided by the routing protocol to minimize the collisions and energy wastage in data transmission. The MAC Protocol will also try to shorten the queuing delays at the intermediate nodes for a message traveling from source to the sink. A comparison will be conducted with other existing routing and MAC protocols. The routing protocol will be tested and compared with the E-Span spanning tree algorithm for data aggregation.
