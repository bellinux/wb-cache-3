In order {{to calculate the}} recoverability of free gold particles, a laboratory scale of knelson concentrator was used. Different experiments were carried out to determine the behaviour of gold particles using Casa Berardi and Snip and Hemlo samples, {{and it has been}} observed that due to grinding, gold particles report to coarser and finer size classes. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> free gold particles into coarser size classes, especially and mostly to one adjacent coarser size class, is flattening. Of course folding of free gold particles {{could be one of the}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> them to finer size classes. In addition, broken free gold particles report to finer size classes, and therefore folding and breakage of gold particles are both conducive to reporting into the finer size classes. We attempted to recover the ground free gold particles using a knelson concentrator to distinguish recoverability of flattened and folded and broken gold particles and total recovery for Casa Berardi and Snip and Hemlo were 92 - 100 %, 91 - 99 %, and 89 - 99 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|People report {{suggested}} misinformation about {{a previously}} witnessed event for manifold reasons, {{such as social}} pressure, lack of memory of the original aspect, or a firm belief to remember the misinformation from the witnessed event. In our experiments (N = 429), which follow Loftus's paradigm, we tried to disentangle the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> a central and a peripheral piece of misinformation in a recognition task by examining (a) the impact a warning about possible misinformation has on the error rate, and (b) whether once reported misinformation was actually attributed to the witnessed event in a later source-monitoring (SM) task. Overall, a misinformation effect was found for both items. The warning strongly reduced the misinformation effect, but only for the central item. In contrast, reports of the peripheral misinformation were correctly attributed to the misinformation source or, at least, ascribed to guesswork much more often than the central ones. As a consequence, after the SM task, the initially higher error rate for the peripheral item was even {{lower than that of}} the central item. Results convincingly show that the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> misinformation, and correspondingly also the potential to avoid them in legal settings, depend on the centrality of the misinformation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E
40|$|Prescription drug {{insurance}} and unmet need for health care: a cross‐sectional analysis Gi lli an E H anley Background: Despite Canada’s universal health insurance coverage, many Canadians still report an unmet need for health care. I investigated whether not having prescription drug insurance {{increases the likelihood}} of reporting an unmet need for health care. I hypothesized that people without prescription drug insurance would be more likely than those with insurance to report an unmet health care need. Methods: I included 31 630 people in Ontario 64 years of age or younger who had participated in the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 3. 1. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to obtain an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association between having prescription drug {{insurance and}} reporting an unmet need for health care in the past 12 months, adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, health status and having a regular medical doctor. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> an unmet need for care were stratified into reasons related or not related to prescription drug insurance. Three separate multivariate logistic regressions were performed to obtain an adjusted OR for the association between prescription drug insurance and unmet need based on the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> unmet need...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that it is common for women to report inconsistent fertility motivations and family planning behaviors. This study examines these inconsistencies among urban Honduran women interviewed at two points in time and presents reasons for inconsistent fertility motivations and contraceptive behaviors at follow-up. Methods Data come from a one-year panel study conducted in Honduras from October 2006 to December 2007. A total of 633 women aged 15 - 44 years were interviewed at baseline and follow-up and have non-missing information on the key variables of interest. At baseline and follow-up, women were asked how much of a problem it would be (no problem/small problem/big problem) if they got pregnant {{in the next couple of}} weeks. At follow-up, women were asked an open-ended question on reasons it would be no problem, a small problem, or a big problem. The open-ended question was recoded into a smaller set of response categories. Univariate and bivariate analyses are presented to examine inconsistencies and reasons for stated inconsistencies. Results At follow-up, over half the women using a contraceptive method said that it would be no problem if they got pregnant. Nearly half of the women changed their perceptions between baseline and follow-up. Common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> no problem among contraceptive users were that they accepted a child as God's will or that children are a blessing, their last child was old enough and they wanted another child. Common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> a big/small problem among non-users of family planning (who have an unmet need for family planning) were that they were not in a stable relationship, the husband was not present, and they would expect a negative response from their family. Conclusion Inconsistent fertility motivations and contraceptive behaviors are common among effective contraceptive users. Women who are using contraception and become pregnant will not necessarily report the pregnancy as unintended, given the widespread acceptance of unintended pregnancies in Honduras. Family planning providers need to recognize that fertility motivations vary over time and that women may not have firm motivations to avoid a pregnancy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background / aim: Using {{reliable}} {{outcome measures}} {{is a necessity}} for the occupational therapy profession in enabling valid assessments of clients. Although Cronbach’s alpha is the most widely applied index of internal consistency reliability, there are misconceptions about its use and interpretation. This paper aims to guide assessment developers in paediatric occupational therapy, as well as practitioners who are evaluating outcome measures in using and interpreting the Cronbach’s alpha estimates appropriately. This {{will enable them to}} decide on the tools’ clinical value and incorporate them into their practice with children. Method: Previously published papers reporting on internal consistency issues of outcome measures in paediatric occupational therapy were searched through the Allied and Complementary Medicine database. These papers were used as a basis to discuss possible <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> of low internal consistency. Results: The analysis demonstrates that Cronbach’s alpha reports are not always interpreted in a sound way. The paper emphasises that one should be cautious about judging estimates of internal consistency. Low size of the coefficient alpha might not always indicate problems with the construction of the tool; whereas large sizes do not always suggest adequate reliability. Instead, these reports might be related to the data characteristics of the construct. Conclusion: In judging an outcome measure’s internal consistency, researchers and practitioners in occupational therapy should report and consider the nature of data, the scale’s length and width, the linearity and the normality of response distribution, the central response tendency, the sample response variability and the sample size...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{is celebrating}} {{the first anniversary}} of {{experimental}} disease-based price indexes, which adjust expenditures on disease for inflation. Statistical agencies have long collected price information on medical procedures, drugs, equipment, and services, but the cost of treating a patient is typically some combination of these goods and services. Many users of the Federal Statistical System have asked that medical care spending be reported on a disease basis. Creating price indexes on a disease basis helps provide greater understanding of the cost of care for a given condition. The indexes are the result of a long-term research effort by staff in the BLS Office of Prices and Living Conditions. Using existing data products, we met the need for a new product, without incurring more data collection expenses. We construct the experimental indexes using two publicly available datasets: 1) the monthly producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) published by BLS and 2) the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. The monthly BLS data allow our experimental disease-based price indexes to be timely. MEPS supplies data on the use of medical service and products for the treatment of each disease. After a year of constructing the experimental disease-based index we reveal the wealth of information that the data show. This Beyond the Numbers article examines the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> by disease rather than by service and explains the reasons behind the spending growth for each disease...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{investigate}} how small/medium hospitality (SMH) firms set preferences for knowledge transfer relating to customer service improvement activities, through {{a determination of}} the most valued activities, preferred forms of media delivery and why best practice choice is valued. Design/methodology/approach - A single cross-sectional survey was used of 255 owners, managers or owner-managers of SMH firms in Australia using attitude rating scales. Findings - In nominating preferred customer service training/business performance improvement activities, the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> a highly valued activity were grouped into six themes. Relevance and novelty of the activity were the two highest ranked activities. The remaining four themes of informative, credible, ease of use, and social were ranked equally. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that hospitality firms are reluctant to embrace knowledge transfer activities in general and customer service training in particular. These findings shed light on specific preferred activities and indicate the reasons why. Practical implications - The {{results from this study}} have been integrated with other studies to present a range of communication-based strategies to assist industry policy makers. It is recommended that communication strategies to sell the "novelty, relevance and newness" of the customer service activity should be promoted. Originality/value - The paper synthesises literature from the small business sector, together with hospitality-specific papers and extends thinking beyond prescriptive advice. Given that knowledge transfer, delivered as prescriptive advice, tends to be ignored by the sector at large, this paper focuses on what managers do in practice and how they can be reached more directly.

40|$|To assess parental vaccine safety {{views and}} future {{vaccination}} decisions after an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) experienced by their child. A cross-sectional telephone {{survey was conducted}} of parents of children aged 0 – 7 y, identified in AEFI reports submitted to the South Australian Immunization Section, Department Health. The reports included childhood National Immunization Program (NIP), seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccines. Interviews were conducted following a national suspension of the 2010 seasonal trivalent influenza (STIV) vaccine. Parental attitudes toward vaccine safety, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> the AEFI and impact on future vaccination intent were assessed. Of 179 parents interviewed, 88 % were confident {{in the safety of}} vaccines in general. Parents reporting an AEFI to the STIV were more likely to state the event had influenced future vaccination decisions than the NIP vaccine reporters (65 % vs 14 %, p < 0. 001), with 63 % stating refusal or hesitance to re-vaccinate their children against influenza. Media reports of the 2010 STIV program suspension was the most common reason for reporting an AEFI for parents of children who received an influenza vaccination. The AEFI experience did not impact on parental decision to continue with routine childhood NIP schedules, regardless of whether children received influenza or NIP vaccines. In contrast, most parents whose child experienced an AEFI to the 2010 STIV stated decreased confidence in the safety of influenza vaccines, which is likely to have impacted on the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination in 2011. Addressing influenza vaccine safety concerns to promote influenza vaccination in the community is required.

Six daily newspapers, which represent four different types of print media, have been studied for 30 days on news geography, based on five geographic levels. First, the continental news (European); second, Balkan news; third, national news; forth, regional news (county), and finally, local news. The analysis has been carried out in several areas simultaneously; first, for each geographic area the Information topics have been monitored based on the common structure of the Albanian print media; political, economic, social, cultural, art, daily news, etc. Secondly, the genre through which the information is conveyed (news, analysis / commentary, reportage (feature), interview) has been highlighted and also it has been studied if the genre is defined depending on the country of the origin of information. Finally, there has been monitored the news authorship for each geographical level, and from where the news is reported.

40|$|Identifying what is {{important}} in the self-interpretations of young people who report no religion, this study examines how relationships of difference to religion relate to matters of importance. Twenty-three Year 10 pupils (14 - and 15 -year-olds) from two non-denominational secondary schools in the West Midlands who ticked the ‘no religion’ box on a questionnaire were asked to take photographs to represent what was important to them. These were used as prompts for discussions during one-to-one interviews that explored what was important to these young people, before asking questions about religion and their <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> none. Taking a relational approach to the study of non-religion (Lee 2012 a; Quack 2014), this thesis identifies participants’ relationships of difference to their constructions of religion. Understanding identity as a self-interpretation relating to things that matter to us (Taylor 1989), it determines whether and how relationships of difference are significant in participants’ self-interpretations and how, therefore, ticking the ‘no religion’ box on a questionnaire relates to issues of identity. Participants’ constructions of religion and their decision to report none were influenced by what they considered to be matters of importance, and what they considered to be important was reflected in their beliefs about life, the end of life, life after death, God, the supernatural and prayer. While many participants held beliefs adapted from religious traditions, they considered these to be different from those they associated with religion. The question of whether participants expressed non-religious identities depends on the relative significance of relationships of difference to religion in participants’ self-interpretations. For the majority of participants, relationships of difference to religion were not of central importance, meaning that very few should be categorised as having non-religious self-identities. Implications are drawn for the study of youth, religion and non-religion and for the teaching of religion and belief in schools. ...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{the safety}} of new and exisiting {{vaccines}} following licensure is {{a critical component of}} maintaining public confidence in immunisation and {{is an integral part of}} national immunisation programs. In Australia the process relies predominantly on the passive surveillance of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) via spontaneous voluntary reports of AEFI by healthcare professionals, vaccine manufacturers and the public to state or federal health authorities. The aim of this thesis was to investigate factors that promote or inhibit parental and healthcare professional reporting of AEFI. A mixed-methods sequential study design was employed, with three separate studies conducted: two quantitative and one qualitative. The first quantitative study involved telephone interviews of a representative sample of 469 South Australian parents, recruited from the general population about the previous occurrence of children’s AEFI, safety opinions, awareness of surveillance and reporting AEFI to healthcare professionals and surveillance authorities. The second quantitative study interviewed 179 parents whose children had experienced an AEFI and had reported the events to the South Australian Immunisation Section, Department of Health. This study was conducted following the national suspension of a seasonal trivalent influenza (STIV) vaccine in 2010. Parental vaccine safety attitudes, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> and impact on future vaccination intent were assessed. The qualitative study involved in-depth interviews with 29 healthcare professionals working in general practice, council immunisation clinics and a paediatric hospital emergency department (ED). The interviews sought to examine the experiences, knowledge and training of general practitioners (GPs), nurses and ED consultants in detecting AEFI and of reporting to surveillance authorities. The study was planned using a social constructionist perspective and thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data. In the first study, 95 % of all parents were confident in vaccine safety in general. Parental confidence in vaccine safety was significantly associated with higher levels of education (OR: 2. 58, p = 0. 01) and being born in Australia, (OR: 2. 30, p = 0. 004). Mothers, when compared with fathers, were less accepting of two vaccine risks: febrile convulsion (OR: 0. 57, p = 0. 04) and anaphylaxis, (OR: 0. 55, p = 0. 04). One in four parents stated that at least one of their children had previously experienced an AEFI: one third of these parents reported the symptoms to either a healthcare professional or the Department of Health. Parents of children who had experienced an AEFI were less likely to believe vaccines were safe (OR: 0. 53, p≤ 0. 01) compared with parents of children who did not experience an AEFI. In the second study, 88 % of all parents were confident in {{the safety of}} vaccines in general. Parents reporting an AEFI to the 2010 STIV were more likely to state the event had influenced future vaccination intent than the National Immunisation Program (NIP) vaccine parent AEFI reporters (65 % vs 14 %, p< 0. 001), with 63 % stating refusal or hesitance to re-vaccinate their children against influenza. Concern for their children’s symptoms and media reports of the 2010 STIV program suspension were the most common <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reporting.</b> The qualitative study revealed that interpretations of a “serious” or “unexpected” AEFI and what would constitute a reportable AEFI varied according to the professional group. Common barriers to reporting included time constraints and unsatisfactory reporting processes. Nurses were more likely to have received formal training in vaccine safety and reporting than medical practitioners. Collectively, these studies should inform future strategies aimed at improving AEFI reporting. These need to incorporate ongoing education and enhancing existing reporting processes for health professionals and investigation of alternate surveillance approaches that consumers will use.
