40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{decision}} support system to discriminate the diagnoses of alterations in urinary elimination, according to the nursing terminology of NANDA International (NANDA-I). Methods: A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) was structured considering six possible diagnoses: stress urinary incontinence, <b>reflex</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> urge urinary incontinence, functional urinary incontinence, total urinary incontinence and urinary retention; and 39 signals associated with them. the model was implemented in Microsoft Visual C++(R) Edition 2005 and applied in 195 real cases. Its performance was evaluated through the agreement test, comparing its results with the diagnoses determined by three experts (nurses). the sensitivity and specificity of the model were calculated considering the expert's opinion as a gold standard. in order to compute the Kappa's values we considered two situations, since more than one diagnosis was possible: the overestimation of the accordance in which the case was considered as concordant when at least one diagnoses was equal; and the underestimation of the accordance, in which the case was considered as discordant when at least one diagnosis was different. Results: the overestimation of the accordance showed an excellent agreement (kappa = 0. 92, p < 0. 0001); and the underestimation provided a moderate agreement (kappa = 0. 42, p < 0. 0001). in general the FCM model showed high sensitivity and specificity, of 0. 95 and 0. 92, respectively, but provided a low specificity value in determining the diagnosis of urge urinary incontinence (0. 43) and a low sensitivity value to total urinary incontinence (0. 42). Conclusions: the {{decision support system}} developed presented a good performance compared to other types of expert systems for differential diagnosis of alterations in urinary elimination. Since there are few similar studies in the literature, we are convinced {{of the importance of}} investing in this kind of modeling, both from the theoretical and from the health applied points of view. Limitations: in spite of the good results, the FCM should be improved to identify the diagnoses of urge urinary incontinence and total urinary incontinence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is {{a common}} problem among women and it is {{estimated}} that between 15 and 55 % of them complain of lower urinary symptoms. The most prevalent form of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is associated with stress, followed by mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> It is a symptom with several effects on quality of life of women mainly in their social, familiar and sexual domains. Female reproductive and urinary systems share anatomical structures, which promotes that urinary problems interfere with sexual function in females. This article is a review of both the concepts of female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and its impact on global and sexual quality of life. Nowadays, it is assumed that <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> especially urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> promotes anxiety and several self-esteem damages in women. The odour and the fear of incontinence during sexual intercourse affect female sexual function and this is related with the unpredictability and the chronicity of <b>incontinence,</b> namely urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> management involves conservative (pelvic floor muscle training), surgical and pharmacological treatment.

Case series and clinical trials reporting the effect of surgical, behavioral, and/or pharmacological weight loss on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> are summarized. Results: Epidemiological studies demonstrate that obesity is a strong and independent risk factor for prevalent and incident <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> There is a clear dose-response effect of weight on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> with each 5 -unit increase in body mass index associated with a 20 %&ndash; 70 % increase in risk of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> The maximum effect of weight on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> has an odds ratio of 4 &ndash; 5.

40|$|Almost every forth {{woman is}} {{suffering}} from <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Most frequent types of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> are stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (SUI), over active bladder (OAB) and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (MUI). Beside medical history and sonography, urodynamic testing is commonly used to differentiate between these forms of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> During urodynamic testing the bladder capacity is measured routinely. A small bladder capacity has already been described in patients with over active bladder. Neither in stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> nor in mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> the meaning of bladder capacity has been analyzed. In this trial the evaluation of a possible relationship between bladder capacity {{and the type of}} <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was the point of interest. Therefore three groups of women with <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> were formed, in detail stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> over active bladder and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Additionally a continent control group was examined in order to verify the results. As already known from current literature smallest bladder capacity was found in patients with over active bladder. Patients suffering from stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> showed a significantly higher bladder capacity than patients with over active bladder. This mismatch in bladder capacity could be explained with small bladders in the OAB group but could also be a hint for large bladder capacities in patients with SUI. Though these patients presented the largest bladder capacity, a significant difference to the control group was not obvious. Probably a certain bias was created by the control group being continent but showing possible risk factors for SUI in their patient history. Another significant difference was apparent between stress and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> A possible explanation would be that the component of overactivity had a stronger influence than stress component. As urodynamic testing is an expensive and invasive technique, there is desire to establish less invasive diagnostics like perineal sonography. Different sonographic markers for hypermobility of the urethra were measured in this trial and a comparison between the four groups was carried out including correlation analysis of bladder capacity and the sonographic findings. Finally no correlation was obvious.

Drug activity was evaluated in terms of outcome for the {{different types of}} <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> A prevailing reduction in maximal muscle contraction and endurance in the patients affected by stress and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was found. 42 % of the patients affected by urge incontinence showed a decrease in endurance, and 52 % showed overall good functioning of their pelvic floor. Administration of oxybutynin only improved <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in those patients affected by urge incontinence who did not have pelvic floor dysfunction (exact Fisher’s test, p< 0. 001) ...|$|R
40|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} {{in women}} {{is a major}} health problem. Symptoms are protrusion of vaginal tissue, voiding difficulties, <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> stool problems and sexual dysfunction. Many of these women may eventually require surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction, especially for prolaps and <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> This thesis focuses on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and especially on the etiological aspects of pregnancy and childbirth. In a community survey MacLennan reported a prevalence {{of all types of}} self-reported <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in women is 35. 3 %. <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> increased after pregnancy according to parity and age.

40|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> {{in older}} adults is {{associated}} with an increased risk of institutionalization, as well as with urinary tract infections and depression. Transient <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> arises suddenly, lasts less than six months, and results from reversible causes. Many caregivers erroneously consider <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> to be inevitable in older adults, especially in hospitalized patients. Failure to identify and respond to transient <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> may lead to established incontinence and to other poor outcomes after hospital discharge. A bladder diary and a mnemonic are two methods nurses can use to assess for transient <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and its treatable underlying causes.

40|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is {{involuntary}} leakage of urine. It is not life-threatening {{but does}} adversely affect {{the quality of}} life (1). On pathophysiology, activity of the detrusor muscle is decreased, urethral activity is increased. Because of reduced urethral output, urine accumulates in the bladder and after a certain point, overflow occurs (2). Medications rarely cause <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and mainly affect suburinary system. Although druginduced <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is noted as one of the side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), there have only been few cases of SSRIassociated <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in the literature (3).

New-onset stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is low and similar in the two groups. The effect of anterior vaginal wall mesh on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is somewhat controversial, but our results show that mesh placement does not increase the risk of postoperative <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> similar to the results reported by Nieminen et al. [5] and in accordance with results reported after trans-obturator mesh placement [7].|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the prevalence {{and frequency of}} <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in women presenting to a specialist osteoporosis clinic. Methods: Participants included 412 female patients aged 22 to 94 years (mean 62 years) presenting to a hospital-based specialist multidisciplinary osteoporosis clinic over one year. The {{presence or absence of}} <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> urgency without leakage, type of symptoms (stress, urge, mixed) and frequency of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> were recorded. Results: Sixty-seven percent of patients (277 / 412) reported some symptoms of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> 23 % reported no symptoms and 10 % reported urgency without any leakage.

40|$|Male <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is an underestimated and {{frequently}} not broached issue. The <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> {{is divided into}} stress-, urge incontinence and hybrid forms as well as overflow incontinence.

Many investigations and therapies can be realized by the general practitioner. Already simple therapy approaches can lead to a considerable clinical improvement of male <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> If the initial therapy fails or pathological results (i.
