40|$|Classification {{based on}} {{association}} rules {{is considered to}} be effective and advantageous in many cases. However, the "sharp boundary " problem in association rules mining with numerical data may lead to semantics <b>retortion</b> of discovered rules, which may further disturb the understandability, even the accuracy of classification. This paper aims at proposing an associative classification approach, namely Fuzzy Association Rules Classification (FARC), where fuzzy logic is used in partitioning the domains of numerical data items, giving rise to fuzzy association rules for classification. In doing so, two measures, pseudo support and pseudo confidence, as well as the notion of minimal equivalence set (MESet), are introduced, along with extensions to the corresponding mining algorithms. The experimental results revealed that FARC generated fewer rules than the traditional CBA approach without loss of accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abundant oil prone coal (Type III kerogen) {{deposits}} {{are preserved}} within the high latitude, middle Palaeocene, Todalen {{member of the}} Central Tertiary Basin, Spitsbergen Island, Norwegian Arctic. The coals (Svea, Longyear, Svarteper and Askeladden seams) {{have been subjected to}} only minor previous geochemical characterisation. Focussing upon the Longyear seam, this paper characterises the present, prospective and economic oil potential of the Svalbard coals. Organic biomarker parameters, Fe–S chemistry and coal maceral analysis are then applied to understand the provenance and environmental origins of this unusual source rock. The upper Todalen Mbr. coals (Longyear, Svarteper and Askeladden seams) have significantly more oil potential than the Lower Svea seams with estimated <b>retortion</b> yields of 170 – 190 kg/tonne vs. 24 kg/tonne respectively. The Longyear seam exhibits relatively high HI values (ca. 300 – 400 mg/g TOC) consistent with a hydrogen rich mixed Type II/III kerogen source. Greatest oil potential is shown to be favoured by formation within a fen environment, with high bacterial degradation (> 100 μg/g TOC hopanes), marine influence (> 0. 5 wt. % sulfur, Fe/S < 0. 9) and the unique temperate high latitude Palaeocene climate of Svalbard leading to preservation of hydrogen rich organic matter via organo-sulfur bond formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} work aims at {{minimizing the}} environmental impact of the solid wastes (ash) that is produced after the utilization of the bituminous limestone in thermal power stations and /or <b>retortion</b> processes. Limy ash has been prepared from the El-Lajjun bituminous limestone by direct combustion at 1200, 950, and 525 °C respectively. The laboratory tests have been selected with respect to construction needs and possible post construction conditions. Utilization of the various types of ash in the stabilization problematic soils from Jordan as brown soils and the clayey marl has revealed optimum results. The unconfined compressive strength of the parent brown soil and the clayey marl has been raised from 5 kg/cm 2 to 50 and 25 kg/cm 2 respectively. The CBR value has been raised from 4. 5 % to 150 % for both problematic soil types. Various mortars and construction elements can be produced at normal room curing temperature without the use of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Low quality sub-base and base course can be mixed with ash to produce cement treated base (CTB) and roller compacted concrete (RCC) without OPC. Durable pavements, embankments can be constructed with very long life and low cost. CTB and RCC utilizing ash can be used in dam construction instead of normal soil in earth fill dams. The high alkalinity of El-Lajjun ash is considered as a disadvantage to be utilized in normal concrete mixes for structural purposes. Ash only can be mixed with aggregates to produce lean concrete like for blinding purposes to be prepared for foundation activities 1...|$|E
40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} November 1977 By {{a boycott}} we mean the refusal by persons {{to deal with}} one or more other persons. The purpose of the boycott is generally to punish, or induce abandonment of a course of action, by economic pressure. Likewise, an international boycott refers to the refusal of citizens of a state to trade, or enter into other economic relations with the citizens of another state, in order to manifest resentment or bring pressure. A boycott is to be distinguished from measures of economic <b>retortion</b> such as reprisals, sanctions, embargoes or blockades, which are initiated by a government to bring pressure upon a state guilty of unfriendly, reprehensible or illegal behaviour. Boycotts, however, merge into such official procedures if they are encouraged or organized by government [...] As far as South Africa is concerned, there has been a notable tendency for an increase in the calls for an economic boycott [...] An articulate demand for an investment boycott was made last year in a joint statement issued by Chief Gatsha Buthelesi and Dr. C. F. Beyers Naude [...] It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to assess the validity of the theologians' reasoning. Suffice it to say that social and economic devastation is a most unlikely scenario from which South Africa will emerge as a peaceful multi-racial society. In my opinion it is rapid economic growth, and NOT the enforced abandonment of prosperous international economic links, which is best suited effectively to further the case of the South African Black. Be this as it may, let us look now at the consequences which a hypothetical economic boycott would have for South Africa...|$|E
