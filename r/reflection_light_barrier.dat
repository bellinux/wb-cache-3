40|$|The paper {{presents}} an effective solution for determining characteristic features of objects {{from a simple}} measurement set-up. A low-cost IR diode array, working on a <b>reflection</b> <b>light</b> scanner principle, has been designed. Essentially arrays of several emitter-receiver pairs are mounted on different sides of the area of observation, enabling the estimation {{of the size of}} the object in different dimensions and its reflection coefficient. The emitters are driven successively in time, hence no signal overlapping and cross-talk occur. The results show that from simple light intensity measurements, a variety of objects can be reliably recognised. As an example, the problem of determining the number of people getting into or out of a room is addressed. Two arrays of 3 diode pairs each are mounted on both sides of a doorway. With the proposed sensor, people can be recognised easily and are well separable from other echoes (motion of hands etc.), making the performance far more reliable than that of ordinary <b>light</b> <b>barriers...</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{light comes}} {{into contact with}} milk, the milk will start to {{deteriorate}} and taste bad due to production of off-flavour compounds. Aseptic milk carton packages stored at ambient temperature usually have a layer of aluminium foil, which acts as a <b>barrier</b> for incoming <b>light,</b> water, oxygen and other gases. If the aluminium would not be present the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> would mainly consist of the paperboard. In order to develop a milk package without aluminium foil for ambient storage, {{it is important to}} obtain knowledge of <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties of paperboard and plastic caps. When measuring the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> in the material two spectrophotometers were used. The spectrophotometers measured the fraction of light that was able to penetrate a sample. The investigation of paperboards for 1 litre packages showed that they had protection against light of wavelengths that induced off flavour reactions with Riboflavin (220 - 375, 410 - 475 nm). But the transmission for light within the range 650 - 700 nm was above 0. 1 %. Those wavelengths induce off flavour reactions with porphyrins and chlorins. Different layers in the paperboard contribute differently to the total <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> of the paperboard. Exposing a paperboard to sunlight deteriorates its <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> in the long run, while printing on paperboard improves its <b>light</b> <b>barrier.</b> The plastic caps on packages are a fraction of the total package in term of area. But the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> of the total package could be lacking due to the plastic caps which is why they have been investigated. Different colouring pigments give different <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> properties in the cap...|$|R

30|$|In Fig. 3 (a), two {{orthogonal}} polarizers {{are placed}} in front of two projectors with the same parameters and then two EIAs with orthogonal polarization states are projected onto the projection screen by the corresponding projectors. The polarization direction of the EIA is {{the same as that of}} the polarizer in front of the projectors. The projection screen is a rear projection screen which is able to maintain the light polarization characteristics. In addition, by adding a full <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> between different polarizers before the lenslet array, we can increase the viewing angle further. The size of each <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> is the same as that of each lenslet. The width of each EI is 4 times that of conventional integral imaging system, and its height remains unchanged. The polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are placed in}} close proximity to the lenslet array and the polarization directions of adjacent polarizers are orthogonal. The light ray of the EIA is filtered through polarizers array and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array and then reaches the lenslets array. The 3 D reconstructed image can be obtained by the observer.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} wide-viewing integral {{imaging system}} is established {{by using the}} lenslet array coupling with the polarizers, <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> and enlarged elemental images array. The size of <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> and polarizer {{is equal to the}} pitch of each lenslet, the <b>light</b> <b>barrier</b> prevents <b>light</b> rays from passing through, and the polarizer controls the passage of light ray in the specific polarization direction. In the projection-type integral imaging system, two orthogonal elemental images arrays (EIA) are projected onto the projection screen simultaneously by the corresponding projectors. In LCD integral imaging system, two orthogonal EIAs are displayed by use of an LCD screen which can switch the polarization direction of the EIA by time-multiplexed technology within the time constant of the eyes’ response time.|$|R

30|$|It {{can be seen}} in Fig. 6 {{that the}} viewing angle of the {{integral}} imaging system based on polarizers and <b>light</b> <b>barriers</b> array has been significantly improved. By comparing the different view images horizontally, different parallax information can be obtained. In the range of ± 33 °, you can get the correct reconstructed image of the whole scene. The proposed method is about approximately 4 times the viewing angle of the conventional integral imaging. The different wide-viewing integral three-dimensional imaging methods proposed by Refs. [9, 10] can improve the field angle to a certain extent, but cannot more than 2 times the original viewing angle. In both modes of our manuscript, the viewing angle can be enlarged more than 2 times which is the main difference between the proposed system and the previous methods. The increment of viewing angle can be determined by the number of <b>light</b> <b>barriers,</b> the more the <b>light</b> <b>barrier,</b> the lager the viewing angle. When one light baffles array is used, the field angle will be enlarged 4 times as conventional method. The size of each elemental image can be enlarged as any positive integer multiples as the pitch of the lenslet. Thus, the viewing angle of the integral imaging system can be improved dramatically by the improvement of the size of each elemental image according to the integral imaging principles.|$|R
