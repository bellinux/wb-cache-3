5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water <b>radiators.</b> The absence of standard <b>radiators</b> allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard <b>radiators</b> in the nose of the car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted <b>radiators</b> moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the <b>radiators</b> from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard <b>radiators</b> were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the air flow through the <b>radiator</b> core. The flow through the <b>radiator</b> core in turn depends on other panels {{that are in the}} vicinity of the <b>radiator</b> and these include the <b>radiator</b> cover, grille, front inner panel, cowl, floor, etc. A clear understanding of the flow pattern inside the <b>radiator</b> cover is essential for optimizing the <b>radiator</b> cover shape to increase the flow through the <b>radiator</b> core, thereby increasing the thermal {{efficiency of}} the <b>radiator.</b> In this paper, CFD enabled optimization of airflow distribution inside the <b>radiator</b> cover is discussed. Starting from a CFD solution of the baseline design that was validated against indoor test data, a series of optimization cases were executed to arrive at the optimum configuration of the <b>radiator</b> cover. The airflow distribution inside the <b>radiator</b> cover and the flow through the <b>radiator</b> core was monitored to provide a quantitative basis for the optimization process. The CFD analysis was conducted using the commercial software FLUENT™, while the surface and volume mesh were generated using ANSA ™ and TGRID™, respectively. Use of ANSA ™ for surface meshing was instrumental in reducing the CFD cycle time. CFD analysis of the baseline design that was validated against test data showed that significant regions of re-circulating flow existed inside the <b>radiator</b> cover. This recirculation reduced the flow through the <b>radiator</b> core, leading to a build-up of hot air pockets close to the <b>radiator</b> surface and subsequent degradation of <b>radiator</b> thermal efficiency. The CFD enabled optimization led to <b>radiator</b> cover configuration that eliminated these recirculation regions and increased the flow through the <b>radiator</b> core by 34 %. It is anticipated that this increase in <b>radiator</b> core flow would significantly increase the <b>radiator</b> thermal efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} <b>radiator,</b> the <b>radiator</b> under the starboard wing was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler <b>radiator</b> housed alongside. Under the port wing a new <b>radiator</b> fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one <b>radiator</b> section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard <b>radiator</b> section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.|$|R
5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil <b>radiators.</b> This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted <b>radiators</b> for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{maiden flight}} of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, {{occurred}} at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936. After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests. Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified {{a problem with the}} aerodynamics of the <b>radiators</b> and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' <b>radiators</b> were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles and the rudder was enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The <b>radiators</b> were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the <b>radiators.</b> In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon {{dissolved}} {{in it with}} small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard.

5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into <b>radiators.</b> In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to the {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as <b>radiators.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused <b>radiators</b> to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty <b>radiators</b> with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the <b>radiators</b> were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 2-way design {{consisted of}} two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns. The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring <b>radiators</b> (tweeters) mounted {{in the back of the}} cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E
40|$|The active {{thermal control}} system (ATCS) {{of the crew}} {{exploration}} vehicle (Orion) uses <b>radiator</b> panels with fluid loops as the primary system to reject heat from spacecraft. The Lockheed Martin (LM) baseline Orion ATCS uses eight-panel <b>radiator</b> coated with silver Teflon coating (STC) for International Space Station (ISS) missions, and uses seven-panel <b>radiator</b> coated with AZ 93 white paint for lunar missions. As an option to increase the <b>radiator</b> area with minimal impact on other component locations and interfaces, the reduced-curvature (RC) <b>radiator</b> concept was introduced and investigated here for the thermal perspective. Each RC <b>radiator</b> panel has 15 percent more area than each Lockheed Martin (LM) baseline <b>radiator</b> panel. The objective {{was to determine if}} the RC seven-panel <b>radiator</b> concept could be used in the ATCS for both ISS and lunar missions. Three <b>radiator</b> configurations the LM baseline, an RC seven-panel <b>radiator</b> with STC, and an RC seven-panel <b>radiator</b> with AZ 93 coating were considered in the ATCS for ISS missions. Two <b>radiator</b> configurations the LM baseline and an RC seven-panel <b>radiator</b> with AZ 93 coating were considered in the ATCS for lunar missions. A Simulink/MATLAB model of the ATCS was used to compute the ATCS performance. Some major hot phases on the thermal timeline were selected because of concern about the large amount of water sublimated for thermal topping. It was concluded that an ATCS with an RC seven-panel <b>radiator</b> could be used for both ISS and lunar missions, but with two different coatings STC for ISS missions and AZ 93 for lunar missions to provide performance similar to or better than that of the LM baseline ATCS...|$|R
