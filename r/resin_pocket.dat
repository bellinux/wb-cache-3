40|$|In this paper, {{a finite}} element method is {{presented}} capable of predicting the influence an embedded interrogator has on the structural performance of the composite host. It starts {{with the development of}} a methodology capable of predicting the <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> geometry surrounding the inclusion, and the subsequent creation of a cured part used for loading simulations. The obtained results are compared to experimental force-displacement curves obtained on several composite samples with embedded interrogators of different geometries under a 3 -point bending load, developed within the EU FP 7 SmartFiber project. A very good correspondence between experimental and numerical data is obtained, both in the prediction of the <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> geometry as well as the resulting force-displacement curves. A consequence of the developed modelling technique is that it allows the numerical study of shape optimization of embedded structures in order to minimize the detrimental effects of the inclusion on the structural performance of the composite structure...|$|E
30|$|The way {{in which}} water stress leads to <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> formation, and how it interacts with stem {{movement}} is not understood. The association of resin pockets with false rings suggests that soil water deficits lead to zones of weakness in the growth rings (Cown, 1973), which predisposes the trees to <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> formation during wind events. However, {{it could be that}} changes in cell turgor pressure in the cambium following the release of water stress, lead to conditions that predispose the cambium to damage and the formation of resin pockets. The cells in a severely water-stressed cambium tend to load their vacuoles with minerals that will help the cell retain enough water to prevent death (Sudachkova et al., 1994). Over the surface of the cambium, there will be gradients of cells with lower or higher osmotic potential. When a heavy rainfall event occurs, the sudden influx of water will be drawn into the vacuole of some cells more rapidly than others. Those with a very high osmotic potential will be better competitors, than cells with lower osmotic potential, and the influx of water and high cell turgor pressure could make the cambium more susceptible to mechanical damage.|$|E
30|$|The Type 1 and 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> {{raw data}} were {{summarised}} for the stem bending and control treatments prior to analysis. Growth rings prior to 2003, and heights above 6 metres from the ground, {{were not used}} in the analysis. The exclusion of this data is unlikely to affect the results, as {{the vast majority of}} the resin pockets occurred from 2003, and at heights below 6 metres above the ground. Within each combination of ring and height class, the presence or absence of resin pockets of each type, and the number of resin pockets were obtained. Presence/absence of resin pockets was then analysed using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS Version 9.2 with a logistic link function and binary distribution function. The number of resin pockets was also analysed with PROC GLIMMIX using a Poisson link function but this analysis gave similar results to the presence/absence analysis and is not presented here. The distribution of <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> numbers was extremely skewed with some trees having large numbers and others having only a few resin pockets. This meant that a simple measure of presence/absence within each combination of height class and ring gave comparable results to complete counts.|$|E
30|$|Stem bending {{in spring}} or summer {{was found to}} {{increase}} the number of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets,</b> but had no effect on the number of Type 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets.</b> The soil moisture conditions at the time of stem bending had no effect on the number of Type 1 or 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{formation}} of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in trees {{is thought to}} occur {{as a result of}} the stress associated with wind exposure. Frey-Wyssling (1938; 1942) suggested that <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) were formed as checks in the cambium due to wind forces. The swaying of trees in strong winds was believed to induce sufficient shear stress in the cambium to cause tearing of the cells in the tangential direction, which formed into <b>resin</b> <b>pockets.</b> Wind exposure was proposed by Clifton (1969) as the cause of the high incidence of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in radiata pine grown in Canterbury, New Zealand. The distribution of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in the trees suggested a mechanically induced cause - in the vertical direction the <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> were predominant in an area representing the zone of maximum wind sway, and in the radial direction the incidence of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> decreased when the trees reached a size where they were able to resist wind sway (Clifton, 1969). The exposure to wind has been implicated in the increase in the number of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> observed after storm events in central Europe. Survivor trees of European larch and Norway spruce have been shown to produce <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> more intensively in the years following severe storms (Wernsdörfer et al., 2002; Zielonka & Malcher, 2009). The increase in the number of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> is thought to occur as the result of wind sway in the remaining stems of the storm thinned stands. Heavy thinning of managed plantation forests to low final stockings has produced similar increases in the number of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in Norway spruce in central Europe (Schumacher et al., 1997) and radiata pine in New Zealand (Barker & Tombleson, 1999; Dean & Barker, 1999). However, Watt et al. (2011) found no relationship between the incidence of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> and wind speed at a given site.|$|R
30|$|The <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in {{the disc}} {{photographs}} were classified by type, and the dimensions, location and ring position were measured using an IDL imaging routine developed at CSIRO. The disc photographs were corrected to a constant scale, using the back board calibration pins, and the <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> {{were classified as}} Type 1 or 2 (McConchie et al., 2008; Ottenschlaeger et al., 2012). The XY coordinates of the <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> were recorded, the annual rings identified, and the within-ring positions of the <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> were estimated {{as a percentage of}} the ring width.|$|R
30|$|In this study, a field {{experiment}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} interactive effects of stem movement and water stress on <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> formation in a 12 -year-old radiata pine stand. The stems of the radiata pine trees were mechanically bent at two different times during the 2007 / 2008 growing season, over a range of naturally occurring and artificially induced soil moisture conditions. Following the completion of this growth season, the incidence of resin pockets was assessed and compared with unbent control trees. Type 1 and Type 2 resin pockets were assessed.|$|E
40|$|Discontinuous {{reinforcement}} phases are often observed in natural materials, such as nacre. The {{aim of this}} study is to introduce a degree of 'pseudo-ductility' to fibre reinforced polymer materials by exploiting such discontinuities. The work presented takes the principle of discrete material sections and applies it in the form of ply cuts to a carbon fibre reinforced polymer. A variety of specimen designs were tested which encompassed the principles taken from the architecture of nacre. Four point bend flexural testing was carried out and the failure processes investigated. It was identified that the ply end to ply end geometry, typically resulting in a <b>resin</b> <b>pocket,</b> is very important in achieving sequential failure of a conventionally brittle material...|$|E
40|$|Damage {{development}} in the later stages of the fatigue life of a glass/epoxy non-crimp 3 D orthogonal woven fabric composite has been examined {{using a combination of}} mechanical testing and damage observations. Changes in both the stiffness reduction rate and the energy dissipation per cycle suggest that there are three stages in the fatigue lifetime. Observations of damage using X-ray micro computed tomography (CT) and optical microscopy within specimens cycled {{to the beginning of the}} third stage show extensive matrix cracking extending between surface weft tows, with associated <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> cracking. It is suggested that the observation of extensive fibre fractures within sections of warp tows closest to z-crowns is a consequence of stress concentrations due to these cracks...|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} of stem bending to radiata pine trees in spring or summer {{of a single}} growth season {{increased the number of}} Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets,</b> but had no effect on the number of Type 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets.</b> The majority of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> were located in {{the lower part of the}} stems, in the early wood of the outer growth ring, and close to the growth ring boundary. This location appears to be a zone of weakness that is prone to the formation of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> by compressive stresses in the stems during the {{application of}} stem bending.|$|R
30|$|<b>Resin</b> <b>pockets</b> are a {{major cause}} of degrade in the {{appearance}} grade timber of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don). When present at moderate to severe levels in the logs of radiata pine, they can lead to significant reductions {{in the value of the}} timber (McConchie & Turner, 2002; Cown et al., 2011). <b>Resin</b> <b>pockets</b> occur as Type 1 and 2 forms in the logs of radiata pine (Sommerville, 1980; McConchie et al., 2008; Ottenschlaeger et al., 2012). Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> are described as lens-shaped accumulations of resin and callus tissue within a growth-ring that cause no damage to the cambium, while Type 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> are similar except the cambium is ruptured and healing results in an occlusion scar that can occur over several growth rings. <b>Resin</b> <b>pockets</b> occur at some level in all stands of radiata pine in New Zealand (Park, 2004), but reach epidemic levels in regions that are windy and/or dry.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} low velocity impact response of carbon/epoxy asymmetrically tapered laminates. The tests are realised at energy between 10 and 30 J on two types of layup with multiple terminated plies. The type and localisation of damage are analysed using C-scan and micrographs. Then, the data is compared with the response of corresponding respective plain laminate. The effects of some tapering parameters (taper angle, drop-off disposition and configuration) on the impact damage mechanisms are also investigated. Very similar impact damage phenomena are found between tapered and plain laminates. The presence of material discontinuity due to the <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> affects less the damage mechanism than the structural difference between the thick and the thin sections...|$|E
30|$|The role of stem {{movement}} on <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> formation has been evaluated in controlled experiments involving stem bending, and restraints on wind sway. Temnerud et al. (1999) found {{the application of}} mechanical bending stress during growth to the stems of 5 -year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees increased the formation of xylem wounds that resembled resin pockets by 30 % over the controls. Watt et al. (2009) found that restraints on 14 -year-old radiata pine trees to limit wind sway {{reduced the number of}} resin pockets, compared with unrestrained control trees on the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand. The effects were most marked on the incidence of Type 1 resin pockets. Ottenschlaeger et al. (2012) proposed a common cause triggering the occurrence of Type 1 and Type 2 resin pockets.|$|E

30|$|Mechanical {{bending stress}} due to tree sway in strong winds and water stress during drought {{are thought to}} {{contribute}} to the formation of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets,</b> but it is unclear if these are linked and whether the initiation of <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> is influenced by the water status of the trees at the time of stem bending.|$|R
30|$|The Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> {{occurred}} in the inner part of the early wood, adjacent to the growth ring boundary. This suggests the Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> were initiated in the mature wood, behind the cambium and zone of differentiation, and were not influenced by the water status of the tree stems {{at the time of}} stem bending.|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> {{in the early}} wood of trees subjected to the stem bending treatments applied here, suggests that Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> were forming in the mature wood, behind the cambium and zone of differentiation, as observed by Donaldson (1983). The early wood that {{is close to the}} growth-ring boundary {{appears to have been a}} zone of weakness for the formation of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets,</b> and will have contained fully differentiated mature wood at the time of the spring and summer stem bending treatments. The structural properties of the mature wood will not be affected by either the water status of the trees, or the timing of the stem bending during the growth season. This situation could explain the similar number of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> formed when the trees were water-stressed compared with trees that were water stressed then rehydrated.|$|R
30|$|Interaction of the LoE type {{can also}} be strong, where sites differ {{strongly}} in P deficiency (Fielding and Brown 1961; Burdon 1971, 1976) or in foliage disease hazard (although P deficiency is becoming irrelevant because of how easily it can now be corrected). The role of disease hazard here is self-evident, but main interest will lie in cases of disease levels that favour identifying the most resistant genotypes. However, LoE interaction tends to be very strong for straightness, malformation and coarseness of branching and possibly wood stiffness. For tree-form traits, the LoE interactions can often be stark, in which on some sites, form can be almost uniformly good whereas on others, it varies widely about an average of bad to very bad. Nevertheless, the evidence tends to be anecdotal, because practical necessity means such traits are typically rated in genetic trials subjectively, with the rating scales not being absolute. The main factors involved, which have generally adverse effects and strong expression of genotypic differences, include high soil fertility and exposure. A notorious, if ill-documented, example exists in the grossly inferior tree form of long-internode genotypes (of low branch cluster frequency) compared with short-internode material on very fertile sites, {{especially if they are}} severely exposed. Among wood properties, compression wood incidence, which is seen as a driver of dimensional instability, has been shown to exhibit LoE interaction (Burdon 1975). In the apparent absence of specific documentation, the expectation is that high fertility would be associated with greater expression of genotypic differences in stiffness, and dimensional instability associated with longitudinal shrinkage and grain spirality, in addition to generally adverse effects. For the secondary wood property, <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> incidence, genotypic differences will almost certainly be much more strongly expressed on high-hazard sites which are in some degree identifiable (Cown et al. 2011 and references therein), although evidence of the heritability of <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> incidence is largely lacking.|$|E

Stiffness reduction and energy dissipated per cycle were found to be complementary measurements of damage accumulation, occurring in three stages: a first stage characterised by rapid changes, a more quiescent second stage, followed by a third stage where the (decreasing) stiffness and (increasing) energy dissipation change irregularly and then rapidly, to failure. Microscopy of specimens cycled into the transition between the second and third stages showed macroscopic accumulations of fibre fractures in sections of warp tows which lying adjacent to the surface weft tows which are crowned-over by the Z-tows. At these locations, the warp tow fibres are subjected to stress concentrations both from transverse weft tow matrix cracks and <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> cracks...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Embedding {{fiber optic}} sensor (FOS) in fiber {{reinforced}} composites caused resin pockets and geometric disturbance of the reinforcing fibers around the optical fiber. The disturbance angle varied from 6. 2 to 8. 2 and the <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> area varied from 7 to 10 times the cross-sectional {{area of the}} sensor. These two act like defects and cause premature failure initiation. Failure initiation was hypothesized as due to transverse stress concentration. A static experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of an embedded optical fiber in unidirectional composite laminates. Inclination of FOS with respect to reinforcing fiber (loading direction) varied from 0 to 90 and the laminate thickness varied from 8 to 20 plies. The embedment had practically no loss of tensile modulus and about 10 % loss of tensile strength while compression strength reduction was as large as 40 %.

30|$|The {{absence of}} {{increased}} numbers of Type 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> suggests {{there was no}} cambial damage associated with the stem bending treatments. The influx of water and the high cell turgor pressure of the cambium cells, following the uptake of water by the water-stressed trees, {{did not appear to}} make the cambium cells susceptible to mechanical damage. Type 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> are formed in response to damage to the cambium, as has been shown by Donaldson (1983). Either the bending and axial stresses produced by the stem bending treatments were not large enough to damage the cambium, or other factors are involved in the formation of Type 2 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{number of}} Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in radiata pine trees {{increased}} with {{the application of}} stem bending treatments in this study. Although project resources did not permit the destructive sampling of all the trees to which bending treatments were applied, the numbers were sufficient to detect significant effects, despite the considerable variance among trees. The results {{were consistent with the}} formation of xylem wounds with stem bending in Scots pine trees (Temnerud et al., 1999), and with the {{reduction in the number of}} Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> that occurred with restraints on wind sway in radiata pine trees (Watt et al., 2009). This suggests the bending and axial stresses induced in the tree stems by wind sway, are an important factor in the formation of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> in radiata pine trees.|$|R

The models were fitted separately for the pre-treatment period (2003 – 2007), and the treatment period (2007 – 2008). The azimuth classes were orientated such that the classes were separated {{along the lines of the}} directions of winching.|$|R
30|$|A {{stand of}} 12 year-old radiata pine trees in Balmoral forest, Canterbury, New Zealand (latitude 42 ° 49 ’ 56 ”, {{longitude}} 172 ° 47 ’ 20 ”, altitude 190 m, slope 0 °) {{was selected as}} the trees had high levels of external resin bleeding, a trait that {{has been found to be}} positively related to <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> incidence (McConchie & Turner, 2002). The long-term annual rainfall at the site is 624 mm year- 1, which is considered low. The soils are Balmoral stony and shallow silt loams (Soil Bureau, 1968). The low water storage capacity (47 % soil fractional root-zone water storage, Palmer et al., 2009) of the soil, in combination with the low rainfall and high evaporative demand over spring and summer, typically results in severe seasonal soil water deficits in summer. The stand was planted in 1995 at a stocking rate of 868 stems ha- 1, and was thinned to waste in 2003 to 600 stems ha- 1.|$|E
40|$|In {{non-destructive}} {{health monitoring}} of composite materials optical sensors {{have been shown}} many advantages compared to the piezoelectrical transducers and electrical strain gauges. Some of their properties include light weight, tiny structures, remote sensing, electro-magnetic interference, and more importantly they are immune to any hazardous environment, particularly they can withstand a high temperatures up to over 1000 ° C, and they are immune to electro-magnetic interference. They can be easily embedded inside the materials like composites with minimum effect on their original structure. The light weight of composite materials makes optical sensors embedded in composite package very suitable for many applications including airspace industry. The composite packages can be tailored to achieve desired mechanical characteristics. Moreover, they can be applied as extra protection for embedded fiber optics. In this work, phase-modulated sensor, Michelson interferometer, was fabricated and embedded in composite package. Then the package was glued on an aluminum substrate. The resultant structure {{was used to measure}} strain in the aluminum substrate. The comprehensive study was performed in evaluating different lay-ups of the composite package in order to find the best match between the composite materials and the substrate in term of stiffness. ANSYS simulations were performed to study the influence of the <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> on the strain transmission to the optical sensor, dependence of the thickness of the adhesive layer on the strain readings on the composite package and on the optical sensor. The results of the simulations showed that optical sensor within <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> created by the resin and carbon fiber will give small alteration in strain readings between composite material and optical fiber. Static tensile tests were investigated on different lay-ups of the laminate, adhesives, composite materials, and thickness of the adhesive layers. Difference in strain readings between aluminum and optical sensor were smaller due to good transmission of the strain through epoxy adhesive layer with thickness a 100 om. The most successful lay-ups for composite package were [90 / 90 /F(0) / 90 / 90] for CYCOM 5276 - 1 and for NCT 301 - [90 / 90 /F(0) / 90 / 90] and [- 60 / 60 /F(0) / 60 /- 60].

One of the disadvantages of using ply drop-offs is the likelihood of stress concentrations at the terminations of the dropped plies, as these stress concentrations frequently lead to the premature development of damage. In this work, composite coupons with a double ply drop-off have been fabricated using out-of-autoclave CFRP. Coupons cut from the panels have been subjected to quasi-static and fatigue loading and the development of damage has been monitored using microscopy, and in some coupons, by using a chirped fibre Bragg grating (CFBG) sensor. The first damage appeared as resin cracks within the <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> associated with the ply drop-off and this damage developed subsequently into delaminations.

At 20 years and thereafter annually until 30 years of age, a pruned butt log was theoretically cut from the mean stem and sawn, and clearwood timber grades were calculated and expressed as a percentage of sawn timber volume. A multiple regression model that linked rotation age to clearwood conversions, site productivity, and treatments was developed for GF 22 seedlot. Application of the model to a site of moderate productivity, planted at 800 stems/ha, thinned to 400 stems/ha, and pruned when diameter over stubs measured 180 mm, indicated that a rotation of at least 33 years would be needed to achieve a clearwood production level of 40 %. On extremely low or high productivity sites, rotations of 40 and 25 years respectively were predicted. At a final stocking of 200 stems/ha and under the same practices, rotations of 32, 25, and 17 years were predicted for the low, moderate, and high productivity sites respectively.

40|$|Thickness tapered {{laminates}} {{obtained by}} terminating {{a certain number}} of plies contain resin-rich areas called ‘resin pockets’ near ply drops, where high stress concentrations exist. Study of the effects of ply drops and resin pockets on the tensile behaviour of tapered laminates considering certain important parameters like taper angle, the number of plies dropped, and the fiber orientation is reported here. Estimation of the tensile strength of tapered laminates necessitates accurate determination of the state of stress near the ply-drop region, which is, in general, three-dimensional (3 -D) in nature. Recognising the fact that full 3 -D finite-element analysis becomes computationally exorbitant, special layered 3 -D finite-element analysis is carried out. Laminates with ply drops along only one direction are analysed to elicit the nature of the local bending effects occurring near the ply drops. Complete 3 -D Tsai–Wu criterion considering all the six stress components is used to obtain a quick and comparative assessment of the tensile strength of these laminates. High stress concentration zones are identified and the effects of number of plies dropped at a station and <b>resin</b> <b>pocket</b> geometry are illustrated.

30|$|The greater {{incidence}} of Type 1 <b>resin</b> <b>pockets</b> {{in the lower}} part of the stems is consistent with the distribution of bending and axial stress in the stems. When stems bend in the wind, the maximum bending and axial stress occurs at the outer surface, close to the cambium, in {{the lower part of}} the stem (Mergen, 1954; Petty & Worrell, 1981; Morgan & Cannell, 1994; Chiba, 2000). The axial stress on the compression side of the bend, can lead to failure along the lamellate structures of the growth rings. In Norway spruce, tangential splits were produced by axial compressive stress, usually in the early wood along the growth ring boundary (Bariska & Kučera, 1985).

For research purposes the study showed that compared to destructive methods, both accuracy and speed of the CT-method were competitive.

The X-ray LogScanner was based on two X-ray sources and designed for scanning at 3 m/s. The possibility of using this X-ray LogScanner to make nondestructive measurements of properties of saw logs has been investigated. The study showed that the X-ray LogScanner measures minimum shadow diameter under bark before debarking with an accuracy comparable to a 3 D-scanner and that the sawing position could be controlled based on X-ray LogScanner measurements of the best half of the logs. The X-ray LogScanner could also be used to measure percentage of heartwood and green heartwood density.
