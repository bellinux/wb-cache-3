500|$|Although Martin Marietta {{completed}} its AEC contract and its lease expired on December 21, 1966, {{it had to}} stay at the reactor site [...] "until radiation contamination was brought to acceptable levels". Martin Marietta partially decontaminated the site, and in April 1967 undertook a joint <b>radiological</b> <b>survey</b> with Penn State and the AEC. The survey found [...] "licensable [...] quantities of strontium-90 stayed behind as structural contamination and residual radioactivity in piping and tanks, estimated at about 0.2 curies". This met the standards for that day, although Penn State did raise questions about the contamination remaining. Strontium is chemically very similar to calcium (both are alkaline earth metals) and can be absorbed by the body, where it is chiefly incorporated into bones. Strontium-90 decays by beta decay and has a half-life of 29 years; when it is in the body, its radioactivity can lead to bone cancer and leukemia.|$|E

The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has amended its regulations to establish residual radioactivity criteria for decommissioning of licensed nuclear facilities. In support of that rulemaking, the Commission has prepared a Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS), consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The effects of this new rulemaking on the overall cost of decommissioning are among the many factors considered in the GEIS.

One Hundred twenty- five environmental <b>radiological</b> <b>surveys</b> were performed during the second quarter of 1996, twenty nine at the active waste sites and ninety six at the inactive waste sites. Contamination above background levels Wag found at three of the active waste sites and fifteen of the inactive waste sites. Contamination levels as high as 65, 000 disintegrations per minute (dpm) were reported. Of these contaminated surveys seven were in Underground Radioactive Material (URM) areas and one was in an unposted area. The contamination found within three of the URM areas was immediately cleaned up and no further action was required. In the remaining four sites the areas were posted and will require decontamination. At the site where there was no posting, the contamination was below action levels, however, Site Support Services was notified. Radiological Problem Reports (RPR`s) were issued and the sites were turned over to the landlord for further action if required.
