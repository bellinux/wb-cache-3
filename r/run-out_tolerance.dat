40|$|The {{predominant}} {{trend in}} paper machines is towards an increased running speed. At the same time, the paper produced {{must have a}} higher and more even quality. In printing papers the main end-use properties and quality components are runnability, printability, and print quality. These coexistent requirements create new demands for the behaviour of rolls under production conditions. High quality printing paper grades are coated. In blade coating {{the thickness of the}} coating film on the paper surface is found to be heavily dependent on the run-out of the backing roll which supports the paper web against the metering blade. The <b>run-out</b> <b>tolerance</b> of backing rolls at running speed has lately been 50  µm and should be substantially reduced in the future. The new tolerances can no longer be met by tightening the traditional roll manufacturing tolerances. A new predictive 3 D grinding method has been developed to improve roll behaviour in the paper production environment. It consists of a measuring system, which can verify the rotational and geometry errors of the roll at running speed, and a 3 D grinding system, which controls the grinding process according to the information gained by these measurements. In this study, the new method was applied to the backing rolls of a coating station. The experiments were carried out in a paper mill, on a medium-weight coated (MWC) paper production line. The paper was analysed before and after the predictive 3 D grinding. The predictive 3 D grinding reduced the machine direction (MD) ash variation caused by the backing rolls by an average of 76  %. Ash variation correlates well with coating variation. As a result of a more even coating film, MD gloss variation was reduced by 82  %. Reduced gloss variation improves the print quality of LWC paper. The variation in thickness caused by the backing rolls was reduced by 74  %. More even paper thickness reduces excitations and therefore improves runnability in calendering, winding, and printing. A new paradigm for roll grinding was set. The applications of the technology are not limited to high-speed paper machine rolls; the method can also be applied to different kinds of nips of rolls. The method can compensate for a systematic error causing nip force variation, such as uneven thermal expansion or the uneven flexural stiffness of a roll. The technology can be applied in different industries, such as the steel, plastics, or aluminium industries. With this method, it is also possible to use rolls in applications which have requirements too high to be met by traditional technology. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} geometric tolerances on the rotating shafts natural frequencies. Due to modeling the tolerances, a code is written in MATLAB 2013 software that produces deviated points. Deviated points are controlled by different geometric tolerances, including cylindricity, total <b>run-out</b> and coaxiality <b>tolerances.</b> Final surfaces and models passing through the points are created using SolidWorks 2013 software and finally modal analysis is carried out with the FE software. It is observed whatever the natural frequency is higher or the geometric tolerances are greater, the real and ideal shafts natural frequencies are more distant. Also difference percentage between ideal and real frequencies is investigated. The {{results show that the}} percentage value is approximately constant for every mode shapes...|$|R
40|$|Study {{of surface}} quality and {{machining}} accuracy {{of a deep}} hole in the camshaft in manufacturing environment is conducted to make recommendations to eliminate emerging stress concentrators on the hole surface after machining and arising cracks while the engine is in operation. So {{it is important to}} conduct a comprehensive task-driven study to determine qualitative and quantitative values of arithmetical mean deviation of the surface roughness profile (parameter of height) and available stress concentrators, as well as to define regularities of changing accuracy parameters for deep-hole length such as deviation size, radial <b>run-out,</b> and geometric <b>tolerance</b> in cross section. A guide diameter of the drill bushing and an outer diameter of the cutting part of one-sided cut have been determined too. A camshaft casting from ductile iron HF 65 - 48 - 1 was processed in the automatic line on the machine "Hȕller" by a drill with the cutting head from the hard alloy VK 6 with simultaneously rotating workpiece and tool. The drill was guided through drill bushing from solid alloy VK 15. The measurement results showed that in 53 % of samples there were tears and scratches up to 0. 15 mm in depth, which could serve as stress concentrators and in the process of operation encourage growth of cracks in the bulk of the camshaft material. A significantly increasing value of the radial run-out size and all six studied harmonic components show that there is a deviation of the hole axis (run) from the nominal (specified) position and faceting available with their copied (increased) values along {{the entire length of the}} hole. This is a qualitative confirmation that in processing the holes in parts made from grey cast iron, there is a mechanism of copying errors earlier available. It is found that the size of a clearance between guide diameter of drill bushing and diameter of tool gage ribbon makes 0. 150 mm and almost 3 times exceeds the recommended value. All this reduces resistance, promotes a wear of the guide elements and a gauge part of the tool. In turn, these reasons create favorable conditions for built-up edge on calibrating and cutting parts of the one-sided cuts which contribute to tears and scratches on the surface of the camshaft hole. Thus, the causes and the mechanism of appearing stress concentrators and their possible growth in the bulk of the material during camshaft operation have been defined. As the wear mechanisms of guide bushing of various drill bits are different, it is advised to settle no more than 80 processing cycles for bushing and at most 63 cycles for drills. The technological operation content on deep drilling to be made has to contain a mandatory checking of the diametral clearance between the drill bushing hole and the calibrating part of the drill, which must be of 0. 055 mm at most. It is recommended to introduce a drill size m= 0. 26 0. 39 mm in its working drawing because it is unavailable there. It allows to reduce deviation of drill cutting part from the nominal position, tool vibration, run of axis and faceting the camshaft holes. The elaborated recommendations can be used in the development of similar drilling operations. </p...|$|R
