5|$|The Ottawa {{writing system}} is a minor {{adaptation}} of a very similar one used for other dialects of Ojibwe in Ontario and the United States, and widely employed in <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> and text collections. Sometimes {{referred to as the}} Double Vowel system because it uses doubled vowel symbols to represent Ottawa long vowels that are paired with corresponding short vowels, it is an adaptation attributed to Charles Fiero of the linguistically oriented system found in publications such as Leonard Bloomfield’s Eastern Ojibwa. Letters of the English alphabet substitute for specialized phonetic symbols, in conjunction with orthographic conventions unique to Ottawa. The system embodies two basic principles: (1) alphabetic letters from the English alphabet are used to write Ottawa, but with Ottawa sound values; (2) the system is phonemic in nature, in that each letter or letter combination indicates its basic sound value, and does not reflect all the phonetic detail that occurs. Accurate pronunciation cannot be learned without consulting a fluent speaker.|$|E

30|$|Whatever the explanation, {{according}} to our results, it seems fair to state that the <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> used for the PRMC test today does not in a satisfactory degree {{take into account the}} effect of age (or height) on lung clearance, which is most evident for children under 14  years of age. This is not surprising since our <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> is based upon a cross-sectional study of 53 healthy never-smoking adults (18 to 84  years) meaning that predictive norms have been extrapolated for ages < 18.

40|$|It has {{not been}} common {{practice}} to calibrate optical systems for measuring full-field strain distributions. Consequently it {{has not been}} possible to identify and then cite the uncertainties associated with such measurements. A draft standard on the calibration of optical systems for measuring strain was produced by the European SPOTS project in 2006. The SPOTS standard proposes a <b>reference</b> <b>material,</b> a methodology for calibration and recommendations for quantifying the uncertainties associated with the <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> and the calibration experiment. The <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> generates a reproducible and predictable strain distribution. A comparison between the measured and predicted strain in the gauge section of the <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> allows the uncertainties in the data to be evaluated. A judgment on the acceptability of the calibration can be made by considering these uncertainties together with knowledge of the uncertainty in the <b>reference</b> <b>material.</b> The data also contributes to quantifying the uncertainty in subsequent measurements made with the calibrated instrument.

25|$|Most {{people in}} Taiwan romanize their names using a {{variation}} of Wade-Giles. This simplified version employs no diacritics (tone marks, apostrophes and umlauts) and, in semi- and unofficial contexts, does not follow the standard capitalization conventions of Wade-Giles. Under Wade-Giles, the first letter in the second character of the given names is generally lower case, but Taiwanese names tend not to follow this practice. For example, Lü Hsiu-lien is often written as Lu Hsiu-Lien. The use of Wade-Giles is generally not out of personal preference but because this system {{has been used by}} most government offices' <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> in Taiwan to date.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the characterization of}} a purified human thyroglobulin (Tg) <b>reference</b> <b>material,</b> and details the procedures used in its certification. The purified Tg {{is intended to be}} used as a primary <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> to establish calibration of working serum based <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> for immunoassay procedures. The programme involved the participation of 15 European laboratories and one laboratory from the United States. The physicochemical characterization showed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting that the purified Tg had for the major part the expected molecular size of 660 kDa with traces of lower molecular forms. The amino acid composition was close to that demonstrated for the cDNA and the content of iodine was in keeping with a moderately to highly iodinated Tg. The mass concentration in <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> RM 457 is certified to be (0. 324 +/- 0. 018) g/L on the basis of protein determined by the Lowry method and supported by nitrogen determination, absorbance measurement, and amino acid analysis.
