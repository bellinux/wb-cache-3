25|$|AMS Production Group was {{formally}} started in 1982, with $25,000 in {{loans from the}} founder Andy Streitfeld's friends and relatives. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the company grew in size and eventually moved out of Streitfeld's back bedroom and into rented warehouse space at KDFI-TV (Channel 27) in Irving, Texas. Two years later, the company moved into its own office building inside the Las Colinas Communications Complex, beginning its reputation as a full-fledged production company and signing clients such as <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack</b> and JC Penney.|$|E

25|$|The last 8-bit {{version of}} CP/M was version 3, often called CP/M Plus, {{released}} in 1983. It incorporated the bank switching memory management of MP/M in a single-user single-task operating system compatible with CP/M 2.2 applications. CP/M 3 could therefore use more than 64 kB of memory on an 8080 or Z80 processor. The {{system could be}} configured to support date stamping of files. The operating system distribution software also included a relocating assembler and linker. CP/M 3 was available for the last generation of 8-bit computers, notably the Amstrad PCW, the ZX Spectrum +3, the Commodore 128, and the <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack</b> TRS-80 Model 4.|$|E
25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his <b>radio</b> <b>shack</b> by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the month, Sea Devil {{entered the}} East China Sea and turned toward the Kyūshū coast. On 1December, just prior to midnight, she made radar contact with a distant convoy and {{commenced}} running with the state-five sea on four engines to gain position. At 02:39 on 2December, she changed course to close the convoy. A minute later, she took a wave over the bridge which knocked the starboard lookout onto the bridge deck; flooded the main induction and both engine rooms to the lower deck plates; and sent water through the supply line into the after battery compartment, the crew's mess, and the <b>radio</b> <b>shack.</b> A solid stream came into the control room via the conning tower. But, other than numerous electrical grounds, no damage was sustained.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May 1985, Reyat {{bought a}} Micronta digital {{automobile}} clock at the <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack</b> store in Duncan. Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, {{it could also}} be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer, but he returned a week later for an electrical relay after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls between Parmar's residence in Vancouver and Reyat from either his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island that month, which got Reyat added to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities. The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003 when at first {{he said he did not}} know what three clocks he had bought could be used for. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. In that case, the relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a blasting cap which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives such as dynamite.|$|E
500|$|When {{amendments}} to the U.S. Neutrality Acts in late 1941 allowed United States merchant ships to be armed for service in the Atlantic, West Nohno became the first vessel so equipped when a large deck gun and three anti-aircraft gun emplacements were installed by workers at the Tietjen & Lang Drydock in Hoboken, New Jersey in late November.

50|$|Under {{the name}} Big Five Software, Bill Hogue {{programmed}} commercial computer {{games in the}} late 1970s for <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack's</b> TRS-80 Model I home computer. He created several games patterned after actual arcade games, such as Super Nova (Asteroids), Attack Force (Targ), Cosmic Fighter (Astro Fighter), Galaxy Invasion (Galaxian), Meteor Mission II (Lunar Rescue), Robot Attack (Berzerk), and Defense Command (Missile Command). Robot Attack was the first commercial game for the TRS-80 to feature digitized voice.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Dragon" [...] for {{the club}} was derived from Kramer's Dragon Computer (a European version of <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack's</b> Color Computer), which hosted a local Bulletin Board System ("The Dragon") that {{initially}} served as a central hub for both organizations. The inaugural Dragon*Con flyers debuted at the 1986 Atlanta Worldcon, ConFederation. Within a year, Dragon*Con had been selected to be {{the host of the}} 1990 Origins convention, to take place at the Atlanta Hilton.|$|R
500|$|Beck {{began as}} a folk musician, {{switching}} between country blues, Delta blues and more traditional rural folk music in his teens. He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions. [...] "I'd {{get on the bus}} and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up," [...] he later recalled. He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops. [...] "We had <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack</b> mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft people in the audience to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape," [...] Beck recalled.|$|E
500|$|The company touted Cosby's {{education}} and rapport with adults and children. The campaign {{was aimed at}} parents, rather than children, as was the campaign for the Commodore 64. [...] Cosby was {{the face of a}} mystery rebate program, offering reimbursements of between $3 and $1,000. J. Fred Bucy, who was head of Texas Instruments' home computer operation in 1983, scrapped Cosby's advertisements to focus on the product's educational value. <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack</b> vice-president of marketing David Beckerman said, [...] "A celebrity draws attention to the product. Even if we had President Reagan on our ads, we wouldn't sell any more computers. A product sells itself. A celebrity causes indirect sales." [...] Cosby, along with entrepreneur James Bruce Llewellyn, bought stock in a Philadelphia Coca-Cola bottler in 1983 as part of the company's push to increase African American participation in the company. This was, in part, a response to pressure by Jesse Jackson's PUSH campaign.|$|E
500|$|David Lovering {{was born}} in Burlington, Massachusetts. He learned to play drums during his teenage years and joined his high school's marching band. According to his friend John Murphy, Lovering was always very [...] "drum oriented" [...] in his musical taste. In his high school {{yearbook}} entry, Lovering stated his three main ambitions: {{to be in a}} rock band, to be an electrical engineer, and to tour with Rush, his favorite band. After graduating from high school, Lovering studied electronic engineering at the Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. He got a job at a <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack</b> store with Murphy, and the pair often played practical jokes while at work. One such incident involved Lovering wiring the store toilet to a fire alarm. After graduating from Wentworth with a bachelor's degree in 1982, he took a job building lasers, and continued to drum in local bands such as Iz Wizard and Riff Raff. A number of different genres of music have influenced him, including bands [...] Steely Dan, Led Zeppelin, and Devo.|$|E
50|$|With {{fewer than}} 100 stores, far {{fewer than the}} aggressively {{expanding}} <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack's</b> thousands of local outlets, Lafayette Radio remained more of a dedicated enthusiasts' store than a mass marketer. The company was also hurt by the advent of electronics retailers relying on aggressive marketing techniques and competitive pricing in the late 1970s. Many experienced managers departed. Formerly a national chain, the remaining Lafayette stores {{in the state of}} New York closed by the end of 1981.|$|R

It could hold an additional three 8" [...] disk drives {{or up to}} four 8.4Mb hard drives (the Model II allowed three external floppy drives to be daisy-chained to it). In 1981, the 64K Model II computer was $3,350 and the [...] "primary unit" [...] 8.4Mb hard disk another $4,040 by mail-order from <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack's</b> dealer in Perry, Michigan; MSRP in the company's own stores was higher.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 {{the company}} {{branched}} {{out into the}} TRS-80 market, starting with the Percom Separator, and add-on device that corrected deficiencies in <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack's</b> own floppy disk interface. In 1980 they introduced the Percom Doubler, the first double-density floppy disk for the TRS-80 platform. They later introduced Electric Crayon, a color graphics system that communicated with the TRS-80 through the printer port and output to a separate composite monitor or color television. Floppy disks for the Atari 8-bit family were also introduced during this period.|$|R
500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from <b>Radio</b> <b>Shack,</b> the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with something that looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E
