40|$|Although first {{discovered}} in viruses, {{previous studies have}} identified operational − 1 ribosomal frameshifting (− 1 <b>RF)</b> <b>signals</b> in eukaryotic genomic sequences, and suggested a role in mRNA stability. Here, four yeast − 1 <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> are shown to promote significant mRNA destabilization through the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD), and genetic evidence is presented suggesting that they may also operate through the no-go decay pathway (NGD) as well. Yeast EST 2 mRNA is highly unstable and contains up to five − 1 <b>RF</b> <b>signals.</b> Ablation of the − 1 <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> or of NMD stabilizes this mRNA, and changes in − 1 RF efficiency have opposing effects on the steady-state abundance of the EST 2 mRNA. These results demonstrate that endogenous − 1 <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> function as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast. Consistent with current evolutionary theory, phylogenetic analyses suggest that − 1 <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> are rapidly evolving cis-acting regulatory elements.

40|$|Abstract — Bandpass {{sampling}} {{can be used}} {{by radio}} receivers to directly digitize the radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>signals.</b> Although the bandpass sampling theory for single-band <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> is well established, its counterpart for multiband <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> is relatively immature. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method to find the ranges of valid bandpass sampling frequency for direct downconverting multiband <b>RF</b> <b>signals.</b> Simple formulas for the ranges of valid bandpass sampling frequency in terms of the frequency locations of the multiple RF bands are derived. The result can be used to design a multiband receiver for software defined radios.

40|$|This letter {{introduces}} a novel wireless-powered backscatter communication system which allows sensors to utilize <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted from a dedicated RF energy source to transmit data.

25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{transmitters}} work {{by mixing}} a radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>signal</b> {{of a specific}} frequency, the carrier wave, with the signal to be broadcast. The result {{is a set of}} frequencies with a strong peak signal at the carrier frequency, and smaller signals from the carrier frequency plus the maximum frequency of the signal, and the carrier frequency minus the maximum frequency of the signal. That is, the resulting signal has a spectrum with twice the bandwidth of the original input signal. In conventional AM radio, this signal is then sent to the radio frequency amplifier, and then to the broadcast antenna. Due {{to the nature of the}} amplification process, the quality of the resulting signal can be defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum signal energy. Normally the maximum signal energy will be the carrier itself, perhaps twice as powerful as the mixed signals.|$|E

30|$|Sampling {{frequency}} {{selection is}} a key issue in direct digitalization of the radio frequency (<b>RF)</b> <b>signals.</b> In this paper, we propose a cylindrical surface spectrum and arc distance-based sampling frequency selection method for multiband <b>RF</b> <b>signals.</b> In this method, a 3 D visual expression of cylindrical surface spectrum of digital signal is introduced. This expression reflects better the circulatory nature of the spectrum of digital signals. It is found more intuitive, heuristic, and effective in dealing with undersampling issues of multiband <b>RF</b> <b>signals</b> than conventional spectrum expressions are. A function of arc distance between two frequency bands are also introduced {{which turns out to}} be useful in the determination of sampling frequency and design of digital filters.|$|R

2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. [...] In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both {{above and below the}} rail during operation.

2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband <b>RF</b> <b>signal</b> is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same symbol rate (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E
