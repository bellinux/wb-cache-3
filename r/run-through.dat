5|$|The {{date for}} Harrison's <b>run-through</b> of songs for Spector, at Abbey Road Studios, is {{generally}} {{thought to have}} been 20 May 1970, the same day as the Let It Be film's world premiere, with recording sessions beginning on 26 May. With assistance from former Beatles engineers Ken Scott and Phil McDonald, Spector recorded most of the album's backing tracks live, in some cases featuring multiple drummers and keyboard players, and as many as five rhythm guitarists.|$|E

25|$|In the 5th category, the Trainee {{immediately}} starts Specialty Training (ST1 {{instead of}} CT1) progressing up to Consultant level without break or further competitive application process (<b>Run-Through</b> Training). Most of the <b>run-through</b> schemes are in stand-alone specialties (such as Radiology, Public Health or Histopathology), {{but there are}} also a few traditionally Surgical specialities which can be entered directly without completing Core Surgical Training - Neurosurgery, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Ophthalmology. The length of this training varies, for example General Practice is 3 years while Radiology is 5 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{cast and}} crew moved to Studio D at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios on Saturday 11 December 1954 for a full camera {{rehearsal}} and <b>run-through.</b> Rehearsals continued the following day until shortly before transmission, which began at 20:37 Sunday 12 December and continued for {{the best part of}} two hours.|$|E
25|$|During construction, several tracks may {{be taken}} out of service due to their extension. To make up for the {{temporary}} loss of those platforms, track 13 was revitalized for use and tracks 14 & 15 were re-constructed. The project was completed on October 17, 2012. Once the SCRIP project is finished, the <b>run-through</b> tracks and tracks 13–14 will be in regular use (track 15 will be used for storage), resulting in a 40% increase in track capacity.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the season proved less successful for Fernández. Although considered a medal favorite at the 2012 Europeans, he finished sixth. At the 2012 World Championships, Fernandez placed fifth in the short program but dropped to ninth overall after the free skate. After these results, he agreed to perform full <b>run-throughs</b> of his programs more frequently in practice.|$|R
5000|$|New York Times critic Ben Ratliff {{described}} Meets the Rhythm Section as [...] "an honest record; if {{you believe}} the story of its making, you'd have to conclude that Pepper, unprepared and unarmored, was forced to pull the music out of himself, since tepid <b>run-throughs</b> and stock licks weren't going to work in such exalted company." ...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in November/December 2015, {{preparations}} for the parade were well attended at the unit level. Individual unit practices were held in the various military installations for all the participating units in the national and local parades. Unit practices within Moscow Oblast itself started in early March in the Alabino field before the full blown parade practice <b>run-throughs</b> for all the participating units will commence.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 2012, Norfolk Southern painted 10 EMD SD70ACes and 10 GE ES44ACs as special {{heritage}} units, each bearing the paint schemes and markings of the various predecessor railroads of Norfolk Southern and Conrail. On July 1–3, 2012, all 20 units gathered together at the North Carolina Transportation Museum at Spencer, North Carolina, as the highlight of NS's 30th-anniversary celebration. The locomotives have since traveled throughout the United States on various Class I railroads as <b>run-through</b> pool power, attracting much attention from railfans.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{sections}} were opened, the MBTA planned to connect the Washington Street and Waterfront sections with a downtown tunnel. This proposed Phase III would consist of an underground busway running from Washington Street to South Station via Boylston station on the Green Line. The tunnel would allow <b>run-through</b> service and remove buses from downtown traffic, as well as connecting the Green Line to South Station apart from crowded Park Street station. The core tunnel from Boylston to South Station via Chinatown was to run under Essex Street, while four possible routings under downtown streets were considered for the section connecting Boylston to Washington Street. Capital cost was originally estimated at around $780 million, depending on the route chosen for the southern section, with completion in 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, in {{an effort}} to earn money to finance his planned folk opera, Gershwin hosted his own radio program titled Music by Gershwin. The show was {{broadcast}} on the NBC Blue Network from February to May and again in September through the final show on December 23, 1934. He presented his own work as well as the work of other composers. Recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his Variations on I Got Rhythm, portions of the Concerto in F, and numerous songs from his musical comedies. He also recorded a <b>run-through</b> of his Second Rhapsody, conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos. Gershwin recorded excerpts from Porgy and Bess with members of the original cast, conducting the orchestra from the keyboard; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers. In 1935 RCA Victor asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from Porgy and Bess; these were his last recordings.|$|E
50|$|After {{failing to}} make the Canadian team for the 1968 Winter Olympics, Cranston {{struggled}} with motivation and lack of training discipline. His career turned a corner in the following season {{when he began to}} work with coach Ellen Burka in Toronto. Burka required him to do complete <b>run-throughs</b> of his entire program and his results began to improve: third at the Canadian championships in 1969, and second in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|... "Including <b>run-throughs,</b> 'Start Me Up' {{took about}} six hours to record. You see, if they all played the right chords in the right time, went to the chorus {{at the right time}} and got to the middle eight together, that was a master. It was like, 'Oh, wow!' Don't forget, they would never sit down and work out a song. They would jam it and the song would evolve out of that. That's their magic..." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an April 2012 interview, Joubert {{said that}} he prefers to {{practice}} programs in parts: [...] "I like to train the programs in pieces {{over and over to}} know in order to really know them by heart. ... Later, you have to combine both - skating a lot of pieces and skating the programs as a whole. Doing <b>run-throughs</b> all the time is something that I don't like and don't feel comfortable with." ...|$|R
500|$|... between 1955 and 1960. He {{tried to}} {{encourage}} CBS {{to do other}} shows in color at the facility, but CBS mostly avoided color broadcasting after the network's television set manufacturing division was discontinued in 1951. By 1959, Skelton was the only comedian with a weekly variety television show; others who remained on the air, such as Danny Thomas, were performing their routines as part of situation comedy programs. He performed a preview show for a studio audience on Mondays, using their reactions to determine which skits needed to be edited for the Tuesday program. [...] For the Tuesday afternoon <b>run-through</b> prior to the actual show, he ignored the script for the most part, ad-libbing through it at will. The <b>run-through</b> was well attended by CBS Television City employees Sometimes during sketches, both live telecasts and taped programs, Skelton would break up or cause his guest stars to laugh.|$|E
500|$|Bayer {{asked the}} group to perform [...] "Vow" [...] live while he filmed the takes for the video shoot. Garbage had never {{performed}} live as group prior to this, and had initially had not considered ever performing live onstage. [...] "We set up amps and played the guitars. Butch was pounding away and Shirley had a live mic. After the first <b>run-through,</b> we all {{looked at each other}} and said, 'This feels really good.'" [...] Erikson later recalled. The group enjoyed the experience of performing together so much that they quickly changed their minds, and scheduled tourdates later that year.|$|E
500|$|During the rehearsals, the duo {{took out}} two {{production}} numbers, [...] "Wake Up, Little Theatre" [...] and [...] "Dance", {{concerned that the}} show was running long. The actress playing Juliet in the internal play {{proved to be a}} fine singer but a poor actress; she was replaced by Helena Scott. Abbott had few negative comments after the final New York <b>run-through,</b> and the company entrained for Cleveland, site of the first tryouts, in high spirits, sleeping little on the train ride. RCA Records put up the $350,000 cost of the production in exchange for a fifty-percent interest and rights to the original cast recording.|$|E
5000|$|Lowery {{signed to}} Psychopathic Records, and {{recorded}} his second album, Hatchet Warrior, released on April 8, 2003. It peaked at #4 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart, #42 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #98 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "Mostly, Hatchet Warrior is a rehash of Records mystique. References to Faygo abound and shout-outs to Detroit and the Juggalos are frequent, {{while much of}} ABK et al.'s raps are workmanlike <b>run-throughs</b> of familiar themes".|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} Central of Georgia (CofG) took {{delivery}} of E8s 811 and 812, {{they were sent}} to Chicago and repainted in IC colors, returning to the CofG only on diesel <b>run-throughs</b> of IC power. They were used on the IC system. As a result, the IC supplied power to the City of Miami from Chicago to Miami and in the mid-1960s on the Seminole between Chicago and Columbus, Georgia. These engines were returned to the CofG after Amtrak came into being, but were retired from service.|$|R
50|$|Cesario {{made her}} {{international}} debut in 2010 {{when she won}} the 2010 Gardena Spring Trophy on the junior level. The following season, she made her ISU Junior Grand Prix debut, competing at the JGP in Romania where she placed 4th. After winning 2011 Eastern Sectionals she withdrew from the 2011 U.S. Championships due to a back injury. She spent eight weeks in a hard cast. She was later diagnosed with an arthritic facet joint and was administered a cortisone shot {{to be able to}} train full <b>run-throughs.</b>|$|R
500|$|Rick Millikan {{selected}} Lisa Jane Persky, {{who was at}} the top of his casting [...] "wish list", for {{the role}} of Laura. In the middle of filming, a cast member withdrew from the production for religious reasons. A mother withdrew her baby from the cast during the final <b>run-through</b> of the [...] "cursed-birth" [...] scene. Although a fan of the show, as a devout Catholic she was uncomfortable with her child representing a demon. Director Rob Bowman assured her that the production staff understood her dilemma; the casting staff called down and found a replacement in less than 45 minutes. It was the first time during the filming of the series that a cast-member withdrew for religious reasons.|$|E
500|$|Undertale soundtrack {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics {{as part of the}} success of the game, in particular for its use of various leitmotifs for the various characters used throughout various tracks. In particular, [...] "Hopes and Dreams", the boss theme when fighting Asriel in the <b>run-through</b> where the player avoids killing any monster, brings back most of the main character themes, and is [...] "a perfect way to cap off your journey", according to USgamer's Nadia Oxford. Oxford notes this track in particular demonstrates Fox's ability to [...] "turning old songs into completely new experiences", used throughout the game's soundtrack. Tyler Hicks of GameSpot compared the music to [...] "bit-based melodies".|$|E
500|$|This version also {{appeared}} on the January 2002 posthumous release of the [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] single – a three-song charity CD comprising the original 1970–71 hit, the acoustic <b>run-through</b> of [...] "Let It Down" [...] (with recent overdubs, another 2001 bonus track), and Harrison's reworking of the title song. Proceeds from the single went to the Material World Charitable Foundation, set up by Harrison in April 1973. For some months after the single's release, a portion of [...] "My Sweet Lord (2000)" [...] played on Harrison's official website, on a constant loop, over screen images of lotus petals scattering and then re-forming. The song also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968–75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{practice}} session must be attended by the players, {{it does not}} involve all the formal elements of a regular practice. Especially absent will be normally routine conditioning drills; probably absent also will be <b>run-throughs</b> of plays and extensive chalk-talks by the coaches. The practice may consist largely of players practicing their shooting in an unstructured manner, with five or six players shooting at one basket, rebounding others' shots and continuing this informal type of practice [...] - [...] hence the term [...] "shootaround." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2010-11 season, Verner changed coaches, and began {{training}} with Robert Emerson in Richmond Hill, near Toronto. Whereas in Europe, he typically trained his program in parts, with full <b>run-throughs</b> only before a competition, his new coach requires complete <b>run-throughs</b> in everyday training. Verner won the bronze at 2010 Cup of China, his first Grand Prix event of the year. At the 2010 Cup of Russia, Verner set a new personal best in the long program and beat Patrick Chan and Jeremy Abbott to win his first senior Grand Prix title. He was the only person to beat Patrick Chan in international competition during the 2010-2011 season. He qualified for the 2010-2011 Grand Prix Final, where he finished fifth in the short program and fourth in the free skate for fifth place overall. His next event was the Czech national championships, which he won {{for the first time in}} three years. Verner was fifth in the short program at the 2011 Europeans following a fall on his triple Axel, but finished second in the free skate to move up to third overall. The bronze medal was his first podium finish at the Europeans since winning the event in 2008.|$|R
50|$|In March 2014, Krasnozhon {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} compete for the United States and would be coached by Peter Cain and Darlene Cain in Euless, Texas. He qualified for the 2015 US Championships on the junior level and won the pewter medal. On July 1, 2015, the Russian Figure Skating Federation released Krasnozhon so that he could compete internationally for the United States. While training in Moscow, Krasnozhon performed full <b>run-throughs</b> of his programs about once a week, but he began doing them daily after moving to Texas.|$|R
500|$|The Binding of Isaac {{has been}} {{received}} by reviewers {{as a game}} with high replayability with the extensive range and combinations of power-ups that the player can encounter during a <b>run-through,</b> while providing an accessible Zelda-inspired framework that most video game players would recognize and easily come to understand. John Teti for Eurogamer praised the game for its replayability through the randomization aspects, calling it [...] "the most accessible exploration of the roguelike idea" [...] that he had seen. Edges similarly commented on the lure to replay the game due to its short playthrough time, calling it [...] "an imaginative and quick-witted arcade experience that manages to be both depraved and strangely sweet by turn". GameSpot's Maxwell McGee stated that the game smartly has removed extraneous features such that [...] "what remains is a tightly focused game that continues to feel fresh even after multiple completions". Though the game {{is considered to be}} accessible to new players, reviewers found the game to be a difficult challenge, often set by the randomness of what power-ups the player happened to acquire during a single run. Writers for The A.V. Club rated the game an A on a grading scale, and favorably compared the title to McMillen's Super Meat Boy, requiring the player to have [...] "masochistic patience in the face of terrible odds". This difficulty was considered mitigated by the large number of possible power-ups that the game offers, most would not be seen by players until they have replayed the game many times. McGee noted that while players can review what items they have discovered prior to a <b>run-through,</b> this feature does not explain what each item does, leaving the effect to be determined by the player while in game.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{put forward}} [...] "Let It Down", along {{with as many}} as nine other compositions, during the Get Back sessions. On 2 January, before the arrival of bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr for the first day of filming, he debuted the song to John Lennon at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London. Tapes from this session reveal Lennon struggling with the song's chord changes, during a <b>run-through</b> that authors Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt describe as an [...] "excellent performance by George... seriously marred by John's distracting accompaniment on guitar". Once the film project was under way, a combination of Lennon's barbed criticism of Harrison's songwriting and McCartney's attempts to [...] "dominate" [...] him musically, as Starr later put it, resulted in Harrison walking out on 10 January, apparently having quit the band for good. Doggett observes that, for Harrison, there had been [...] "no relief from the tension" [...] that week, since an upset Boyd had recently left Kinfauns to stay with friends in London.|$|E
500|$|At London's Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970, Harrison {{performed}} [...] "Let It Down" [...] among {{a selection}} of songs for Spector, {{with a view to}} narrowing down the amount of material that they would be recording for All Things Must Pass. Along with compositions that have yet to see release, including [...] "Window, Window", [...] "Nowhere to Go", [...] "Cosmic Empire" [...] and [...] "Mother Divine", this solo acoustic version of [...] "Let It Down" [...] became available in 1994 on a bootleg titled Beware of ABKCO! In January 2001, Harrison included the song, along with a similar <b>run-through</b> of [...] "Beware of Darkness", as one of five bonus tracks on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass; in his liner notes, he states that he had been unaware that the session was ever recorded. Harrison added acoustic lead guitar to the song, as well as a string-synthesizer part played by Ray Cooper, both recorded at Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT, during 2000.|$|E
50|$|Offenbach {{had heard}} Louise Théo singing in café-concert in Paris and {{although}} {{her voice was}} unremarkable, her stage presence made him decide to centre his next stage work around her. <b>Run-throughs</b> of the opera {{took place during the}} summer of 1873 at the 'Villa Orphée' home in Étretat which Offenbach had built and furnished with the royalties from Orphée aux Enfers. Théo's success in Pomme d'api stimulated Offenbach to create a full-length work around her for the Renaissance. In seven weeks he composed La jolie parfumeuse, which, as with the one-act piece, perfectly suited her talent.|$|R
50|$|Long Jumpers tend to {{practice}} jumping 1-2 times a week. Approaches, or <b>run-throughs,</b> are repeated sometimes up to 6-8 times per session.Short approach jumps are common for jumpers to do, as {{it allows for}} them to work on specific technical aspects of their jumps in a controlled environment. Using equipment such as low hurdles and other obstacles are common in long jump training, as it helps the jumper maintain and hold phases of their jump. As a common rule, {{it is important for}} the jumper to engage in full approach jumps at least once a week, as it will prepare the jumper for competition.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{printing}} is {{the oldest}} automated printing method still in use today. Surface machines lay down very heavy amounts of ink. Because the ink is pushed onto the paper, the images are not as crisp as the other methods. Also, there is no drying stage between laying down each color, so the order of color <b>run-throughs</b> {{is very important to}} keep the inks from running into each other. Because of the amount of ink required for impressions, and the inexact image rendering, surface printing has a very distinct look. It is especially well suited for multi-colored floral patterns and classic document designs. Surface printers can usually print up to 12 colors.|$|R
