40|$|Besides a {{long period}} of using {{acoustic}} methods in fishery research, their practical application was mostly limited to fish stock assessment. In reality, the acoustic methods could be applied for a significant development of the multi-factor empirical model of the marine ecosystem. The paper presents one of new concepts of treatment of acoustic data collected during routine surveys. Traditionally, the results of sounding are presented in the form of echograms, where the information on fish distribution is dispersed over many meters of <b>recording</b> <b>paper.</b> In the method proposed, called macrosounding, a graphic picture of vertical fish density distribution is generated by a computer, according to different scales chosen in relation to a spatial and time correlation of the observed phenomena. The picture can be enriched by other factors, such as isotherms or isohalines, {{with the use of a}} multi-dimensional matrix of environmental, biological, and acoustic data from the surveyed area. Such a presentation, being easier to interpret for all marine scientists, gives wider possibilities of a multi-factor analysis of ecosystem features and allows to determine important relationships.

40|$|In recent {{publications}} {{from our}} laboratories, a technique using dual {{pulse height analyzer}} count rate systems has been described for electronic subtraction of one gamma photopeak from another allowing unhindered visualization of a second photopeak. By this method, subtraction of the 198 Auphotopeak from the 75 Se photopeak permits elimination of the liver scan from the pancreatic scan (1 - 3). Applying similar circuitry to a commercially available color scanner, 2 the instrument may be modified to simultaneously scan two isotopes which emit photons of two different energy levels and display on the <b>recording</b> <b>paper</b> the distribution of each isotope in a different color. The overlying parts are displayed in intermediate colors or shades of two colors.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{estimation}} of blood levels of methoxyflurane by gas chromatography using carbon disulphide as a solvent and toluene as an internal standard has been des-cribed. Virtually complete extraction of methoxyflurane from blood was observed and results were reproducible. Blood levels of less than 1 mg were measured without difficulty. The advantage of the internal standard technique in obviating the necessity for accurate measurement of the injected sample has been pointed out and the constancy of results {{in the face of}} changes in sample size, column temperature and carrier gas flow has been shown. Gas chromatography holds an established place in chemical analysis and in recent years its use for the measurement of anaesthetic agents has become widespread. Basically the chromatograph is comprised of an analytical column, a detector and a recorder. The sample to be analyzed is in-jected into a heated port where it is volatilized. It is then carried by an inert gas through the column to the detector. Within the column differ-ent substances are held, by a process of adsorption, for different lengths of time. Multiple compo-nents, therefore, reach the detector separately. The detector, which may be of various types, sends a signal to the recorder, for each component, which varies in intensity with the quantity pre-sent. The recorder in turn transcribes the signal on to <b>recording</b> <b>paper</b> {{in the form of a}} peak (fig. 1). The area under this peak gives an accurate indication of the quantity of agent involved. However, when the peaks are sharply defined, symmetrical, and with a relatively narrow base, it is acceptable to use the height of the peak for this estimation. Numerous techniques have already been des-cribed for the analysis of blood levels of ethe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY To assess time, staff, {{problems}} and costs involved in clinical electrophysiologic studies for documented or suspected tachycardia, 33 consecutive cases were analyzed prospectively. At least seven staff members {{were used for}} each study. Insertion of catheters required 24 - 105 minutes (mean 63 ± 20 minutes). Programmed stimulation required 12 - 210 minutes (mean 87 ± 38 minutes). Total fluoroscopy times were 6 - 67 minutes (mean 22 ± 15 minutes). Each study used 360 - 2100 feet (mean 1260 ± 390 feet) of <b>recording</b> <b>paper.</b> Detailed analysis of tracings took 1 - 11 hours (mean 5 ± 2. 5 hours). Delays occurred during elec-trophysiologic study in 25 cases (76 %), with multiple causes of delay in 14 cases (42 %). These were caused by 1) difficulty in obtaining venous access (five patients); 2) difficult initial catheter placement (15 cases); 3) repositioning of catheters during stimulation (17 cases); 4) sustained atrial fibrillation (four cases). Coronary sinus catheterization was achieved from the groin in 21 of 27 cases (78 %) in whom a sustained attempt was made. The approximate cost of each study was greater than $ 800. Our data show that clinical elec-trophysiologic studies in the investigation and management of tachycardia are difficult, time-consuming and expensive. DESPITE THEIR LIMITATIONS, clinical elec-trophysiologic studies have an established and ever-growing place in the investigation and management of cardiac tachyarrhythmias. ' These studies are invasive, time-consuming, require elaborate, expensive equip-ment, involve {{a large number of}} staff members and are difficult to perform at a satisfactory level. No data are available on these problems.

40|$|The {{cathode ray}} is {{practically}} free from inertia and therefore an ideal instrumentality for study-ing variations in electrical potential. A cathode ray oscilloscope with an amplifier system of high frequency response and an expanded time scale, 330 mm. per second, {{were employed to}} record electrocardiograms. Such tracings revealed considerable notching, slurring, and other peculiarities not seen in the conventional electrocardiographic records on the same individuals. An instrument should have a frequency response curve flat to well over 330 cycles per second to record faithfully the human electrocardiogram. This {{is much higher than}} the frequency response of instruments usually used for electrocardiography. T HE CATHODE ray oscillograph and the high speed camera are presented as a method for the more detailed study of electrocardiographic patterns. The cathode ray oscillograph has been used in electrocar-diography chiefly to study the vectorcardio-gram or QRS and T loops. Our study is concerned {{with the use of the}} cathode ray oscillograph together with a high speed camera to record the standard extremity and precordial leads. Records obtained with this method re-veal a wealth of detail that remain obscured in the conventional electrocardiographic record. Whether this additional detail will prove to be of value in routine electrocardiography has not yet been determined and will require con-siderable study. However, it seemed worth while now to present a brief account of the results obtained with this method and to report upon the application of this method to a par-ticular field of investigation for which it seems eminently suited. This field is the study of electrocardiographic patterns and their dis-tribution throughout the body and on its sur-face. In order to exploit the advantages of the cathode ray oscillograph, the time scale must be greatly expanded. This is done by increasing the speed with which the <b>recording</b> <b>paper</b> moves from the usual 25 mm. to 300 mm. per second or more. The vertical amplitude of the recor...|$|E

Participants The same CHWs collected <b>paper</b> and electronic <b>records.</b> <b>Paper</b> data contain weight and age for 320 boys and 380 girls. Electronic data contain weight and age for 922 girls and 886 boys. Electronic data were collected over 9  months; most of the data is cross-sectional, with about 330 children with time-series data.

40|$|The {{first set}} of twenty {{uncorrected}} digitized earthquake accelerograms was published in July, 1969, as Volume I, Part A, of the present series. That volume also contained introductory material and background information describing the methods used, accuracies, etc., which should be referred to by all users of the data. The San Fernando Earthquake provided records of sufficient importance that the original plan was interrupted after two parts, and Part C contained {{the first of the}} San Fernando Earthquake accelerograms. This issue continues the San Fernando accelerograms and contains fifteen records consisting of three records each from four buildings, two ground level records at the Hollywood Storage Building and the record from the Old Ridge Route at Castaic. Some comments on these records follow. ID 056. Castaic, Old Ridge Route. At 0. 97 seconds after triggering the drive mechanism malfunctioned briefly and the film was stationary for a short length of time with the recording light on. The actual time is indicated by asterisks in the computer printout and by arrows in the computer plot. The lost portion of trace can be estimated to be one to two seconds long for the following reasons. The gap between the time marks is normally 0. 5 seconds, but the particular gap spanning the missing part measures only 0. 3 seconds. Hence at least 0. 2 seconds is missing. In addition, {{at least one of the}} time marks occurred during the pause, so that the possible lengths of the pause are 0. 7, 1. 2, 1. 7, 2. 2, [...] . seconds. The maximum amplitudes of the missing traces can be ascertained from the thickness of the recorded vertical line for two of the three traces and these are less than the peak amplitudes occurring during the following one or two seconds. The changes in density along the recorded vertical line indicate that not a great many of the large oscillations of the trace took place during the pause and that a duration of 1. 2 seconds is realistic. Also the records from the Lake Hughes Array Stations 4 and 12, within 26 km of Castaic, and a similar distance from the epicenter, 25 - 29 km, indicate that the strong motion portion in this vicinity was only a few seconds in duration. These complete records show a marked similarity to that portion of the Castaic record outside the lost part, further confirming that not more than one or two seconds was lost. As another means of estimating the time lost, a laboratory test was made on the Castaic accelerograph in which the <b>recording</b> <b>paper</b> was held stationary for various time intervals with the recording light on, The intensities of the resulting traces were compatible with the above estimates. ID 057, 58, Hollywood Storage Building, Basement and P. E, Lot. The total record length for the main shock is included. ID 059, 60, 61, 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Subbasement, 9 th and 21 st Floors. The instrument on the 9 th floor several times responded with a very high frequency, 80 - 100 cps, lightly damped oscillation, probably initiated by an impact loading on the structure near the instrument. Such impacts arise from dislodged material or equipment, or safety devices operating in elevator mechanisms. These were not digitized as part of the project. The instrument on the 21 st floor operated for the same 58 - 60 seconds as the other two, but the first 11 seconds were not recorded. ID 062, 63, 64. 1640 South Marengo Street, lst, 4 th and 8 th Floors. The 1 st and 8 th floor records were digitized to 54 seconds, by which time the first aftershocks had diminished. The 4 th floor record was digitized to 98 seconds, for the total length of the record. ID 065, 66, 67. 3710 Wilshire Blvd, Basement 5 th and 10 th Floors. The instrument on the 10 th floor faces a different direction from the other two instruments and the component directions are therefore different. ID 068, 69, 70. 7080 Hollywood Blvd., Basement 6 th and 12 th Floors. The total record length for the main shock is included. As in previous reports the printout and plots contain asterisks and arrows, respectively, indicating where the record was shifted in the digitizer. Two further reports (see References) have been issued at the California Institute of Technology describing the San Fernando Earthquake. "The Engineering Features of the San Fernando Earthquake, February 9, 1971 " contains preliminary studies of some of the more important and interesting engineering features of the earthquake. The various chapters were prepared by staff and students working in Earthquake Engineering within the Division of Engineering and Applied Science. "Strong Motion Instrumental Data on the San Fernando Earthquake of February 9, 1971 ", a joint report with the Seismological Field Survey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U. S. Department of Commerce, presents an overall picture of the instrumentation results, updating and bringing together a number of preliminary reports issued by both the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory and the Seismological Field Survey.
