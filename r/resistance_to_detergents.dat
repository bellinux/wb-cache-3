25|$|Bacteria {{living in}} a biofilm usually have {{significantly}} different properties from free-floating bacteria of the same species, as the dense and protected environment of the film allows them to cooperate and interact in various ways. One benefit of this environment is increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents</b> and antibiotics, as the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect {{the interior of the}} community. In some cases antibiotic resistance can be increased a thousandfold. Lateral gene transfer is often facilitated within bacterial and archaeal biofilms and leads to a more stable biofilm structure. Extracellular DNA is a major structural component of many different microbial biofilms. Enzymatic degradation of extracellular DNA can weaken the biofilm structure and release microbial cells from the surface.|$|E
5000|$|A biofilm is a {{community}} of microorganisms adsorbed to a surface. Microorganisms in biofilms are enclosed in a polymeric matrix consisting of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and proteins. Seconds after a surface (usually metal) is placed in a solution, inorganic and organic molecules adsorb onto the surface. These molecules are attracted mainly by Coulombic forces (see above section), and can adhere very strongly to the surface. This first layer is called the conditioning layer, and {{is necessary for the}} microorganisms to bind to the surface. These microorganisms then attach reversibly by Van der Waals forces, followed by irreversible adhesion through self-produced attachment structures such as pili or flagella. [...] Biofilms form on solid substrates such as stainless steel. A biofilm's enclosing polymeric matrix offers protection to its microbes, increasing their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents</b> and cleaning agents. Biofilms on food processing surfaces can be a biological hazard to food safety. Increased chemical resistance in biofilms can lead to a persistent contamination condition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the serendipitous discovery and first characterization {{of a new}} resistant cell type from Dictyostelium, for which the name aspidocyte (from aspis: Greek for shield) is proposed. These cells are induced from amoebae by a range of toxins including heavy metals and antibiotics, and were first detected by their striking <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> lysis. Aspidocytes are separate, rounded or irregular-shaped cells, which are immotile but remain fully viable; once the toxic stress is removed, they revert to amoeboid cells within an hour. Induction takes a few hours and is completely blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Aspidocytes lack a cell wall and their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> lysis is active, requiring continued energy metabolism, and may be assisted by a complete cessation of endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the dye FM 1 - 43. Microarray analysis shows that aspidocytes have a distinct pattern of gene expression, {{with a number of}} genes up-regulated that are predicted to be involved in lipid metabolism. Aspidocytes were initially detected in a hypersensitive mutant, in which the AMP deaminase gene is disrupted, suggesting that the inductive pathway involves AMP levels or metabolism. Since aspidocytes can also be induced from wild-type cells and are much more resistant than amoebae to a membrane-disrupting antibiotic, it is possible that they are an adaptation allowing Dictyostelium cells to survive a sudden onslaught of toxins in the wild...|$|R

Here we report that the bipartite Gly-Arg repeat of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) - 1 acts as a stabilization signal that inhibits proteasomal degradation in the nucleus by promoting binding to cellular DNA. Protection can be transferred by grafting the domain to unrelated proteasomal substrates and does not involve changes of ubiquitylation. Protection is also afforded by other protein domains that, similar to the Gly-Arg repeat, mediate high avidity binding to DNA, as exemplified by <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> extraction. Our findings identify high avidity binding to DNA as a portable inhibitory signal that counteracts proteasomal degradation...|$|R

We studied the distribution of poly(A) mRNA within cultured cerebrocortical neurons using high resolution in situ hybridization to identify cytoskeletal components that may anchor mRNA. After 1 day in culture, poly(A) mRNA was distributed throughout all of the initial neurites, including the axon-like process. At 4 days in culture, poly(A) mRNA was distributed throughout the cell body and dendritic processes, but confined to the proximal segment of the axon. Poly(A) mRNA was bound to the cytoskeleton as demonstrated by <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> extraction. Perturbation of microtubules with colchicine resulted in a major reduction of dendritic poly(A) mRNA; however, this distribution was unaffected by cytochalasin.

40|$|V 8 {{protease}} (GluV 8), {{a member}} of the glutamyl endopeptidase I family isolated from the V 8 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, is widely used for proteome analysis because of its unique substrate specificity and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents.</b> We recently developed an Escherichia coli expression system for the production of GluV 8 based on a technique that suppresses the autoproteolysis—the use of the prosequence of its homologue (GluSE) from Staphylococcus epidermidis as a chimeric form or the introduction of four substitutions in the prosequence of GluV 8. In the current study, we refined this technique through five amino acid substitutions within the prosequence of GluV 8 for complete suppression of the autodegradation. As a result, the recovery of GluV 8 proform was enhanced to 20 fg/cell, which was comparable {{to the level of a}} constitutive inactive form of GluV 8, indicating complete suppression of the autoproteolysis. This mutated propeptide was also effective for the expression of the mature sequence of the glutamyl endopeptidase from Staphylococcus warneri. The recombinant proteins were successfully converted to their active forms through a common cleavage mechanism mediated by thermolysin in vitro.

The goal {{of the project was}} to determine if the hybrid systems met the requirements of the kitchen cabinet and furniture industries. Adhesion of each system to the substrate was first evaluated, and significant differences were recorded. Subsequently, resistance to heat and moisture was evaluated using hot box and hot and cold check tests. These tests indicated that the experimental systems generally performed relatively well in terms of thermal resistance, but the appearance of those prepared from solvent-borne sealers and lacquers were less stable. The chemical resistance of these systems was also studied. The ability of the finish to withstand the effects of substances typically found in a kitchen was tested, as was their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents</b> and water. All the systems performed very well in vertical testing. Volatile organic compound emissions were finally measured after conditioning times of 3 and 21 days. These tests showed that the different systems behaved quite differently. The systems prepared with solvent-borne sealers and lacquers produced a high level of VOCs {{at the beginning of the}} test, with a rapid decrease thereafter, while the opposite was observed in systems based on water-borne sealers and lacquers...|$|E
40|$|Background Despite recent {{attention}} to surface cleaning and hand hygiene programmes, multiresistant organisms (MROs) {{continue to be}} isolated from the hospital environment. Biofilms, consisting of bacteria embedded in exopolymeric substances (EPS) are difficult to remove due to their increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents</b> and disinfectants, and periodically release free-swimming planktonic bacteria back into the environment which may may act as an infection source. Aim To establish whether reservoirs of MROs exist in the environment as biofilms. Methods Following terminal cleaning, equipment and furnishings were removed aseptically from an intensive care unit (ICU) and subjected to culture and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were placed in 5 mL of tryptone soya broth, sonicated for 5 min before plate culture on horse blood agar, Brillance MRSA and Brilliance VRE agar plates. Samples for SEM were fixed in 3 % glutaraldehyde and hexamethyldisilizane (HMDS) prior to sputter-coating with gold and examination in an electron microscope. Findings Biofilm was demonstrated visually on the sterile supply bucket, the opaque plastic door, the venetian blind cord, and the sink rubber, whereas EPS alone was seen on the curtain. Viable bacteria were grown from three samples, including MRSA from the venetian blind cord and the curtain. Conclusion Biofilm containing MROs persist on clinical surfaces from an ICU despite terminal cleaning, suggesting that current cleaning practices are inadequate to control biofilm development. The presence of MROs being protected within these biofilms may be the mechanism by which MROs persist within the hospital environment. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Encystment is an {{essential}} process in the biological cycle of the human parasite Entamoeba histolytica. In the present study, we evaluated the participation of E. histolytica Gln 6 Pi {{in the formation of}} amoeba cyst-like structures by RNA interference assay. Amoeba trophozoites transfected with two Gln 6 Pi siRNAs reduced the expression of the enzyme in 85 %, which was confirmed by western blot using an anti-Gln 6 Pi antibody. The E. histolytica Gln 6 Pi knockdown with the mix of both siRNAs resulted in the loss of its capacity to form cyst-like structures (CLSs) and develop a chitin wall under hydrogen peroxide treatment, as evidenced by absence of both <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> treatment and calcofluor staining. Thus, only 5 % of treated trophozoites were converted to CLS, from which only 15 % were calcofluor stained. These results represent an advance in the understanding of chitin biosynthesis in E. histolytica and provide insight into the encystment process in this parasite, which could allow for the developing of new control strategies for this parasite...|$|R

In fact, researchers have hypothesized that the lipid rafts can be extracted from a plasma membrane. The extraction would take advantage of lipid raft <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> non-ionic <b>detergents,</b> such as Triton X-100 or Brij-98 at low temperatures (e.g., 4 °C).

40|$|Membrane microdomains (“rafts”) that {{sequester}} specific {{proteins and}} lipids are often characterized by their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> extraction. Because rafts are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol, raft bilayers are thicker and have larger area compressibility moduli than nonraft bilayers. It has been postulated that rafts concentrate proteins with long transmembrane domains (TMDs) because of “hydrophobic matching” between the TMDs and the thick raft bilayers. However, previous detergent extraction experiments with bilayers containing raft and nonraft domains {{have shown that}} the peptides P- 23 and P- 29, designed to have single TMDs matching the hydrocarbon thicknesses of detergent soluble membranes and detergent resistant membranes, respectively, are both localized <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> soluble membranes. Those results imply that both peptides are preferentially located in nonraft domains. However, because the detergent solubilizes part of the bilayer, it has been unclear whether or not detergent extraction experiments provide an accurate indication of the location of peptides in intact bilayers. Here we use confocal microscopy to examine the distribution of these same peptides in intact bilayers containing both raft and nonraft domains. At 20 °C and 37 °C, P- 23 and P- 29 were both primarily localized in fluorescently labeled nonraft domains. These confocal results validate the previous detergent extraction experiments and demonstrate the importance of bilayer cohesive properties, compared to hydrophobic mismatch, in the sorting of these peptides that contain a single TMD...|$|R
40|$|The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents</b> and detergent-induced {{tolerance}} of a gastrointestinal organism, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, were examined. The most remarkable observation was the rapid response of cells {{in contact with}} bile salts and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The killing by high concentrations of detergents was nearly instantaneous. A 5 -s adaptation with moderate sublethal concentrations of bile salts or SDS (0. 08 or 0. 01 %, respectively) was sufficient to induce significant adaptation against homologous lethal conditions (0. 3 % bile salts or 0. 017 % SDS). However, resistance to a subsequent lethal challenge progressively increased further to a maximum reached after 30 min of adaptation. Furthermore, extremely strong cross-resistances were observed with bile salts- and SDS-adapted cells. However, no relationship seems to exist between levels of tolerance and de novo-synthesized proteins, since blockage of protein synthesis during adaptation {{had no effect on}} induction of resistance to bile salts and SDS. We conclude that this induced tolerance to detergent stress is independent of protein synthesis. Nevertheless, the stress-induced protein patterns of E. faecalis ATCC 19433 showed significant modifications. The rates of synthesis of 45 and 34 proteins were enhanced after treatments with bile salts and SDS, respectively. In spite of the overlap of 12 polypeptides, the protein profiles induced by the two detergents were different, suggesting that these detergents trigger different responses in E. faecalis. Therefore, bile salts cannot be substituted for SDS in biochemical detergent shock experiments with bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} human {{activity}} on the selection for antibiotic resistance in the environment is largely unknown, although considerable amounts of antibiotics are introduced through domestic wastewater and farm animal waste. Selection for resistance may occur by exposure to antibiotic residues or by co-selection for mobile genetic elements (MGEs) which carry genes of varying activity. Class 1 integrons are genetic elements that carry antibiotic and quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) resistance genes that confer <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents</b> and biocides. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and diversity of class 1 integron and integron-associated QAC resistance genes in bacteria associated with industrial waste, sewage sludge and pig slurry. We show that prevalence of class 1 integrons is higher in bacteria exposed to detergents and/or antibiotic residues, specifically in sewage sludge and pig slurry compared with agricultural soils to which these waste products are amended. We also show that QAC resistance genes are more prevalent {{in the presence of}} detergents. Studies of class 1 integron prevalence in sewage sludge amended soil showed measurable differences compared with controls. Insertion sequence elements were discovered in integrons from QAC contaminated sediment, acting as powerful promoters likely to upregulate cassette gene expression.

C-terminal His(6) -tagged proGluSE was successfully expressed from the full-length sequence as a soluble form. By contrast, GluV 8 was poorly expressed by the system as a result of autodegradation; however, it was efficiently obtained by swapping its preprosegment with that of GluSE, or by the substitution of four residues in the GluV 8 prosequence with those of GluSE. The purified proGluV 8 was converted to the mature form in vitro by thermolysin treatment. The prosegment was essential for the suppression of proteolytic activity, {{as well as for the}} correct folding of GluV 8, indicating its role as an intramolecular chaperone. Furthermore, the four amino acid residues at the C-terminus of the prosegment were sufficient for both of these roles. In vitro mutagenesis revealed that Ser 237 was essential for proteolytic activity, and that Val 69 was indispensable for the precise cleavage by thermolysin and was involved in the proteolytic reaction itself. This is the first study to express quantitatively GluV 8 in E. coli, and to demonstrate explicitly the intramolecular chaperone activity of the prosegment of glutamyl endopeptidase I...|$|E

Lipid rafts are cholesterol/sphingolipid-rich membrane domains, involved in many cellular processes, including transmembrane receptor signaling, vesicle traffic, and protein sorting. We provide direct biochemical evidence that P 2 X 3 receptor localizes into lipid rafts, in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons {{as well as in}} brain and dorsal root ganglia extracts. We show that P 2 X 3 exhibits all the characteristics distinctive of a protein associated with lipid rafts.

The results of mass spectrometric and shotgun-proteomic analyses of SOD 1 -containing aggregates isolated from spinal cords of symptomatic transgenic ALS mice using two different isolation strategies are presented, including 1) <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> extraction and 2) size exclusion-coupled anti-SOD 1 immunoaffinity chromatography. Forty-eight spinal cords from three different ALS-SOD 1 mutant mice were analyzed, namely G 93 A, G 37 R, and the unnatural double mutant H 46 R/H 48 Q. The analysis consistently revealed that the most abundant proteins recovered from aggregate species were full-length unmodified SOD 1 polypeptides. Although aggregates from some spinal cord samples contained trace levels of highly abundant proteins, such as vimentin and neurofilament- 3, no proteins were consistently found to co-purify with mutant SOD 1 in stoichiometric quantities.

In this study we investigated the localization and possible roles of perinuclear K(V) 10. 1.

30|$|Despite these {{differences}} between SBcas 3.3 and KP- 43, easily explainable by the their low similarity (33 % identity, 49 % similarity), these proteins share several features {{in addition to}} the fact that they are produced as large precursors with N-ter parts playing the role of intramolecular chaperones. Both SBcas 3.3 and KP- 43 have a preference for an alkaline pH (optimum: respectively 9 – 10 and 11 – 12) and for relatively high temperatures (optimum: respectively 50 and 60 °C). Interestingly, SBcas 3.3 is also highly resistant to the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. Most subtilisin-like proteases are rapidly inactivated in the presence of 50 mM H 2 O 2 (1.7 g/l), notably because of oxidation of a conserved methionine residue adjacent to the catalytic serine (Nonaka et al. 2004). Though SBcas 3.3 contains this conserved methionine, it resists H 2 O 2 concentrations much higher than 50 mM, and its activity is even enhanced up to 10 g/l H 2 O 2 (0.29 M), in contrast to other oxidant-stable proteases such as AprX from Virgibacillus sp. SK 37 (Phrommao et al. 2011). The ability to resist oxidizing agents is particularly sought in the detergent industry, which uses oxidants as bleaching agents in an increasing number of products. Several proteases currently used have been genetically engineered to meet this performance requirement, but results are not entirely satisfactory and better enzymes are still sought (Maurer 2004). Though SBcas 3.3 meets almost all the requirements for this particular application of proteases (temperature and pH preferences, oxidant stability, detergent resistance), its strict calcium dependence is incompatible with use in most current bleach-based detergents, as these generally contain chelating agents to improve the efficiency of anionic detergents. Crystallographic analysis of SBcas 3.3 will help understand the determinants of its marked <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergents,</b> denaturing agents, and oxidants, and should be a useful tool for the rational design of a new protein with a minimized calcium requirement.|$|E

A short-lived higher molecular mass variant (t 1 / 2 approximately equal to 3 min) accompanying the mature-size protein was also detected {{in the case of}} lamin B 2 biosynthesis, but no precursor was found for lamin B 1. By combining pulse-chase experiments with subcellular fractionation, we provide evidence that synthesis of lamin proteins occurs on free polysomes; subsequently, the newly synthesized proteins become rapidly associated with a crude nuclear fraction. The lamin A precursor is processed within the nucleus with a half-time of about 30 min. Concomitantly, lamin proteins acquire a characteristic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> extraction, suggesting their insertion into a submembraneous protein network.

At or above 10 mumol/l MeHg, progression through all the phases of the cell cycle is blocked and mitotic cells are arrested irreversibly in anaphase, with most exhibiting arrangement of chromosomes in a wreathlike ring formation. Also the cells exhibit both nuclear propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (indicative of loss of viability) and concurrent cytoplasmic carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (viable cells exhibit CF fluorescence and exclude PI).

However, lipid rafts themselves are commonly defined purely in biochemical terms, by <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> extraction. The existence of rafts in live-cell membranes remains controversial [6 – 8], and their distribution relative to endocytic machinery has not been investigated. This study employs fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to show that in the plasma membrane (PM) of living cells the glycosphingolipid GM 1, labeled with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) [9, 10], is found at least in part within clusters that also include GPI-linked proteins. These clusters are cholesterol-dependent and exclude non-raft proteins such as transferrin receptor and so possess predicted properties of lipid rafts. This type of lipid raft is largely excluded from clathrin-positive regions of the PM. They are found within Caveolin-positive regions at the same concentration as at the rest of the cell surface. The data provide evidence for a model in which lipid rafts are distributed uniformly across most of the PM of nonpolarized cells but are prevented from entering clathrin-coated pits...|$|R

In the present study, we examined the distribution of IRs in the plasma membrane of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Quantitative electron microscopy indicates that IRs are predominantly associated with the neck, but not the bulb, of caveolae. Caveola necks represent distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane. Indeed, as shown by freeze-fracture analysis, intramembrane particles are concentrated as necklaces around the craters of caveolae. In addition, subcellular fractionation suggests that the neck and the bulb of caveolae present a different <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> solubility. Finally, cytoskeletal components, including actin, are highly enriched in the membrane area underlying the neck part of caveolae. IRs coimmunoprecipitate with cytoskeletal components, and disruption of the actin cytoskeleton alters IRs expression, localization, and signaling, thus supporting the notion that caveola necks are involved in intracellular signaling by IRs. Together, these results suggest that cytoskeletal proteins anchor IRs to microdomains in the caveola necks of 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. By homology with IR localization in other cell types, we suggest that the necks of caveolae may represent the counterpart of microvillar domains in cells poor in microvilli such as adipocytes and that they play an important role as signaling platforms...|$|R

Five Tnmutants formed wild-type biofilms in the absence of antibiotics but produced decreased biofilm biomass in the presence of antibiotic concentrations that were subinhibitory to the parent strain. Genetic determinants responsible for biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance include components of the quorum-sensing system (fsrA, fsrC, and gelE) and two glycosyltransferase (GTF) genes (epaI and epaOX). We also found that the GTFs play addi-tional roles in E. faecalis <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> and bile salts, maintenance of cell envelope integrity, determination of cell shape, polysaccharide composition, and conjugative transfer of the pheromone-inducible plasmid pCF 10.

These results are of interest for all those who exploit Tat as a vehicle fo...|$|R
40|$|Murine T {{cells and}} T cell lines bearing high- and low-affinity receptors for {{interleukin}} (IL) 2 were chemically cross-linked to radiolabeled IL 2 and subjected <b>to</b> differential <b>detergent</b> extractions <b>to</b> evaluate {{the extent of}} IL 2 receptor association with the nonionic detergent-resistant framework of the plasma membrane. Low-affinity receptors were readily solubilized by nonionic detergent extraction of whole cross-linked cells, while solubilization of high-affinity receptors required a stronger ionic detergent suggesting their association with a membrane structure that is resistant <b>to</b> nonionic <b>detergents.</b> <b>To</b> achieve physical separation of low- and high-affinity receptors, cells cross-linked to 125 I-labeled IL 2 were centrifuged through a sucrose barrier containing Triton X- 100. Alternatively, Triton X- 114 extracts of plasma membrane fractions were partitioned into aqueous and detergent phases. By either approach, high-affinity receptors differed from low-affinity ones by their increased density and consisted of detergent-resistant complexes containing p 55 -p 75 heterodimers. The low-affinity receptors, on the contrary, were of low density and consisted exclusively of detergent-soluble p 55 subunits. High density and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> nonionic <b>detergent</b> extraction of high-affinity IL 2 receptors suggest their integration into lateral microdomains of the detergent-resistant framework of the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|Several {{spontaneous}} cya and crp mutants of Escherichia coli {{have been}} selected as clones simultaneously resistant to phage lambda and nalidixic acid and characterized. Both cya and crp mutants {{have been found to}} grow as cocci with increased doubling times. They have increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> some mutagens (methylmethanesulfonate, ultraviolet light, gamma rays), antibiotics (nalidixic acid, ampicillin), phages (lambda, T 6), sublethal heat and hypotonic shock, and decreased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> neutral <b>detergents</b> (sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium deoxycholate), a protein synthesis inhibitor (streptomycin), and a respiratory inhibitor (sodium azide). The nature of changes in cell parameters indicate fundamental alterations in the envelope structure of the cya and crp mutant cells. The new cya and crp mutants {{have been found to be}} multiply carbohydrate negative and nonmotile in conformity with similar previously isolated mutants. Studies of revertants and phi 80 cya+ and phi 80 cya transductants indicated that the pleiotropic phenotype is related to a single mutational event at the cya or the crp locus in the mutants...|$|R
40|$|The canalicular plasma {{membrane}} is constantly exposed to bile acids acting as detergents. Bile acids {{are essential to}} mediate release of biliary lipids from the canalicular membrane. Membrane microdomains (previously called lipid rafts) are biochemically defined by their <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> solubilization at cold temperature. We aimed to investigate the canalicular {{plasma membrane}} {{for the presence of}} microdomains, which could protect this membrane against the detergent action of bile acids. Highly purified rat liver canalicular plasma membrane vesicles were extracted with 1 % Triton X- 100 or 1 % Lubrol WX at 4 degrees C and subjected to flotation through sucrose step gradients. Both detergents yielded detergent-resistant membranes containing the microdomain markers alkaline phosphatase and sphingomyelin. However, cholesterol was resistant to Lubrol WX solubilization, whereas it was only marginally resistant to solubilization by Triton X- 100. The microdomain marker caveolin- 1 was localized to the canalicular plasma membrane domain and was resistant to Lubrol WX, but to a large extent solubilized by Triton X- 100. The two additional microdomain markers, reggie- 1 and reggie- 2, were localized to the basolateral and canalicular plasma membrane and were partially resistant to Lubrol WX but resistant to Triton X- 100. The canalicular transporters bile salt export pump, multidrug resistance protein 2, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, and Abcg 5 were largely resistant to Lubrol WX but were solubilized by Triton X- 100. Conclusion: These results indicate the presence of two different types of microdomains in the canalicular plasma membrane: "Lubrol-microdomains" and "Triton-microdomains". "Lubrol-microdomains" contain the machinery for canalicular bile formation and may be the starting place for canalicular lipid secretion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{origin of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>detergent</b> {{solubilization}} in certain membranes, or membrane components, is not clearly understood. We {{have studied the}} solubilization by Triton X- 100 of binary mixtures composed of egg sphingomyelin (SM) and either ceramide, diacylglycerol, or cholesterol. Solubilization has been assayed in the 4 – 50 °C range, {{and the results are}} summarized in a novel, to our knowledge, form of plots, that we have called temperature-solubilization diagrams. Despite using a large detergent excess (lipid/detergent 1 : 20  mol ratio) and extended solubilization times (24 – 48 h) certain mixtures were not amenable to Triton X- 100 solubilization at one or more temperatures. DSC of all the lipid mixtures, and of all the lipid + detergent mixtures revealed that detergent resistance was associated with the presence of gel domains at the assay temperature. Once the system melted down, solubilization could occur. In general adding high-melting lipids limited the solubilization, whereas the addition of low-melting lipids promoted it. Lipidomic analysis of Madin-Darby canine kidney cell membranes and of the corresponding detergent-resistant fraction indicated a large enrichment of the nonsolubilized components in saturated diacylglycerol and ceramide. SM-cholesterol mixtures were special in that detergent solubilization was accompanied, for certain temperatures and compositions, by an independent phenomenon of reassembly of the partially solubilized lipid bilayers. The temperature at which lysis and reassembly prevailed was ∼ 25 °C, thus for some SM-cholesterol mixtures solubilization occurred both above and below 25 °C, but not at that temperature. These observations can be at the origin of the detergent resistance effects observed with cell membranes, and they also mean that cholesterol-containing detergent-resistant membrane remnants cannot correspond to structures existing in the native membrane before detergent addition...|$|R
40|$|The gene locus {{known as}} mtr confers <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> {{hydrophobic}} dyes, <b>detergents,</b> and antibiotics. It {{has been suggested}} previously that the host environment {{is important in the}} selection of gonococcal strains with this outer membrane phenotype, and thus that strains with mtr gene loci should predominate in environments high in hydrophobic molecules. Furthermore, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> hydrophobic molecules has been related to a sevenfold increase in a minor outer membrane protein. To test these suggestions the outer membrane phenotypes of 61 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were identified using 27 rectal isolates from homosexual men and 34 urethral isolates from heterosexual men who were matched for age. The cell envelope phenotype of each strain was identified on the basis of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> various hydrophobic compounds.

40|$|Inhibition of {{encystment}} can {{be conceived}} as a potentially useful mechanism to block the transmission of Entamoeba histolytica under natural conditions. Unfortunately, amoeba encystment has not been achieved in vitro and drugs inhibiting the formation of cysts are not available. Luminal conditions inducing encystment in vivo are also unknown, but cellular stress such as exposure to reactive oxygen species from immune cells or intestinal microbiota could be involved. A role for certain divalent cations as cofactors of enzymes involved in excystment has also been described. In this study, we show that trophozoite cultures, treated with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of}} trace amounts of several cations, transform into small-sized spherical and refringent structures that exhibit <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> different <b>detergents.</b> Ultrastructural analysis under scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed multinucleated structures (some with four nuclei) with smooth, thick membranes and multiple vacuoles. Staining with calcofluor white, as well as an ELISA binding assay using wheat germ agglutinin, demonstrated the presence of polymers of N-acetylglucosamine (chitin), which is the primary component of the natural cyst walls. Over-expression of glucosamine 6 -phosphate isomerase, likely to be the rate-limiting enzyme in the chitin synthesis pathway, was also confirmed by RT-PCR. These results suggest that E. histolytica trophozoites activate...|$|R
40|$|Paramecium, a {{unicellular}} ciliate, can {{be attracted}} by various chemical stimuli. Chemoattractants such as glutamate, folate, cAMP, and acetate activate different receptor mediated signal transduction pathways. The final event in these signal transductions is a hyperpolarization of membrane potential, which makes Paramecium swim smoothly and fast. There {{is evidence that}} the effecter of this hyperpolarization is the plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA), that when activated, expels Ca 2 + from the cell. In Paramecium three PMCA isoforms, named PMCA 2, 3, and 4, have been cloned. PMCA 2 is associated with lipid rafts, which is demonstrated by its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> cold <b>detergent</b> solubilization and distribution in sucrose density gradients in ultracentrifugation. PMCA 3 and 4 are not associated with lipid rafts. On the cell surface, PMCAs are localized to the bases of cilia. Sterol-depletion by methyl-ß-cyclodextrin (MßCD) treatment disrupts the distribution of PMCA 2 in sucrose density gradients and ciliary base-localization on the cell surface. MßCD treatment also decreases the chemoattraction to glutamate and cAMP. This indicates that PMCA 2 and its association with lipid rafts are essential in the chemoattraction signal transduction pathways. Based on these results, a model of membrane domains incorporating three signal transduction pathways is proposed...|$|R
