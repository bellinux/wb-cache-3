5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in <b>relief.</b> <b>When</b> Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E

50|$|Lane has {{experimented with}} new methods in recent years, {{producing}} new non-commissioned sculptural works. Progressing from early explorations with glass casting, Lane has coined a new process as ‘carved casts’, {{in which he}} spontaneously cuts into the mold material.

25|$|Distant rumblings of a nebulous entity {{dubbed the}} 'gay plague', later {{standardised}} in nomenclature as AIDS, were heard emanating from America. There was some <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> US doctors {{discovered that it}} affected not exclusively gays, but also Haitians and haemophiliacs. However, it caused some local homosexuals to cast a wary eye on Caucasians and promiscuous Singaporeans returning from Western countries. The possibility that it would become a problem here seemed remote at the time.|$|E
25|$|From 1917 to 1937 a pogy plant {{producing}} oil for Procter & Gamble {{and fertilizer}} for the Southern Fertilizer and Chemical Company {{was one of}} the major economic activities of the area. The layoffs from the pogy plant found <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> the Gilman Paper Company came to the county in 1939. The company was sold to Durango Paper Co. in 1999, and went out of business in 2002, resulting in 900 workers losing their jobs.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} steps {{would depend on the}} {{capacity}} of the storage. The Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar, for example, has 50 steps that would take the user to a depth of 17m below grade. Nabi mosque ab anbar had 36 steps, Haj Kazem 38 steps, Jame’ mosque 35 steps, and Zabideh Khatun with 20 steps (all these are in Qazvin). To provide a brief <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> traversing the steps, there would be one to three landings built midway into the stairway. All stairways are linear.|$|E
50|$|Terrain (or relief) is {{the third}} or {{vertical}} dimension of land surface. Topography {{is the study of}} terrain, although the word is often used as a synonym for <b>relief</b> itself. <b>When</b> <b>relief</b> is described underwater, the term bathymetry is used. In cartography, many different techniques are used to describe relief, including contour lines and TIN (Triangulated irregular network).|$|R

25|$|Condit dam was {{required}} to discharge at least 15ft³/s (0.4 m³/s) to keep the river channel viable. Surplus water {{was used by the}} turbines for electrical power generation and returned to the river about a mile downstream. Additional flow beyond what the turbines could use was discharged through five tainter gates and two sluice gates. The dam crest had a pneumatically actuated hinged crestgate which was designed to fail catastrophically as a safety <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> flow exceeds 18000ft³/s (510 m³/s). The river averages 1125ft³/s (32 m³/s), with flows up to 3500ft³/s (99 m³/s) fairly common.|$|E

Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, Häkkinen, Lehto, Barrichello and Alesi. As Simtek and Sauber both fielded only 1 car for the race, both Pacific cars were able to qualify for the race by default as they did in Monaco.|$|E
25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication {{that sounds like a}} short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E

25|$|Successful {{therapeutic}} {{relationships between}} nurses and patients {{need to have}} positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses. Minor activities such as shopping, reading the newspaper together, or taking lunch/dinner breaks with patients can {{improve the quality of}} support provided. Physical support may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch. Patients described feelings of connection when the psychiatric nurses hugged them or put a hand on their shoulder. Psychiatric/mental health nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand. Patients with depression described <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> the psychiatric nurse embraced them. Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual feelings with the psychiatric nurses.|$|E
25|$|The Franco-Spanish fleet was {{involved}} in the indecisive Battle of Cape Finisterre in fog off Ferrol with Admiral Sir Robert Calder's squadron on 22 July, before taking refuge in Vigo and Ferrol. Calder on 14 August and Nelson on 15 August joined Admiral Cornwallis's Channel Fleet off Ushant. Nelson continued on to England in Victory, leaving his Mediterranean fleet with Cornwallis who detached twenty of his thirty-three ships of the line and sent them under Calder to find the combined fleet at Ferrol. On 19 August came the worrying news that the enemy had sailed from there, followed by <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> they arrived in Cádiz two days later. On the evening of Saturday, 28 September, Lord Nelson joined Lord Collingwood's fleet off Cádiz, quietly, so that his presence would not be known.|$|E
25|$|The storm which {{dominates the}} opening chorus is portrayed vividly by the orchestra. Rapidly {{changing}} sixteenth notes {{played by the}} lower strings and woodwinds create {{an image of a}} turbulent sea while rising and descending scales in the upper woodwinds represent the unpredictable patterns of the wind in the tempest. Frequent interjections from the brass and percussion portray the bolts of lightning and thunder which accompany the storm. Otello's first entrance is marked by brass instruments for a sense of grandeur. Verdi adds to the anxiety by having the organ hold its three lowest notes in a cluster (C–C–D) through the entire scene. At the end, the woodwinds gradually calm down to portray the fading of the storm, and finally the release of the low organ discord completes the feeling of <b>relief.</b> <b>When</b> the chorus sings of their joy, the high woodwinds now portray the sparkling, cheerful flames.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} two years, Voce and Larwood practised this {{modified}} form of leg theory for Nottinghamshire, causing severe problems for opposing batsmen. Although Voce was somewhat slower than Larwood, his line, from left-arm over the wicket, and the steeper bounce that he obtained from his height, made him formidable enough and the batsmen got no <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> facing him. Voce took 123 wickets for 19.29 each in 1931, and with 136 for 16.87 each in 1932, he was chosen {{as one of the}} Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1933. His bowling was so good that he regained his Test place and, with Larwood, was named for the 1932–1933 English tour of Australia, to be captained by Jardine. The bowlers implemented Jardine's tactic, bowling fast and short at the Australian batsmen, with Voce inflicting several bruising injuries. The Australian media dubbed the tactic 'Bodyline'. This resulted in severe ill-feeling between the cricket teams, and the countries.|$|E
500|$|From {{the first}} moment of the marriage, Anne was under {{pressure}} to provide James and Scotland with an heir, but the passing of 1591 and 1592 {{with no sign of}} a pregnancy provoked renewed Presbyterian libels on the theme of James' fondness for male company and whispers against Anne [...] "for that she proves not with child".

Thorpe received some <b>relief</b> <b>when</b> his former colleague Bessell, who had resigned from parliament and relocated to California to escape from a string of business failures, re-emerged in early February after discovery by the Daily Mail. Bessell gave muddled accounts of his involvement with Scott, but insisted that his former chief was innocent of any wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|Wickliffe was {{returned}} to the Kentucky House in 1822 and 1823. During this period, a controversy known as the Old Court-New Court controversy was raging in Kentucky. Reeling from the financial Panic of 1819, many of the state's citizens demanded debt <b>relief.</b> <b>When</b> some debt relief measures passed by the legislature were declared unconstitutional by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the legislature attempted to dissolve the court {{and replace it with}} a more sympathetic one.
