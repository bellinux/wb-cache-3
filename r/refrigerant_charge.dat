40|$|The {{phasing out}} of {{hydrochlorofluorocarbon}} and chlorofluorocarbon fluids and further environmental problems arising from new, synthetic working fluids stimulate a continuously rising interest on natural candidates. The nontoxic and nonflammable CO 2 impacts neither on ozone depletion nor {{on global warming}} if leaked to the atmosphere. The critical temperature of CO 2 (31. 1 C) is almost ambient and, therefore, it undergoes a transcritical refrigeration cycle. In cooling mode operation, a trans-critical CO 2 system, as compared to conventional airconditioners, has a lower performance which, contrary to conventional systems, strongly depends on the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge.</b> In this paper, {{the performance of the}} trans-critical system was evaluated experimentally under different <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> amounts.

When simulating the running of heat pumps and chillers the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> needs to be taken into account. Since many contemporary refrigerants are inflammable, <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> is a key parameter when analysing the safety of a plant and should be predicted when designing a heat pump/chiller. The purpose of this diploma work has been to develop <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> calculations (distribution of refrigerant as well as total quantity) for heat pumps and chillers. The new <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> calculation routines have been added to a module-based FORTRAN program for heat pump or refrigeration steady-state calculations.

The <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> routines use the program's existing routines as far as possible to make use of future updates of the main routines as well as for practical reasons. During the course of this diploma work, the following tasks have been carried out: • A routine has been created to compile and present <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> results from the different modules/units of the program. • <b>Refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> calculation routines {{have been added to the}} modules modelling the five most common parts of a heat pump/ refrigeration system. • The heat transfer calculations in the liquid layer at the bottom of the condenser has been improved and the user is given better feedback when running the program. • Debugging and documentation Calculations with the program show that the amount of refrigerant in condensers dominate in systems where there are no other large liquid phase accumulations, e. g. suction gas heat exchangers or buffer tanks. It also shows that the amount of subcooling of the condenser outlet refrigerant stream is decisive for the amount of refrigerant in the condenser and that more subcooling increase the amount. The amount of refrigerant in an evaporator is affected in a reversed way by the amount of super heating of its refrigerant out stream.

A qualitative discussion is provided concerning the possible impacts of transient operation and total energy use on utility program decisions. The analysis indicates that proper sizing of the unit is the largest factor affecting energy demand of the three factors (sizing, charging, and efficiency) studied in this paper. For typical oversizing of units to cooling loads in houses, both overcharging and undercharging showed significant negative impact on peak demand.

40|$|Direct {{expansion}} (DX) refrigeration {{technology is}} almost exclusively used in multi-temperature transport refrigeration systems. Multi-temperature systems use {{up to three}} evaporators, requiring large <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charges</b> and system pressure control to operate {{over a wide range}} of set-point conditions. Despite incremental design improvements over the past decade, environmental and control issues continue to arise with DX systems. Deployment of indirect refrigeration systems (IDX) offers an alternative approach to address these issues. Indirect systems can however suffer from performance penalties, where reduced cooling capacity and COP occur under certain operating conditions. One strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity, is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX system. Economiser cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the primary refrigerant in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the indirect system. In this paper, for a multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, the performance of an optimised economised indirect system is compared with a non-economised indirect system and a contemporary direct expansion system. All tests for the economised IDX system were carried out using optimised refrigerant mass flowrate injection ratios, which were established for different operating boundary conditions.

The experiments were conducted on an original equipment air conditioning system modified for laboratory investigation. Qualitative results showing a clear relationship between <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> and mean clutch cycling period, and between <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> and the transient behavior of the evaporator outlet refrigerant temperature, were obtained. A five-factor, two-level, designed experiment was performed to determine {{the sensitivity of the}} clutch cycling period of the air conditioning refrigeration system to small (8 %- 15 %) changes in: condenser air flow rate, condenser air inlet temperature, evaporator air inlet temperature, compressor speed, and refrigerant mass. The values chosen for each factor were based on a nominal operating condition which assumed a vehicle speed of 60 mph, and an air conditioning system operating on maximum cold setting, full recirculation, and maximum evaporator speed. The test facility permitted the control of condenser and evaporator air flow rates and inlet air temperatures, compressor speed, and <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge.</b> Evaporator fan speed was set at the same value for all tests, and all tests were run dry coil. For the range of variables studied, experimental results showed that <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> loss corresponded to a shortening of the mean clutch cycling period and a decrease in the variance of the mean clutch cycling period.

The design of the simpler tubing system will be depend on the location of other components in refrigeration system are located. The previous developed lengthy tubing system was greatly reduced in length by removing the thermocouple wires from the tubing system and moved it to the outer surface of the tubing.

CFCs used in domestic applications were initially replaced with hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as R 134 a which has a zero ozone depletion potential (ODP). The use of HFCs has also come under scrutiny as they have high global warming potential (GWP) and inferior thermodynamic and lubricating properties and have been replaced by hydrocarbon (HC) refrigerants such as R 600 a in much of the domestic European and Asian markets. Despite this, there has been little research into the long-term environmental consequences of their application. Domestic refrigeration compressors were analysed to ascertain the tribological contact conditions for both R 600 a and R 134 a systems. A novel pressurised micro-friction test machine was developed to simulate the tribological conditions of the critical components using aluminium on steel samples. <b>Refrigerant</b> <b>charges</b> of R 600 a with mineral oil (MO) and poly-ol-ester (POE) lubricant and R 134 a with POE were tested for their tribological performance within the test rig. Experimental tribological information is presented from the physical test procedures to establish wear mechanisms and friction coefficients within the critical components. The tribological performance is used to predict deterioration in energy consumption and system durability. Results indicate that for higher contact stresses R 600 a MO charges provide a lower wear regime than R 600 a and R 134 a POE charges. At lower contact stresses the R 600 a and R 134 a POE charges provide a very low wear, very low friction regime. Despite contact conditions lead to a faster deterioration in durability, hence increase in energy consumption compared to the R 600 a system.

This testing is expensive for equipment manufacturers and {{it can be difficult to}} find available test facilities. Â The current work describes the development of an automated open lab training kit for calibrating the virtual <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> level sensor in an open laboratory space. The developed automated training kit algorithm has the ability to modulate the condenser and evaporator fans to simulate the effects of different ambient conditions and automatically add different amounts of refrigerant. The charge level is automatically adjusted and monitored using solenoid valves and a digital weighing scale. This approach reduces the human involvement to a great extent and eliminates the need for psychrometric chambers. An optimal set of test conditions has been determined using optimal experimental design techniques and implemented as a Python application. An Arduino microcontroller is used to continuously send data from the sensors to a personal computer which is used to supervise the process, including determining when the system has reached steady-state. The training kit has been applied to several different rooftop units in an open lab space. Â A comparison of the virtual <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charge</b> sensor accuracy and time/cost for calibration determined using the automated system and using psychrometric chamber test facilities will be presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|R 32 was {{selected}} as the alternative for R 410 A for mini-split air conditioners/heat pumps in Japan and have already phased out R 410 A in residential market. Recently several new alternatives for R 410 A have been proposed in order to achieve more close capacity to R 410 A and mitigate high discharge temperature issue of R 32 as well as to reduce energy consumption. We selected R 32 from among the candidates a few years ago; however it is important to continue comparing it to new candidates in search for an even better choice. We carried out the drop-in tests of the new refrigerant R 32 /R 125 /R 1234 yf (67 / 7 / 26) by comparing its COP and especially pressure loss to those of R 410 A, R 32 /R 1234 ze(E) (70 / 30), and R 32, using residential mini-split type air conditioner. We conducted the drop-in tests by two types of method, actual measuring and especially simulated calculation. Adjusting compressor suction superheat and the amount of <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charged</b> into the system. Moreover, we measured the performance of the system with changing compressor speed in the wide range by variable frequency drive. Furthermore, we compared electricity consumption at the constant capacities, and analyzed the results precisely by loss analysis. As a result, we found that the COP of R 32 /R 125 /R 1234 yf (67 / 7 / 26) is better than R 410 A in many conditions and it achieves very close capacity to R 410 A, but COP at the same capacity is not as high as R 32. The reason is that pressure losses are increased by adding R 125 and R 1234 yf to R 32. It was clarified, comparing losses with R 410 A, R 32 / 1234 ze(70 / 30), and R 32. From the above, we confirmed that R 32 is still the best choice at present. However, we will continue searching for a better alternative. ...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, the refrigeration industry {{is facing the}} challenge of developing more efficient and environmental friendly refrigerators. Environmentally harmful refrigerants, CFC's and HCFC's, have already been shifted toward environmental friendly refrigerants such as HFC's and hydro carbons. However HFC's have a significant global warming potential. Accordingly, new policies have taken effect which are forcing the refrigerator industry to develop refrigerators that will reduce energy consumption and refrigerant emissions to reduce energy bills and the global warming effects of refrigerators. This study presents the research conducted on the condenser improvement {{of one of the}} commercially available household refrigerators and designing and applying a so-called Alternating evaporator duty cycle (AED) with a two step capacity modulated compressor. In the condenser improvement study, a household refrigerator's condenser configuration was changed from the cross-flow configuration to the counter-flow configuration without changing other components and cabinet structure. Ten experiments for different <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charges</b> were conducted and it was experimentally proved that the refrigerator with counter flow condenser consumes 1 % less energy compared to the one with cross-flow condenser. To study the potential of the AED cycle, a side-by-side household refrigerator equipped with a conventional cycle was converted into the AED cycle. First of all, the performance of the refrigerator with the new cycle was simulated and then cycle components were designed. Two different kinds of evaporators were used for food (R) cabinet such as forced convection fin-and-tube type evaporator (FCE) and natural convection tube-and-plate type evaporator (NCE), to investigate the humidity control improvement. Experimental results shows that, average humidity ratios of freezer (F) and R compartments during the cyclic operations are 0. 5 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air) and 2. 5 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air), respectively using the FCE and 0. 6 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air) and 2. 4 gH 2 O/(kg of dry air), respectively with NCE. Therefore, the humidity ratio of R compartment is maintained at 4 - 5 times higher level than that of F compartment for the AED cycle, and also 4 - 5 times higher than that R and F compartments for the base cycle. In addition to the better humidity control, AED cycle provides separate and more efficient cabinet temperature control...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} findings of an experimental study {{of the effects of}} changing refrigerants on the performance of a refrigeration system. The different refrigerants studied are considered to be less harmful to the environment than R- 12 which is currently widely used. Environmentally harmful effects include global warming and ozone depletion. The findings are {{based on the results of}} over one hundred independent tests using four refrigerants, namely R- 12, R- 134 a, and two R- 22 blends;The test equipment consisted of a 3 -ton vapor compression refrigeration system, an air flow loop used to control evaporator conditions, and a water flow loop used to control condenser conditions. The instrumentation provided information needed to determine the system COP, cooling capacity, mass flow rates, and thermodynamic states of the refrigerant at the inlet and exit of each component in the system. The parameters varied in the study were the evaporator and condenser sink temperatures and the amount of refrigerant used in the system. The evaporator exit superheat was maintained constant at 13. 5 F for all tests;The performance with each refrigerant at several <b>refrigerant</b> <b>charges</b> is presented as a function of operating conditions. Curve fits of several system variables (COP, capacity, mass flow rate, and system temperatures and pressures) allow for comparisons to be made among refrigerants. The performance with each alternative refrigerant was compared to the performance with R- 12 at the same operating conditions. The other system variables were also compared with R- 12. These comparisons are used to explain the observed differences in performance, and they provide information needed for design and for making system modifications;The experimental results show equal or slightly better COPs with the alternative refrigerants compared to R- 12. The capacities are also similar with the exception of MP- 52 which had a lower capacity than R- 12. The differences in performance were somewhat dependent on the operating conditions;Several models for the compressor are presented and compared with experimental data. The models are based on the ideas of polytropic compression and isentropic efficiency. Heat exchanger models are also examined and compared with experimental data. The validity of some of the models is questioned as they do not represent the test data well...|$|R
