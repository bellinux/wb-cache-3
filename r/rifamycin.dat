5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the <b>rifamycin</b> class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and <b>rifamycin,</b> which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} {{of a large number}} of natural and semisynthetic <b>rifamycins</b> made it possible to derive a clear relationship between structural features and activity against the target enzyme, the bacterial DNA-directed RNA polymerase (DDRP). Recent data are reported on the conformation of the active molecule in solution and on the Hansch approach for quantitative correlation between the in vitro antibacterial activity of several <b>rifamycins</b> and their lipophilicity. Some semisynthetic <b>rifamycins</b> were found to have a limited activity on the DDRP of rifampicin-resistant bacteria and of cytoplasmic DNA-viruses and on the RNA-directed DNA polymerase (RDDP) of oncogenic RNA viruses, but up-to-now there is no clear indication of the essential structural requisites for these activities. The biosynthetic pathways leading from acetate to propionate units to the ansamycins (<b>rifamycins,</b> tolipomycins, streptovaricins) are reviewed.

40|$|SummaryRifamycins, the {{clinically}} important antibiotics, target bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). A proposed {{mechanism in}} which <b>rifamycins</b> sterically block {{the extension of}} nascent RNA beyond three nucleotides does not alone explain why certain RNAP mutations confer resistance to some but not other <b>rifamycins.</b> Here we show that unlike rifampicin and rifapentin, and contradictory to the steric model, rifabutin inhibits formation {{of the first and}} second phosphodiester bonds. We report 2. 5 Å resolution structures of rifabutin and rifapentin complexed with the Thermus thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme. The structures reveal functionally important distinct interactions of antibiotics with the initiation σ factor. Strikingly, both complexes lack the catalytic Mg 2 + ion observed in the apo-holoenzyme, whereas an increase in Mg 2 + concentration confers resistance to <b>rifamycins.</b> We propose that a rifamycin-induced signal is transmitted over ∼ 19 Å to the RNAP active site to slow down catalysis. Based on structural predictions, we designed enzyme substitutions that apparently interrupt this allosteric signal...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>rifamycins</b> have {{a unique}} {{mechanism}} of action, selectively inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and show no cross-resistance with other antibiotics in clinical use. However, despite their activity against bacteria resistant to other antibiotics, the <b>rifamycins</b> themselves suffer from a rather high frequency of resistance. Because of this Rifampin, and other <b>rifamycins,</b> are typically used {{in combination with other}} antibacterial drugs. This is routinely practiced in TB therapy and serves to prevent the formation of mutants that are resistant to any of the drugs in the combination. Rifampin rapidly kills fast-dividing bacilli strains as well as “persisters” cells, which remain biologically inactive {{for long periods of time}} that allow them to evade antibiotic activity. [...] In addition, rifabutin and rifapentine have both been used against tuberculosis acquired in HIV-positive patients.
