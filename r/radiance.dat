5|$|The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons {{role-playing}} game module Ruins of Adventure {{was produced}} {{using the same}} adventure scenario as Pool of <b>Radiance,</b> using the same plot, background, setting, {{and many of the}} same characters as the computer game. The module thus contains useful clues to the successful completion of the computer missions. Ruins of Adventure contains four linked miniscenarios, which form the core of Pool of <b>Radiance.</b> According to the editors of Dragon magazine, Pool of <b>Radiance</b> was based on Ruins of Adventure, and not vice versa.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} was {{a continuation}} of the narrative of Path of <b>Radiance,</b> even though that game was not given an intentional cliffhanger ending. So the story would be comprehensible for people who had not played Path of <b>Radiance,</b> the story was split up into four segments divided between the game's various factions. The team initially thought of a three-part structure, then settled on the current format. Their aim from the beginning was to create a large-scale, intricate world for players to enjoy. It {{was the first time the}} developers had incorporated such a structure into a Fire Emblem game. The dialogue for characters was made slightly rougher based on feedback from Path of <b>Radiance,</b> where character dialogue remained calm and cultured even in battle situations. The total number of characters increased by approximately 1.5 times compared to Path of <b>Radiance.</b> So players could keep track of how characters interacted with each other, the team introduced a character relationship flow chart. The game's Japanese subtitle made reference to both a key character and the way Telleus came to be. They also wanted to continue to portray the themes of conflict explored in Path of <b>Radiance.</b> The game's thematic color, expressed in its artwork and presentation, was red, as opposed to the use of blue in Path of <b>Radiance.</b> Senri Kita, the character designer for Path of <b>Radiance,</b> returned in that capacity for Radiant Dawn.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier. The staff numbers, including those working on the cutscenes, went from around one hundred for Path of <b>Radiance</b> to around 200 for Radiant Dawn: half the staff worked on the game itself, while the other half worked on the cutscenes. For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from Path of <b>Radiance</b> the developers felt was wrong. All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} unfiltered shortwave (SW), longwave (LW) and window (W) <b>radiances</b> from filtered <b>radiances</b> {{measured by the}} Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite instrument is presented. The method uses theoretically derived regression coefficients between filtered and unfiltered <b>radiances</b> that are a function of viewing geometry, geotype {{and whether or not}} cloud is present. Relative errors in insta. ntaneous unfiltered <b>radiances</b> from this method are generally well below 1 % for SW <b>radiances</b> (approx. 0. 4 % 1 (sigma) or approx. l W/sq m equivalent flux), < 0. 2 % for LW <b>radiances</b> (approx. 0. 1 % 1 (sigma) or approx. 0. 3 W/sq m equivalent flux) and < 0. 2 % (approx. 0. 1 % 1 (sigma) for window channel <b>radiances...</b>|$|R
40|$|Amongst the 36 {{spectral}} <b>radiances</b> {{available on}} the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) seven of them are used operationally for detection of clouds in daytime polar regions. While the information content of clouds inherent in spectral <b>radiances</b> is familiar, the information content of clouds contained in angular <b>radiances</b> (i. e., <b>radiances</b> emanating to space from the same object but in di#erent directions) is not. The Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) measures angular <b>radiances</b> to space and its collocation on the NASA Terra satellite with MODIS allows for a comparative analysis of its cloud detection capabilities with those of MODIS...|$|R
40|$|Microwave <b>radiances</b> {{from the}} {{humidity}} sounder SAPHIR at 183 GHz onboard the MEGHA-TROPIQUES satellite are simulated in cloudy and rainy conditions (all-sky <b>radiances)</b> using short-range forecasts from the operational limited area model ALADIN-Réunion over the Indian Ocean. The simulation of SAPHIR <b>radiances</b> uses cloud and precipitation profiles from the moist physical parameterizations of ALADIN-Réunion describing deep convection and large-scale precipitation, that are coupled to the fast radiative transfer model RTTOV-SCATT accounting for scattering by hydrometeors. Sensitivity {{studies show that}} within cloud systems the SAPHIR sounder is particularly sensitive to solid precipitating hydrometeors. An optimal choice of scattering properties for snow particles is undertaken by a systematic comparison of simulated and observed SAPHIR <b>radiances</b> over a 1 -month period in February 2012. This choice has required defining a criterion for rain occurrence from SAPHIR <b>radiances</b> that has been calibrated with the TMPA 3 B 40 RT surface precipitation rate product. Finally, a retrieval technique based on Bayesian inversion is proposed to derive atmospheric profiles within clouds to be assimilated in the ALADIN 3 D-Var system in a forthcoming study. The retrieved profiles are evaluated through the simulation of <b>radiances</b> from the microwave imager MADRAS that also flew on MEGHA-TROPIQUES...|$|R
5|$|Another story {{involving}} Kaali is her escapade {{with a band}} of thieves. The thieves {{wanted to}} make a human sacrifice to Kaali, and unwisely chose a saintly Brahmin monk as their victim. The <b>radiance</b> of the young monk was so much that it burned the image of Kaali, who took living form and killed the entire band of thieves, decapitating them and drinking their blood.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of <b>Radiance</b> {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of <b>Radiance,</b> Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E
5|$|Radiant Dawn began {{development}} in 2005 for the Wii after {{the success of}} Path of <b>Radiance.</b> Continuing the trend of developing for home consoles after a period on portable devices, {{it was intended to}} release close to the Wii hardware's release so as to boost sales for both game and hardware. Radiant Dawn has been positively received by critics, many of whom criticised only the game's high difficulty.|$|E

25|$|Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) is a {{scanning}} radiative budget instrument, {{which has}} already been launched twice on Russian satellites. The basic measurements of ScaRaB are the <b>radiances</b> in two wide channels, a solar channel (0.2 - 4µm), and a total channel (0.2 - 200µm), allowing to derive longwave <b>radiances.</b> The resolution at nadir will be 40km from an orbit at 870km. The procedures of calibration and processing of the data in order to derive fluxes from the original <b>radiances</b> {{have been set up}} and tested by CNES and LMD.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly <b>radiance,</b> he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Path of <b>Radiance</b> is a {{tactical}} role-playing video {{game in which}} players control protagonist Ike {{and a group of}} characters across multiple battle scenarios. At the game's opening, multiple difficulty settings can be chosen: in the Japanese version the options are Normal, Hard, and Maniac modes, while the western version has Easy, Normal, and Hard modes. In all modes, characters who fall in battle cannot be revived, being removed {{from the rest of the}} game, and no revival items can be used on them during a battle. If Ike falls in battle, the game will end and the stage must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|In Japan {{during its}} opening week, Path of <b>Radiance</b> sold over 100,357 copies, selling through 64.16% of its initial shipment. By {{the end of}} 2005, the game had sold 156,413 copies. In its UK debut, it {{reached the top of}} the GameCube charts. Although no exact sales figures have been published, Nintendo cited the game as being among its {{successful}} GameCube titles for 2005. According to the developers, the fact that it was released near the end of the GameCube's lifespan affected sales, but it still managed to help sell the hardware and convinced Nintendo that the Fire Emblem had selling power on home consoles.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the conversion of}} narrow-to-broadband <b>radiances</b> in the special case of the sensor SEVIRI onboard the satellite Meteosat- 8 of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). The advent of this new program poses {{the problem of the}} transfer of operational procedures from the previous satellite Meteosat- 7 to MSG. Among these operational procedures are several different implementations of the Heliosat method to convert Meteosat data into irradiance maps. An easy-to-implement fast-running method is proposed that combines the <b>radiances</b> of the two narrow visible bands of SEVIRI to produce broadband <b>radiances</b> that are almost identical to those observed in the broadband channel of Meteosat- 7. A comparison between Meteosat- 7 actual <b>radiances</b> and these simulated-radiances shows errors with a negligible bias and a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 6 %. After combination with the uncertainties found in the calibration procedures (10 - 13 %), the total relative RMSE on the <b>radiances</b> amounts to 12 - 14 %. It is concluded that the Meteosat- 8 images may be used in operational procedures currently applied to Meteosat- 7 images...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} algorithm {{based on}} Eddington's second approximation to {{the equation of}} radiative transfer has been developed in order to compute the <b>radiances</b> with horizontal and vertical polarization that emerge from precipitating clouds. This algorithm yields a rapid solution to problems pertaining to clouds with vertically inhomogeneous structure. Precipitating clouds containing liquid, mixtures of phases, and ice hydrometeors are modelled. It is shown that the lower-frequency <b>radiances</b> are sensitive to liquid precipitation at low altitudes while the higher-frequency <b>radiances</b> are {{more sensitive to the}} ice hydrometeors at the cloud tops. The extinction coefficients of aspherical hydrometeors are presented as a function of rainfall rates. The fact that vertically polarized <b>radiances</b> are warmer than horizontally polarized ones at high rainfall rates, with the difference diminishing at lower frequencies, is due to aspherical ice hydrometeors in the upper regions of precipitating clouds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Current {{and future}} {{operational}} high spectral resolution infrared sounding measurements are observing unprecedented information content about earth atmosphere and surface. The recent NWP centers {{have demonstrated the}} use of only fractional of clear <b>radiances</b> can improve 3 to 5 days of forecast by 6 hours (Le Marshall, et al., 2005) [1]. The cloudy <b>radiances</b> observed from the weather active areas, no doubt, can provide even richer information to further improve the forecast skill. This paper will review the progress {{that has been made}} so far for either indirect or direct assimilation of cloudy <b>radiances</b> in to NWP models...|$|R
5|$|In {{its debut}} week, Rekka no Ken entered Japanese gaming charts at #2 {{with sales of}} 93,880 units. The {{following}} week it had dropped to #4, selling a further 47,550 and bringing total sales to 141,430 units. The following week it had reached #3 with further sales of 23,296 units. The game continued to steadily into July, reaching #21 in the top 100 best-selling games for that half of 2003 with total sales of 223,575 units. As of 2012, Rekka no Ken has sold 272,000 units in Japan. While no exact sales figure are available for Western territories, developers later stated that Fire Emblem was a commercial success overseas, and prompted the development of Path of <b>Radiance</b> for the GameCube home console.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the <b>radiance</b> coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|Pool of <b>Radiance</b> {{is based}} on the same game {{mechanics}} as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set. As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of <b>Radiance</b> has a character race and a character class, determined {{at the beginning of the}} game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring character continuation regardless of events in the game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk.|$|E
40|$|The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) is now {{implementing}} {{the assimilation of}} AIRS <b>radiances</b> along with that of several other data types in its operational global and regional analysis systems. The separate impact of AIRS data {{as well as the}} impact of the combined package were evaluated from extensive (~ 80 days) 4 D-var summer and winter assimilation cycles. Cloud free <b>radiances</b> from 87 channels are assimilated. The impact of the combined package is clearly positive with a gain in predictability of several hours at day 5 in both hemispheres. AIRS <b>radiances</b> account for about half of that impact...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous use of AIRS/AMSU-A {{observations}} {{allow for}} the determination of accurate atmospheric soundings under partial cloud cover conditions. The methodology involves {{the determination of the}} <b>radiances</b> AIRS would have seen if the AIRS fields of view were clear, called clear column <b>radiances,</b> and use of these <b>radiances</b> to infer the atmospheric and surface conditions giving rise to these clear column <b>radiances.</b> Susskind et al. demonstrate via simulation that accurate temperature soundings and clear column <b>radiances</b> can be derived from AIRS/AMSU-A observations in cases of up to 80 % partial cloud cover, with only a small degradation in accuracy compared to that obtained in clear scenes. Susskind and Atlas show that these findings hold for real AIRS/AMSU-A soundings as well. For data assimilation purposes, this small degradation in accuracy is more than offset by a significant increase in spatial coverage (roughly 50 % of global cases were accepted, compared to 3. 6 % of the global cases being diagnosed as clear), and assimilation of AIRS temperature soundings in partially cloudy conditions resulted in a larger improvement in forecast skill than when AIRS soundings were assimilated only under clear conditions. Alternatively, derived AIRS clear column <b>radiances</b> under partial cloud cover could also be used for data assimilation purposes. Further improvements in AIRS sounding methodology have been made since the results shown in Susskind and Atlas. A new version of the AIRS/AMSU-A retrieval algorithm, Version 4. 0, was delivered to the Goddard DAAC in February 2005 for production of AIRS derived products, including clear column <b>radiances.</b> The major improvement in the Version 4. 0 retrieval algorithm is with regard to a more flexible, parameter dependent, quality control. Results are shown of the accuracy and spatial distribution of temperature-moisture profiles and clear column <b>radiances</b> derived from AIRS/AMSU-A as a function of fractional cloud cover using the Version 4. 0 algorithm. Use of the Version 4. 0 AIRS temperature profiles increased the positive forecast impact arising from AIRS retrievals relative to what was shown in Susskind and Atlas...|$|R

5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the sentiment of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and <b>radiance</b> to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Pool of <b>Radiance</b> game shipped with a 28-page introductory booklet, {{which describes}} secrets {{relating to the}} game and the concepts behind it.

40|$|In recent decades, {{the land}} surface temperature/vegetation index (LST/NDVI) feature space {{has been widely}} used to {{estimate}} actual evapotranspiration (ETa) or evaporative fraction (EF, defined as the ratio of latent heat flux to surface available energy). Traditionally, {{it is essential to}} pre-process satellite top of atmosphere (TOA) <b>radiances</b> to obtain LST before estimating EF. However, pre-processing TOA <b>radiances</b> is a cumbersome task including corrections for atmospheric, adjacency and directional effects. Based on the contextual relationship between LST and NDVI, some studies proposed the direct use of TOA <b>radiances</b> instead of satellite retrieved LST products to estimate EF, and found that use of TOA <b>radiances</b> is applicable in some regional studies. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to test the robustness of the TOA <b>radiances</b> based EF estimation scheme over different climatic and surface conditions. Flux measurements from 16 FLUXNET (a global network of eddy covariance towers) sites were used to validate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) TOA <b>radiances</b> estimated daytime EF. It is found that the EF estimates perform well across a wide variety of climate and biome types-Grasslands, crops, cropland/natural vegetation mosaic, closed shrublands, mixed forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and savannas. The overall mean bias error (BIAS), mean absolute difference (MAD), root mean square difference (RMSD) and correlation coefficient (R) values for all the sites are 0. 018, 0. 147, 0. 178 and 0. 590, respectively, which are comparable with published results in the literature. We conclude that the direct use of measured TOA <b>radiances</b> instead of LST to estimate daytime EF can avoid complex atmospheric corrections associated with the satellite derived products, and would facilitate the relevant applications where minimum pre-processing is important. © 2014 by the authors...|$|R
5|$|Several journalistic {{sites have}} cited its low notoriety {{in the west}} as an effect of Nintendo's {{sporadic}} localization efforts, along with its place in a niche game genre. At the same time, they have praised the series' gameplay, regularly noting its high difficulty and relationship mechanics. Game Informer and Gamasutra both cited the series as an inspiration for later popular tactical role-playing games, with Gamasutra naming , Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series as being influenced by its design. Destructoid writer Chris Carter, writing in 2014, praised the series' mechanics, {{at the same time}} listing the five best games in the series: among those he chose were Mystery of the Emblem, Path of <b>Radiance,</b> and Awakening.

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of <b>Radiance</b> and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|The first Fire Emblem title, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, was {{originally}} never {{intended as a}} commercial game, defined by creator Shouzou Kaga as a dōjin project with three other job-holding students. As it turned out, the game was successful, prompting {{the development of more}} games in the series. The game was developed at Intelligent Systems, whose previous notable game was the strategy game Famicom Wars. Kaga would work on the Fire Emblem series until Thracia 776, when he left Nintendo and began development on Tear Ring Saga for the PlayStation. After Thracia 776, the Fire Emblem series had several releases on portable devices. At this time, Marth and Roy from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Sword of Seals appeared as playable characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee, prompting western interest in the Fire Emblem series. The positive reception of the characters made Nintendo decide to localize Blazing Sword under the title Fire Emblem. Due to its overseas success, it was decided to return the series to home consoles for Path of <b>Radiance</b> for the GameCube. Despite it arriving late in the GameCube's life cycle, it provided a late boost to sales, reaffirming Nintendo's faith in the series. By 2010, the series was suffering from declining sales and Nintendo told Intelligent Systems that if their next Fire Emblem failed to sell above 250,000 units, the series would be cancelled. This prompted Intelligent Systems to include lots of features new to the series, intending to make it the culmination of the series. The game's reception and sales ended up saving the series from cancellation, convincing Nintendo to continue production.|$|E
