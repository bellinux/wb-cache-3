25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But <b>remember</b> <b>these</b> words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

We have not forgotten what Jochen Peiper wrote to us from Landsberg Prison in 1952: [...] "Don't forget that the first Europeans killed in action were in the units of the Waffen-SS, that the one beaten to death during the post war period mostly were men from our ranks. They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe. <b>Remember</b> <b>these</b> martyrs".|$|E

The crack, having first appeared in Amy's bedroom {{when she was a little}} girl, has been a recurring theme; in [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] the Doctor discovers it has the power to erase things from existence, the reason Amy cannot remember the Daleks.|$|E

2500|$|The Jefferson Literary and Debating Society (commonly {{known as}} the Jefferson Society or [...] "Jeff Soc") is the oldest student {{organization}} at the University of Virginia, having been founded on July 14, 1825, in Room Seven, West Lawn. As such, {{it is one of}} the oldest collegiate societies in North America. It is also the second oldest Greek-lettered organization in the United States, after Phi Beta Kappa. The Society's Greek-letters are Φ Π Θ, initials for Φίλοί, Πατρίς, θεός (philoi, patris, theos, or [...] "friends, fatherland, God"). Its Latin motto, Haec Olim Meminisse Iuvabit, is taken from Virgil's Aeneid and roughly translated, [...] "In the future it will be pleasing to <b>remember</b> <b>these</b> things." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Italians of Henderson Street (and Leith in general) {{were also}} {{not immune to}} the results of Benito Mussolini siding with Adolf Hitler in World War II. Like many other Italian businesses, Angelo Lanny's shop was {{attacked}} and looted {{as a result of a}} new wave of anti-Italian feeling amongst some of the local population, and as was typical at the time Lanny was subsequently interned. So too was Joe Di Ponio, and the Scappiticci's were personally affected by the loss of a relative when the ship SS Arandora Star, bound for Newfoundland, transporting Italian and German interns, was torpedoed by a German U-Boat off the coast of Ireland. In all, 486 Italian and 175 German deportees were killed and the incident resulted in the British Government changing their policy on deporting interns overseas. Although those who can <b>remember</b> <b>these</b> incidents first hand were only children at that time, they made a deep impression. The 70th anniversary of the sinking of the Arandora in 2010 also brought these wartime events back into focus. The extract quoted to the right is from a poem by a Leith-born author and reflects his sentiments on those events: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory that}} can be tested using cued recall is {{symmetry}} of forward and backward recall. Forward recall is generally assumed to be easier than backward recall, i.e. forward recall is stronger than backward recall. This is generally true for long sequences of word or letters such as the alphabet. In one view, the independent associations hypothesis, the strength of forward and backward recall are hypothesized to be independent of each other. To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. George Wolford tested participants' forward and backward recall and found that forward and backward recall are independent of each other. The probability of correct forward recall was [...]47 for word pair associations and the probability of correct backward recall of word pair associations was [...]25. However, in another view, the associative symmetry hypothesis, the strengths of forward and backward recall are about equal and highly correlated. In S.E Asch from Swathmore College and S. M Ebenholtz's experiment, participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables by anticipation recall. After reaching a certain threshold of learning, the participants were tested by free recall to determine all pairs and single items they could <b>remember.</b> <b>These</b> researchers found that backward association was greatly weaker than forward association. However, when the availability of forward and backward recall were basically the same, there was little difference between forward and backward recall. Some scientists including Asch and Ebenholtz believe in the independent association hypothesis think that the equal strengths of forward and backward recall are compatible with their hypothesis because forward and backward recall could be independent but with equal strengths. However associative symmetry theorists interpreted the data to mean that the results fit their hypothesis.|$|E
