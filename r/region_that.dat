50|$|Global regions {{distinguishable}} from space, and {{are therefore}} clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However, they have been generally recognised as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into largest of land regions, known as continents, and the largest of water regions known as oceans. There are also significant <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> {{do not belong to}} either classification, such as archipelago <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are littoral <b>regions,</b> or earthquake <b>regions</b> <b>that</b> are defined in geology.|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} strong and {{damaging}} aftershocks persisted for about three-and-a-half months. The {{largest in the}} sequence came on May 8. The event caused additional destruction to the northeast of the initial meizoseismal area. Qatur, which had been nearly destroyed by the mainshock, took another serious hit. Other villages (Chaliyan, Givaran, Mir 'Umar, and Ravyan) also experienced major destruction. Shikaryazi was a village in the southeast <b>region</b> <b>that</b> had not been seriously affected by the mainshock, but experienced heavy damage during the May 8 event. This shock resulted in four additional deaths.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a handful}} of men reached Illinois Country, help {{never made it to}} the fort. Most of the {{remaining}} members of the colony were killed during a Karankawa raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the <b>region</b> <b>that</b> is now Texas.

5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} <b>region</b> <b>that</b> had been {{claimed by the}} {{provisional}} government, {{with the exception of}} Korçë, was under its control. On March 22, a Sacred Band unit from Bilisht reached the outskirts of Korçë and joined the local guerillas, and fierce street fighting took place. For several days, Northern Epirote units controlled the city, but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements.|$|E
