30|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>effluents</b> are {{measured}} by the radioactive materials that comprise the waste stream, and the associated radiation doses those materials deliver or carry with them. Data for two types of radioactive effluents—gaseous and liquid effluents—were summed {{to arrive at a}} total volume of <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluents</b> released by each NPP. The amount released was normalized according to the amount of electricity generated at each site. The effective dose data, which were computed using the normalized total <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluents,</b> were then estimated using a dose estimate model established by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and employed by Harris and Miller (2008). The dose estimate model made an assumption that a model NPP site has a population density of 1036 /square mile and 52 /square mile for within 31 miles of the site and within 772 miles of the site, respectively (Kyne 2015). This model site provides an estimate of the collective effective dose (CED) per unit release for different release categories. The CED per unit of electrical energy (man Sv (GW a) − ^ 1) then can be obtained by multiplying the normalized releases by the UNSCEAR-calculated values for CED per unit release. Both the <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluents</b> released and their effective dose data for the period 2001 – 2008 were included in these calculations, and were given equal weight in constructing the NPP PRI presented here.|$|R

The methodology addresses routine emission of chemical and <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluents,</b> and applies to mining, milling, conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication, reactors (LWR and BWR) and fuel reprocessing. Chemical and <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluents</b> are evaluated independently. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>effluents</b> are evaluated on the basis of maximum exposed individual dose and population dose calculations for a 1 -year emission period and a 50 -year commitment. Sources of radionuclides for each facility are then listed according to their relative contribution to the total calculated dose. Effluent, ambient and toxicology standards are used to evaluate the effect of chemical effluents. First, each chemical and source configuration is determined. Sources are tagged if they exceed existirrg standards. The combined effect of all chemicals is assessed for each facility. If the additive effects are unacceptable, then additional control technology is recommended. Finally, sources and their chemicals at each facility are ranked according to their relative contribution to the ambient pollution level. This ranking identifies those sources most in need of environmental control...|$|R

40|$|An {{in depth}} {{evaluation}} of safety {{is an essential}} component of the successful operation of nuclear facilities. The Safety Assessment Methodology is the tool applied to perform the safety evaluations of a facility in order to demonstrate satisfactory safety of such a facility to the operator, the National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) in South Africa, and to the public. A Safety Assessment is performed and documented to demonstrate the compliance with safety objectives, principles and criteria as stipulated by national and international standards. In South Africa the Department of Mineral and Energy publishes the National Nuclear Regulatory Requirements for demonstrating safety of a Nuclear Facility. As such, this Safety Assessment provides a formal structured procedure for defining the logic of systems and assessing the consequences if failure in the control logic occurs. This Safety Assessment demonstrates that the <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluent</b> generated at a typical nuclear facility the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) is managed according to national and internationally acceptable proven technology and standards. Those standards are documented in the National Nuclear Regulatory Act. Licensing documents have been issued by the Regulator to guide the holder of a nuclear installation licence to compile a Safety Assessment. International standards are provided by the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) through a number of technical documents and the Safety Standards Series. This Safety Assessment aims to show that the <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Effluent</b> Treatment Facility at Necsa can be operated without endangering the lives of the operators and the public and without having adverse effects on the environment. The hazards of operating a <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Effluent</b> Treatment Facility include radiological, chemical and conventional hazards. However, this Safety Assessment only focuses on the radiological (radiation and contamination) hazards and, in particular on the radiological hazards associated with the accidental exposure of an operator to Medium Activity Effluent. This report demonstrates the safety condition of the <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Effluent</b> Treatment Facility at Necsa by providing: 1. a systematic evaluation of consequences in the case of accidental exposure and 2. a documented demonstration of the controls in place to ensure that the workers, members of the public and environment are protected sufficiently, with the main focus being on worker exposure. The justification of the discharge of treated <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluent</b> into the environment is a globally accepted practice. This Safety Assessment briefly discusses environmental discharge practices but the main focus is on the analysis of the protection of the workers of the <b>Radioactive</b> <b>Effluent</b> Treatment Facility. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>effluent</b> is only discharged into the nearby Crocodile River if it is in compliance with discharge criteria as set by the National Nuclear Regulator and the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry...|$|E
