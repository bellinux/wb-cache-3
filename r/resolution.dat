5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a <b>resolution</b> instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter {{to negotiate with the}} governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the <b>resolution,</b> and it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute <b>resolution</b> which softened the most objectionable language but retained the call for fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E

Emmanuel Rivoire increased the <b>resolution</b> to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher <b>resolution.</b> The game still supports the original 320×200 <b>resolution,</b> as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
