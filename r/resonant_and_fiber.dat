3000|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> amplifying currents {{in shaping the}} neuronal voltage response (impedance and phase profiles) to oscillatory input currents is complex [29], sometimes non-intuitive, and involves not only changes in the maximal amplitude of the voltage response but also in other attributes including the <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> phase <b>resonant</b> frequencies. The role that different types of <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> amplifying currents play in shaping the impedance profile has been recently clarified in [29]. An important outcome {{of this study is}} that the standard classification “resonant vs. amplifying” does not capture in its entirety the effect that changes in their biophysical parameters have on the shapes of the impedance and phase profiles. For instance, while hyperpolarization-activated (h- or [...]...|$|R

40|$|Open quantum {{systems are}} often {{represented}} by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians that have complex eigenvalues associated with resonances. In previous work {{we showed that}} the evolution of tight-binding open systems can be represented by an explicitly time-reversal symmetric expansion involving all the discrete eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian. These eigenstates include complex-conjugate pairs of <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> anti-resonant states. An initially time-reversal-symmetric state contains equal contributions from the <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> anti-resonant states. Here we show that as the state evolves in time, the symmetry between the <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> anti-resonant states is automatically broken, with resonant states becoming dominant for $t> 0 $ and anti-resonant states becoming dominant for $t< 0 $. Further, we {{show that there is}} a time-scale for this symmetry-breaking, which we associate with the "Zeno time. " We also compare the time-reversal symmetric expansion with an asymmetric expansion used previously by several researchers. We show how the present time-reversal symmetric expansion bypasses the non-Hilbert nature of the <b>resonant</b> <b>and</b> anti-resonant states, which previously introduced exponential divergences into the asymmetric expansion.

40|$|International audienceThis article investigates {{combined}} {{effects of}} nonlinearities and substrate's deformability on modulational instability. For that, we consider a lattice model {{based on the}} nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation with an on-site potential of deformable shape. Such a consideration enables to broaden the description of energy-localization mechanisms in various physical systems. We consider the strong-coupling limit and employ semi-discrete approximation to show that nonlinear wave modulations can be described by an extended nonlinear Schrodinger equation containing a fourth-order dispersion component. The stability of modulation of carrier waves is scrutinized and the following findings are obtained analytically. The various domains of gains and instabilities are provided based upon various combinations of {{the parameters of the}} system. The instability gains strongly depend on nonlinear terms and on the kind of shape of the substrate. According to the system's parameters, our model can lead to different sets of known equations such as those in a negative index material embedded into a Kerr medium, glass <b>fibers,</b> <b>resonant</b> optical <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> others. Consequently, some of the results obtained here are in agreement with those obtained in previous works. The suitable combination of nonlinear terms with the deformability of the substrate can be utilized to specifically control the amplitude of waves and consequently to stabilize their propagations. The results of analytical investigations are validated and complemented by numerical simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The regions (tongues) in the forcing frequency and forcing amplitude parameter plane where resonant patterns form are identified through analysis of the temporal response of the patterns. <b>Resonant</b> <b>and</b> near-resonant responses are distinguished. The unforced BZ reaction shows both spatially-uniform oscillations and rotating spiral waves, while the forced system shows patterns such as standing-wave labyrinths and rotating spiral waves. The patterns depend on the amplitude and frequency of the perturbation, and also on whether the system responds to the forcing near the uniform oscillation frequency or the spiral wave frequency.

The values of wood density <b>and</b> <b>fiber</b> length, <b>fiber</b> diameter <b>and</b> <b>fiber</b> wall thickness were obtained and variance {{analyses were performed}} considering site and clone as the sources of variation. Components of genetic and phenotypic variations were determined to calculate heritability in its broad sense. The results indicated that site and clone had significant effect on wood density <b>and</b> <b>fiber</b> biometry. The pattern variation of properties showed that the clone 77 / 51 corresponded to the higher wood density <b>and</b> <b>fiber</b> biometry range in both sites, but the clone 45 / 51 had the lowest. Also, the wood density of populus deltoids from Safra-baste site in Guilan was higher than that it Shast-kolateh site in Gorgan. For each clone, the mean values of wood density, <b>fiber</b> length <b>and</b> <b>fiber</b> diameter <b>and</b> <b>fiber</b> wall 3 thickness varied between 305. 7 - 367. 1 kg m, 0. 96 - 1. 29 mm, 24 - 28. 46 µm and 5. 02 - 6. 25 µm respectively.
