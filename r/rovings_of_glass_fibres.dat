The {{hybrid of}} liquid {{crystalline}} polymer (LCP) <b>fibres</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> (GF) provide {{a combination of}} modulus and toughness to semi-crystalline linear-low-density-polyethylene (LLDPE). LCP and GF fibres reinforced composites were studied using two-body abrasion tesr under different applied loads. Two sets of fibre reinforced LLDPE, 10 and 20 vol%, were investigated.

40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> {{reinforcements}} {{form the}} foundation of a composite materials industry with a global annual production of greater than 10 million tons of high performance, light weight carbon footprint lowering materials. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and their composites is the fibre sizing. Yet because of the intense level of industrial secrecy around sizings there are very few people in the vast chain of composite materials suppliers, processers and end users who have more than a superficial understanding <b>of</b> what <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings are and what they do. There are many questions which this large and growing composite community poses about <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings. Which analytical techniques are most useful in sizing research? Who has published research results on sizing and their ingredients? Which silanes are the most researched for use in sizings? Which <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> manufacturers have reported research findings on sizings? This review will act as a guide to obtaining some of the answers to these and many other questions about <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings. The composites materials industry is currently experiencing a period of intense growth in new application development due to the potential which light-weight high performance composite materials have to reduce the carbon footprint of many industries. Composite materials have been highly successful in such applications due to the synergy of combining two, or more, dissimilar materials to obtain a better performance than the sum of the individual components. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> has been particularly successful as the reinforcement in these composites. Today <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> products account for more than 95 % of fibre reinforcements used in the composites industry, primarily due to their highly attractive performance to price ratio. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and their composites is the fibre sizing. Sizing is a thin surface coating of mainly organic materials applied to nearly all types of man-made fibres during their manufacture. Given the well-recognized critical importance of sizing in all aspects of the profitability, processibility and performance <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced composites and consequently to the ultimate success of the composites industry, it is surprising (perhaps even astonishing) to note the lack of a proportionally sized body of fundamental and applied research publications on this subject. There can be few examples of such a large materials industry (global annual production well in excess of 10 million tons of fibre reinforced composites) where the manufacturing and performance of those materials are so critically dependent on such a small component that is so narrowly understood. The research and development <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizing is inextricably linked to the intellectual property concerns <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> manufacturers and consequently information {{on the nature of the}} technical challenges facing sizing developers is not openly available to the technical community. Despite these challenges there has been quite some work published in and around the subject <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings over the years.

40|$|The {{processing}} and reuse of end-of-life composite products in an environmentally friendly manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the industry and community. The global annual production <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced composite materials is rapidly approaching 10 million tons, of which approximately 60 % is thermoset based. A number of processes are available for recycling such GRP composites. Of these possible routes, thermal recycling is probably the most technologically advanced and has been piloted in the UK and Denmark. However, nearly all options deliver recycled fibres which suffer from a lack of cost competitiveness with pristine first-pass materials. A key factor in this equation is that there is a huge drop in the performance <b>of</b> recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> (80 - 90 %) in comparison to its original state. Consequently, recycled fibres have a very poor performance to cost ratio, and in most cases are considered unsuitable for re{{processing and}} reuse as a valuable reinforcement of composites. In this presentation we will introduce two recently initiated EPSRC funded projects (ReCoVeR) focussed on the enabling cost-effective regeneration of the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> obtained from thermal recycling <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced composites from end-of-life automotive and wind energy applications. A breakthrough in the regeneration <b>of</b> recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such GRP composites which would otherwise most likely be disposed of to landfill.
