50|$|In {{the field}} of {{computer}} networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, teletraffic engineering refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service {{is the ability to}} provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. For example, a required bit rate, delay, jitter, packet loss or bit error rates may be guaranteed. Quality of service guarantees are important if the network capacity is insufficient, especially for <b>real-time</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>multimedia</b> applications such as voice over IP, multiplayer online games and IPTV, since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive, and in networks where the capacity is a limited resource, for example in cellular data communication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Multimedia {{groupware}} systems provide rich {{support for}} distributed team work. Yet {{effective design of}} these systems is difficult because they must cater to complex human and social factors. Rapid prototyping partially mitigates this, for it allows designers to build, deploy, test and quickly evolve design ideas. The problem is that multimedia groupware is hard to prototype because distributed multimedia systems are complex to implement. To solve this problem, we offer the Collabrary, a toolkit designed to ease prototyping of multimedia groupware. The Collabrary blends <b>real-time</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>multimedia,</b> asynchronous shared application state, and novel multimedia analysis and manipulation algorithms to provide rich functionality for distributed teamwork. Implementing core functionality—multimedia capture, analysis, manipulation, transmission and rendering—is trivial.

40|$|Quality of Service (QoS) {{guarantees}} are important, if {{the network}} capacity is insufficient, particularly for <b>real-time</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>multimedia</b> {{applications such as}} voice over IP. Differentiated Services or DiffServ are the services of the original internet that prioritizes flows according to their service class andprovides much better bandwidth utilization. Predicting the end-to-end behavior and acquiring the method by which individual routers deal {{with the type of}} service field is difficult and fairly appropriate. Moreover it becomes more difficult if a packet crosses two or more DiffServ clouds, before reaching its destination. In this paper, we propose a QoS mapping framework to achieve scalability and end-to-end accuracy in QoS, using a Policy Agent (PA) in every DiffServ domain. This agent performs admission control decisions depending on a policy database. It configures the ingress and egress routers to perform traffic policing and conditioning jobs. Moreover, it constructs the shortest path between a source and destination satisfying the QoS constraints Bandwidth and Delay. By simulation results, we show that our proposed approach attains high throughput with reduced packet loss when compared with the normal DiffServ architecture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. IIn this paper, we have {{successfully}} implemented a seamless handoff between heterogeneous networks {{to achieve a}} fast voice/video over IP (V 2 oIP) with Partially Reliable Stream Control Transport Protocol (PR-SCTP) instead of TCP or UDP. In order to improve real-time video/voice streaming over IP, the conventional framework IHU has been remodeled as a new framework called SCTP-IHU that can simultaneously resolve the crucial problems of head-of-line blocking, handoff interruption, and non-real-time transmission using multi-streaming, multi-homing, and partial reliability in PR-SCTP. Four types of handoff experiment, switching paths (a) from wired to wireless network, (b) from wireless to wired network, (c) between wired networks, and (d) between wireless networks, have been tested successfully for real-time V 2 oIP within the smallest delay (1. 5 sec) for any handoff, that is, so-called timed PR-SCTP. As a result, the scheme SCTP-IHU definitely realizes <b>real-time</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>multimedia</b> for voice/video over IP (V 2 oIP) in parallel. With high throughput, low handoff delay, and minimum packet losses rate, our proposed approach outperforms the previous work TCP-based USHA scheme...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} and investigates a dynamic buffer management scheme for QoS control of multimedia {{services in a}} 3. 5 G wireless system i. e. the High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA). HSDPA was introduced to enhance UMTS for high-speed packet switched services. With HSDPA, packet scheduling and HARQ mechanisms in the base station require data buffering at the air interface thus introducing a potential bottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, for multimedia services with multiplexed parallel diverse flows such as video and data in the same end-user session, buffer management schemes in the base station are essential to support end-to-end QoS provision. We propose a dynamic buffer management scheme for HSDPA multimedia sessions with aggregated real-time and non real-time flows in the paper. The end-to-end performance impact of the scheme is evaluated with an example multimedia session comprising a real-time streaming flow concurrent with TCP-based non real-time flow via extensive HSDPA simulations.

Unlike earlier systems, UMTS-evolved systems from HSDPA and beyond incorporate mechanisms such as packet scheduling and HARQ in the base station necessitating data buffering at the air interface. This introduces a potential bottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, buffer management at the air interface is crucial for end-to-end QoS support of multimedia services with multi-plexed parallel diverse flows such as video and data in the same end-user session.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for scheduling packets in <b>real-time</b> <b>multimedia</b> data <b>streams.</b> Common to these classes of data streams are service constraints {{in terms of}} bandwidth and delay. However, it is typical for <b>real-time</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>streams</b> to tolerate bounded delay varia-tions and, in some cases, finite losses of packets. We have therefore developed a scheduling algorithm that assumes streams have window-constraints on groups of consecutive packet deadlines. A window-constraint defines the number of packet deadlines that can be missed in a window of dead-lines for consecutive packets in a stream. Our algorithm, called Dynamic Window-Constrained Scheduling (DWCS), attempts to guarantee no more than x out of a window of y deadlines are missed for consec-utive packets in <b>real-time</b> and <b>multimedia</b> <b>streams.</b> Using DWCS, the delay of service to <b>real-time</b> <b>streams</b> is bounded even when the scheduler is overloaded. Moreover, DWCS is capable of ensuring independent delay bounds on streams, {{while at the same}} time guaranteeing minimum bandwidth utilizations over tunable and finite windows of time. We show the conditions under which the total demand for link bandwidth by a set of real-time (i. e., window-constrained) streams can exceed 100 % and still ensure all window-constraints are met. In fact, we show how it is pos-sible to guarantee worst-case per-stream bandwidth and delay constraints while utilizing all available link capac-ity. Finally, we show how best-effort packets can be ser-viced with fast response time, in the presence of window-constrained traffic. 1...|$|R
