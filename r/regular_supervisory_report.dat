40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} guarantees on loan interest rates {{before and during the}} recent financial crisis in Italian firm financing. The paper improves on existing literature by distinguishing between real and personal guarantees. Further, the paper investigates the potential different role of guarantees in the bank-borrower relationship during the recent financial crisis. This paper draws from individual Italian bank and firm data taken from the Banks’ <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Reports</b> to the Bank of Italy and the Central Credit Register over the period 2006 - 2009. Our analysis demonstrates that collateral affects the cost of credit of Italian firms by systematically reducing the interest rate of secured loans, while personal guarantees increase it. These effects are amplified during the crisis. Furthermore, guarantees are a more powerful instrument for ex-ante riskier borrowers than for safer borrowers. Indeed, riskier borrowers obtain significantly lower interest rates on secured loans than interest rate they would be charged on unsecured loans. ...|$|R

The transnational solutions for labour conflicts have an increasing complementary role to national systems, mainly in the today’s context of globalisation and transnationalisation of industrial relations. For this purpose, the International Labour Organization (ILO), an agency of transnational labour conflicts regulation and a supervising entity of core labour standards enforcement, has implemented supervisory mechanisms either special (complaints and representations) or <b>regular</b> (<b>regular</b> <b>supervisory</b> system). Drawing on the documentary analysis of all the complaints and representations procedures, we intend to clarify the relationship between Portugal and ILO, particularly after 1974.

While the principal observes a noisy signal about agent’s effort and the supervisor’s report, the agent and supervisor can perfectly observe each other’s actions. In a repeated setting, this allows the employees to punish each other without error for shirking. The optimal compensation schemes are designed to trade off incentives {{to work in the}} current period against inducing the most severe punishments following a deviation. On the equilibrium path, optimal schemes provide incentives for the agent by compensating for favorable <b>supervisory</b> <b>report,</b> and off the equilibrium path by inducing severe minmax punishments. In contrast, in a static setting the likelihood ratios (the informational content of performance measures) shape the optimal schemes. Thus repeated interaction generates compensation policies that would not be optimal in a static setting.

METHODS: In the first quarter of 2005, the HIV Unit of the Ministry of Health and its partners (the Lighthouse Clinic; Médecins Sans Frontières-Belgium, Thyolo district; and WHO's Country Office) undertook structured supervision and monitoring of all public sector health facilities in Malawi delivering antiretroviral therapy. FINDINGS: Data monitoring showed {{that by the end of}} 2004, there were 13 183 patients (5274 (40 %) male, 12 527 (95 %) adults) who had ever started antiretroviral therapy. Of patients who had ever started, 82 % (10 761 / 13 183) were alive and taking antiretrovirals; 8 % (1026 / 13 183) were dead; 8 % (1039 / 13 183) had been lost to follow up; < 1 % (106 / 13 183) had stopped treatment; and 2 % (251 / 13 183) had transferred to another facility. Of those alive and on antiretrovirals, 98 % (7098 / 7258) were ambulatory; 85 % (6174 / 7258) were fit to work; 10 % (456 / 4687) had significant side effects; and, based on pill counts, 96 % (6824 / 7114) had taken their treatment correctly. Mistakes in the registration and monitoring of patients were identified and corrected. Drug stocks were checked, and one potential drug stock-out was averted. As a result of the supervisory visits, by the end of March 2005 recruitment of patients to facilities scheduled to start delivering antiretroviral therapy had increased.

A body of evidence indicates that exemption policies, while potentially effective in principle, are ineffective in implementation. However, there is evidence that some districts, despite the challenges, perform better than others in terms of identifying the poor and allocating funds for the poor and vulnerable groups. Drawing from the review of minutes, health facility visits, and key informant interviews with the community representatives and the district health managers, the study explored why exemption policies in Tanzania are relatively better implemented in some districts than in others. The findings indicate that in Lindi district the pro-poor exemption mechanism was ineffective in implementation. There were no clear ways of identifying and protecting the poor household members. In contrast, in Iramba district the policy was relatively better implemented. The poor were identified at the village, ward, health facility and district levels. In some villages, the poor were grouped in 10 s to form one household. Then, using the village funds, the Community Health Fund cards were purchased for them.

40|$|Objective: Supervised {{experience}} is a crucial element {{in the education of}} trainee sport psychologists (TSPs). Insight into the issues that are raised in supervision is relevant for the development of educational programs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain insight into supervisory issues of TSPs. Design: A mixed methods design was employed. Method: 369 supervision questions from fourteen TSPs were collected from written <b>supervisory</b> <b>reports.</b> The supervision questions were initially rated on the supervisory issues described by Loganbill, Hardy, and Delworth (1982) and Rabinowitz, Heppner, and Roehlke (1986). Inter-rater agreement and occurrence of issues were calculated. An alternative model for supervision questions of TSPs was developed through inductive and deductive analyses. Results: For most of the supervisory issues described by Loganbill et al. (1982) and Rabinowitz et al. (1986) the inter-rater agreement and occurrence was low. An alternative model was developed consisting of two higher-order categories ('Know-how' and 'Professional development'), six lower-order categories ('Intake', 'Treatment plan', 'Execution', 'Reflections', 'Working principles' and 'Coping with dilemmas') and 19 separate themes. Conclusions: The supervisory issues proposed by Loganbill et al. (1982) and Rabinowitz et al. (1986) do not fully capture the learning needs for supervision as formulated by the TSPs studied. Our alternative model provides an overview of supervision questions of TSPs. The developed model may contribute to the quality of trainees' learning in supervision by helping both trainees and supervisors prepare for supervision, and by helping sport psychology educators to offer efficacious curricula and learning experiences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Building on {{conservation}} of resources theory, we cast resource depletion as a novel explanatory mechanism to explain why employees’ experience of psychological contract violation results in harm to third parties outside the employee-organization exchange dyad. This resource-based perspective extends and complements the dominant social exchange perspective which views employee reactions to psychological contract violation as targeting {{the source of the}} violation – the organization. The present paper reports on three studies. Study 1 conducted an experiment with 109 participants and established the main effect of psychological contract violation on resource depletion. Study 2, using survey data from 315 medical employees and their immediate supervisors, found that after controlling for the social exchange mechanism (i. e., revenge cognitions toward the organization), resource depletion mediated the indirect effects of psychological contract violation on <b>supervisory</b> <b>reports</b> of employees’ interpersonal harming toward coworkers and decision-making vigilance for clients. Further, we found that organizational and professional identification played opposing moderating roles in the effects of violation on resource depletion and consequently behavioral outcomes, such that these mediated relationships were stronger when organizational identification was high, and weaker when professional identification was high. Study 3 replicated all the results obtained in Studies 1 and 2 with time-lagged data from 229 medical employees across three measurement points. The findings confirm that resource depletion is a more effective explanation of the consequences of violation on third parties than revenge cognitions, although both are useful in predicting organization-directed outcomes (i. e., civic virtue and organizational rule compliance) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} {{the association between}} household-level and provider-level determinants and childhood immunization rates in Cameroon while also calculating the cost of childhood immunizations. Methods: This study uses multilevel regression analysis to calculate these relationships. The 1998 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey and the 2000 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey are the main sources of household-level data. These surveys are supplemented by data from a 2002 survey of health facilities conducted in three provinces. At the national level, immunization financing {{data were collected from}} the Ministry of Health and donors that support the national Expanded Programme on Immunization. Findings: The 1998 survey found that nationally 37 % of children were fully immunized; the 2000 survey found that nationally 34 % were fully immunized. These results are strongly correlated with both the mother's level of education and the household's economic status. Multilevel logistic regression shows that maternal education level is a stronger predictor of positive immunization status than is relative economic status. Children of mothers with secondary education or higher education were 3 {{times more likely to be}} fully vaccinated than children whose mothers had not completed primary education. At the health-facility level, both having an immunization plan and <b>regular</b> <b>supervisory</b> visits from someone at the health-district level are strongly positively associated with immunization rates. The cost of routine vaccinations for each fully immunized child is US$ 12. 73 when donors' contributions are included but not the costs of immunization campaigns. Conclusion: Studies conducted in the 1980 s and 1990 s found that costs per fully immunized child varied from US$ 2. 19 to US$ 26, 59 (not adjusted for inflation) in a range of low-income and middle-income countries. The relatively low rates of immunization coverage in Cameroon, and the strong influence of the household's socioeconomic status-particularly the mother's level of education-on immunization rate s suggest that the effectiveness of the Cameroon programme could be increased by promoting immunization and directing such programmes towards households with limited resources...|$|R
40|$|Mid-level cadres {{are being}} used to address human {{resource}} shortages in many African contexts, but insufficient and ineffective human resource management is compromising their performance. Supervision {{plays a key role in}} performance and motivation, but is frequently characterised by periodic inspection and control, rather than support and feedback to improve performance. This paper explores the perceptions of district health management teams in Tanzania and Malawi on their role as supervisors and on the challenges to effective supervision at the district level. This qualitative study took place as part of a broader project, "Health Systems Strengthening for Equity: The Power and Potential of Mid-Level Providers". Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 district health management team personnel in Malawi and 37 council health team members in Tanzania. The interviews covered a range of human resource management issues, including supervision and performance assessment, staff job descriptions and roles, motivation and working conditions. Participants displayed varying attitudes to the nature and purpose of the supervision process. Much of the discourse in Malawi centred on inspection and control, while interviewees in Tanzania were more likely to articulate a paradigm characterised by support and improvement. In both countries, facility level performance metrics dominated. The lack of competency-based indicators or clear standards to assess individual health worker performance were considered problematic. Shortages of staff, at both district and facility level, were described as a major impediment to carrying out <b>regular</b> <b>supervisory</b> visits. Other challenges included conflicting and multiple responsibilities of district health team staff and financial constraints. Supervision is a central component of effective human resource management. Policy level attention is crucial to ensure a systematic, structured process that is based on common understandings of the role and purpose of supervision. This is particularly important in a context where the majority of staff are mid-level cadres for whom regulation and guidelines may not be as formalised or well-developed as for traditional cadres, such as registered nurses and medical doctors. Supervision needs to be adequately resourced and supported in order to improve performance and retention at the district level...|$|R

In this paper, we describe a new business intelligence system developed to monitor {{the efficiency of the}} energy production of a PV park. The system includes services for data collection, summarization (based on trend cluster discovery), synthetic data generation, <b>supervisory</b> monitoring, <b>report</b> building and visualization...|$|R
40|$|Chinese listed {{companies}} adopt a two-tier board structure, a Board of Directors (BoD) and a Supervisory Board. They are also {{required to provide}} in their annual <b>reports</b> a <b>supervisory</b> board <b>report</b> (SBR). However, Congquin, a listed company, failed to issue a SBR in its 1998 annual report. This study specifically investigates {{the usefulness of the}} SBR by examining the stock market reaction to Congquin's SBR omission. The study also examines the <b>Supervisory</b> Board's <b>reporting</b> process and users' perceived usefulness of the SBR through interviews with directors, supervisory board members and senior executives of 16 {{listed companies}}. Discussions were also held with financial analysts, regulatory officials and academics. Our event study suggests that the absence of the SBR in Congquin's 1998 annual report caused a negative market reaction suggesting that investors had considered the SBR and the Supervisory Board important and were discouraged by the problems manifested by the absence of the SBR. Our interviews reveal that the usefulness of the SBR depends on the role that the Supervisory Board plays in corporate governance. If the Supervisory Board is an honoured guest, a friendly advisor, or a censored watchdog, {{it is unlikely that the}} SBR will convey much useful information. By contrast, if the Supervisory Board acts as an independent watchdog, then the SBR would be useful. Given the fact that the Supervisory Board in most of the companies that participated in the interviews fell into the first three categories, there remains a strong need to improve the usefulness of the SBR and strengthen the functioning of the Supervisory Board.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Mid-level cadres {{are being}} used to address human {{resource}} shortages in many African contexts, but insufficient and ineffective human resource management is compromising their performance. Supervision {{plays a key role in}} performance and motivation, but is frequently characterised by periodic inspection and control, rather than support and feedback to improve performance. This paper explores the perceptions of district health management teams in Tanzania and Malawi on their role as supervisors and on the challenges to effective supervision at the district level. 				 				 					 						Methods 					This qualitative study took place as part of a broader project, &# 8220;Health Systems Strengthening for Equity: The Power and Potential of Mid-Level Providers&# 8221;. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 district health management team personnel in Malawi and 37 council health team members in Tanzania. The interviews covered a range of human resource management issues, including supervision and performance assessment, staff job descriptions and roles, motivation and working conditions. 				 				 					 						Results 					Participants displayed varying attitudes to the nature and purpose of the supervision process. Much of the discourse in Malawi centred on inspection and control, while interviewees in Tanzania were more likely to articulate a paradigm characterised by support and improvement. In both countries, facility level performance metrics dominated. The lack of competency-based indicators or clear standards to assess individual health worker performance were considered problematic. Shortages of staff, at both district and facility level, were described as a major impediment to carrying out <b>regular</b> <b>supervisory</b> visits. Other challenges included conflicting and multiple responsibilities of district health team staff and financial constraints. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					Supervision is a central component of effective human resource management. Policy level attention is crucial to ensure a systematic, structured process that is based on common understandings of the role and purpose of supervision. This is particularly important in a context where the majority of staff are mid-level cadres for whom regulation and guidelines may not be as formalised or well-developed as for traditional cadres, such as registered nurses and medical doctors. Supervision needs to be adequately resourced and supported in order to improve performance and retention at the district level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tackling {{neonatal}} mortality {{is essential for}} the achievement of the child survival millennium development goal. There are just under 4 million neonatal deaths, accounting for 38 % of the 10. 8 million deaths among children younger than 5 years of age taking place each year; 99 % of these occur in low- and middle-income countries where a large proportion of births take place at home, and where postnatal care for mothers and neonates is either not available or is of poor quality. WHO and UNICEF have issued a joint statement calling for governments to implement "Home visits for the newborn child: a strategy to improve survival", following several studies in South Asia which achieved substantial reductions in {{neonatal mortality}} through community-based approaches. However, their feasibility and effectiveness have not yet been evaluated in Africa. The Newhints study aims to do this in Ghana and to develop a feasible and sustainable community-based approach to improve newborn care practices, and by so doing improve neonatal survival. Methods Newhints is an integrated intervention package based on extensive formative research, and developed in close collaboration with seven District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) in Brong Ahafo Region. The core component is training the existing community based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs) to identify pregnant women and to conduct two home visits during pregnancy and three {{in the first week of}} life to address essential care practices, and to assess and refer very low birth weight and sick babies. CBSVs are supported by a set of materials, <b>regular</b> <b>supervisory</b> visits, incentives, sensitisation activities with TBAs, health facility staff and communities, and providing training for essential newborn care in health facilities. Newhints is being evaluated through a cluster randomised controlled trial, and intention to treat analyses. The clusters are 98 supervisory zones; 49 have been randomised for implementation of the Newhints intervention, with the other 49 acting as controls. Data on neonatal mortality and care practices will be collected from approximately 15, 000 babies through surveillance of women of child-bearing age in the 7 districts. Detailed process, cost and cost-effectiveness evaluations are also being carried out. Trial registration [URL] (identifier NCT 00623337) </p...|$|R

The assessment {{reveals that}} insurance supervision in Italy occurs within a legal framework that incorporates the relevant European Union Directives. More {{than two-thirds of}} the principles have been assessed as being observed or largely observed. Furthermore, the authorities in Italy are actively pursuing a number of legislative and supervisory initiatives that hold the potential to materially improve the level of observance in the near future.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{influence}} of Islam on corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs). Design/methodology/approach – Using the content analysis approach, the paper examines the influences of Islam on CSRD by looking into the annual reports of 21 conventional financial institutions (CFIs) and 21 IFIs operating in the Gulf region. Findings – The results show significant differences in the level and the extent of the disclosure between IFIs and CFIs, largely due to the disclosure made by IFIs of religions related themes and information, including Shari'a <b>supervisory</b> board <b>reports,</b> the “Zakah” and charity donation, and free interest loan. Originality/value – This paper's contribution to the literature is twofold: the paper reveals the actual difference of CSRD between IFIs and non-IFIs, by comparing the disclosures made by IFIs and non-IFIs; and the paper identifies the extent of influence of Islam upon the CSRD of IFIs...|$|R
