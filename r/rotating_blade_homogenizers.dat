Firstly, {{by using the}} finite element method to obtain the <b>rotating</b> <b>blade’s</b> natural frequency, modal shape and strain modal shape, the mounting location of the FBG on the <b>rotating</b> <b>blade</b> is determined; secondly, using optical fiber non-contact transmission device, the <b>rotating</b> <b>blade’s</b> dynamic strain in different locations can be measured by FBG. In this paper, the author only analyzed the frequency, amplitude and the dynamic stiffening phenomenon of dynamic strain {{at one point in}} rotating state. Finally, the author points out that this method can effectively measure <b>rotating</b> <b>blade’s</b> dynamic strain and dynamic response, by result analysis, roatating blade worth further researching.

40|$|<b>Rotated</b> <b>blades</b> are key {{mechanical}} components in turbomachinery and high cycle fatigues often induce blade cracks. Accurate detection of small cracks in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> is very significant for safety, reliability, and availability. In nature, a breathing crack model is {{fit for a}} small crack in a <b>rotated</b> <b>blade</b> rather than other models. However, traditional vibration displacements-based methods are less sensitive to nonlinear characteristics due to small breathing cracks. In order to solve this problem, vibration power flow analysis (VPFA) is proposed to analyze nonlinear dynamic behaviors of <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> with small breathing cracks in this paper. Firstly, local flexibility due to a crack is derived and then time-varying dynamic model of the <b>rotated</b> <b>blade</b> with a small breathing crack is built. Based on it, the corresponding vibration power flow model is presented. Finally, VPFA-based numerical simulations are done to validate nonlinear behaviors of the cracked blade. The results demonstrate that nonlinear behaviors of a crack can be enhanced by power flow analysis and VPFA is more sensitive to a small breathing crack than displacements-based vibration analysis. Bifurcations will occur due to breathing cracks and subharmonic resonance factors can be defined to identify breathing cracks. Thus the proposed method can provide a promising way for detecting and predicting small breathing cracks in <b>rotated</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the flow characteristics of the laminar and the turbulent boundary layers on <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> of an axial-flow turbomachine, a theoretical analysis was performed taking the chord-wise pressure gradient into account with the aid of the rotating helical coordinates. Comparison of the calculated results of <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> with those of two－dimensional stationary ones showed that the secondary flow induced over the <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> has strong effect of suppressing the boundary layer growth, which results in that the transition and the separation of the boundary layer are much delayed.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{behavior}} of the blade tip vortices of a wind turbine equipped with a brimmed-diffuser shroud, called a &# 8220;Wind-Lens turbine&# 8221;, we conducted a three-dimensional numerical simulation using a large eddy simulation (LES). Since this unique wind turbine consists of not only <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> but also a diffuser shroud with a broad-ring brim at the exit periphery, the flow field around the turbine is highly complex and unsteady. Previously, our research group conducted numerical simulations using an actuator-disc approximation, in which the <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> were simply modeled as an external force on the fluid. Therefore, the detailed flow patterns around the <b>rotating</b> <b>blades</b> and the shroud, including the blade tip vortices, could not be simulated. Instead of an actuator-disc approximation, we used a moving boundary technique in the present CFD simulation to simulate the flow around a <b>rotating</b> <b>blade</b> in order to focus especially on blade tip vortices. The simulation results showed a pair of vortices consisting of a blade tip vortex and a counter-rotating vortex which was generated between the blade tip and the inner surface of the diffuser. Since these vortices interacted with each other, the blade tip vortex was weakened by the counter-rotating vortex. The results showed good agreement with past wind tunnel experiments...|$|R

In order to solve this problem, it is important and necessary to study effects of crack on vibration characteristics of mistuned <b>rotated</b> <b>blades</b> (MRBs). Firstly, a lumped-parameter model is established based on coupled multiple blades, where mistuned stiffness with normal distribution is introduced. Next, a breathing crack model is adopted and eigenvalue analysis is used in coupled lumped-parameter model. Then, numerical analysis is done and effects of depths and positions of a crack on natural frequency, vibration amplitude, and vibration localization parameters are studied. The results show that a crack causes natural frequency decease and vibration amplitude increase of cracked blade. Bifurcations will occur due to a breathing crack. Furthermore, based on natural frequencies and vibration amplitudes, variational factors are defined to detect a crack in MRBs, which are validated by numerical simulations.
