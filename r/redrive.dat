50|$|In 2008, GeoSmart {{launched}} the RAPIDcV mapping car, {{which is an}} ongoing program to <b>redrive</b> all of New Zealand. This is to enhance the car navigation database used by brands including Navman, TomTom, Nav N Go, Siemens VDO and Horizon. The RAPIDcV (Road attributes, points of interest, imagery data capture vehicle) uses technology to capture the road centreline of all of New Zealand's roads to an accuracy of 0.15 metres. It does this {{with a number of}} technologies including inertial measurement unit (IMU) that uses gyroscopes and accelerometers. This technology compensates for situations where the traditional differential GPS accuracy is lost when the satellite signal is poor, such as behind volcanic hill shadows, dense forest canopies and high rise urban areas. It has a number of cameras on board capturing lane information, street signs, turn restrictions and points of interest to enhance and keep up to date GeoSmart's car navigation and web mapping products. It is also taking a 360 degree panoramic image every 50 metres. In order to support truck navigation as well as multi mode navigation it is collecting information on the incline and camber of each corner, a feature which is used for truck safety warnings in fleet management systems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{construct}} new 1 / 2 supersymmetric {{solutions in}} D = 3, N = 2, matter coupled, U(1) gauged supergravities and study {{some of their}} properties. We do this by employing a quite general supersymmetry breaking condition, from which we also <b>redrive</b> some of the already known solutions. Among the new solutions, we have an explicit non-topological soliton for the non-compact sigma model, a locally flat solution for the compact sigma model and a string-like solution for both types of sigma models. The last one is smooth for the compact scalar manifold...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe Tau {{protein is}} the major {{component}} of intracellular filaments observed {{in a number of}} neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. The pathological mutant of Tau containing a proline-to-leucine mutation at position 301 (P 301 L) leads to severe human tauopathy. Here, we assess the impact of FK 506 -binding protein with a molecular mass of ∼ 52 kDa (FKBP 52), an immunophilin protein that interacts with physiological Tau, on Tau-P 301 L activity. We identify a direct interaction of FKBP 52 with Tau-P 301 L and its phosphorylated forms and demonstrate FKBP 52 's ability to induce the formation of Tau-P 301 L oligomers. EM analysis shows that Tau-P 301 L oligomers, induced by FKBP 52, can assemble into filaments. In the transgenic zebrafish expressing the human Tau-P 301 L mutant, FKBP 52 knockdown is sufficient to <b>redrive</b> defective axonal outgrowth and branching related to Tau-P 301 L expression in spinal primary motoneurons. This result correlates with a significant reduction of pT 181 pathological phosphorylated Tau and with recovery of the stereotypic escape response behavior. Collectively, FKBP 52 appears to be an endogenous candidate that directly interacts with the pathogenic Tau-P 301 L and modulates its function in vitro and in vivo...|$|E
40|$|In the Seel-Strack contest (Seel and Strack [2013]), n agents each privately observe an {{independent}} {{copy of a}} drifting Brownian motion which starts above zero. Each agent chooses when to stop the process she observes, and {{the winner of the}} contest is the agent who stops her Brownian motion at the highest value amongst the set of agents. The objective of each agent is to maximise her probability of winning the contest. We will give a new derivation of the results of Seel and Strack [2013] based on a Lagrangian approach. This approach facilitates our analysis of the variants of the Seel-Strack problem. We will consider a generalisation of the Seel-Strack contest in which the observed processes are independent copies of some time-homogeneous diffusion. We will use a change of scale to reduce this contest to a contest in which the observed processes are diffusions in natural scale. It turns out that, unlike in the Seel-Strack problem, the way of breaking ties becomes important. Moreover, we will discuss an extension of the Seel-Strack contest to one in which an agent is penalised when her strategy is suboptimal, in the sense that her chosen strategy does not win the contest, but there existed an alternative strategy which would have resulted in victory. We will see that different types of penalty have different effects. Seel and Strack [2013] studied the asymmetric 2 -player contest in which the observed processes start from different constants. We will <b>redrive</b> their results using the Lagrangian method and then study a general asymmetric n-player contest. We will find that some results in the 2 -player contest do not hold for the general n-player contest. In a symmetric 2 -player contest, the Seel-Strack model assumes that the observed processes start from the same positive constant. We will extend the results to the case where the starting values of the processes are independent non-negative random variables that have the same distribution...|$|E
