40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the greatest water reservoirs in the ancient Roman world and, in particular, the “Piscina Mirabilis” in Misenum, in Southern Italy. In our study, we considered the reservoirs with a volume in the order of thousands of cubic metres, storing flowing water, set low in the ground or actually underground, and roofed over. In general, a Roman aqueduct was not built to provide drinking water, nor to promote hygiene, but either to supply the baths or for military aims. As a matter of fact, the population of Rome at the end of the 1 st century AD had an average water supply of 1, 550 L /d per capita especially used for baths. This circumstance required reservoirs of huge capacity. The reservoir of the Baths of Caracalla in Rome could contain over 80, 000 m 3 of water.

40|$|Abstract—Here {{we examine}} the cause, size and future of the U. S. carbon sink. To {{estimate}} {{the size of the}} U. S. carbon sink we review a comprehensive landbased analysis of the carbon sink in the coterminous U. S. For the 1980 s, the sink is between 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 PgC y – 1, and is split approximately evenly between forest and non-forest sectors. The nonforest sink is caused by fire suppression on non-forested lands, sediment burial in <b>resevoirs,</b> alluvium and colluvium, and agriculturual practices. The forest sink has been attributed to changes in land use and the enhancement of plant growth by CO 2 fertilization, N deposition and climate change. To estimate the relative contribution of land use and growth enhancement in forest ecosystems, we use forest inventory data from five states spanning a latitudinal gradient in the eastern U. S. Land use is the dominant factor governing the rate of carbon accumulation in forests in these states, with growth enhancement contributing far less than previously reported. The estimated fraction of aboveground net ecosystem production due to growth enhancement is 2. 0 +/ – 4. 4 %, with the remainder due to land use. To forecast the future of the U. S. carbon sink, we used the Ecosystem Demography Model (ED). We first modeled carbon sources and sinks from 1700 – 1990, and then projected patterns to 2100. Our projections indicate that the land-use portion of the U. S. carbon sink will decrease in the future, with a half-life of approximately 50 years, as U.

Geological Survey Three broad geologic environmentB, or reservoirs, having appreciable amounts of U, Th, and Pb and sufficient longevity, are required by the plumbotectonics model. These <b>resevoirs,</b> the mantle, upper continental crust, and lower continental crust, and an additional short-lived mixing orogene provide the necessary chemical environments to produce gross terrestrial isotopic patterns. The transfer of matter among reservoirs is treated as proceeding through cycles called orogenies of discrete, sequential operations that can be expressed {{by a series of}} BASIC program statements (paralleling the algebraic equations of the companion paper). From the sets of numerical data generated as matrix arrays, both the total mass distribution and the U, Th, and Pb isotopic contents among reservoirs can be determined as a function of time. Two versions of the model are presented by Zartman and Doe (in press), which follow the same basic program form and differ only in certain parametric values. We list version I in its entirety in Appendix A, and supply the pertinent substitute lines for conversion to version II in Appendix B. In addition to yielding mass distribution and U, Th, and Pb isotopic contents of reservoirs, several output options are available for calculating isotopic ratios, mean age of the crust, and isotope concentrations of reservoirs. A separate subroutine is also provided, which modifies the main program, for computing the mean age of isotopes in the crust. The program was written specifically for use with the Hewlett-Packard model 9830 A minicomputer with 8 K words of memory, but with a few modifications it could be adapted to several other comparable H-P models.

40|$|A mineralogical {{study of}} the hypabyssal fades, late Cretaceous macrocrystic pulse of TK 1 {{intrusion}} and the Mesoproterozoic aphanitic pulse of TK 4 intrusion in the Wajrakarur Kimberlite Field of southern India shows that the rocks contain macrocrysts of forsteritic olivine, phenocrysts and microphenocrysts of Al-Na-poor diopside and phlogopite set in a groundmass mainly of Al-Na-poor diopside and phlogopite. Other groundmass minerals are spinel, perovskite and fluorapatite in TK 1, and spinel, titanite, chlorite, calcite and gittinsite in TK 4. K-richterite and perovskite occur only as inclusions in phlogopite and titanite, respectively in TK 4. Late-stage deuteric phases include pyrite and barite in TK 1, and strontianite, chalcopyrite, galena and pentlanditein TK 4. Diopside microphenocrysts in TK 4 exhibit oscillatory zoning with characteristics of diffusion controlled magmatic growth. TK 1 spinels show magmatic trend 2 that evolves from magnesiochromite and culminates in titaniferous magnetite, whereas TK 4 spinels are less evolved with magnesiochromite composition only. TK 1 phlogopites show a simple compositional trend that is typical of lamproite micas, while four distinct growth zones are observed in TK 4 phlogopites with the following compositional characteristics: zone I: high Cr 2 O 3 and TiO 2 and low BaO; zone II: low Cr 2 O 3; zone III: low TiO 2 and high BaO; zone IV: low BaO. Forsterite contents and trace element concentrations reveal two xenocrystic core populations and one magmatic rim population for TK 1 olivines. Mineralogically, both TK 1 and TK 4 are classified as diopside-phlogopite lamproites rather than archetypal kimberlites. The two lamproites are considered to have formed from the same parent magma but crystallised under distinct oxygen fugacity conditions. With elevated content of Fe 3 + in phlogopite, spinel and perovskite, TK 1 appears to have crystallised in a relatively high oxygen fugacity environment. Multiple growth generations of phlogopite, spinel and fluorapatite in TK 4 indicate a complex evolutionary history of the magma. Close spatial and temporal associations of Mesoproterozoic kimberlites and lamproites in southern India can possibly be explained by a unifying model which accounts for the generation of diverse magmas {{from a range of}} geochemical <b>resevoirs</b> in a continental rift setting.

Two hundred ninety four drinking water samples were collected during the time period from March to August 2014. The water samples were collected from seven desalination plants (DPs), four <b>resevoirs</b> and eight mosques distributed in South and North Qatar. The ClO₂ level was ranged from 0. 38 to less than 0. 02 mg/L, with mean value of 0. 17, 0. 12, and 0. 04 mg/L in the desalination plants (DPs), the reservoirs (R), and the mosques (M), respectively. The chlorite level was varied from 12. 78 - 436. 36 ppb with median values varied from 12. 78 to 230. 76, from 77. 43 to 325. 25, and from 84. 73 to 436. 36 ppb in the DPs, the reservoirs, and the mosques, respectively. While chlorate was varied from 10. 66 ppb to 282. 71 ppb with mean values varied from 35. 58 to 282. 72 ppb, from 11. 02 to 200. 69, and from 10. 66 to 150. 38 ppb in the DPs, R, and M respectively. However, the average value of THMs was 4. 90 ppb, while maximum value reached 76. 97. Lower disinfectant residual was observed in few samples, however this could be attributed to the normal decomposition reaction of ClO₂ with organic and inorganic compounds, including biofilms, pipe materials, corrosion products, formation of slime or may due to the fact the water in distribution system experience water aging problem. Significant differences were observed in the concentration level of chlorite, chlorate and THMs between DPs, reservoirs and the mosques. However, the concentrations of all DBPs fell wihtin the range of the regulatory limit set by GSO 149 / 2009, WHO and KAHRAMAA (KM). It is recommended to slightly increase the average ClO₂ dosage at the DPs. Such slight increase would provide safer margin at the customer point of use in case of any microbial activities. Consideration must be given to the overall demand and should account for seasonal variations, temperature, and application points. As well as a monitoring approach is recommended for the drinking water safety assessment. Re-conducting the study to include other DPs of ClO₂ is recommended...|$|R

A debris flow of Kouyamagawa suggests a prevention measure of this disaster. After the debris flow broke a bank of a bending point and flowed down a protected low-land, it flowed into a reservoir located immediately downward from the broken point. The debris flow loosed its energy by deposition of sediment in the <b>resevoir.</b> The disaster at the area located downward, therefore, was greatly reduced...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{comparisons}} between global ozone burdens {{derived from the}} backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) experiment on Nimbus 4 and those inferred from an analysis of ground-based network data seem to indicate {{significant differences in the}} inter-annual variability of ozone. Some of the observed differences may be due to improper weighting of the ground-based network data, slowly changing planetary wave structure over the fixed station, of small inter-annual changes in meridional transport parameters. There is also some evidence which indicates that the polar stratosphere at high latitudes may represent an important ozone storage <b>resevoir</b> which tends to compensate for large scale changes observed in the regions outside of the polar stratosphere. Possible consequences of this are that the global trends derived from ground based ozone measurements may not be valid and furthermore that the current satellite techniques by themselves may be sufficient. An ozone monitoring system which includes observations from satellites, ground-based stations, balloons and rockets may be necessary...|$|E
30|$|These basic {{questions}} regarding the seasonally varying influence of ENSO on Philippine climate arose during early stages of an IRI project in the region focused on improving water management practices for the Angat <b>Resevoir</b> in Luzon, which provides water for over 8 {{million people in the}} Metro Manila area. Since inflow to the reservoir can be substantially affected by the state of ENSO, better management of water within the reservoir system relied fundamentally on a better understanding how inflows to the system varied {{over the course of the}} year, particularly when an ENSO event was underway. Working with climate data provided by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and in collaboration with some of their climate scientists, a study addressing these topics was undertaken. Previous work had provided some hints that the influence of ENSO on boreal summer rainfall in the Philippines might be different from that during the boreal fall and winter (Walker & Bliss 1932; Kiladis & Diaz 1989; Kripalani & Kulkarni 1997) but additional research was needed to provide a more definitive answer.|$|E
