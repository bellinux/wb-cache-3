6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the <b>ringed</b> <b>teal,</b> with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or Coscoroba Swan, as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ringed</b> <b>teal</b> (Callonetta leucophrys) {{is a small}} duck of South American forests. It is {{the only}} species of the genus Callonetta. Usually placed with the dabbling ducks (Anatinae), this species may {{actually}} be closer to shelducks and belong in the subfamily Tadorninae; its closest relative is possibly the maned duck.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ringed</b> <b>teals</b> {{can live}} up to 15 years in captivity, however, an average life span is not known for wild individuals.|$|R
50|$|Their {{habitats}} include tropical, swampy {{forests and}} marshy clearings in well-wooded lowlands, {{as well as}} secluded pools and small streams. As a predominately aquatic species, <b>ringed</b> <b>teals</b> eat a variety of aquatic plants and invertebrates, {{as well as any}} seeds that can be found. <b>Ringed</b> <b>teals</b> are classified as “dabblers” as opposed to “divers”. Dabblers tend to feed on plant and insect material near the surface of the water, where as divers feed on plants, invertebrates, and fish deeper under the water’s surface. Although dabblers may submerge their heads and upper torso while putting their tails up in the air, also known as “up-ending”, they rarely completely submerge themselves and stay under for periods of time, such as the divers do.|$|R
50|$|The {{male and}} female remain {{colourful}} throughout the year, lacking an eclipse plumage. The drake has a rich chestnut back, pale grey flanks and a salmon-coloured breast speckled in black. A black band runs {{from the top of}} its head down to the nape. Females have an olive-brownish back with the head blotched and striated in white, with pencilled barring on a pale chest and belly. Both have a dark tail, a contrasting pale rump, and a distinctive white patch on the wing. Bills are grey and legs and feet are pink in both sexes. Pairs easily bond. Their contact calls are a cat-like mee-oowing in ducks, a lingering peewoo in drakes. Most <b>ringed</b> <b>teals</b> average 14 - 15 in long, with a 28 in wingspan. Individuals typically weigh 11 - 12 oz. <b>Ringed</b> <b>teals</b> also have webbed toes with long, pointed claws that specialize in allowing the birds to sit on tree branches. These specialized toes are unique, as most waterfowl cannot easily remain perched on tree branches.|$|R
50|$|The Australian wood duck, maned duck or maned goose (Chenonetta jubata) is a dabbling duck found {{throughout}} much of Australia. It is the only living species in the genus Chenonetta. Traditionally placed in the subfamily Anatinae (dabbling ducks), it might belong to the subfamily Tadorninae (shelducks); the <b>ringed</b> <b>teal</b> may be its closest living relative.|$|E

The aviary also houses golden pheasants, Lady Amherst's pheasants and Swinhoe's pheasants. Adjacent to the aviary is a flock of Chilean flamingos.|$|E

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses can affect many bird species, with disease symptoms ranging from severe morbidity and high mortality to mild transient illness. Much {{is known about}} infections in chickens, but for other captive birds the relations between disease symptoms, excretion patterns, and transmission, {{as well as the}} effect of vaccination on these relations are not clear. We report results from experimental transmission studies with a highly pathogenic H 7 N 7 virus and two commonly kept bird species (<b>ringed</b> <b>teals</b> and golden pheasants). The results show that depending on the host species the virus can spread in unvaccinated birds with or without disease symptoms. Vaccination reduces disease symptoms markedly, but need not always reduce virus transmission. We discuss the implications for the control of highly pathogenic avian influenza. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceWe use a {{new method}} called "product kernel estimator" {{to explore the}} spatial and {{temporal}} distribution of 9, 114 recoveries of <b>Teal</b> () <b>ringed</b> in Camargue, southern France, and recovered over the whole of Europe. This method allows exploration {{of the changes in}} time of the probability density to recover a ringed bird over a grid covering the study area. We thus identified two migration corridors for this species to the north and south of the Alps, whereas earlier analyses mostly suggested a southern route from Camargue, especially in spring. The northern route seems to be used to a greater extent in autumn than in spring, indicating a frequent abmigration (animals switching from one corridor to the other). Moreover, migration of the population seems faster in spring than in autumn. The simultaneous presence of Teal recoveries in many distinct geographical areas in spring is consistent with the idea that these ducks are not limited by their migratory speed in spring, nor do they wait until favorable environmental conditions before colonizing their breeding areas...|$|R

50|$|The <b>ringed</b> <b>teal</b> breeds in north-west Argentina and Paraguay, also {{occurring}} in Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay. Upon reaching sexual maturity, ringed teals form strong pair bonds. These pair bonds typically last a single breeding season, but {{can last for}} the lifetime of a pair. A pair bond begins with the male courting the female. In general, courting consists of large amounts of preening, flashing the iridescent green patches on the wings, and swimming in figure eights around the female of interest while vocalizing. Once a pair bond is solidified, mating occurs in the water. Nests are usually created out of hollow holes in tree cavities. The nests are lined with down and the female {{tends to be the}} defender of the nest. The male, however, will defend the female against other males and potential predators throughout their pair bond. Females typically lay 6-12 eggs that are white in colour. The eggs are incubated for an average of 29 days. Both male and female participate incubating the eggs, however, one captive study shows that the females were solely responsible for incubation. Hatched chicks are precocial. Precocial chicks are mostly developed upon hatching, have a layer of down feathers, can walk, function, and essentially feed themselves. Although, the chicks hatch with a layer of feather down, it is not waterproof. Since the chicks {{spend most of their time}} in the water, they rub on the parents, in doing so, they gain essential oils needed for waterproofing. Both the male and female play a large role in raising and defending the chicks until they fledge at 50-55 days old. The male, however, tends to be the most invested and will often be seen following behind separated or slower chicks. Until fledging, the chicks stay in a close group and learn quickly from their parents how to forage, swim efficiently, and avoid predators. Often, the bonded pair is able to produce two groups of offspring in one breeding season. The male will continue to care for the first group of chicks, while the female incubates the second group of eggs. The ringed teal’s pair bonding behaviour makes reproduction very efficient. By the end of a breeding season it is possible for a bonded pair to have laid and hatched up to 24 offspring.|$|E
40|$|Delacour and Mayr (1945) {{placed the}} {{perching}} duck tribe after the pochards (Aythyini) and {{adjacent to the}} sea ducks (Mergini), but hybridization evidence (Johnsgard, 1960 a) clearly indicates that the group belongs between the shelducks and the dabbling ducks and closely adjacent to the latter. There is other evidence to support this arrangement. The tracheae of shelducks, perching ducks, and dabbling ducks are all very similar, possessing bullae which in most species are osseous and rounded, and lacking enlargements of the tracheal tube. The downy young of perching ducks and dabbling ducks are very similar, and are usually patterned with dark brown and white or yellow. Woolfenden (1 96 1) has advocated merging the perching ducks and dabbling ducks into a single tribe (Anatini), but although the two groups do tend to overlap in some of their characteristics, I believe that merging them would result in an unduly large and heterogeneous tribe. Such action would, however, resolve {{the problem of the}} tribal allocations of such species as the Brazilian teal and <b>ringed</b> <b>teal.</b> Some species of perching ducks mature in two years, although the smaller species mature their first year. Nearly all perching ducks have metallic coloration on the upper-wing surface. With few exceptions they do not dive well or frequently, and apparently all use their wings when submerging. Most of them dabble for their food, and some also graze. Nearly all species are hole-nesters, and have relatively long incubation periods. As here constituted the tribe contains thirteen species; those included in it by Delacour (1959), plus an additional species, the <b>ringed</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas leucophrys of Delacour), which is here considered to comprise a separate genus (Callonetta) ...|$|E
40|$|Spur-winged Goose Muscovy Duck White-winged Wood Duck Comb Duck Hartlaub Duck Green Pygmy Goose Cotton Pygmy Goose African Pygmy Goose <b>Ringed</b> <b>Teal</b> North American Wood Duck Mandarin Duck Australian Wood Duck Brazilian Teal This {{group of}} 13 species of {{primarily}} perching waterfowl {{is a rather}} heterogeneous assemblage of birds that are not easily characterized. In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the comb duck, muscovy duck, and the spur-winged goose, there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite eclipse plumages, probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the <b>ringed</b> <b>teal,</b> pink-eared duck, and Brazilian teal should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{tribe of}} surface-feeding, or dabbling, ducks {{is the largest}} single tribe in the family. There are 40 species in the tribe as it is {{constituted}} here. Contrary to the arrangement of Delacour (1956), the <b>ringed</b> <b>teal</b> {{is included in the}} Cairinini; and the crested duck, included in the Tadornini by Delacour, is here considered a typical dabbling duck. In addition, the pink-headed duck has been removed from the Anatini and placed in the Aythyini with the pochards, and the freckled duck has been removed from the tribe and is considered a primitive species having anserine relationships. The marbled teal has been removed from the genus Anas and placed in a monotypic. genus which, I believe, provides an evolutionary link between the dabbling ducks and the pochards. The Anatini are world-wide in distribution and include the most numerous and widespread species of the family. Most species (and especially those of the shoveler group) forage on the water surface, gathering food from the surface by up-ending or 2 ̆ 2 tipping-up, 2 ̆ 2 or, more rarely, by diving. Most species open their wings when diving. A few species, such as the wigeon, graze, and nearly all species are predominantly vegetarians. Nearly all nest on the ground, but a few species nest in holes or crevices. The downy young are much like those of the perching ducks and are usually strongly marked with brown and white or with yellow. All species mature their first year, and pair bonds are generally renewed yearly. Most species exhibit sexual dimorphism in plumage, and metallic coloration is usually restricted to the head and speculum. The males of most sexually dimorphic species have a distinct eclipse plumage. Nearly all species have metallically colored wing specula. Males of all species studied to date except one have tracheal bullae which are ossified throughout; the marbled teal is the exception, and its bulla has numerous membranaceous fenestrae similar to those found in the pochard group...|$|E
