5|$|The video {{begins with}} showing Beyoncé against a green wall and Jay-Z {{sitting on a}} chair inside a dark room. Beyoncé and Jay-Z then start to {{simultaneously}} play imaginary instruments, mimicking the song's tune. Scenes of Beyoncé are then shown in several different rooms wearing different outfits.

Beyoncé is then shown wearing a green skirt and bedazzled bra while dancing around in sand. As the song progresses, she is shown dancing alone in a dark forest wearing a sparkling black dress as fireflies circle around her head. The song ends with Beyoncé leaning back in a pose as fireflies race away.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a <b>red</b> <b>dress</b> on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the <b>red</b> <b>dress,</b> holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E

5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a <b>red</b> <b>dress</b> and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé then {{sings the}} chorus again and dances in her <b>red</b> <b>dress</b> {{in front of}} the background. Mc Lyte and Free are seen at a {{backyard}} barbecue party as Mc Lyte's verse begins and she mingles with the party guests, with Elliott as the party DJ. Again, Beyoncé comes back to sing the chorus of the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in front of a large audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in the beginning and the latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting at a picnic table at the barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E

Next, Elliott is shown on roller skates in a white and black outfit rollerskating throughout the mansion. Shots are shown of Elliott {{in bed with a}} man and Beyoncé at a party with a guy and singing to the people there. As the song moves to Beyoncé singing the chorus, she is shown sitting on a bed and dancing in a room in a golden top and black shorts, while back at the party, she is singing for her lover and blowing him kisses. The song then moves to a verse by Mc Lyte and we see her dancing {{in the middle of a}} semi-circle of men wearing orange prison jumpsuits. Scenes of the movie and of Mc Lyte in front of an ever-changing background are intercut throughout this.|$|E

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} <b>red</b> <b>dress</b> in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a <b>red</b> <b>dress.</b> In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{little girl}} is {{described}} as having long curly golden hair, blue eyes, and pink chubby cheeks with a prominent dimple in each.

50|$|The {{building}} is constructed in timber framing with fillings of red brick and white windows. It {{consists of two}} storeys under a steep half-hip roof.

25|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was celebrated {{with all due}} tradition in Esma Sultan Palace {{in the presence of}} Sultan's ministers in 1844.

He took her by the arm and escorted her into the Sovereign's Hall in the palace harem, having her take a seat in the nook that had been prepared for the bride. Mahmud II's daughters and wives came in and joined in the ceremony, as did the wives of important personages.|$|E
25|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{perspective}} in the fiction at times {{can be much}} less successful in a European market. Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint <b>Red</b> <b>Dress</b> Ink, in that country romance readers do not care to read books about cowboys, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular {{in countries such as}} Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful. Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular. German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels, and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories. The alternate scenario also occurs, as other German translators censor the love scenes.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Léonce got {{the call}} for a six-month tour which enabled him to travel {{throughout}} Europe and to Russia.
