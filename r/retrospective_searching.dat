40|$|A review of: Line, Maurice B. "The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists: An Overview of INFROSS. " Aslib Proceedings 23. 8 (1971) : 412 - 34. Rpt. in Lines of Thought: Selected Papers. Ed. L. J. Anthony. London: Bingley, 1988. 45 - 66. Objective - The study {{reported}} in this article was conceived in order {{to answer a question}} of very large scope: What are the information systems and services requirements of social scientists? Inherent in this question was the correlative question: How do social scientists tend to use such systems and services, and what resources and information access approaches do they by choice employ? The choice for such an approach was well-considered, given that 1) there were at the time almost no research results available in this area; 2) the investigators feared that approaches developed earlier for the natural sciences and technology would be uncritically adopted for the social sciences as well; and 3) "the social science information system was developing anyway, and if it was to develop in appropriate ways, some guidance had to be provided quickly" (412). The Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social Sciences (INFROSS) project team believed that there was "no point" (412) in embarking first on a series of more narrowly focused studies. The express intention was to derive findings that would be usable "for the improvement of information systems, or for the design of new ones" (414). For more on the project's conceptual underpinnings, see Line’s "Information Requirements. " Design - Exploratory study employing both quantitative and qualitative approaches over a period of three and a half years, beginning in the autumn of 1967. Setting - The whole of the United Kingdom. The project was funded by that country’s Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), which had been established in 1965. Subjects - Almost 1, 100 randomly selected academic social science researchers, plus a substantial number of government social science researchers and social science "practitioners" ("college of education lecturers, schoolteachers, and individuals in social work and welfare" [413]). For the purposes of the study, the social sciences included anthropology, economics, education, geography, political science, psychology and sociology, but numerous historians and statisticians ultimately participated. Methods - Three methods were employed: surveys, interviews, and direct observation. A "very long" (413) questionnaire was sent to 2, 602 of the identified ca. 9, 100 social science researchers in the United Kingdom, with 1, 089 (41. 8 %) completed questionnaires returned. Two pilots were conducted with the questionnaire before a definitive version was finalized for the study. Seventy-five interviews were conducted (individually or in groups) with researchers, some of whom had received but not responded to the questionnaire, and some of whom {{were not included in the}} questionnaire sample. The interviews with non-responding persons in the sample were for purposes of determining "whether they were non-typical" (413). Fifty additional interviews were conducted (individually or in groups) with practitioners. Day-to-day observation of a small number of social scientists was undertaken in the context of a two and a half year-long experimental information service at Bath University - the first time any UK university had employed information officers for the social sciences. Main results - The results showed a pronounced perception among social scientists that informal "methods of locating references to relevant published information" (416 - 8, 426 - 7, 431) are more useful than formal methods (such as consulting the library catalogue, searching library shelves, or searching in indexing and abstracting publications), and an even more pronounced inclination to actually use such informal methods - something of a revelation at the time. Less than one sixth of all sociologists, for example, made use of Sociological Abstracts. On both counts, "consulting librarian" (418) scored worse than all the other ten options. Forty-eight percent of respondents never did it, and only 8 % perceived it as a "very useful" (418) method. Nonetheless, 88 % of respondents were in principle prepared to delegate at least some of their literature searching, and approximately 45 % all of it, "to a hypothetical information officer" (425). More than 75 % of the experimental service clients also responded affirmatively to the question: "Should a social science information officer be a high priority," given limited available resources? (Line, Cunningham, and Evans 73 - 5). Most subjects found, in any case, that their major "information problems" (427 - 8) lay not in discovering what relevant documents might exist, but rather in actually getting their hands on them. In only around 20 % of the cases were they ultimately successful in doing so. The younger the researcher, the greater the dissatisfaction with her/his own institution’s collection. This study also revealed that academic social scientists drew little distinction between information needs for their research and those for their teaching. There was one social science discipline which clearly stood out from the rest: psychology. Psychologists were the heaviest users of abstracting and indexing (A&I) publications, as well as of the journal literature, published conference proceedings, and research reports. They were also the least tolerant of time lags in the A&I services’ coverage of new publications. Further significant findings were: • A librarian’s way of categorizing research materials was not very meaningful to the researchers themselves. • A&I services were generally used more often for ‘keeping up’ than for <b>retrospective</b> <b>searching.</b> • Consultation with librarians was more common in the less scholarly and more intimate college environment than at research institutions. • A large percentage found library cataloguing insufficiently detailed. The same was true for book indexes. • There was considerable enthusiasm for the idea of a citation index for the social sciences. (N. B. : the SSCI began publication two years after the appearance of this article.) • Among informal methods of scholarly communication and information transfer, conferences (to the investigators’ surprise) rated remarkably low. • Researchers with large personal collections made more use of the library and its services than those with small collections. • Social scientists had little interest in non-English-language materials. Line speaks of "a serious foreign language problem" (424). The INFROSS study produced an enormous amount of data. Only 384 of the computer tables produced were made available in 4 separate reports to OSTI. Only 3 tables, 2 of which were abbreviated, appeared in this article. The further raw data were available on request. Conclusion - Line himself was exceedingly cautious in drawing explicit positive conclusions from the INFROSS results. He even stated that, "No major patterns were detected which could be of use for information system design purposes" (430). He was freer with his negative and provisional assessments. Two years earlier he had written: "It still remains to be established that there is an information problem in the social sciences, or that, if there is, it is of any magnitude" ("Information Requirements" 3). However, it was now clear to Line that information services and systems for the social scientist were indeed quite inadequate, and that (potential) users were not satisfied. He was, furthermore, prepared to go out on a limb with the following assertions and inferences: 1) It was a great strength of INFROSS that it had - in marked contrast to previous science user studies - generated "a mass of comparable [his italics] data within a very broad field, so that every finding can be related to other findings" (430). 2) There are discernable - and exploitable - differences in the information needs and use patterns among the different social science disciplines (which he often also refers to as the different "subjects"). 3) INFROSS had likewise made more evident the nature of similarities across disciplines. 4) There is indeed, from an information/library perspective, a continuum from the ‘harder’ to the ‘softer’ social sciences. 5) Social scientists showed too little awareness, made too little use, and even displayed "insufficient motivation" (431) to make use of available information systems/services. He elsewhere ("Secondary Services" 269, 272) characterizes them as "remarkably complacent," "even apathetic. " 6) There is good reason to doubt the wisdom of libraries’ investing in user education, since it is bound to have little effect (for further discussion of this matter, one can consult his "The Case for" 385 - 6 and "Ignoring the User" 86). 7) User-friendly systems amount inevitably to underdeveloped and ineffective systems - and therefore "personal intermediaries," in sufficient numbers, will remain essential if we wish to offer social scientists really good information services (426, 431). Line believed that INFROSS was only a beginning, and he had already, even before writing this article, begun follow-up research aimed at attaining results really of use for information system design purposes (e. g., the DISISS project). He complained many years later, however, that all this research "indicated means of improvement, but led to no action" ("Social Science Information" 131). In any case, "Bath" (the common shorthand subsequently used to refer to all this research) became, and has remained, the starting point for all subsequent discussions of social science information problems. Several years ago, there was a well-argued international call for "a new and updated version of the INFROSS study" - with an eye to finally using the findings for practical purposes, and aiming "to extend and follow up the research agenda set by the original study" (Janes "Time to Take") ...|$|E

One author (ÞÞ) reviewed all pathological material. Strong inclusion criteria were proposed and of the 50 cases discovered, only 26 fulfilled these strict criteria, 16 women and 10 men. Five were {{under the age of}} 40 (19...|$|R
30|$|A <b>retrospective</b> <b>search</b> of {{the entire}} digital archive of {{patients}} undergoing lumbar spine MRI was conducted, after obtaining informed consent, from January 2006 to December 2010 in our institution. The study was reviewed {{and approved by the}} institution’s ethical committee. Patients with known history of malignancy with or without spine involvement and patients with repeated lumbar spine MR examinations over the 2006 – 2010 period were excluded. Both conditions would have generated a bias on estimates of the prevalence of the extra-spinal MRI findings. Out {{of the entire}} archive, 10, 254 lumbar spine MR examinations were considered eligible for the study. By means of random sampling, obtained by using the Research Randomizer tool ([URL] we included 3, 000 lumbar spine MRI examinations in the study.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Congenital rubella {{syndrome}} (CRS) is a {{major cause}} of severe birth defects worldwide. A national CRS surveillance system was established in Oman to assess the scope of the CRS problem and to detect early manifestations of CRS for planning and early intervention. Methods: Oman implemented a CRS surveillance system in 2004 that was integrated with measles and rubella case-based surveillance. National surveillance occurs through active and passive reporting from all health institutions. Surveillance guidelines were adopted, including case definitions, an algorithm, standard laboratory methods, system operations, and feedback. A systematic <b>retrospective</b> <b>search</b> was conducted to find and describe CRS cases prior to 2004. Results: The CRS surveillance system operates in all health facilities and has been integrated with the communicable diseases surveillance system. A total of 104 suspected CRS cases were reported from 1980 - 2015. Of those, 101 (97 %) were detected through <b>retrospective</b> <b>search</b> (1980 - 2003) and 3 (3 %) through prospective passive surveillance (2004 - 2015). Of the suspected cases, 61 (59 %) were clinically confirmed, 23 (22 %) were laboratory confirmed and 1 (1 %) was classified as congenital rubella infection. Of 85 confirmed cases, 46 (54 %) were located and consented to direct clinical evaluation. In 2015, the median age of this group was 17. 9 years (range 8 - 33 years). Of these patients, 29 (63 %) had ocular, 27 (59 %) had auditory, 25 (54 %) had neurologic, and 18 (39 %) had cardiovascular manifestations of CRS; 11 (24 %) had low birth weight (≤ 2. 5 Kg) and 3 (6 %) had hepatosplenomegaly. Conclusions: Establishment of a CRS surveillance system that conducts both active and passive surveillance was important to detect and describe CRS. Early clinical manifestations of CRS in Oman included ocular, auditory, neurologic, and cardiovascular abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A virtual {{screening}} method is presented that is grounded on a receptor-derived pharmacophore model termed “virtual ligand ” or “pseudo-ligand”. The model represents an idealized constellation of potential ligand sites that interact with residues of the binding pocket. For rapid virtual screening of compound libraries the potential pharmacophore {{points of the}} virtual ligand are encoded as an alignment-free correlation vector, avoiding spatial alignment of pharmacophore features between the pharmacophore query (i. e., the virtual ligand) and the candidate molecule. The method was successfully applied to retrieving factor Xa inhibitors from a Ugi three-component combinatorial library, and yielded high enrichment of actives in a <b>retrospective</b> <b>search</b> for cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitors. The approach provides a concept for “de-orphanizing ” potential drug targets and identifying ligands for hitherto unexplored or allosteric binding pockets...|$|R
40|$|Swift/BAT, {{owing to}} its good sensitivity, huge {{field of view}} as well as almost uniform {{coverage}} of the sky along the mission, is a very useful tool for hard X/gamma-ray astronomy. Thanks to its characteristics, BAT can be exploited to monitor known, bright X-ray sources with a very good temporal coverage, {{as well as to}} serendipitously catch and study interesting transient sources. Moreover, thanks to the huge amount of data collected since the Swift launch, it is also possible to perform <b>retrospective</b> <b>searches</b> in the BAT data archive. No procedures for analysing BAT data had been made available to date. In this paper, a concise description of new data analysis procedures aimed at exploiting BAT data is given, together with first astrophysical results on Galactic X-ray binaries and novae. ...|$|R

30|$|Utilizing a <b>retrospective</b> <b>search</b> of {{our health}} {{information}} system, patients were included if they met both of the following inclusion criteria: a. diagnosed with Stage 3 B NSCLC {{in accordance with the}} 8 th edition of the TNM classification system; and b. received baseline staging PET/CT between February 2004 and Dec 2014. Patients were excluded if they either: 1. received prior lung cancer treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery; or 2. had a second primary cancer diagnosed from 5  years before to 2  months after the FDG PET/CT scan conducted for NSCLC diagnosis and staging. 110 consecutive patients were identified from center A and served as the training set. The external validation set included 44 patients managed and imaged at institution B from 2008 to 2014. These patients received a FDG PET/CT within 3  months of starting radiation therapy.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the frequency and}} distribution of ophthalmic articles with Turkish origin on Pubmed search engine and to compare these data {{with those of the}} world’s leading countries in that field. Materials and Methods: Using the words “ophthalmology” and “Turkey”, an online <b>retrospective</b> <b>search</b> was conducted on Pubmed for the period from 1990 to 2013. Additionally, same search was performed for each ophthalmic journal indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) (n= 56) and not indexed in SCI-E (n= 8), separately. The articles were divided into two groups (research articles and the other articles as case reports, letters, correspondence, editorials and reviews). Results: A total of 5044 articles in the area of ophthalmology were from Turkey in that period. The United States of America, Japan, and Germany had the maximum number of published articles (25...|$|R
