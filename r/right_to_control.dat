5|$|Although Salinger {{tried to}} escape public {{exposure}} as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both {{the media and the}} public. Readers of his work and students from nearby Dartmouth College often came to Cornish in groups, hoping {{to catch a glimpse of}} him. In May 1986 Salinger learned that the British writer Ian Hamilton intended to publish a biography that made extensive use of letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends. Salinger sued to stop the book's publication. The court in Salinger v. Random House ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters, including quotation and paraphrasing, was not acceptable since the author's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> publication overrode the right of fair use.|$|E
5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the copying of the book. Penalties for infringing this right were severe, with all infringing copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the copyright holder and the government; there was only a three-month statute of limitations on bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and when that ran out, the works would enter the public domain. Copyright under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm had {{the right}} to vote on civil, {{administrative}} and legal issues; a simple majority was required to pass laws. With permission from the king, it could vote on matters related to the fiscal system and the military. It had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> government officials, and could prepare reviews and reports on them to present to the king. It had legislative competences in court and administrative law. It could issue laws on currency, taxation and budget, deal with issues related to military conscription (such as its size), and amend the constitution. It had no legislative initiative, as that belong only to the king; however, the Sejm could issue petitions to the monarch with proposed legislation.|$|E

5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the story}} is {{presented}} as a melodrama—the villainous slave-dealer even twirls his mustache—it conveys the injustices of the Code noir and realities of how slavery disrupted family life. European legal and ethical traditions allowed Africans to be deprived of legal personhood and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their own bodies; within this system, the Maroons who reclaimed their freedom became outlaws.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} notion of {{ownership}} in economics, taking our point of departure in the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach. We criticize the exclusive identification of ownership with residual <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> in this approach, and argue that economic organization may be rendered determinate under complete contracting (contrary to the GHM approach). Crucially, we argue that under complete contracting, some control rights may be appropriable because of measurement and enforcement costs. This holds {{the key to a}} theory of ownership that is not dependent on {{the notion of}} residual <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>control,</b> but rather relies on appropriable control rights. However, the two perspectives may be complementary rather than rival. Ownership, property rights, complete and incomplete contracts...|$|R

25|$|Welles's second {{film for}} RKO was The Magnificent Ambersons, adapted by Welles from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Booth Tarkington.

25|$|In 1839 the Daoguang Emperor, rejecting {{proposals}} to legalise and tax opium, appointed viceroy Lin Zexu {{to solve the}} problem by banning the opium trade. Lin confiscated around 20,000 chests of opium (approximately 1210tons or 2.66millionpounds) without offering compensation and ordered a blockade of foreign trade in Canton. The British government, although not officially denying China's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> imports of the drug, objected to this unexpected seizure and dispatched a military force to China. In the ensuing conflict the Royal Navy used its naval and gunnery power to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire, a tactic later referred to as gunboat diplomacy.|$|E
25|$|At independence, the {{government}} of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny acknowledged existing decrees affecting {{the status of women}} and went on to establish the primacy of the nuclear family, raise the minimum age for marriage to eighteen, and condemn in general terms the notion of female inferiority. At the same time, however, legislation during the 1960s established a husband's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> much of his wife's property, and it required a woman to obtain her husband's permission to establish a bank account or obtain a job. The government also placed restrictions on a woman's right to divorce, denied legal recognition of matrilineal rights of inheritance (inheritance by a man's nephews before his sons), and finally, condemned the practice of bride-price.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive rights {{represents}} a broad concept, that may include {{some or all}} of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> one's reproductive functions, the right to access quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence. Reproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections. Reproductive rights are often defined to include freedom from female genital mutilation (FGM), and forced abortion and forced sterilization. The Istanbul Convention recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.|$|E

Furthermore, Canada aligned her ton with US measures by cataloguing the ton of 2000lb as being legal for trade, but kept the imperial gallon.|$|E
25|$|Natural Rights/Justice Argument: this {{argument}} is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and/or products which is produced by his/her body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind, {{it is possible to}} apply his argument to intellectual property rights, in which it would be unjust for people to misuse another's ideas. Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> that which they create. They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.|$|E
25|$|Hong Kong's {{manufacturing}} industry faced many challenges {{during the early}} 1930s. After China regained the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> its tariffs in 1928, the tax imposed on Hong Kong goods rose tremendously, but the Chinese government rejected pleas from Hong Kong industrialists to lower tariffs. The United Kingdom's abolishment of the gold standard destabilised exchange rates. Japan's dumping policy also hit Hong Kong, which did not impose tariffs on exports. The consumption power of Mainland China decreased. The Great Depression further damaged the city's manufacturing sector {{and led to the}} liquidation of over 300 factories. However, a series of favourable events led to another surge in the manufacturing sector in 1935, including a decline in Japanese and Italian goods, the stabilisation of exchange rates, an expansion in Mainland markets, {{and the rise of the}} Malay Archipelago.|$|E
