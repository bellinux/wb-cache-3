Mario, hero of the Super Mario series of games, has Princess Peach to rescue from the main villain. Link and Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda series made gamers wonder why the two were not romantically together while <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> couple. Double Dragon features the protagonist Billy Lee, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend (Maria) from his evil twin brother (Jimmy), leader of a sinister street gang.

Although George idolized Lakers star Kobe Bryant, he grew up <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Clippers. George spent most of his free time playing basketball at the park or one-on-one against his older sister Teiosha. He did not play organized basketball until his freshman year at Knight High School. He played for the varsity basketball team his last three years of high school under head coach Tom Hegre. George played for Pump and Run of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) with future UCLA Bruins Jrue Holiday and Malcolm Lee.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the teams}} were from New York City and Boston, which are {{approximately}} {{three and a}} half hours apart by car, the Super Bowl echoed the fierce rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball, games of which are often televised by Fox.

Many old-time New Englanders, in fact, grew up <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Giants before Boston got its AFL franchise in 1960, and are more accustomed to rooting against the Jets. Giants fans, however, discussed their great hatred for the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. Many Giants fans also wore hats and shirts of the New York Mets and the New York Rangers as part of discussing their hatred for the Eagles.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{was born}} in Marion, Ohio, Huff grew up in Mineral Wells, Texas. When he was six years old, his father, Aubrey II, was killed as an {{innocent}} bystander in a domestic dispute while working as an electrician. That left Huff's mother Fonda in charge of raising him and his sister Angela. Growing up, Huff regularly practiced baseball in his yard, which had a batting cage with lights and a pitching machine.

[...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outcome that he got.

However, some Yankees fans <b>root</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jets (both teams have intense rivalries with Boston, as the fierce Yankees–Red Sox rivalry {{has led to}} the rivalry between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots and the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics), while some Mets fans <b>root</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Giants as part of their hatred for their counterparts in Philadelphia (Phillies and Eagles), as well as the rivalry between the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League. In fact, the differing allegiances between Met and Yankee fans and their respective football team could be best seen in the Jets 30 point 4th quarter comeback over the Dolphins, which took place during the 2000 World Series.

500|$|Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe {{said that}} [...] "Bally's in Las Vegas set the Red Sox as 8–5 {{favorites}} {{to win the}} Series" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "some sentiment in St. Louis that the NL champions have been disrespected."

If we get three wins and 26 outs into the fourth win, I'm pretty sure it will hit us." [...] Before the series began, Shaughnessy wrote a piece saying that although the Red Sox had beaten the Yankees, the series needed to be won, as {{it was the only way}} the Curse of the Bambino, which he had publicized based on the book of the same title in 1990, would end, and demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] would no longer echo at Yankee Stadium. During the series, he wrote a piece about how much people in New England were thinking about loved ones who had spent their entire lives <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Red Sox, hoping that one day, they would see their Red Sox win a World Series.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E
500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, {{and a lot of}} action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|E

In regard to the finale, itself, Gandert noted that it was [...] "pretty good, but not outstanding, which is a fitting way to conclude a season that never quite hit its stride but was still consistently entertaining."

[...] Alexandra Martell of New York magazine said that Avery's pregnancy was [...] "going to drive much of next season, but if that means more Elizabeth Banks, we're cool." [...] Martell wrote that Kenneth getting fired was a [...] "nice twist", but that [...] "the highlight" [...] of [...] "I Do Do" [...] was Jenna discovering Paul dressing up as Cher.
