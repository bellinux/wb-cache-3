40|$|The {{infrared}} (IR) stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) {{signals from}} K-feldspar can, for convenience, {{be divided into}} two components, bleachable and ‘non-bleachable’, where the latter corresponds to the ‘residual’ signal observed in sunlight-bleached samples. In this paper, we examine the non-bleachable component of IRSL of K-feldspar for several sedimentary samples from across Eurasia. We observed a large variability in the residual doses among these samples after prolonged exposure to sunlight. By employing multiple elevated temperature (MET) IR stimulations at 50 – 300 °C, we show that the <b>residual</b> <b>dose</b> increases systematically with stimulation temperature, attaining values as high as ∼ 50 Gy at 300 °C, even after several hours to tens of hours of exposure to unfiltered sunlight. We examined two samples in detail and found that the bleachable and non-bleachable components produced different dose response curves. Pulse annealing studies showed that the non-bleachable component is more stable than the bleachable component, suggesting that a preheat procedure cannot eliminate the non-bleachable component. Additional experiments revealed that the non-bleachable component is dose dependent. Owing to this dose dependency, we demonstrate mathematically and empirically that the simple subtraction of a <b>residual</b> <b>dose</b> from the measured equivalent dose (De) – which is the most common approach employed (if any <b>residual</b> <b>dose</b> is subtracted at all) – will result in underestimation of the actual De.

It utilizes the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal measured by progressively increasing the stimulation temperature from 50 to 250 °C in step of 50 °C, so-called multi-elevated-temperature post-IR IRSL (MET-pIRIR) measurements.

Using this method, the <b>residual</b> <b>doses</b> of the MET-pIRIR signals are generally less than 1 Gy.

This is followed by two steps of IR stimulation at high temperatures (140 and 170 °C) for equivalent dose (De) measurement. Dating results consistent with the expected ages have been obtained at stimulation temperatures of 140 and 170 °C.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{dilemmas}} in feldspar luminescence dating is that the infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals are either stable and difficult to bleach when measured at elevated temperatures, or unstable and easy to bleach when measured at low temperatures. To identify a signal for sediment dating that is both stable and easy to bleach, we investigate the potential of an optically and thermally transferred IRSL (T-IRSL) signal. Based on the mechanisms described in Wang et al. (2014), we develop a T-IRSL single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) measurement protocol. We investigate the a-thermal stability of six different T-IRSL signals from a sample of infinite age using fading experiments, and by comparing field and laboratory saturation levels. The T-IRSL signal measured at 125 °C (T-IRSL 125) following a preheat of 280 °C, {{is found to be}} as stable as the post-IR IRSL 290 °C signal (pIRIR 290). Furthermore, laboratory bleaching experiments show that the T-IRSL 125 signal bleaches faster than the pIRIR 290 signal, and that the corresponding <b>residual</b> <b>doses</b> are more than 40 % lower. This indicates that T-IRSL signals may be superior to pIRIR methods for dating young and/or insufficiently bleached deposits.

The species studied was Aphidius ervi, a relatively generalist parasitoid of aphids, and commercialised for biological control and integrated pest management. Active ingredients with similar and different modes of action on the nervous system were compared: a pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin), an organophosphate (chlorpyrifos), a carbamate (pirimicarb) and a carbamyltriazole (triazamate). Adult females were exposed to dry residues on glass for 24 h. LD 50 were calculated and predicted a high risk of mortality at the field application rate. The effect of five increasing <b>residual</b> <b>doses</b> of each active ingredient was tested on responses to plant-host odour in the olfactometer, from sublethal doses to LD 50, and up to LD 70 for some products. It appeared that none of the doses of lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyriphos and pirimicarb had any effect on A. ervi responses to the odour from the aphid-infested plant (Myzus persicae on oilseed rape). But for triazamate, a significant dose-behavioural response was quantified and attraction to the odour was no longer significant in females surviving the LD 50. The possible explanations for {{the presence or absence of}} effect, depending on the insecticide are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Deltas where {{luminescence}} dating is {{most essential}} due to organic-poor geologic records are also those {{where it is}} often most challenging due to unsuitable luminescence properties of quartz grains, associated with rapid production of young clastic sediment. One example is the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta (GBMD), where Himalaya uplift drives erosion, production, and delivery to the delta plain of poorly sensitized quartz sand. Luminescence dating of fluvial deposits may be further complicated by partial bleaching prior to deposition. Here, we use GBMD quartz and polymineral sediment, including sand and silt fractions, with constrained depositional ages between {{a few years and}} a few centuries to test novel approaches to luminescence dating of fluvial deposits in an otherwise challenging setting. This produces the first delta-wide assessment of GBMD sediment luminescence dateability. We use a new multiple-signal SAR (MS-SAR) bleaching index (BI) to explore zeroing of the luminescence signals of sediment prior to deposition and to quantify the IR, pIRIR, and TL <b>residual</b> <b>doses</b> of GBMD polymineral silt with well-reset BSL signals. This test establishes BI values {{that can be used to}} identify sufficient bleaching of Holocene sediment with unknown depositional ages, thereby improving confidence in quartz silt dating. We find that GBMD quartz sand is unsuitable for luminescence dating in most localities. By contrast, GBMD silt is sufficiently bleached and has universally suitable luminescence characteristics, enabling dating of GBMD deposits up to the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings in the GBMD establish methodology for obtaining and validating luminescence ages for fluvial deposits in challenging settings with unsuitable quartz sand. </p...|$|R
