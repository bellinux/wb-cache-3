40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{documents}} {{an exploratory}} development effort {{to produce a}} 6 -inch diameter, lightweight, high strength, collapsible, layflat hose using aramid yarn as the hose reinforcing material. The design goals were to produce a hose with a 100, 000 -pound tensile strength and 1, 800 -psi burst pressure. The project had three phases: (1) a feasibility study, (2) manufacturing trials with 4 -inch hose, and (3) the design and fabrication of 6 -inch hose on the production line. The work failed to produce the desired hose primarily because of strength losses incurred in the aramid during the manufacturing pro-cess. However, the project did produce a relatively high performance polyester <b>reinforced</b> <b>hose</b> (47, 000 -pound tensile strength) that may have applications for fuel transfer. D T I...|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} {{was prepared}} {{in an effort}} to assist utility companies, electrical contractors, manufacturers of aerial bucket trucks and hydraulic impact tools, insurers of these companies, electrical lineman, and maintenance personnel in avoiding the hazards of using metal <b>reinforced</b> <b>hoses</b> on aerial bucket trucks near energized power lines. The case of a 37 year old electrical lineman who died when he jumped from a burning aerial bucket and fell 35 feet to the ground was reviewed. At the time of the accident the lineman was sagging the center phase of a three phase, 12, 400 volt energized power line. A metal <b>reinforced,</b> rubber hydraulic <b>hose</b> was attached to an impact wrench the lineman was using. The hose simultaneously contacted two phases of the line, and the heat generated caused the hose to melt and rupture. The hydraulic fluid from the ruptured hose ignited on contact with the power line and the bucket became engulfed in flames. He attempted to jump to safety, but caught his foot {{on the side of the}} bucket and fell on his head and chest. NIOSH recommends that employers remove any metal <b>reinforced</b> <b>hoses</b> currently installed on any part of the boom, aerial bucket or hydraulic attachments of aerial bucket trucks used to work near energized power lines.

5000|$|... 3D braided fabrics {{have found}} {{applications}} in areas including medicine, aerospace, automobiles, train components, and <b>reinforced</b> <b>hoses.</b> The initial development of 3D braided fabrics {{came from the}} composite and medical industries. 3D braided fabrics can be manufactured in myriad varieties of cross-sections, and their near-net complex shapes {{made it possible to}} design very specialized products for both industries.In helicopters, typical structural components like beams, sandwich structures, frames, and panels are manufactured using 3D braided profiles. Similarly, 3D fabrics are used to manufacture complex beam structures and floor panels in passenger cars. For train structures, different components manufactured from 3D braided profiles include the roof panel, interior components, side panels, and body structures.|$|R
40|$|Silicone Rubber is a {{specialty}} synthetic elastomer {{that provides a}} unique balance of chemical and mechanical properties required by many of today's more demanding industrial applications. ns. Because of its relative purity and chemical makeup, silicone rubber displays exceptional biocompatibility which makes it suitable for many health care and pharmaceutical applications. However, Braiding {{is probably the most}} common and traditional method of <b>reinforcing</b> <b>hose.</b> Braiding machines were available in France and Germany as early as the middle of the l 9 th century for braiding textiles used for rope and clothing products. Compared to many organic elastomers, silicone rubber offers superior ease of fabrication resulting in high productivity and cost effectiveness for extended service reliability. Here, We are going to combine properties of silicone with braiding technology to make a well suited hose to industrial applications. Keywords...|$|R

According to the {{features}} of reinforced layer of steel wire wound <b>reinforced</b> high-pressure <b>hose</b> (hereinafter referred to as SRH), 9 classical models for predicting the engineering elastic modulus of reinforced layer of continuous filament reinforced composite material were contrastively analyzed. As a result, Chinese engineering empirical formula should be conformable for predicting the engineering elastic constants of SRH reinforced layer in material normal coordinates. Based on composite microscopic theory and tensor theory, constitutive equation of SRH reinforced layer in structural cylindrical coordinates in three-dimensional case was obtained...|$|R
50|$|Air-operated pinch valves {{generally}} only {{consist of}} an extremely elasticised <b>reinforced</b> rubber <b>hose,</b> {{a type of}} housing, and two socket end covers or flanges. The rubber hoses of the air operated pinch valves are usually press-fitted and centred into the housing ends by the socket end covers or flange.Since they function without any additional actuators, all they need to close or operate is a pressurized air supply into the valve body. As soon as the air supply becomes interrupted and the volume of air exhausts, the elastic rubber hose starts to open due to {{the force of the}} process flow.|$|R

5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel <b>reinforced</b> air <b>hoses</b> {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|R
40|$|Modern 3 D CAD systems piping modules are {{powerful}} tools for modeling solids as rigid bodies but neglect their physical behavior. On the contrary, Virtual Prototyping requires the realistic representation of components especially for flexible parts. A finite element based system {{is presented to}} model flexible uniaxial components like hoses, wires and cables {{on the base of}} mounting and loading conditions. It interacts with a 3 D CAD system in order to generate geometries and assess optimal solutions, interferences and overall stress condition. The proposed system requires an adequate validation in order to be efficiently integrated in the design workflow. The first investigated aspect was material characterization. Since metallic <b>reinforced</b> elastomeric <b>hoses</b> show non linear behavior, a simplified model based on mean section characteristics was drawn from numeric models and experimental measurements. Then, some significant configurations have been physically reproduced on a test bed, acquired through a Reverse Engineering system and compared with simulation outputs of identical setups. The approach, the validation activity, results and some meaningful application examples are presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{prototyping}} (VP) {{of complex}} machines requires the realistic representation of components to perform robust analyses and simulations. In many cases, machines are an assembly of rigid and flexible components. Although modern three-dimensional CAD {{systems can be}} considered powerful tools for modelling solids or surfaces representing rigid bodies, they are not adequate to model soft material components, especially a realistic visualisation of physical behaviour. This drawback motivated the present research work. In particular, this paper describes an approach and the related knowledge-based software system (FlexSim) developed to create virtual prototypes facilitating product development in cases of flexible parts like cables, pipes and wires. The resulting VP tool integrates the CAD technology and the dedicated structural simulation methods to automatically model and validate three-dimensional functional sub-groups having flexible parts. The system application is shown on metallic <b>reinforced</b> elastomer <b>hoses</b> used for hydraulic power transmissions. For this purpose, a finite-element approach has been implemented to find hose configurations for given boundary conditions determined by mounting positions. Pipe fittings are selected and automatically assembled and the optimal hose length and its ideal spatial disposition are calculated. Simulations of behaviour allow the rapid optimisation of a solution. The system has been tested on agricultural harvest machines and mining equipment, which widely employ hydraulic transmissions for moving groups of components. As a result, the number of physical prototypes, the lead-time due to the trial-and-error activities and the product development costs can be significantly reduced...|$|R
