An average human worker can provide work good for around 0,9 hp (2.3 MJ per hour) [...] while a machine (depending on the type and size) can provide for far greater amounts of work. For example, it takes more than one and a half hour of hard labour to deliver only one kWh - which a small engine could deliver in less than one hour while burning less than one litre of petroleum fuel. This implies that a gang of 20 to 40 men will require a financial compensation for their work at least equal to the required expended food calories (which is at least 4 to 20 times higher). In most situations, the worker will also want compensation for the lost time, which is easily 96 times greater per day. Even if we assume the <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> for the human labour to be at US $1.00/day, an energy cost is generated of about $4.00/kWh. Despite this being a low wage for hard labour, even in some of the countries with the lowest wages, it represents an energy cost that is significantly more expensive than even exotic power sources such as solar photovoltaic panels (and thus even more expensive when compared to wind energy harvesters or luminescent solar concentrators).|$|E

It is asserted in many theoretical and popular writings that increased pressures of global competition would squeeze the profit margins and reduce capital returns. I discuss this proposition theoretically and then test for it using manufacturing data for a selected group of developing countries under post-liberalization. I utilize time series and panel data econometrics to study the behavior of markups (gross profit margins) against <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> trade openness, and investment share in the GDP as a proxy for capacity utilization.

Fixed private investment was found to have an inconclusive relationship with financial capital inflows. <b>Real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> were observed to carry a significant negative relationship with private investment, indicating that at a time of currency appreciation, investors had to rely on declining <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> in order to keep their export competitiveness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple New-Keynesian small open economy model allowing for labour {{to be supplied}} both domestically and abroad with a locational preference to work at home rather than abroad. From this small change in the otherwise standard setup follows an important implication for the Phillips-curve: The opening of the "labour account" reduces the output-inflation trade-off, i. e. the Phillips-curve becomes flatter. The theoretic intuition is simple: Any given boost to output is followed by increasing <b>real</b> <b>wages,</b> marginal <b>costs</b> and thereby inflation if labour is the only input to production because workers need to be compensated for a reduction in leisure. However, {{to the extent to}} which this additional labour is mobilized from a substitution away from labour formerly supplied abroad, due to an improving <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> di¤erential, there is no need for such a compensation.

30|$|The wage shock {{moves the}} economy into the neo-classical regime where the {{increase}} of <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> {{is the source of}} a depressed labor market. Labor supply is clearly rationed by the lack of demand. This also depresses the goods market where supply declines and rations the increased demand. Interest rates rise because of inflation and the fiscal balance deteriorates somewhat because of the fall in output. Over time, the economy moves essentially between the neo-classical and Keynesian regime. Clearly, the positive wage shock in this setting is not an efficient instrument to stimulate the economy. In fact a form of stagflation is produced in the short run: higher unemployment and inflation result, compared to the initial equilibrium.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{analysis of the}} performance of the Polish state-owned enterprise sector in 1990, with particular attention to wages, output, profitability, and the contribution of enterprise taxation to the state budget. A new piece of empirical evidence presented in the paper is an index of industrial production by the state-owned sector calculated by the author using data on physical output of principal products. The main points of the paper are: (1) Polish state-owned enterprises are "worker-managed firms". This helps explain some of the peculiar features of enterprise sector performance in 1990 : high profits and the absence of bankruptcies despite a huge drop in output; a very large drop in <b>real</b> <b>wages</b> January 1990 followed by a steady increase and the consequent failure of the Government''s tax-based incomes policy to be binding constraint until late in 1990; and the slow rate of labour shedding. (2) The author''s industrial production index shows a drop in state sector output in 1990 of about 21 %, not much less than the 25 % drop in the official industrial sales index. Gershenkron-type biases are apparently small. (3) The use of monopoly power by these worker-managed firms may possibly account for some, but not most, of the decrease in output. (4) Wage movements explain much of the movement in enterprise profitability in 1989 - 90. In particular, about 2 / 3 of the drop in profitability over January-December 1990 can be accounted for by an increase in <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> and about 1 / 3 to an increase in the real exchange rate. Other factors were also at work, however. (5) The most important consequences of the rises in the <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> and <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> were, first, the shift of tax revenue from profit taxes to wage taxes, and, second, the spending of most of the additional wage tax revenues on higher real pension payments because pensions are indexed to the wage. It is estimated in the paper {{that by the end of}} the period January-December 1990 this process had added something like 7 % to the monthly central budget deficit. This shift in the division of enterprise surpluses from profits to wages thus contributed substantially to the emergence of the current budgetary problems...|$|R

Using various panel data procedures over twenty-nine subsectors of Turkish manufacturing for the 1980 - 1996 period, we focus on three sets of issues: (1) the effect of openness {{on the extent of}} market concentration as measured in CR 4 ratios; (2) the behavior of gross profit margins (markups) in relation to openness, concentration ratios, and <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> costs; and (3) the behavior of sectoral real investments (by destination) in relation to the profit margins, <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> and the openness indicator.

The adjustment dynamics show that Spanish inflation has adjusted in the long run to the European purchasing power parity level (as measured by the German price level) corrected for the Balassa-Samuelson effect. In the medium run this long-run convergence was achieved by two types of Phillips curve mechanisms; one where the inflation/unemployment trade-off was triggered off for different levels of the interest rate and <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> another one where the trade-off was a function of the real exchange rate and the interest rate. Excess <b>wages</b> and/or increasing <b>cost</b> levels in the tradable sector led to higher unemployment rather than higher prices.

40|$|The undocumented {{economic}} immigrants (UEI) in Greece (about half {{a million}} since the early 1990 s, forming {{the bulk of the}} immigration to the country) find jobs because of their wage and job-flexible labour and the regidities in the Greek labour market. They have positive effects on the GDP through the increase in the supply of labour, and there is evidence that they also contribute to relieving the inflationary pressures on the economy. The immigrant-induced unemployment, the decreasing effect on <b>real</b> <b>wages</b> and the adverse distributional effects on income appear to be limited, but other tangible and intangible socio-economic costs are likely to be significant: the UEI expand further the underground economy, although their work is not among its main causes; they - among others - are often subject to exploitation, which exposes Greece to criticism that it benefits from their labour without offering them any opportunity to integrate economically and socially. Despite ample evidence that the recent increased criminality in Greece is mainly due to individuals and organized gangs who enter in order to commit crimes, usually in close collaboration with local people, many Greeks believe that the UEI are the main cause. Finally, by restricting increases in <b>real</b> <b>wage</b> <b>costs,</b> the UEI may have diminished the efforts to increase capital investment and economic restructuring.
