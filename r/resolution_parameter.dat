High-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) has emerged as a powerful tool owing to its high mass accuracy and resolving power.

Although it is generally assumed that higher resolution is better for peptide identifications, the precise effect of varying <b>resolution</b> as a <b>parameter</b> on peptide identification has not yet been systematically evaluated. We used the Escherichia coli proteome and a standard 48 protein mix to study the effect of different <b>resolution</b> <b>parameters</b> on peptide identifications in the setting of a shotgun proteomics experiment on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We observed a higher number of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) whenever the MS scan was carried out by FT and the MS/MS in the ion-trap (IT) with the maximum PSMs obtained at an MS resolution of 30, 000. In contrast, when samples were analyzed by FT for both MS and MS/MS, the number of PSMs was significantly lower (∼ 40 % compared with FT-IT experiments) with the maximum PSMs obtained when both the MS and MS/MS resolution were set to 15, 000. Thus, a 15 K- 15 K resolution setting may provide the best compromise for studies where both speed and accuracy such as high-throughput post-translational analysis and de novo sequencing are important.
