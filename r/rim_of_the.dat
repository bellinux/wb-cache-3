5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell, squeeze {{water out of the}} cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E

25|$|The coins {{differ in}} terms of size, weight and rim. Within each {{sequence}} the diameter and weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins increase with their value. The 50-øre and 10-krone coins have smooth <b>rims,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1- and 5-krone coins are milled. <b>The</b> <b>rims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2- and 20-krone coins have interrupted milling.

5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds.

5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along the <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E

Despite this, the road on the {{opposite}} rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920. Following {{the construction of the}} Vale of Avoca {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 Henry Colton, {{who worked}} for the Williamsport Lumber Company, {{supervised}} the cutting of white pine on the land owned by Silas Billings; this land would later become the park. Colton gave his name to the Colton Point overlook on the west <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pine Creek Gorge. Deadman Hollow Road in the park is named for a trapper whose decomposed body was found in his own bear trap there in the early 20th century. Fourmile Run flows through the park: its O'Connor Branch is named for the dead trapper's brothers, who were loggers in the area.|$|E
