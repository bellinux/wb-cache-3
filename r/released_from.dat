40|$|Bone {{remodeling}} is {{an important}} factor in orthodontic tooth movement. During orthodontic treatment, osteoclasts are subjected to various mechanical stimuli, and this promotes or inhibits osteoclast differentiation and fusion. It has been previously reported that the <b>release</b> <b>from</b> tensile force induces osteoclast differentiation. However, little is known about how <b>release</b> <b>from</b> compressive force affects osteoclasts. The present study investigated the effects of <b>release</b> <b>from</b> compressive force on osteoclasts. The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) -positive multinucleated osteoclasts derived from RAW 264. 7 cells was counted, and gene expression associated with osteoclast differentiation and fusion in response to <b>release</b> <b>from</b> compressive force was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Osteoclast number was increased by optimal compressive force application. On <b>release</b> <b>from</b> this force, osteoclast differentiation and fusion were suppressed. mRNA expression of NFATc 1 was inhibited for 6 h subsequent to <b>release</b> <b>from</b> compressive force. mRNA expression of the other osteoclast-specific genes, TRAP, RANK, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, cathepsin-K, chloride channel 7, ATPase H+ transporting vacuolar proton pump member I, dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein and osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) was significantly inhibited at 3 h following <b>release</b> <b>from</b> compressive force compared with control cells. These findings suggest that <b>release</b> <b>from</b> optimal compressive force suppresses osteoclast differentiation and fusion, which may be important for developing orthodontic treatments...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} thapsigargin and thapsigargicin to {{activate}} mast cells and leukocytes has been investigated. The thapsigargin-induced histamine <b>release</b> <b>from</b> rat peritoneal mast cells {{was found to}} be dependent on the concentration of thapsigargin, the purity of the mast cell preparations, and the number of mast cells in suspension. Thapsigargin induced histamine <b>release</b> <b>from</b> human basophil leukocytes. Thapsigargin induced beta-glucuronidase and lysozyme <b>release</b> <b>from</b> human neutrophil leukocytes. Thapsigargin caused a <b>release</b> of histamine <b>from</b> mesentery, lung, and heart mast cells of the rat, but only to a minor extent from the corresponding guinea-pig cells. Thapsigargicin induced histamine <b>release</b> <b>from</b> mesentery, lung, and heart mast cells of the rat at concentrations from 0. 1 microM but provoked only a <b>release</b> <b>from</b> the corresponding guinea-pig cells in the concentration-range 0. 16 to 1. 6 microM.

40|$|Insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> {{pancreatic}} islets: Effects of CRF {{and excess}} PTH. Insulin secretion may be impaired in {{chronic renal failure}} (CRF) and available data suggest that this abnormality {{may be related to}} the state of secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal failure. We directly measured insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> isolated islets of Langerhans obtained from normal rats, CRF-control and CRF-PTX (parathyroidectomized) rats, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) -treated animals. Both early and total glucose-induced insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> islets of CRF-control were markedly and significantly (P < 0. 01) lower than from islets of normal rats. Insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> islets of CRF-PTX rats was significantly (P < 0. 01) higher than that from islets of CRF-control rats, and not different <b>from</b> insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> islets of normal rats. Forskolin and IBMX, which cause a rise in cAMP, significantly stimulated glucose-induced insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> islets of normal, CRF-control and CRF-PTX rats, but the increments from baseline were not significantly different between the three groups. Both early and total insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> islets obtained from PTH-treated rats with normal renal function were markedly and significantly (P < 0. 01) lower than values obtained from normal rats. Calcium contents of the pancreas of CRF-control and PTH-treated rats were significantly (P < 0. 01) higher than that in pancreas of normal rats and CRF-PTX animals, and values in the latter two groups of animals were not significantly different. The results show that: 1) CRF impairs insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> pancreatic islets; 2) this abnormality is reversed by prior parathyroidectomy; and 3) hyperparathyroidism induced by PTH-treatment in normal rats impairs insulin <b>release</b> <b>from</b> pancreatic islets. The data provide a direct evidence for the role of secondary hyperparathyroidism in the genesis of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism in CRF. This effect of excess PTH is not related to alterations in cAMP production but may potentially be due to calcium accumulation in the pancreas...|$|R

40|$|Low-molecular-weight (LMW) {{organic acids}} widely exist in soils, {{particularly}} in the rhizosphere. A series of batch experiments were carried out to investigate the phosphorus <b>release</b> <b>from</b> rock phosphate and iron phosphate by low-molecular-weight organic acids. Results showed that citric acid had the highest capacity to solubilize P from both rock and iron phosphate. P solubilization from rock phosphate and iron phosphate resulted in net proton consumption. P <b>release</b> <b>from</b> rock phosphate {{was positively correlated with}} the pK(a) values. P <b>release</b> <b>from</b> iron phosphate was positively correlated with Fe-organic acid stability constants except for aromatic acids, but was not correlated with pK(a). Increase in the concentrations of organic acids enhanced P solubilization from both rock and iron phosphate almost linearly. Addition of phenolic compounds further increased the P <b>release</b> <b>from</b> iron phosphate. Initial solution pH had much more substantial effect on P <b>release</b> <b>from</b> rock phosphate than from iron phosphate...|$|R
