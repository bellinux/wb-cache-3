5000|$|Model {{yachting}} is the pastime {{of building}} and racing model yachts. It {{has always been}} customary for ship-builders to make a miniature model of the vessel under construction, which is in every respect {{a copy of the}} original on a small scale, whether steamship or sailing ship. There are fine collections to be seen at both general interest museums such as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and at many specialized maritime museums worldwide. Many of these models are of exquisite workmanship, every <b>rope,</b> <b>pulley</b> or portion of the engine being faithfully reproduced. In the case of sailing yachts, these models were often pitted against each other on small bodies of water, and hence arose the modern pastime. It was soon seen that elaborate fittings and complicated rigging were a detriment to rapid handling, and that, on account of the comparatively stronger winds in which models were sailed, they needed a greater draught. For these reasons modern model yachts, which usually have fin keels, are of about 15% or 20% deeper draught than full-sized vessels, while rigging and fittings have been reduced to absolute simplicity. This applies to models built for racing and not to elaborate copies of steamers and ships, made only for show or for [...] " [...] toy cruising." ...|$|E

Kneeling on a trolley or rollerboard, skiers pulled themselves up a 95 inch inclined track using rope pulleys at a cadence of one pull every 2. 5 seconds. Peak blood lactate values represented the highest blood lactate value obtained from the post exercise samples. Differences in phase one and two PBLa(A + L) and MVO 2 values were related to the degree of sports specificity of the A + L protocol to cross-country skiing. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
