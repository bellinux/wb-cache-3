50|$|Shotguns {{used for}} <b>riot</b> control are nearly always in 12 gauge, {{as that is}} the gauge in which nearly all <b>riot</b> control rounds are made.

Due to the reduced power of <b>riot</b> control rounds, there is insufficient energy to cycle the actions of gas operated and recoil operated firearms, so <b>riot</b> shotguns are manually operated, usually pump action. The advantage of using a <b>riot</b> shotgun for <b>riot</b> control is that the shotgun is a dual use firearm, and can switch quickly {{to and from the}} <b>riot</b> control role by changing the ammunition. The downside is that it can fire lethal projectiles, and so extra care must be taken in its use to prevent the wrong ammunition from being used.|$|R
