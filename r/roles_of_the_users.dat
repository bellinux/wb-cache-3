The field of interest rests upon the communication about the case as it developed on Twitter, it being a social media platform. The aim is to theorize the case and to find a communication structure, which is done by implementing a number of theories and methodologies that are beneficial in 1) understanding the role and structure of Twitter within the public response to a mediated high level political scandal, 2) investigating Twitter in terms of how to make social research that is relevant for this case and 3) investigating the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> in terms of how they act and how they are connected. The general conclusions that are reached in the project are first that Twitter in this case has a dynamic function for its users and enables a relatively immediate and diverse but not equal response to a scandal; secondly that what tends to dominate the motivation and sentiment behind the communication about the case on Twitter can be divided into self-promotion, satirical and serious criticism and plain humour; and lastly that specific categories of Twitter profiles tend to dominate the case-related communication including News media outlets, ‘high profile’ users, and blogs, and thus weakening the influence of ‘ordinary’ users...|$|E
40|$|Processing {{documents}} is {{a critical}} and crucial aspect in an enterprise environment. The management of documents involves several people and many times becomes a long and wasting-time process. Many systems of document workflow have been proposed but usually they are too rigid and complex. Therefore we have developed a document workflow engine based on the email paradigm. When a user wants to make an order, a request of authorization and, in general, any kind of procedure that involve a document, starts her/his request by filling in a form and sending it by attaching it to an email. To this purpose the user has to use our web application that appears as a normal webmail client. Our solution overcomes the actual limitation {{in the use of}} document workflow software, especially for what concern the user experience; with our system there is no need, for users, to learn the functioning of a new framework. In addition, users with different roles have different customized view of the document. According with the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users,</b> we trained the system to suggest to the user, at each step, a possible receiver of the email. Currently this feature is {{based on the fact that}} the system knows in advance the flow associated with different type of documents. As improvement, we will perform a statistical analysis of interactions between senders and receivers. This analysis will be used to improve the suggestion mechanism: the system will learn the most frequent interactions for each user, depending on the history of previous flow and the document involved. Exploiting these information, the suggestion mechanism will advise to the user the possible receiver of the document...|$|E

The first goal of this thesis is to describe and to specify the term of metadata in the field of theory and on the level of busi-ness, their main structure, their occurrence in a non-visual manner and related places where we can find metadata in the heterogeneous business environment. This part also includes a short introduction to the usage of metadata that is related and originates from business in-telligence and a description of Company encyclopedia that can syndicate these resources for further utilization. When defined, the sources, destinations and purpose of technical and business metadata can be used {{in the second part of}} the thesis [...] this part is aimed at model-ing the use cases for the visual component that can be applied to business and technical metadata. Use cases will be focused on the <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> that will use this component and to discover the primary demands and requirements of these users and the functionality that will be indispensable.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2015 Tez çalışmasının amacı büyük ölçekli karma yapı tipolojisini ortaya çıkaran bağlamı irdeleyerek, tipolojinin üretilmesindeki temel motivasyonları çözümlemek; bu motivasyonların mekansal sonuçlarını araştırmak; ve tipolojinin özelliklerini seçilen örneklerin içinden analiz ederek İstanbul’daki büyük ölçekli karma yapılar üzerine kapsayıcı bir tanımlama geliştirmektir.   Bu eksende büyük ölçekli karma kullanımlı yapı tipolojisini ortaya çıkaran olaylar, durumlar, ilişkiler örgüsü; tipolojinin  üretildiği toplumsal zemin olarak “metropol” ve karma kullanımlı yapı tipolojisini üreten sosyal aktörler olarak “iktidar” “sermaye” ve “tüketici” kavramları üzerinden çözümlenmiştir. İkinci bölümde karma kullanımlı yapı kavramı netleştirilmiş; karma kullanımlı yapı tipolojisinin, ortaya çıktığı ilk dönemden günümüze uzanan süredeki evrimi önemli toplumsal gelişmelerle ilişkilendirlerek ortaya koyulmuş ve güncel durumda barındırdığı kullanımların nasıl bir artı değer mekanizması olarak çalıştığı irdelenmiştir. Üçüncü bölümde karma kullanımlı yapı tipolojisinin üretildiği toplumsal zemin ve varoluşunda etkin olan sosyal aktörler belirlenerek kuramsal bir çözümleme geliştirilmiştir. Bu bağlamda tipolojinin üretildiği zemin olarak “metropol” olgusu, modern kentin doğuşundan günümüze uzanan bir akışla irdelenmiş; tipolojinin üretiminde etkin olan sosyal aktörler “iktidar” “sermaye” ve “tüketici” tanımlamalarıyla kavramlaştırılarak ilgili toplumbilim okumalarıyla çözümlenmiş; ve büyük ölçekli karma kullanımlı yapıların üretimindeki doğrudan rolleri açıklanmıştır. Dördüncü bölümde; bir önceki bölümde ortaya koyulan kuramsal yaklaşımın mekansal sonuçları araştırılmış; ve İstanbul örnekleminden seçilen üç önemli büyük ölçekli karma kullanımlı yapı örneği olan Zorlu Center; Mall of İstanbul ve Metropol İstanbul projeleri “metropol” “iktidar” “sermaye” ve “tüketici” ile olan ilişkileri ve bu ilişkilerin sonuçları ekseninde değerlendirilerek analiz edilmiştir. Sonuç bölümünde; elde edilen bulgular, üç örnek projenin çapraz okuması biçiminde karşılaştırmalı bir analiz olarak sunulmuş ve araştırma neticesinde varılan sonuçlar kamu yararı bağlamında tartışılmıştır. The {{study is}} aiming to {{construe}} the main motivations of producing the large-scale mixed-use buildings by researching the context which exposes this typology;  and to improve an inclusionary definition on large-scale mixed-use buildings in İstanbul  by analyzing the chracteristics  of this typology through its context.   For this aim, {{the network of}} the events, circumstances and relations which expose the large-scale mixed-use building typology have been analyzed within  “metropolis”, which is the social ground that produces the typology; and through “political power”, “capitalist” and “consumer” notions, which are asserted to be the social actors who are operative {{in the production of}} this typology in this thesis. As a multiple case study, three important mixed-use building samples from İstanbul;  Zorlu Center, Mall of İstanbul, Metropol İstanbul projects have been researched through this context to establish a valid attitude and conclusion based on the theory. In the second chapter; the definiton of mixed-use building has been clearified by stating the dialectics of the mixed-use building notion with pre-modern era. Afterwards, the evolution of this typology in 20 th century has been classified by decades and summarized related to the important social progress’ in urban context. The  importance of the three selected cases within the sample pool of İstanbul has been declared as a conclusion to the chronological evolution map of this typology. Finally, it has been analyzed that how the actual functions contained by this building typology work as a profit-making mechanism.   In the third chapter;  a theorical structure has been improved by defining the social ground which the large-scale mixed-use building typology has been exposed in and the social actors which are asserted to be operative in the production of the large- scale mixed-use building typology. Therefore, the phenomenon of “metropolis” has been described as the social ground of the typology; and the social actors which are operative in the production of this typology have been conceptualized as   “political power” “capitalist” and “consumer”.   In this context, the phenomenon of “metropolis” has been discussed begining from the birth of the modern city until the contemporary metropolis and the basic dynamics of site selection in metropoliten area have been described to understand how the large-scale mixed-use buildings position in the urban context. Afterwards, the social actors  have been analyzed within the related social science readings. To analyze the direct roles of the “political power”;  the rational development principals of the modern city and flexibilites that are being shown for the metropoliten structure problems are researched; and the motivations of the political power to promote the large-scale mixed-use projects have been discussed through Turkey’s experiences. To resolve the direct role of the “capitalist” in building this typology, the “flexible accumulation” theory which is named as the actual operation form of contemporary capitalism has been researched; the motivations of the capitalist to build the large-scale mixed-use building and the attitudes which directly effect the characteristics of the typology  has been discussed through this economical theory.   To construe the direct <b>roles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>users</b> of this typology, “consumer society” theory has been researched; and the motivations to use large-scale mixed-use building and user preferences which directly effect the characteristics of the typology  has been discussed through this social theory.   Finally the social actors’ direct roles related with architecture on the charachteristics of this typology has been revealed to use as a research method on the multiple case study.  To build the research method, the notions which came front under each title have been clearified as a conclusion for the third chapter. Through “metropolis” phenomenon, the facts about the construction sites such as characteristics of the metropoliten areas which the projects positioned in,  relations with the transport axis’ and economical connections, annuity rates which come from both location and utilization; came forward as the important facts to research.   Through “political power” notion, the acquisition way of the public land by the private investors, building permissions of the construction sites, zoning permissions of the construction sites and the actual situation of the built projects’,  came forward as the important facts to research to clearify the role of political power on the projects.   Through “capitalist” notion, economical characteristics of the investors, economical mobility of the projects, the planing varietes of the projects related to the economics of diversity, prestige  bookmarks which are created within the projects by the investors came to the fore as the important facts to research to specify the role of the investors on the projects which can be explained within flexible acummulation principals. Through “consumer” notion, leisure activites’ spatial compositions in the projects, direct relations with the public consumers, operation of the brands created within the projects, consumer society discourses and consuming indicators that are used by the investors on the advirtesement and management strategies came to the fore as the important facts to research for specifying the role of the consumers on the projects which can be explained within consumer society phenomenon. In the fourth chapter; the typological results of the social context which was exposed in the previous chapter has been researched within architecture; and three important large-scale mixed-use building cases from İstanbul, Zorlu Center, Mall of İstanbul and Metropol İstanbul projects have been analyzed through the relations with “metropolis” “political power” “capitalist” and “consumer” as a multiple case study. Thus, the main titles have been exposed as the cases; and four subtitles for each cases have been decided  as aforesaid notions.   The decision to name the three cases as “large-scale mixed-use buildings” is based on the facts that all the three projects have 100. 000 m 2 and over land areas, and over 500. 000 m 2 construction areas. In the case selection, Zorlu Center, Mall of İstanbul and Metropol İstanbul projects have been considered important because of their large scales, recognizable investment costs that they are the three of the most expensive five mixed-use buildings in Turkey as the day; and their different positions in the metropoliten area while they are in three different spots in İstanbul which gives an occasion to improve an inclusionary definition on large-scale mixed-use buildings in İstanbul. In the final chapter; the findings which were obtained from the previous chapters have been presented as a comperative analysis of the three case studies. The way of the multiple case study which was based on the system that creating titles for each of the cases and creating subtitles as  “metropolis” “political power” “capitalist” and “consumer” under each of the cases; has been reversed and three cases have been discussed under each notions to offer {{a different point of view}} to reveal the scientific situation. Afterwards, the conclusions have been discussed in the context of  public interest to path the ways for further suggestions. This study analyzes the large-scale mixed-use building phenomenon from a point of view which can be categorized under the common title of “economy politics of space” in the existing literature. The study differs itself from the other thesis’ written on the mixed-use buildings in this way; and states both sociological and architectural discourses about the large-scale mixed-use building typology.

We discuss basic conditions for engineering a user interface in this context, primarily <b>the</b> central <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> interface model and the model's relation to the concrete system. Finally, we argue that the MDA may be able to bridge some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gaps between HCI and System Engineering under certain circumstances...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} <b>the</b> present state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fluency pronunciation trainer and deals with issues concerning <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> {{that have come}} up when choices {{had to be made}} about the system s interface. We first refer to several CALL systems in order to examine user and system initiative in controlling <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> events in a session. In light of this, we then present new additions to Fluency: choosing speakers, using a rejection threshold, limiting error correction, giving listening information, and finally, creating an authoring kit...|$|R
40|$|How {{selection}} of materials, understood as subject knowledge, should occur for non-fiction collections in public libraries has been polarized along an axis of user demand and intellectual rigor for many decades. Attempts to synthesize these various approaches have, largely, {{failed to do}} justice to either tendency. This paper is formulated as an encomium to the materials-centered approach and looks to uncover what is lost when librarians choose to focus in extremis, on <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> in <b>the</b> building <b>of</b> subject knowledge for a comprehensive civil society-oriented collection...|$|R
40|$|Situational {{awareness}} {{is essential for}} effective decision making in both military and civilian domains. In order to achieve good situational awareness a decision maker {{must be able to}} access information from a number of sources and combine this with his/her current knowledge. The retrieved information must be appropriate to <b>the</b> task and <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user,</b> and be presented to him/her in an appropriate manner. Our conjecture is that Personalised Briefing Agents can assist users with achieving situational awareness by connecting to an Agent-Oriented Information System and using user models to provide personalised briefings...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores <b>the</b> {{importance}} <b>of</b> designing interfaces that evoke {{positive feelings}} in <b>the</b> <b>user</b> as {{they interact with}} the interface. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> interactive television (iTV) and affective usability illustrate how usability paradigms shift as new technology is developed. Traditional television is a more passive medium than iTV and <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> (or viewer) varies significantly. iTV requires more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> and to be an active contributor because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more interactive interaction style. Interface designers need to constantly define better ways of developing interfaces that are not only usable, but also enjoyable to use. <br /...|$|R
