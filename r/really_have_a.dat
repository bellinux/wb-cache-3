Pennsylvania agreed to recognize the Iroquois {{as the owner of}} all Indian lands in Pennsylvania; the Iroquois, in turn, agreed to sell lands only to Pennsylvania. Canasatego probably attended a 1736 treaty where some Iroquois chiefs sold land along the Susquehanna River to Pennsylvania, even though the Iroquois did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> claim to this land.|$|E
25|$|Ian meets Karen Taylor (Lorraine Stanley) who {{has just}} moved into the Square with her family. Ian reluctantly employs Karen, who quits after Ian refuses to let her take burgers away for her children. Ian and Jane are later devastated when they learn that Steven has a brain tumour, {{but he has been}} {{secretly}} lying about this {{in a desperate attempt to}} stay with Lauren. Jane has been developing a Walford in Bloom event and on the day of the event, an unnoticed gas leak throws the whole Square into danger. Unbeknownst to Ian, Jane has discovered Steven's lie and that Max has not really forgiven them and is secretly planning revenge. In a bid to get rid of Jane, Max forces Steven to kill her. As a result, Steven sets fire to the restaurant, trapping Jane inside. Steven later has a change of heart and tries to save Jane, but is violently shoved into a table by Max, who leaves Jane to die. However, while Jane is rescued, Steven dies of a liver bleed. Ian, Kathy and Lauren are shocked when they learn that Steven did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> brain tumour. A disgusted Lauren declares that his funeral will not be taking place and only Abi attends. Ian is thrilled when Jane awakens from her coma. Max forces Jane to leave Walford with Ian. But, James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde), who is working with Max and who also raped Kathy years ago, orders Max to ensure that Ian remains in Walford. Therefore, Max blackmails Jane into leaving Walford alone, threatening harm to Bobby if she does not. A heart-broken Jane leaves Walford without Ian, leaving him shattered. Ian allows Lauren and Louie to move back in with him. Ian tells Abi about making Beales into a franchise to pass onto Louie. Abi announces to Ian that he will have another grandchild as she is pregnant with Steven's baby, news that Ian does not take well. Ian informs Max of Abi's pregnancy.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz and {{was intended as a}} morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer {{you have to ask yourself}} 'Why? ... And if you don't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> point or reason, your story's probably not going to be very good." [...] Despite largely being concerned with a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week", [...] "The Gift" [...] also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E

Luke Turner of NME noted that [...] " [...] voice cracks against the increasing, insistent power of the electronic rhythms, as if recognising our human insignificance in the face of geology", citing the verse [...] "As fast as your fingernail grows / The Atlantic ridge drifts" [...] as an example, and, on a similar note, Odile De Plas of Télérama found the singer's voice [...] "strong, acrobat, guttural and [...] crystalline".|$|E

500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time in my whole life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> place'." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} I very much wanted". He added that his vision was for [...] "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great time watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed {{a couple of big}} ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E
500|$|The Wire {{published}} a favorable review by Joseph Stannard, {{in which he}} wrote [...] "If it is an elaborate put-on—and I suspect Ferraro isn't averse to a chuckle {{at the expense of}} his audience—Far Side Virtual still feels like the culmination of numerous releases' worth of research and development. ... Whether or not its creator is giggling through a bong smoke haze, Far Side Virtual is a convincing evocation of the digital dreamtime." [...] Stefan Wharton of Tiny Mix Tapes' took the album as a statement about blurred boundaries between consumers and their technologies, citing the writing of Markus Giesler as a precedent. Wharton said, [...] "Far Side Virtual succeeds in exciting the collective memory of that generation now so conjoined to its technological appendages." [...] In Pitchforks review, Soderberg wrote, [...] "the songs here are exactly the same as what they're ostensibly parodying, which is bold and maybe even the point. ... You suddenly realize you're listening to 45 minutes of utilitarian music that doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> purpose. Can something be utopian and dystopian at the same time? Probably. Maybe even always." ...|$|E

500|$|Directed by Nick Marck, [...] "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] {{was written}} by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and {{penultimate}} writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do {{not appear in the}} episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: [...] "We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sister-brother thing going on. I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works." [...] Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He highlighted the appearance of Vincent Schiavelli, saying that he [...] "totally owns every scene he’s in". He thought that the situation which left La Forge in charge of the Enterprise was [...] "horribly contrived" [...] and said [...] "Picard doesn’t even give a good excuse for going down to the planet beyond the script calling for it". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten, summing up that it was a [...] "fun, enjoyable, diverting episode". Zack Handlen reviewed the episode in May 2010 for The A.V. Club. He criticised the episode, saying that there [...] "are all kinds of problems, the biggest being that the episode doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third act, but the moral superiority of the crew is on full display, and it's frustrating." [...] He summed up the moral story played out in this episode, saying that [...] "On TOS, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy would've hashed out the appeal of an unbeatable weapon as well as its drawbacks. Here, we're all supposed to know that violence begets violence, and that's it." [...] He gave the episode a grade of C+.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed." [...] Nutter said [...] "In many ways, Chris wanted to sell the idea that, as established in Mulder's closing dialogue in the show, not all terror comes from the paranormal. It could come from the person next door." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he {{gradually}} gets used to his {{new body}} and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he [...] "finally clicks into place" [...] after picking out his new outfit." [...] The rooftop scene {{was not in the}} original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed {{this was the kind of}} relationship viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, she is a very different person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting she loved him, too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with many}} critics praising {{the return of}} Mac and the increased role of peripheral characters, the resolution to the rape mystery, and the setup of the next major story arc. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "great". He wrote that [...] "Spit & Eggs" [...] was a welcome episode for longtime fans, as it involved several plots converging {{in a way that}} he found satisfactory. He praised the final few scenes, writing that the episode transitions well into the next mystery of Dean O'Dell's death by developing it slowly {{over the course of the}} season's prior episodes, but he was more mixed towards the reveal of Mercer as the rapist, commenting [...] "the ultimate revelation can't help but be a little underwhelming, since not enough time has been spent on any of the credible suspects to <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good handle on them or be invested in them one way or another." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, who was quite critical of the rape storyline in earlier episodes, said that the conclusion made the storyline slightly better overall. He praised the double reveal of Mercer and Moe as accomplices, stating, [...] "That twist overall is effective because it plays on everyone's expectations. The characters all believe there is a single culprit here. [...] It makes the revelations more plausible, while also making the need for those revelations less intense (the two are related)." ...|$|E
