40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} innovative technical solution of vertical trickle filter systems, which are categorized {{into the category}} of natural ways thow to clean water. The actual vertical filters for root cleaners are currently experiencing a boom thanks to the MPO project with the working title Biostream, within which are vertical root systems tested on <b>root</b> <b>cleaner</b> in the village of Kotenƒçice (involved in pilot conditions). The results show an increased removal of ammonia nitrogen and high efficiency in the elimination of organic pollution BSK 5 and CHSKCr. However, the practice may in the future require even higher efficiency that can be solved by small technical innovations and modifications. In connection with the forced aeration of vertical filters is elaborated the methodological part of the thesis, the final result of the work is several regression equations using which it is possible to determine the input of oxygen into the system at a given input parameters (filter size, water flow, air flow, etc.). The results are very useful for a scientific branch because there is not so much available literature for this topic...|$|E
50|$|Aeroponics has now largely surpassed {{hydroponics}} {{and tissue}} culture as means for sterile propagation of plant species. With the Genesis Machine, or other comparable aeroponics setup, any grower could clone plants. Due to the automation of {{most parts of}} the process, plants could be cloned and grown by the hundreds or even thousands. In short, cloning became easier because the aeroponic apparatus initiated faster and <b>cleaner</b> <b>root</b> development through a sterile, nutrient rich, highly oxygenated, and moist environment (Hughes, 1983).|$|R
40|$|Root canal {{preparation}} is one {{important step in}} endodontic treatment, involves the cleaning and the shaping of the root canal debris. Root canal cleaning effectiveness depends on the preparation bio-mechanical and irrigation. Purpose {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cleanliness of apical third of root canal wall from of debris, with the contact time of 17 % EDTA irrigation material for 60 seconds and 30 seconds after root canal preparation using rotary NiTi instruments. This quasi-experimental study was carried out invitro, with random sampling technique. The sample used was 20 central maxillary incisors that have been extracted and divided into two experimental groups of 10 teeth each. The results were analyzed using student t statistics, showed that the average value of the debris of the two groups differed significantly. The contact time of 60 seconds of 17 % EDTA showed <b>cleaner</b> <b>root</b> canal than the 30 seconds. The conclusion of this study was there were the differences of the cleanliness of apical third of the root canal with the 60 seconds contact time of 17 % EDTA irrigation materials than 30 seconds contact time...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Root canal {{cleaning}} and shaping are important steps in endodontic therapy. In"norder to develop better techniques, new instruments are constantly {{designed and delivered}} to the market. "nPurpose: The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the effectiveness of one manual with three rotary"nroot canal instrumentations techniques. "nMaterials and Methods: In this in-vitro study, 80 mesial roots of freshly extracted human mandibular"nmolars were divided in to four groups equally and prepared by one of the following instrumentation"nmethods profile NiTi rotary system, Protaper NiTi rotary system, Flex Master NiTi rotary system and"nhand NiTi K-file instrumentation. In each root one of the canals was instrumented and the other was used"nas control. "nAfter decalcification, cross sections at 3 mm and 5 mm of apical portion were prepared and examined for"nremaining debris, predentin and smooth walls under light microscope. The data were analyzed by"nKxuskal-Wallis test. "nResults: Significantly less debris was found at 3 mm cross- section using protaper and Flex Master"ntechniques (P&lt; 0. 05). No significant differences were found at 5 mm cross section. Also no significant"ndifferences were observed for remaining predentin at all regions. Significantly more smooth walls were"nfound at both regions using protaper technique (P&lt; 0. 05). "nConclusion: The protaper technique employed in this study resulted in <b>cleaner</b> <b>root</b> cana! walls than the"nother techniques...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a final rinse with Endosolv R&# 174; solvent and ultrasound resulted in <b>cleaner</b> <b>root</b> canal walls during endodontic retreatment. A total of 56 extracted premolar teeth were manually instrumented using a step-back flare technique and filled with gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer. After 9 months, the canals were retreated by removing the gutta-percha and sealer with ProTaper Universal Retreatment and rotary preparation with ProTaper Universal System up to an F 5 file. As a final step, the teeth were randomly divided in 4 groups (n= 14) and were subjected to passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) with either Endosolv R or distilled water. In the control groups, the irrigants were left undisturbed. Roots were cleaved and examined under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the amount of filling remnants on the canal walls was assessed by two calibrated examiners in a blinded fashion. Data were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (&# 945;= 0. 05). All groups presented filling debris in the three root canal thirds after retreatment. There were no significant differences between the groups or among the root canal thirds within each group (p> 0. 05). PUI with Endosolv R was not effective in the removal of filling debris from root canal walls...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of the Mtwo R (Sweden & Martina, Padova, Italy), ProTaper retreatment files (Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), and a Hedstrom manual technique in the removal of three different filling materials (gutta-percha, Resilon [Resilon Research LLC, Madison, CT], and EndoRez [Ultradent Products Inc, South Jordan, UTI) during retreatment. Ninety single-rooted straight premolars were instrumented and randomly divided into 9 groups of 10 teeth each (n = 10) with regards to filling material and instrument used. For all roots, the following data were recorded: procedural errors, time of retreatment, apically extruded material, canal wall cleanliness through optical stereomicroscopy (OSM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A linear regression analysis and three logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the level of significance set at p = 0. 05. The results indicated that the overall regression models were statistically significant. The Mtwo R, ProTaper retreatment files, and Resilon filling material had a positive impact in reducing the time for retreatment. Both ProTaper retreatment files and Mtwo R showed a greater extrusion of debris. For both OSM and SEM logistic regression models, the root canal apical third had the greatest impact on the score values. EndoRez filling material resulted in <b>cleaner</b> <b>root</b> canal walls using OSM analysis, whereas Resilon filling material and both engine-driven NiTi rotary techniques resulted in less clean root canal walls according to SEM analysis. In conclusion, all instruments left remnants of filling material and debris on the root canal walls irrespective of the root filling material used. Both the engine-driven NiTi rotary systems proved to be safe and fast devices for the removal of endodontic filling material...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University School of Dentistry {{located on}} the campus of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This in-vitro, prospective, {{randomized}} study microscopically compared the debridement efficacy of negative pressure irrigation with the EndoVac (Discus Dental, Culver City, CA) versus the Canal CleanMax (Maximum Dental, Inc., Secaucus, NJ). Sixty extracted human canines were instrumented using a combination of hand-instrumentation with Lexicon K-type files and rotary instrumentation with ProTaper files. All canals were irrigated with 6. 0 -percent sodium hypochlorite and 17 - percent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). However, the irrigation/aspiration techniques differed among three groups of 20 randomly selected teeth. Group one (control) was irrigated with only a 12 -ml Monoject syringe via 30 -gauge side-vented, closed-end needle. Group two was irrigated with the EndoVac system. Group three was irrigated similar to group one, but with the adjunct of the Canal CleanMax system. All teeth were sectioned longitudinally, and the more intact sections were divided into coronal, middle, and apical thirds. Each portion of the canal was photographed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The photographs were scored by two independent examiners according to relative amount of debris and/or smear layer present, as well as relative number of patent dentinal tubules. These scores were statistically analyzed using a Krustal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to determine differences between groups. The coronal aspect of root canal walls irrigated with the EndoVac system exhibited significantly less debris and/or smear layer present when compared to the coronal aspect of root canals irrigated with only a standard 12 -ml Monoject syringe equipped with 30 -gauge ProRinse side-vented, closed-end needle (control). There were no other significant differences in scores between any groups at any location. For all locations combined, the EndoVac system produced significantly <b>cleaner</b> <b>root</b> canal walls as compared to the control. No significant differences were seen between the Canal CleanMax and Control or Canal CleanMax and EndoVac. This study suggested negative pressure irrigation delivery with the EndoVac system during and after hand-rotary instrumentation is more effective in removal of debris and smear layer from the coronal third and combined thirds of root canal walls compared to irrigation with a standard 12 -ml Monoject syringe equipped with 30 -gauge ProRinse side-vented, closed-end needle...|$|R
