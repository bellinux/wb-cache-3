40|$|During their {{specialty}} training, Dutch GP trainees {{work at a}} GP {{under the}} supervision of a GP trainer. Research suggests that the patient mix of GP trainees differs from that of their trainers. <b>Receptionists</b> assign patients to either the trainee or the trainer, thereby influencing the patient mix of the trainees.

Most (86. 3 %) of the <b>receptionists</b> considered the patient mix of trainees and trainers to be similar. Almost all <b>receptionists</b> (97 %) reported 'often' or 'always' assigning 'every possible problem' to the trainee and a similar picture arose regarding specific subpopulations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Managing patients' {{requests}} for appointments {{is an important}} general practice activity. No previous research has systematically observed how patients and <b>receptionists</b> negotiate appointments. AIM: To observe appointment making and investigate patients' and professionals' experiences of appointment negotiations. DESIGN OF STUDY: A qualitative study using participant observation. SETTING: Three general practices on Tyneside; a single-handed practice, a practice comprising three doctors, and a seven-doctor practice. METHOD: Participant observation sessions, consisting of 35 activity recordings and 34 periods of observation and 38 patient and 15 professional interviews, were set up. Seven groups of patients were selected for interview. These included patients attending an 'open access' surgery, patients who complained about making an appointment, and patients who complimented the <b>receptionists.</b> RESULTS: Appointment making is a complex social process. Outcomes are dependent {{on the process of}} negotiation and factors, such as patients' expectations and appointment availability. <b>Receptionists</b> felt that patients in employment, patients allocated to the practice by the Health Authority, and patients who did not comply with practice appointment rules were most demanding. Appointment requests are legitimised by <b>receptionists</b> enforcing practice rules and requesting clinical information. Patients volunteer information to provide evidence that their complaint is appropriate and employ strategies, such as persistence, assertiveness, and threats, to try and persuade <b>receptionists</b> to grant appointments. CONCLUSION: Appointment making is a complex social process where outcomes are negotiated. <b>Receptionists</b> have an important role in managing patient demand. Practices should be explicit about how appointments are allocated, including publishing practice criteria...|$|R
