2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. [...] This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck's Cyclery in Oakland, California was granted a patent for his Duck Roller Brake (U.S. Patent 594,234). The duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> against the front tyre, braking the front wheel.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the play}} was {{produced}} in London in 1902, The Era's drama critic described how the chariot race was achieved with [...] "four great cradles" [...] long and [...] wide, that moved [...] "back and front on railways", while horses secured with invisible steel cable traces galloped on treadmills towards the audience. The horses also drove the movement of a vast cyclorama backdrop, which revolved {{in the opposite direction}} to create an illusion of rapid speed. Electric <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> spun the chariot wheels, while fans created clouds of dust. The production had imported thirty tons of stage equipment from the United States, employed a cast of more than one hundred, and featured sets with fountains, palm trees, and the sinking of a Roman galley. A critic for The Illustrated London News described the London production in 1902 as [...] "a marvel of stage-illusion" [...] that was [...] "memorable beyond all else", while The Sketchs critic called it [...] "thrilling and realistic ... enough to make the fortune of any play" [...] and noted that [...] "the stage, which has to bear 30 tons' weight of chariots and horses, besides huge crowds, has had to be expressly strengthened and shored up." ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{mechanical}} model {{was introduced to}} analyze the hair wrapping via a contact surface in the yarn formation zone. Worsted and ramie/cotton rovings were then used to produce yarns on an experimental ring frame with and without a delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> to validate the theoretical analysis. Yarn properties, including hairiness, unevenness, and tensile properties were tested and {{the results indicated that}} the delivery roller could stop fibers from escaping from the twisting process in the spinning triangle and wrap most of them onto the stem of the yarn. In particular for worsted spinning, yarn unevenness CV, as well as tensile properties, was improved significantly due to an improved arrangement of the worsted strand when using the front delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> However, yarn evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> This was mainly because of the high modulus of the ramie/cotton blend strand, as upstream twists were blocked and a weak spinning zone was formed to incur an unexpected drawing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A quasistatic {{and steady}} state contact {{problems}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> and rigid roller is modeled {{by using a}} stress function {{in the form of}} series. The model is derived from the paper feed unit of duplicating machine. The point interpolation meshfree method (PIM) is applied to obtain the solution of the dual series equations resulting from the boundary condition. Stress and deformation for the <b>rubber</b> <b>roller</b> are obtained based on elasticity theory. Effects of rubber thickness and normal load are observed through the numerical examples. The observation show that the contact zone is changing with the normal load F and the rubber thickness has effect on the stress distribution. In addition, the study shows that the PIM method is an efficient and promising method for simulating the problem...|$|R

There are both foam and fabric rollers that are individually available (without a handle), made to replace worn out rollers, once an old roller is removed the new roller can be fitted onto the handle section for use. An innovation of the cylindrical core has allowed it to contain paint inside, with the cover absorbing paint from the inside and filtering it through (naturally by wicking) to be applied externally, when the roller is rolled.|$|E

Seven barangays have cono rice mills a barangay have kiskisan, 4 barangays have rubber roller mills. Total is 13 cono rice mill, 12 kiskisan and 5 <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers.</b> There is a bright prospect on cottage industries, which utilized raw materials like rattan and bamboo. Rattan craft in barangays Dado could possibly generate employment to its residents. The 40 hectares bamboo plantation at Barangay Guiling can provide fro raw materials to the bamboo craft at Kitacubong. This cottage industry is gaining support and acceptance from local residents considering the affordability and its unique qualities. Technology transfer and skills training have been conducted in the area. Its clients are the prospective entrepreneurs in rattan, bamboo and coconut crafts. Recipientss of the training and development seminars are: RIC Camansi, Lower Dado, Pacao, Raradangan the DTI-CARP has establish a Multi-Purpose Hot dryer at Barangay Pacao, the said project generate employment and income from drying service.

50|$|Ink of {{a second}} color, and the {{thinnest}} viscosity, is then applied {{to the surface of}} the plate with a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>roller,</b> so that it covers the plate in one pass and only transfers onto the highest areas of the plate. Ink of a third color, and a much stiffer consistency, is then applied to the lower areas of the plate with a softer <b>rubber</b> <b>roller.</b> The varying viscosities of the two rolled-on inks prevent them from mixing. A fourth color, of even thinner viscosity, can also be applied at this point. This color is either spread out on a glass plate, which is then pressed against the printing plate so that the ink only adheres to the highest points of the metal plate, or it is applied by a hard roller applied with very little pressure.|$|R

5000|$|After {{taking a}} ride with Muntz in a 4-track player-outfitted car, Bill Lear, maker of the Lear Jet, {{modified}} the 4-track technology to create the Stereo 8 cartridge, widely known as the 8-track. Most notably, eight tracks were squeezed onto the same ¼" [...] tape, reducing potential audio quality, but allowing twice as much music to be put onto the same length of tape. The pinch roller was also {{an integral part of}} the 8-track cartridge, although many early <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> would suffer from deterioration because the rubber had not been fully cured. Once this was discovered, all later rubber pinch rollers were [...] "fully cured" [...] (hard) rubber, or plastic rollers (introduced by RCA in 1970) were used instead. Thanks to his connection to Motorola, which made radios for Ford Motors cars, Lear was able to ensure that 8-track players would be included in many Ford cars, and they became popular mainly during the early- to mid-1970s. 4-track tapes gradually faded away and were gone by late 1970, as most people switched to 8-tracks, although players compatible with both 4-track and 8-track tapes were sometimes made. Inexpensive adapters were available that permitted 4-track tapes to be played in 8-track players. The adapter was a rubber pinch roller attached to a small metal plate that would clip into the opening in the 4-track cartridge. 4-track tapes are still in-demand by collectors.|$|E

The spacecraft is now housed at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC.

It {{was one of the first}} issues printed on the new Giori Press (named after its inventor, Gualtiero Giori). It employed a series of specially cut <b>rubber</b> <b>rollers</b> that applied two or three different colored inks on the same printing plate. As the new press was being used to print the Project Mercury stamp before the mission took place and in case the mission failed or was canceled, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing kept word about the new press and the stamp issue's production a secret. To further assure that the project be kept secret the designer of this issue, Charles R. Chickering, worked from his home and simply claimed that he was away on vacation. The stamps, waiting at post offices around the U.S., were sealed and marked [...] "Top Secret". Only after Glenn's trip were the postmasters allowed to open the package and see what was inside.|$|E
