25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence Brown wrote: [...] "Spielberg's {{decision}} {{to present the}} invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which {{did not exist in}} the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E
500|$|Although the NHL had not {{suspended}} Richards for {{his actions}} against Booth, the incident {{was instrumental in the}} League's newfound efforts to eliminate hits to the head, particularly against players who cannot see the oncoming checker approaching (as was the case with Booth). Several months after Booth's October 2009 concussion, Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard was hit by Matt Cooke in a similar fashion on March 7. Later that month, on March 25, the NHL Board of Governors and NHL Players' Association's executive board voted in favour of a rule penalizing [...] "blindside hits" [...] (bodychecking a player after having skated laterally towards him undetected, an idea similar to one's [...] "blind spot" [...] while driving). That same night, Booth suffered his second concussion in five months during a game against the Montreal Canadiens. While reaching back to retrieve a loose puck, Booth was hit in the head by opposing defenceman Jaroslav Špaček's shoulder. No penalty was called on the play, while Booth was helped off the ice and taken to hospital. The hit did not receive suspension and did not spark controversy as Booth's previous concussion had. Following the game, Panthers forward Nathan Horton asserted that [...] "It wasn't a dirty hit"; Špaček expressed concern for Booth, but explained that [...] "when he turned I was standing <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> basically he just ran at me." [...] Sidelined for the remaining nine games of the season, Booth finished the campaign with 16 points (eight goals and eight assists) over 28 games. After pushing for a playoff spot the previous season, the Panthers ranked second-worst in the East with 32 wins and 77 points.|$|E

Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?"
