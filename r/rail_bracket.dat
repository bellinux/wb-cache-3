5000|$|The vz. 58 was {{produced}} in three main variants: the standard vz. 58 P (Pěchotní or [...] "infantry") model with a fixed buttstock made of a synthetic material (wood impregnated plastic, older versions used a wooden stock), the vz. 58 V (Výsadkový—"airborne"), featuring a side-folding metal shoulder stock, folded to the right side, and the vz. 58 Pi (Pěchotní s infračerveným zaměřovačem—"infantry with infrared sight"), {{which is similar to}} the vz. 58 P but includes a receiver-mounted dovetail <b>rail</b> <b>bracket</b> (installed {{on the left side of}} the receiver) used to attach an NSP2 night sight; it also has a detachable folding bipod and an enlarged conical flash suppressor.|$|E
5000|$|Signals {{are most}} {{commonly}} mounted on trackside masts about 12 ft to 15 ft high {{to put them}} in the eyeline of the engineer. Signals can also be mounted on signal bridges or cantilever masts spanning multiple tracks. Signal bridges and masts typically provide at least 20 ft of clearance {{over the top of the}} <b>rail.</b> <b>Bracket</b> masts are arranged with multiple signals are mounted on the same masts governing two adjacent tracks. Bracket masts tend to be the tallest type of signal to allow the train crew to see the signal over a train on the intervening track. Signals in electrified territory may be mounted on the catenary structure, and signals on bi-directional lines may be mounted back-to-back on the same mounting device.|$|E

50|$|H R, hammer rail, {{resting on}} felt cushion, c, glued to <b>rail</b> or <b>bracket.</b> The hammer <b>rail</b> {{is held in}} {{position}} by the rod, shown under the hammer shank, which is hinged to the bracket at the lower end, and which allows it to be moved forward when the soft pedal is used. The soft pedal communicates with this rail by a rod which moves it forward and thereby shortens the stroke of the hammers and produces a softer tone.|$|R
5000|$|The Picatinny rail ( [...] or [...] ), or Pic rail for short, {{also known}} as a MIL-STD-1913 rail, or Standardization Agreement 2324 <b>rail,</b> is a <b>bracket</b> on some {{firearms}} that provides a standard mounting platform consisting of rails with multiple transverse slots similar in concept to the earlier commercial Weaver rail mount used to mount telescopic sights.|$|R
40|$|The {{internship}} {{was located}} at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Innovation Design Center (IDC), which is a facility where the JSC workforce can meet and conduct hands-on innovative design, fabrication, evaluation, and testing of ideas and concepts relevant to NASA's mission. The tasks of the internship included mechanical prototyping design and manufacturing projects in service {{of research and development}} as well as assisting the users of the IDC in completing their manufacturing projects. The first project was to manufacture hatch mechanisms for a team in the Systems Engineering and Project Advancement Program (SETMAP) hexacopter competition. These mechanisms were intended to improve the performance of the servomotors and offer an access point that would also seal to prevent cross-contamination. I also assisted other teams as they were constructing and modifying their hexacopters. The success of this competition demonstrated a proof of concept for aerial reconnaissance and sample return to be potentially used in future NASA missions. I also worked with Dr. Kumar Krishen to prototype an improved thermos and a novel, portable solar array. Computer-aided design (CAD) software was used to model the parts for both of these projects. Then, 3 D printing as well as conventional techniques were used to produce the parts. These prototypes were then subjected to trials to determine the success of the designs. The solar array is intended to work in a cluster that is easy to set up and take down and doesn't require powered servomechanisms. It could be used terrestrially in areas not serviced by power grids. Both projects improve planetary exploration capabilities to future astronauts. Other projects included manufacturing custom <b>rail</b> <b>brackets</b> for EG- 2, assisting engineers working on underwater instrument and tool cases for the NEEMO project, and helping to create mock-up parts for Space Center Houston. The use of the IDC enabled efficient completion of these projects at significantly reduced cost. I acquired and improved manufacturing and prototyping skills during my tour including learning about a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) program called Creo (Creo Parametric; design software), gaining valuable conventional machining experience with lathes, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling machines and various other tools, and improving my engineering project communication and collaboration skills. The internship also allowed me to better understand operations at NASA. I plan to work in the aerospace industry or do academic research benefitting space science and exploration, and this internship experience will enable me to have insight into manufacturing processes for research and development...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In the {{construction}} of a cab-over-engine semi tractor, Freightliner Corporation of Portland, Oregon uses brackets to make the connection between the front leaf spring mounts, bumper, front hinges for the tilt-cab and the longitudinal frame <b>rails.</b> One <b>bracket</b> is used on each side. The integrity of these brackets is essential to the safe operation of the truck. This investigation was undertaken to make an estimate of the stress levels in some special brackets during the various possible load combinations which simulate actual operation. This estimate will be used to justify further more precise measurements of the stresses in the brackets. The geometry of the brackets was too complex to use analytical methods and, also, the prototypes were not available. Quarter scale photoelastic models were built from laminated sheets of epoxy. This kind of model enables one to detect flat plate bending as well as in-plane tension and compression stresses with a reflection polariscope. After the critical load combination was determined from these models, a second model was prepared and stress frozen to determine the magnitude and location of the maximum stress occurring in the bracket. Dimensional analysis was used to relate the model properties to the prototype. The results of this investigation indicated that stress levels higher than the yield strength of the material would occur in the right-hand bracket when braking during a right turn. Strain gages should be applied at the point of maximum stress so that the actual stress in the bracket can be measured for this particular loading condition...|$|R
