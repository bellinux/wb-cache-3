25|$|By 1921, Charles Nelson Co. {{was one of}} {{the largest}} lumber trading {{companies}} in United States. However, unlike most of its competitors, it didn't get rid of its sailing vessels prior to World War I. In the conditions of the changed economy, the company transferred its lumber schooners from transpacific lumber trade to West Coast lumber trade, to delivering lumber from the Pacific Northwest to San Francisco. Moreover, the schooners were no longer sailing this route; instead, they were tugged along the coast by a steam schooner also loaded with lumber or by a tug. This approach permitted the operation of schooners with a minimal crew of less experienced sailors, thus saving money on wages and keeping the transport <b>rates</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

However, under the new 1745 Establishment the responsibility for preparing designs ("draughts") for all ships was given to the Surveyor of the Navy, with the Master Shipwrights now responsible only for constructing ships to those common Surveyor's designs for each type of vessel.|$|E
25|$|Vale's {{decision}} of constructing {{a fleet of}} 400,000-ton ore carriers was widely criticized by other shipping companies. The new Valemax ships, expected to cut the company's transportation costs by 20–25%, were blamed for driving down the freight rates for the entire industry, swelling the already oversupplied bulk transportation market and stalling {{the recovery of the}} shipping business after the financial crisis. The freight <b>rates,</b> <b>down</b> 80% from 2008, were expected to drop further down to the levels of 1977. According to the chief executive of BIMCO, the Valemax vessels could displace up to 168 150,000–180,000-ton capesize bulk carriers, around 15% of the existing fleet, from the long haul voyages and force them to less profitable shorter routes. Vale responded to the criticism by stating that the company aims to permanently cut the costs of Atlantic-Pacific dry bulk shipping to make Brazilian ore more competitive against iron ore produced in Australia, which is closer to major customers in Asia.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1940s the {{demography}} of {{the neighborhood}} has changed markedly several times: {{the addition of the}} large labor-backed Stuyvesant Town–Peter Cooper Village after World War II at the northern end added a lower-middle to middle-class element to the area, which contributed to the eventual gentrification of the area in the 21st century; the construction of large government housing projects south and east of those and the growing Latino population transformed a large swath {{of the neighborhood}} into a Latin one until the late 1990s, when low rents outweighed high crime rates and large numbers of artists and students moved to the area. Manhattan's growing Chinatown then expanded into the southern portions of the Lower East Side, but Hispanics are still concentrated in Alphabet City. With crime <b>rates</b> <b>down,</b> the area surrounding Alphabet City, the East Village, and the Lower East Side, is quickly becoming gentrified; the borders of the Lower East Side differ from its historical ones in that Houston Street is now considered the northern edge, and the area north of that between Houston Street and 14th Street is considered Alphabet City. But, because the Alphabet City term is largely a relic of a high-crime era, English-speaking residents refer to Alphabet City as part of the East Village, while Spanish-speaking residents continue to refer to Alphabet City as Loisaida.|$|E
25|$|In an {{open letter}} to the President, the Congress, and the American people, eighty economists, {{including}} Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith, stated that the FairTax would boost the United States economy. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research and Americans For Fair Taxation, GDP would increase almost 10.5% in the year after the FairTax goes into effect. Real investments could increase by as much as 76% initially and remain 15% above present levels. In addition, the incentive to work would increase by as much as 20%, the economy’s capital stock would increase by 42%, labor supply by 4%, output by 12%, and real wage rate by 8%. A study in 2007 by the Beacon Hill Institute of Suffolk University stated that within five years real GDP would increase 10.7% over the current system, domestic investment by 86.3%, capital stock by 9.3%, employment by 9.9%, real wages by 10.2%, and consumption by 1.8%. Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University finds that the shift to the FairTax would raise marginal labor productivity and real wages {{over the course of the}} century by 18.9% and long-run output by 10.6%. Further, studies of the FairTax at Boston University and Rice University suggests the FairTax will bring long-term interest <b>rates</b> <b>down</b> by as much as one third. As falling tax compliance costs lower production costs, exports would increase by 26% initially and remain more than 13% above present levels. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University’s Economics Department, revenues to Social Security and Medicare would double as the size of the economy doubles within 15 years after passage of the FairTax. Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of supply-side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money.|$|E

[...] Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics projected the economy as measured by GDP would be 2.4% higher {{in the first year}} and 11.3% higher by the 10th year than it would otherwise be. [...] Economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Sabine Jokisch reported the incentive to work and save would increase; by 2030, the economy's capital stock would increase by 43.7% over the current system, output by 9.4%, and real wages by 11.5%. Economist John Golob estimates a consumption tax, like the FairTax, would bring long-term interest <b>rates</b> <b>down</b> by 25–35%.

The first step towards this target was successfully taken on 3 October 2012, when the country managed to regain partial market access by selling a bond series with 3-year maturity. Once Portugal regains complete market access, measured as the moment it successfully manage to sell a bond series with a full 10-year maturity, {{it is expected to}} benefit from interventions by the ECB, which announced readiness to implement extended support in the form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMTs), aiming to bring governmental interest <b>rates</b> <b>down</b> to sustainable levels.

As of December 2012, it has been more than halved to only 7%.
