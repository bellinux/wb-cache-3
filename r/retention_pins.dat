40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the dentinal cra-zing formation and pull-out strength of con-ventional <b>retention</b> <b>pins</b> and modified ma-chinist's taps. Modified machinist's taps pro-duced less dentinal crazing in wet, fresh, and dried dentin than the conventional <b>retention</b> <b>pins.</b> Modified taps have sufficient pull-out strength to retain restorations on teeth with fresh dentin, in clinical situations. Dentinal crazing produced by retentive pins has been reported by MarkleyJ Dilts et al, 2 and Collard, Caputo, and Standlee. 3, 4 Some of these workers have suggested that tooth structure may be thereby weakened so that clinical failure of restorations may occur. 1, 2 All these studies, however, were based on data gathered using freshly extracted teeth, which have been reported to be less prone to cracking than are endodontically treated teeth. 5 Since retentive pins are frequently used during the restoration of these teeth the relative crazing frequency of such treatment should be examined. Chan and Svare 6 found that machinist's taps in fresh teeth produced less dentinal crazing than did the conventional <b>retention</b> <b>pins.</b> This sort of work, however, was not done using embrittled dentin such as that found in endodontically treated teeth. A further clinical question existed with regard to whether the modified tap could provide sufficient pull-out strength to be clinically useful. Thus, this study was undertaken to investigate the retentive strength of the modified machinist's taps that of <b>retention</b> <b>pins,</b> and the dentinal crazing propensity of This stsdy was supported by the General Researc...|$|E

It is shown {{that there is a}} trade-off between the performances of both types of pins. For the same range of retention force, the cantilever pin, with a smaller stiffness, is more forgiving and gives a broader range of deflection. The dynamic retention pin is shown to be more reliable with time and replacement frequency, since it exhibits less plastic deformation for the same range of retention force...|$|E

40|$|Gas turbine {{operating}} temperatures {{are projected to}} continue to increase and this leads to drawing more cooling air to keep the metals below their operational temperatures. This cooling air is chargeable as it has gone through several stages of compressor work. In this paper a surrogate based design optimization approach is used to reduce cooling mass flow on combustor tiles to attain pre-defined maximum metal surface temperatures dictated by different service life requirements. A series of Kriging based surrogate models are constructed using an efficient GPU based particle swarm algorithm. Various mechanical and manufacturing constraints such as hole ligament size, encroachment of holes onto other features like side rails, pedestals, dilution ports and <b>retention</b> <b>pins</b> etc. are built into the models and these models are trained using a number of high fidelity simulations. Furthermore these simulations employ the proprietary Rolls-Royce FEA package SCO 3 to run thermal analysis predicting surface heat transfer coefficients, fluid temperatures and finally metal surface temperatures. These temperature predictions are compared against the pre-defined surface temperature limits for a given service life and fed back to the surrogate model to run for new hole configuration. This way the loop continues until an optimized hole configuration is attained. Results demonstrate the potential of this optimization technique to improve the life of combustor tile by reducing tile temperature and also {{to reduce the amount}} of cooling air required. <br/...|$|E

40|$|A low-loaded {{constructed}} wetland {{was investigated}} {{with respect to}} phosphorus retention. Since the main long-term phosphorus retention mechanism is sedimentation and sediment accretion, the study focused on these processes. The {{purpose of the study}} was 1) to investigate how the calculated value of phosphorus <b>retention</b> (<b>Pin</b> – Pout), corresponded with the measured amount of phosphorus in the sediment, 2) to find out where in the wetland the phosphorus had accumulated, and in what form it was retained, and 3) to investigate the role of vegetation. The calculated value was 12 kg ha- 1 and the measured value was 104 kg ha- 1, which indicated the importance of internal phosphorus circulation, where plants probably take phosphorus from the underlying clay. Hence, vegetation could possibly increase the total phosphorus content in the wetland. The composition of phosphorus in the sediment was analysed using sequential fractionation. The dominating form of phosphorus in the sediment was iron-bound phosphorus (29 %). In total, 48 % of the phosphorus was stable, i. e. tightly bound in the sediment, and 35 % was relatively stable. The bioavailable fraction, which could cause eutrophication in downstream waters, was 17 % of the total phosphorus content, or 41 kg ha- 1. The amount of total phosphorus was significantly higher near the inlet, compared to the outlet, which is explained by rapid sedimentation of particulate phosphorus entering the wetland. The phosphorus amount near the inlet represented 80 % of the total phosphorus load – which indicates the importance of internal circulation of phosphorus, both biological and geochemical...|$|R
40|$|During system {{level testing}} {{intermittent}} and permanent open circuit failures of mated, crimp removable, electrical contact pairs were experienced. The {{root cause of}} the failures {{was determined to be}} low (but not zero) contact forces applied by the socket contact tines against the engaging pin. The low contact force reduces the effectiveness of the wiping action of the socket tines against the pin. The observed failure mode may be produced when insufficient wiping during mate, demate and small relative movement in use allows for the accumulation of debris or insulating films that electrically separate the contact pair. The investigation identified at least three manufacturing process control problems associated with the socket contacts that enabled shipment of contacts susceptible to developing low contact forces: (1) Improper heat treatment of the socket tines resulting in plastic rather than elastic behavior; (2) Overly thinned socket tines at their base resulting in reduced <b>pin</b> <b>retention</b> forces; (3) insufficient screening tests to identify parts susceptible to the aforementioned failure mechanisms. The results from an extensive screening program of socket contacts utilizing the industry standard contact separation force test procedures are described herein. The investigation shows this method to be capable of identifying initially weak sockets. However, sockets whose contact retention forces may degrade during use may not be screened out by <b>pin</b> <b>retention</b> testing alone. Further investigations are required to correlate low contact retention forces with increased electrical contact resistance in the presence of insulating films that may accumulate in the use environment...|$|R
40|$|A double <b>retention</b> {{redundant}} pull <b>pin</b> {{release system}} is disclosed. The system responds {{to a single}} pull during an intentional release operation. A spiral threaded main pin is seated in a mating bore in a housing, which main pin has a flange fastened thereon at {{the part of the}} main pin which is exterior to the housing. Accidental release tends to rotate the main pin. A secondary pin passes through a slightly oversized opening in the flange and is seated in a second bore in the housing. The pins counteract against one another to prevent accidential release. A frictional lock is shared between the main and secondary pins to enhance further locking of the system. The secondary pin, in response to a first pull, is fully retracted from its bore and flange hole. Thereafter the pull causes the main pin to rotate free of the housing to release, for example, a parachute mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This {{laboratory}} study incorporated {{the use of}} three different sized twist drills to prepare pinholes in extracted upper molar teeth. The diameter of each pinhole was measured. A pre-measured self-threading pin was then placed in each pinhole. The amount of strain created during pin placement (placement strain), the temperature rise during pin placement, the amount of strain remaining (residual strain) within the tooth structure after pin placement and the removal force (retention) were recorded for each pin. The results showed that, during the placement of a self-threading dentine pin, {{the difference between the}} pincore diameter and the pinhole diameter was an important parameter. This difference determined the amount of strain created during pin placement, the temperature rise during pin placement, the amount of strain remaining within the tooth structure after pin placement and the <b>retention</b> of the <b>pin.</b> The placement strain, temperature rise, residual strain and retention were all greater when the pin core diameter exceeded the pin hole diameter...|$|R
40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact <b>pin</b> <b>retention</b> forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 17 - 28 The two subject blowers {{operate in}} {{parallel}} to circulate wet chlorine gas. Both units had large synchronous vibrations {{that led to}} multiple bearing failures. After simple rotordynamic studies failed to identify the problem, a comprehensive model that accounted for both the motor and blower was successful at identifying the problem as high sensitivity to unbalance loads due to an extremely lightly-loaded (less than one pound) condition at the blower?s inboard bearing (refer to Gutzwiller and Corbo, 2011). Based {{on the results of}} the rotordynamic analysis, two changes were made to both units. The couplings were changed from disk to gear couplings, and the blower?s bearings were changed from plain cylindrical to tilting-pad designs. After implementing these changes, unit ?A? ran smoothly for a period of six weeks, in accordance with the predictions of the rotordynamic analysis, and it appeared to all that the problem was completely solved. However, when the ?B? blower was then started up the two machines then commenced a three month period of operation in which each suffered from intermittent periods of high synchronous vibrations. During this time, the following behavior traits, which {{can only be described as}} bizarre, were observed: 1. 	After a smooth startup, vibration increased to a high level after about one week. 2. 	The transition from low vibrations to high vibrations was almost instantaneous. Additionally, this transition was always accompanied by an axial motion of the blower rotor away from the active thrust bearing. 3. 	The units appeared to be more likely to suffer high vibrations when both were running simultaneously. 4. 	Starting one machine might result in increased vibrations on the other, and shutting down a machine might lower vibrations on the other. 5. 	Someone observed that during a rainstorm the vibration levels decreased. (Note: the blowers are located outside.) Spraying water on the bearings sometimes (but not always) had a similar effect. A task force of experts was then commissioned and an extensive troubleshooting effort commenced. Some of the potential root causes that were hypothesized included blower surging, starvation of the tilting-pad bearings, thermally-induced misalignment, insufficient blower thrust, acoustic resonance, axial vibration, seal rubbing, and Morton effects. After an extensive troubleshooting effort that included more rotordynamic analysis, bearing flow analysis, blower thrust analysis, and extensive studying of orbit plots, spectrum plots, and vibration and temperature histories, the task force concluded that the most likely cause was rubbing at the blower?s carbon ring seal. Accordingly, the seal was disassembled and its locating pins were found to have come loose and generated a rub. Design changes were then implemented to provide better <b>retention</b> for the <b>pins.</b> The units were then restarted and it was verified that the modifications had finally eliminated the vibration problems. This paper shows how the combination of rotordynamic analysis and troubleshooting skills was employed to identify and generate corrective actions for two independent causes of high synchronous vibrations...|$|R
