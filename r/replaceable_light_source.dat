The corresponding α’s and β’s for the <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> (see Section 3) are listed below the images. Notice the near {{field and the}} far field effects of the <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> In most rendering systems, area <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> are decomposed into many point <b>light</b> <b>sources,</b> which requires heavy computation to pro-duce realistic results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to approximate an area <b>light</b> <b>source</b> with a point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> for each component of the shading model. The position and intensity of the point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> {{is dependent on the}} position and orientation of scene points. Thus the scene is shaded using on-the-fly point <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> The key contribution of our work is that we are able to shade with area <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> of arbitrary shape and arbitrary inten-sity distribution in real time and the shading model can be generic. And the computation cost is independent of the complexity of the area <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> Experimental results show that our approach cre-ates results comparable to the ground truth. Our approach could be extended to other kinds of local <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> such as curved <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and volume <b>light</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} relighting with sparsely sampled {{reflectance}} fields. We present a technique that approximates the correct result of relighting from intermediate <b>light</b> <b>source</b> positions. The acquisition of reflectance fields is a time consuming process, and typically the sampling resolution in the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> positions is rather limited. As a consequence, smoothly moving highlights and shadows due to relighting with a moving <b>light</b> <b>source</b> are hard to generate. Using <b>light</b> <b>source</b> interpolation, densely sampled reflectance fields can be simulated, enabling relighting with area <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and smooth animation of highlights and shadows.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for estimating <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> from a single image of a scene that is illuminated by near point <b>light</b> <b>sources,</b> directional <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and ambi-ent <b>light.</b> We propose to employ a pair of reference spheres as light probes and introduce the difference sphere that we acquire by differencing the intensities of two image regions of the reference spheres. Since the effect by directional <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and ambient <b>light</b> is eliminated by differencing, the key advantage of considering the difference sphere is that it enables us to estimate near point <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> including their radiance, which {{has been difficult to}} achieve in previ-ous efforts where only distant directional <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> were assumed. We also show that analysis of gray level contours on spherical surfaces facilitates separate identification of multiple combined <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and is well suited to the dif-ference sphere.

40|$|Most {{illuminant}} estimation algorithms {{work with}} the assumption of one specific type of the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> (e. g. point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> or directional <b>light</b> <b>source).</b> This assumption brings up two main limitations which significantly restrict {{the applicability of the}} algorithms: First, the knowledge about the type of the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> presented in the scene is needed a priori; second, it can not handle complex scenes where multiple different types of <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> co-exist. To overcome these limitations, we remove the assumption about the source type and develop a general <b>light</b> <b>source</b> model for all different types of <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> Based on this general <b>light</b> <b>source</b> model, we propose a unified framework to estimate multiple illuminants of different types. Within the framework, we use an experiment setup where a calibration sphere with a specular surface is utilized to probe the scene illuminants and a novel ray tracing and matching algorithm is devised to estimate the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> parameters. Experiment results demonstrate the accuracy of our method on a variety of real images. ...|$|R

30|$|Until now, lots of {{research}} have been devoted towards {{the development of}} Si-based <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> that could enable the integration of photonics with Si microelectronics[1 – 3]. Si-based <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> could reduce the fabrication cost because their compatibility with a conventional complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is {{better than any other}} <b>light</b> <b>source</b> such as conventional GaAs- and GaN-based light emitters. Despite a lot of efforts for the realization of Si-based <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> with high efficiency, luminescence efficiency from Si-based <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> is still very low due to an indirect bandgap nature of the bulk Si[4, 5].
