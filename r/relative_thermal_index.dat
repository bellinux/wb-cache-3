40|$|Producers and {{researchers}} {{are interested in}} the energy utilization of animals involved in the meat production industry. Energy utilization of an animal is closely related to its ability to adapt to its environment. Assessing an animal 2 ̆ 7 s response to its environment has proven difficult due to the complex interplay of the environment and the animal. This report develops a measure of a dynamic overall heat transfer coefficient, or thermal index, based upon a noninvasive tympanic temperature measurement. The <b>relative</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> for swine was objectively determined from analysis of the transient response of tympanic temperature of six crossbred barrows exposed to three distinct thermal environments. The three environments (treatments) compared in a repeated Latin square design with subsampling were: 28 ∘C with a low air speed; 28 ∘C with a high air speed; and 18 ∘C with low air speed. ^ The transient thermodynamic response of each pig was determined by analysis of the tympanic temperature spike associated with a meal event. Each suitable temperature spike was processed by a statistical exponential curve fitting algorithm generating the thermal index, K. Thermal index values occurred as subsamples within the Latin square design since multiple meal events were allowed for each treatment. ^ Analysis of thermal index means from the repeated Latin square showed that an air temperature of 28 ∘C with low wind speed was a significantly different (P = 0. 0205) thermal environment compared to the other two treatments. This result supported a preliminary analysis of the projected impact of the prescribed thermal environments based on steady state assumptions. The thermal index {{has been shown to be}} a measure of the overall heat transfer coefficient which relates the pig 2 ̆ 7 s rate of heat loss to its thermal environment by evaluation of the dynamics of the tympanic temperature record. ^ The objectively determined thermal index provides a noninvasive integrated response of a pig to its thermal environment. Researchers can use this biologically based measure to link thermal conditions to performance in optimizing swine production. ...|$|E

The {{results of the present}} study showed that the highest and lowest seed yield was obtained from Hido cultivar at June 1 st planting date and NS 504 cultivar at July 15 th, respectively. Additionally, among the measured indices, crop heat unit (CHU), heat use efficiency (HUE) and <b>relative</b> <b>thermal</b> disparity (RTD) <b>indices</b> were able to estimate heat requirement of maize cultivars accurately in different sowing dates and different phenological stages. These indices provided stable trends and reasonable estimates of the thermal requirements of maize hybrids cultivated on early and delayed sowing dates and hence, they had relative superiority over the other indicators such as growing degree days (GDD), helio-thermal unit (HTU) and the pheno-thermal index (PTI). RTD and CHU had the lowest coefficients of variance which it showed that these indices have enough accuracy to estimate heat requirement of maize hybrids in different planting dates...|$|R

One of the environment stress source is the unfulfilment of thermal comfort. The rapid development of residential at Denpasar City cause the variation on building density that are low, medium, high, and very high density classifications. Residential configuration of each classification gives very strong influence to status of urban’s thermal comfort. Purpose of the research is to understand the <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> profile PET, to identify the status of thermal comfort and to analyze the influence of Tmrt to <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> PET of residential atmosphere environment at West Denpasar Sub-district area. The research was performed at residential atmosphere environment of West Denpasar Sub-district area by using RayMan model simulation to obtain <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> profile PET. Sampling technique used the stratified random sampling method with data diversity that is used based on the buildings density. The <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> profile PET of residential of low density classification is the lowest <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> profile PET compared to the other three classifications, which are the medium, high, and very high density. One hundred percent of status of thermal comfort of residential atmosphere environment is in hot thermal stress and based on average <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> PET is on physiological stress level of “Strong heat stress”.

40|$|Heat stress {{impaired}} productive, reproductive {{and animal}} behaviour. Examination of milk production loss due to heat stress was mainly evaluated in USA and few tropical countries using the temperature humidity index (THI 1) {{developed in the}} 1950 ’s. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of six new environmental stress indices on production traits in a temperate region. These indices include solar radiation and wind speed in addition to the temperature and humidity only defining THI 1. For that purpose, 530820 milk, fat, protein, and somatic cell count first-lactation test-day records (TD) collected between 2000 and 2011 in Luxembourg were used. TD records were merged with meteorological data from 14 public weather stations. Each TD was assigned to the average daily <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> of the 3 days before. Firstly, broken-line regression models were applied to identify the threshold of heat stress (THR) for each of the <b>thermal</b> <b>indices.</b> The decline of daily production of the different traits above THR point was assessed by mixed linear models including regression on unit of each of the <b>thermal</b> <b>index.</b> Estimates of THR were specific to each <b>thermal</b> <b>index</b> and trait. Significant decrease of milk, fat and protein yields above THR was observed for all studied thermal predictors. Whereas, an increase of the somatic cell score was observed above the specific THR point. THR estimates for THI 1 and THI 6 were of 68 and 80 and 62 and 78 for milk and protein yields respectively. Respective rate of decline per unit were of 0. 243 and 0. 188 kg and 0. 0045 and 0. 0051 kg respectively. Results from this phenotypic analysis show that evaluating heat tolerance based on bio-meteorological indicators is promising and phenotypic and genetic implications should be investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The crack {{propagation}} in solder joints is detected {{by measuring the}} <b>relative</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance using transient thermal analysis. The method can be applied on high power devices which have to dissipate {{a significant amount of}} thermal load through the solder joint. The thermal load in the device is switched and the forward voltage of the junction is measured in time resolved modality. As published earlier, to obtain the <b>relative</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance the dissipated power of the device and the proportional factor (k-factor) between temperature and forward voltage are not required when the time resolved forward voltage curves are normalized [1]. Aim of the research was to investigate the concept and the sensitivity of the measuring method using high power ceramic LED packages. For prove of sensitivity, two batches of high power LEDs were soldered on PCBs, i. e. aluminum insulated metal boards (Al-IMS) : one batch with SAC 305 and the other one with a SAC+ (Innolot) solder. The test modules were exposed to typical temperature cycles of - 40 °C / + 125 °C as required for automotive applications. With standard test methods differences in reliability, i. e. thermo mechanical fatigue, of the two solders were very difficult to detect for the module design under these test conditions [2]. First, we investigated the <b>relative</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance after defined number of cycles at room temperature. To define a realistic failure criterion for calculation of the cumulative failure probability, we have set-up a finite element model and simulated the transient temperature curves. The increase of measured <b>relative</b> <b>thermal</b> resistance is critically compared and calibrated with transient finite element simulations. The Weibull curves were determined based on the failure criteria describing a 70 % cracked solder area [...] Then, after resolving {{a significant difference in the}} increase of thermal resistance of the two solders, an In-Situ test system was set up and measurements were performed, i. e. a set of samples was measured in the temperature chamber under hot and cold condition...|$|R
