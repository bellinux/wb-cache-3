40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rule-based legal de-cisonmaking system (LDS) that embodies {{the skills and}} knowledge of an expert in product liability law. The system is being used to study the effect of changes in legal doctrine on settlement stra-tegies and practices. LDS is implemented in ROSIE, a <b>rule-oriented</b> <b>language</b> designed to facilitate the development of large expert systems. The ROSIE language is briefly described and our approach to modeling legal expertise using a prototype version of LDS is presented. L...|$|E
40|$|The {{definition}} of an agent architecture at the knowledge level makes emphasis on the knowledge {{role played by the}} data interchanged between the agent components and makes explicit this data interchange this makes easier the reuse of these knowledge structures independently of the implementation This article defines a generic task model of an agent architecture and refines some of these tasks using the interference diagrams. Finally, a operationalisation of this conceptual model using the <b>rule-oriented</b> <b>language</b> Jess is shown. knowledge level...|$|E
40|$|The aim is {{to develop}} the {{software}} and information support of the operative diagnostics system (ODS) for NPP based on the diagnostic model of rule-oriented type. The procedure of choosing model as the most optimal one for conditions of the concrete problem has been formulated on base of {{the analysis of the}} expert models; the <b>rule-oriented</b> <b>language</b> for representation of the diagnostic knowledges and software of the rule-oriented type ODS have been developed; the design of the host environment for automation in the development of NPP ODS has been proposed. The majority of the results is new. The proposed principles of constructing software and information support of ODS have been realized at creating ODS breadboard of the plant KTP- 6 by means of which the debugging of the algorithms for operative diagnostics was carried outAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The multi-paradigm {{language}} PROGRES is {{the first}} <b>rule-oriented</b> visual <b>language</b> which has a well-defined type concept and supports programming with graph rewriting systems. To some extent, it has the flavor of a visual database programming language with powerful pattern matching and replacing facilities as well as backtracking capabilities. Until now, it was mainly used for specifying and rapid prototyping of abstract data types in software engineering environments. An integrated set of language-specific tools supports intertwined editing, analyzing, browsing, and debugging of specifications as well as generating prototypes in C (Modula- 2) wit...|$|R
