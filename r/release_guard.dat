5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} first Gulf war (Operation Granby), the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) {{commissioned}} the LANDSET Report (officially entitled [...] "Equipment Performance (SA80) During Operation Granby (The Gulf War)"), into {{the effectiveness of the}} L85A1 IW and L86A1 LSW. This report criticised the acceptance of the weapon into service. Neither weapon had managed to pass the sand trials and both frequently jammed. The mechanism of both weapons needed to be well lubricated as the weapon became prone to seizure if fired [...] "dry", yet in sandy condition the lubricated weapon became unreliable due to the lubricant attracting sand into the moving parts. The LANDSET report identified in excess of 50 faults, most notably the magazine release catch, which could easily be caught on clothing and therefore accidentally release the magazine; the plastic safety plunger which became brittle in cold climates; and firing pins that were not up to repeated use, and prone to fracture if used in automatic fire mode. Although this report identified over 50 faults, and some of the rifle's problems were corrected as a result (e.g. the magazine <b>release</b> <b>guard</b> and trigger), these modifications addressed only seven of these issues and complaints over reliability in service continued.|$|E
40|$|Many {{distributed}} and multiprocessor real-time applications {{consist of}} pipelines of tasks that must complete before their end-to-end deadlines. Different schedulability analyses {{have been proposed}} for both Fixed Priority and Earliest Deadline First scheduling. All the schedulability analyses proposed so far assume that a global clock synchronization protocol is used to synchronize the deadlines of jobs allocated on different processors. This assumption may limit the applicability of EDF to such systems. In this paper, we propose the Distributed Deadline Synchronization Protocol (DDSP) for computing the absolute deadlines of jobs. The protocol is a non-trivial extension of the <b>Release</b> <b>Guard</b> Protocol proposed for fixed priority systems. DDSP {{does not require a}} global clock synchronization, yet existing schedulability analyses are valid for schedules generated by DDSP...|$|E

They sent Paul Artadi, Rafi Reavis, and 8th draft pick Chris Timberlake to Purefoods for Enrico Villanueva, Rich Alvarez, Paolo Bugia, and Celino Cruz.

Meanwhile, they <b>released</b> <b>guard</b> Macky Escalona, and forward J. R. Aquino to free-agency and waived center Homer Se. They also <b>released</b> <b>guard</b> Chris Pacana, who was later signed by the Sta. Lucia Realtors [...] and placed forward Junjun Cabatu to the practice player list. On other reports, Ginebra coach Jong Uichico confirmed that they signed Eric Menk to a one-year contract extension for the Kings.

40|$|Abstractâ€”With the {{emergence}} of wireless sensor networks, an enabling communication technology for distributed real-time systems, we face the critical challenge of meeting the end-to-end deadlines of real-time flows. This paper presents Real-time Flow Scheduling (RFS), a novel conflict-free real-time transmission scheduling approach for periodic real-time flows in wireless sensor networks. In contrast to existing transmission scheduling algorithms that ignore interference between transmissions or prevent spatial reuse within the same channel, RFS supports spatial reuse through a novel interference-aware transmission scheduling. While recent work on conflict-free transmission scheduling focused on specialized communication patterns such as queries and converge cast, RFS is designed for peer-to-peer real-time flows with arbitrary inter-flow interference. Moreover, RFS has three salient that make it particularly suitable for real-time systems: First, RFS includes a real-time schedulability analysis that accounts for interference between real-time flows. Second, RFS improves reliability by incorporating retransmissions in a flexible scheduling scheme. Finally, RFS enhances scalability by dividing the network into neighborhoods and provides real-time performance for flows crossing multiple neighborhoods through a novel application of the <b>Release</b> <b>Guard</b> protocol. RFS was evaluated through simulations based on the traces collected from an indoor wireless sensor network testbed. Compared to a traditional TDMA protocol, RFS reduces flow latencies by up to 2. 5 times, while improving the real-time capacity {{by as much as}} 3. 9 times. I...|$|E

40|$|No one {{middleware}} communication model completely {{solves the}} problem of ensuring schedulability in every DRE system. Furthermore, {{there have been few}} studies to date of the trade-offs between alternative middleware communication models under different application scenarios. This paper makes three contributions to {{the state of the art}} in middleware for distributed real-time and embedded systems. First, it describes what we believe is the first example of integrating <b>release</b> <b>guards</b> directly with CORBA distributable threads to ensure appropriate release times for sub-tasks along an end-to-end computation. Second, it presents empirical results in which <b>release</b> <b>guards</b> improve schedulability of distributable threads compared to a greedy protocol in which arriving tasks simply begin to run as soon as they can. Third, we offer the first empirical comparisons of the distributable thread and event channel models under three different communication scenarios and then using a randomized workload...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the primary defense of his opponent, his guard, and attain a more dominant position, such as side mount, full mount, or knee on stomach a practitioner must pass the guard. There are several ways of doing so; many involve pain compliance whereby the practitioner persuades the opponent to <b>release</b> his <b>guard</b> through an abrasive action. Examples {{of this type of}} action would be digging the practitioner's forearms into the inner thigh of the opponent, standing and attempting a can opener neck crank, {{or in the case of}} a mixed martial arts setting, to simply strike the opponent until the <b>guard</b> is <b>released.</b> Passing the <b>guard</b> however has perils of its own, as it has a tendency to leave the practitioner particularly vulnerable to counterattack in the form of sweeps and submissions.|$|R

5000|$|Smoke is the beekeeper's third line of defense. Most beekeepers use a [...] "smoker"â€”a device {{designed}} to generate {{smoke from the}} incomplete combustion of various fuels.
