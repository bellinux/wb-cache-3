5|$|The <b>running</b> <b>order</b> for the semi-finals was {{released}} on 28 March 2013. The <b>running</b> <b>order</b> for the final was determined on 17 May 2013. An additional allocation draw occurred for the final with each finalist nation drawing to perform either in {{the first or second}} half of the final. The allocation draw for qualifying countries from the semi-finals occurred during the semi-final winners' press conferences following each semi-final, while the allocation draw for the Big Five countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) occurred during their first individual press conferences on 15 May 2013. As the host country, the <b>running</b> <b>order</b> position for Sweden in the final was exclusively determined by a draw during the heads of delegation meeting on 18 March 2013. Sweden was drawn to perform 16th in the final.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw that}} {{determined}} the semi-final <b>running</b> <b>order</b> {{was held on}} 25 January 2012 at the Buta Palace. The participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon how those countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} years, the <b>running</b> <b>order</b> was {{not decided}} by the drawing of lots, but instead by the producers, {{with the aim of}} making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out, preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out. The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|A few {{copies of}} the {{original}} pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the Freewheelin album include versions with a different <b>running</b> <b>order</b> of the tracks on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed the tracks in the wrong order. The original pressing of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America, with one copy having sold for $35,000.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Townshend and {{longtime}} Who engineer Bob Pridden remixed the album, {{resulting in a}} deluxe 5-disc box set. Unlike earlier reissues, this set contains two discs of demos, including some songs that were dropped from the final <b>running</b> <b>order</b> of the album, and a selection of songs in 5.1 surround sound. The box set came with a 100-page book including an essay by Townshend about the album sessions, with photos. In 2014, the album was released on Blu-ray Audio featuring a brand-new remix of the entire album by Townshend and Pridden in 5.1 surround sound as well the 2011 Deluxe Edition stereo remix and the original 1973 stereo LP mix.|$|E

Herbert spun while battling for 13th position with Villeneuve. Diniz retired from the race when his engine failed on lap 63. Herbert came under pressure from Verstappen on lap 67 and suffered his second spin, losing the position to Verstappen. Herbert retired on lap 69 {{as the result of}} gearbox problems. Mazzacane pulled off the track on lap 70 and retired because of an engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second semi-final, a winner's press conference was held for the ten {{qualifying}} countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists {{took part in a}} draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Austria was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the <b>running</b> <b>order</b> of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11, following the entry from Greece and before the entry from Germany. On the day of the grand final, Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition, placed only behind the entry from Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{season was}} preceded by three test {{sessions}}; one at Jerez de la Frontera and two in Barcelona. These sessions gave the teams and drivers the opportunity to familiarise themselves with their cars, though the teams downplayed the accuracy of testing times as being representative of the <b>running</b> <b>order</b> for the season. At the second test in Barcelona, Lotus F1 discovered a critical fault in the build of their chassis that forced them to miss four days of running, while both HRT and Marussia were unable to complete any mileage with their 2012 cars after both the HRT F112 and Marussia MR01 failed their crash tests, though both teams were able to complete shakedowns of their cars.|$|E
5|$|The Wheatcroft Collection, Leicestershire, UK. A private collector, Kevin Wheatcroft, {{is about}} to start a restoration/rebuild of a {{complete}} Tiger II.

As the race resumed behind the safety car, both Ferrari drivers were running on the super-soft tyre compound, with both Mercedes now {{equipped}} with mediums, which were set to last {{for the rest of}} the race. The <b>running</b> <b>order</b> at the restart was: Vettel, Rosberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Hamilton, Massa, Grosjean, Bottas. Grosjean in ninth was the only driver who had not made a pit stop before the red flag was shown, which allowed him to save one pit stop and change his tyres during the break.|$|E

5|$|Coletti, Leal, Dillmann, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon, Binder, Giovesi, Haryanto, Rosenzweig and Abt {{were all}} {{trapped in the}} {{blockade}} {{with varying degrees of}} car damage. Nasr was near Bird and Ceccon and managed to avoid the collision between Leal and Palmer. Drivers ran back to their cars and remonstrated with marshals to enable them to take the restart. A forty-minute delay was necessitated to allow the track to be cleaned before the race could be restarted. Nine drivers had enough damage to warrant their retirement from the race: Cecotto, Leimer, Palmer, Leal, Frijns, Ericsson, Rossi, Berthon and Giovesi. The <b>running</b> <b>order</b> at the restart was determined by the order of the drivers that went through the first sector with the cars that did not enter being put in their starting position. This meant Evans led the field behind the safety car followed by Bird, Ceccon, Nasr and Calado. The safety car was withdrawn at the end of lap two and racing resumed with Evans leading Bird. Both drivers opened up a two-second advantage over Ceccon, Nasr, Calado and Richelmi. Although Evans had switched to the supersoft tyres during the stoppage Bird set consecutive fastest laps of the race on the soft tyres.|$|E
5|$|The race ended early when {{a second}} red flag was waved on lap 46, and its results {{were taken from}} the <b>running</b> <b>order</b> at the end of lap 44. This gave Hamilton the victory, with {{teammate}} Rosberg in second. Vettel took third, ahead of his Red Bull teammate Ricciardo. Button finished fifth, ahead of Massa and Bottas in sixth and seventh. Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kvyat, Räikkönen and Gutiérrez filled the next three positions (one lap behind the race winner), with Magnussen, Grosjean, Maldonado, Ericcson, Chilton and Kobayashi the last of the classified finishers who were not involved in any incident. Bianchi and Sutil were classified in 20th and 21st, despite their accidents. There were three lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Rosberg's total of 26 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Hamilton led two different times, for a total of 18 laps. Hamilton's victory was his eighth of the season, his first at Suzuka, and the 30th of his Formula One career.|$|E
5|$|Vandoorne {{remained}} with his intended strategy {{and led the}} field back up to speed at the lap-nine restart, ahead of Haryanto and Leal. He fended off an attempted overtake by Haryanto heading into the first corner, while Leal fell to fifth after he was passed by Matsushita and Visoiu. While in traffic, Lynn attempted to pass Rossi heading into the first turn, but made contact with the rear-end {{of his car and}} sustained front wing damage. Rossi pushed hard and moved ahead of Amberg by the twelfth lap. He caught up to Stanaway and quickly overtook him, and passed Berthon with the use of DRS two laps later. Rossi made further use of the system to get ahead of de Jong and Markelov. It allowed him to build a large gap to Lynn who was struggling. Rossi overtook Leal to move into fifth on lap 15, and the drivers who were running {{in the middle of the}} field made their mandatory tyre pit stops. Evans overtook Lynn driving into turn one on the 18th lap. Lynn reported that his car had tyre degradation problems and dropped down the <b>running</b> <b>order,</b> while cars who conserved their tyres took advantage.|$|E

5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The <b>running</b> <b>order</b> was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E
