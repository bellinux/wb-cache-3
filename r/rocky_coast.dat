However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the <b>rocky</b> <b>coast</b> of 'the Hollows' of Euboea.

5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the <b>rocky</b> <b>coast</b> between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E

40|$|The marine midge Clunio marinus (Chironomidae, Diptera) is {{characterized}} by a one-dimensional distribution along the European Atlantic coast, where its lunar and circadian emergence rhythms are genetically adapted to the local tidal regimes, resulting in a series of ‘temporal races’. Clunio marinus is restricted to <b>rocky</b> <b>coasts</b> and thus the temporal races occur in different rocky patches. We studied 10 populations of Clunio marinus from five different regions, spanning the major <b>rocky</b> mainland <b>coasts</b> from Spain to Norway, using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), microsatellites and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences. Star-like patterns of COI haplotypes within regions indicate postglacial colonization. A high degree of shared polymorphisms in AFLP markers suggests colonization from a single source, implying postglacial evolution of timing adaptations in relation to the local tidal regime. In contrast, no COI haplotypes are shared among regions. We hypothesize that different levels of differentiation of nuclear vs. mitochondrial markers in the source region were carried forward during postglacial expansion. Despite the recent origin of populations, all markers reveal distinct genetic differentiation between <b>rocky</b> <b>coasts</b> on a scale of 650 – 1150 km. Differentiation between <b>rocky</b> <b>coasts</b> is not correlated to timing adaptations, suggesting that geographic isolation is prevalent between <b>rocky</b> <b>coasts</b> and that this facilitated the evolution of local timing adaptations. At the same time there is little genetic differentiation within <b>rocky</b> <b>coasts</b> on a scale of 2 – 6 km; leaving open the possibility that within <b>rocky</b> <b>coasts</b> with large variation in tidal regimes, temporal adaptations evolved in the face of gene flow...|$|R

25|$|The Black Sea {{region has}} a steep, <b>rocky</b> <b>coast</b> with rivers that cascade through the gorges {{of the coastal}} ranges. A few larger rivers, those cutting back through the Pontic Mountains (Doğu Karadeniz Dağları), have tributaries that flow in broad, {{elevated}} basins.

The higher slopes facing northwest tend to be densely forested. Because of these natural conditions, the Black Sea coast historically has been isolated from Anatolia.|$|E
