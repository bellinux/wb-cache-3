We are less convinced by some of [author’s] specific arguments for incorporating literature in accounting education. [author] suggests that interdisciplinary links in education can foster marketable skills in graduates. Teaching literature, s/he argues, addresses the limitations of a technical, skills-based and vocational accounting education which, inter alia, seeks to reduce ambiguity. Literature, on the other hand, exposes students to ambiguity, and engaging with ambiguity encourages innovative, creative and original thinking. We believe that the suggestion that accounting aims to reduce ambiguity is simplistic. Ambiguity is intrinsic to (even) mainstream accounting. Accruals, provisions, asset lives and <b>realisable</b> <b>values,</b> as well as concepts such as materiality, fair value, fair presentation and substance over form are all ambiguous and require judgement. Students learn that different accounting policies and assumptions lead to dramatically different results. Contemporary accounting standards (arguably) involv...|$|R

40|$|The {{accounting}} procedures cannot be analyzed without a previous evaluation. Value is in general a very subjective issue, usually {{the result of}} a monetary evaluation made to a specific asset, group of assets or entities, or to some rendered services. Within the economic sciences, value comes from its very own deep history. In accounting, the concept of value had a late and fragile start. The term of value must not be misinterpreted as being the same thing with cost, even though value is frequently measured through costs. At the origin of the international accounting standards lays the framework for preparing, presenting and disclosing the financial statements. The framework stays as a reference matrix, as a standard of standards, as a constitution of financial accounting. According to the international framework, the financial statements use different evaluation basis: the hystorical cost, the current cost, the <b>realisable</b> (settlement) <b>value,</b> the present value (the present value of cash flows). Choosing the evaluation basis and the capital maintenance concept will eventually determine the accounting evaluation model used in preparing the financial statements of a company. The multitude of accounting evaluation models differentiate themselves one from another through various relevance and reliable degrees of accounting information and therefore, accountants (the prepares of financial statements) must try to equilibrate these two main qualitative characteristics of financial information...|$|R
50|$|IAS 10 {{requires}} an entity {{to adjust the}} amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect adjusting events after the reporting period. For instance, the settlement after the reporting period of a court case that confirms that the entity had a present obligation {{at the end of}} the reporting period. The bankruptcy of a customer who owed a debt to the entity at the balance sheet date usually confirms the loss of the debt. Sale of goods after the reporting period may also give evidence about their net <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> at the balance sheet date.|$|E
50|$|Net {{tangible}} assets (NTA) is {{the balance sheet}} value of the underlying properties in an A-REIT. It has long been regarded as an important measure of the true value of an A-REIT. A-REITs that trade above their NTA were {{for a long time}} considered to be overvalued. Conversely, if the A-REIT traded at a discount to its NTA, it was considered to be trading at a discount to the <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> of its underlying assets. As a result, in the past most A-REITs tended to trade at close to their NTA over the long-term average.|$|E
5000|$|IAS 2 {{requires}} that those assets {{that are considered}} inventory should be recorded at the lower of cost or net <b>realisable</b> <b>value.</b> Cost not only includes the purchase cost but also the conversion costs, which are the costs involved in bringing inventory to its present condition and location, such as direct labour. IAS 2 also allows for the capitalisation of variable overheads and fixed overheads {{so long as the}} fixed overheads are allocated on a systematic and consistent basis and in respect to usual output levels. Where output is lower than expected the resultant excessive overhead should be considered an expense and not capitalised but when output is abnormally high the fixed overhead allocated to each unit must be decreased so as not to overvalue the inventory.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Since its inauguration in 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) has been providing “free {{at the point of}} delivery” healthcare to all UK citizens. However, lately, there has been unprecedented concern over the capability of most NHS hospitals to demonstrate best value in providing non-clinical service to NHS Trust customers. Demonstrating value is particularly important because of the current multi-billion pound expenditure towards modernising the healthcare service estate. Consequently, the present research aimed to respond to the need to demonstrate satisfactory Whole Life Value (WLV) delivery of healthcare facilities. This has been achieved by focusing on the improvement of front-end processes of construction briefing and optioneering, where most value can be embedded before progressing onto design and construction. The study reviewed extant literature in an attempt to construct a theoretical linkage between the three concepts of WLV, strategic briefing and optioneering. In addition, through a qualitative empirical study comprising interviews, workshops observations and a detailed case study, the same concepts were investigated within the context of NHS healthcare facilities. Key findings indicated that having a specific project strategy is vital to WLV delivery; and that selecting the right project and design options is dependent on first agreeing and clarifying a clinical service model/plan with clinicians. It was also found that improved construction briefing and optioneering involves adequately defining a customised whole life solution informed through purposeful communication and engagement with relevant stakeholders in contributing towards issues that directly affect how they use a healthcare facility. Another key finding was that WLV of healthcare facilities is defined through a whole life solution which is directly linked to its usefulness or utility <b>value</b> <b>realisable</b> by service users in achieving expected clinical outcomes over the facility’s design life. Therefore, through briefing and optioneering, a healthcare facility’s project strategy must be directly linked with specific needs and requirements (among other things) in order to reflect exactly what the stakeholders and end-users value in a healthcare built environment in the long term. These research findings were applied to inform the formulation of a better briefing and optioneering guidance framework applicable during project definition for satisfactory WLV delivery of healthcare schemes...|$|R

40|$|Two {{alternative}} measurement bases {{that have}} appeared in accounting standards, Deprival Value (sometimes called Value to the Business) and Fair Value, are explained and compared. They are then reconciled by making the following three adjustments to their conventional definitions. (1) In the case of Deprival Value, situations in which net <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> exceeds replacement cost imply {{that there is a}} profitable redevelopment or redeployment opportunity, so that net <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> is regarded as the appropriate measure of Deprival Value. (2) In the case of Fair Value, transactions costs (including installation and removal costs) are added to acquisition values and deducted from disposal values. (3) In the case of Fair Value, it is assumed that net <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> represents the “highest and best use”, except when it is exceeded by both replacement cost and value in use. In the latter case, “highest and best use” (and therefore Fair Value) is inferred by assuming profitmaximising behaviour by the owner. It is suggested that the resulting synthesis represents a method of current valuation which is consistent with the objective of measuring the asset in terms of the economic opportunities that are available to its current owner in the condition and location in which it is currently to be found...|$|E

40|$|There {{exists a}} joint-cost {{allocation}} {{problem in the}} public sector, particularly highlighted by the cost-based national pricing of blood products in England, supposedly derived using volume-driven activity-based costing (ABC) : an approach criticised by the implementation criteria propounded for ABC within the academic literature. In contrast, {{we believe that the}} contributions of quality-associated operations-based drivers, described within ABC, together with the net <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> method, usually recommended as the optimal joint-cost allocation method, provide the beginnings of a solution. This paper sets out a methodological development from this platform that links allocation decisions with the issue of value. The bipolar nature of the model is based upon the combination of two types of allocation. One allocates joint costs according to the altered value of source material when competing non-joint alternative products exist. The other allocates joint costs according to product outcome values ascertained separately for the physical specification elements that comprise each of the range of joint products. The overall emphases are on academic context, model generalisation, the facilitation of cost-effective choices between joint products and non-joint alternatives, and possible future trends in the application of the method.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to define {{possibilities}} of valuation and their impacts on the function of accounting. Furthermore the comparison of valuation methods within the czech accounting standards with international standards (IAS/IFRS). Valuation is metodical element which has huge influence on use value of information provided by accounting system. It affects the predicative capability of accounting information, mainly the items in accounting document. Monetary expression of company assets and debts, total sum and shareholders' capital are dependent on the selected valuation method. Level of costs is deduced from the valuation of property and debts. Its influenced by the consumption or decreasing of assets and by increasing of debts. The valuation method has also impact on financial analysis of company. The valuation problems is basicaly given by the changes of market price of assets and by the changes of buying power of used monetary unit. For the valuation of assets and debts can be used following valuation platforms: historical cost, <b>realisable</b> <b>value,</b> current cost, current valuation, fair value. Key moments when the valuation takes place are valution with acquisition, valuation during possesion and valuation with sales of assets. The valuation in Czech Republic is primary govern by the accounting law. Valuation according IFRS/IAS is based on conceptual framework and also on elementary international standards...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{whether the}} prospective {{services provided by}} a football player {{on behalf of the}} club holding his registration can be recognised as an accounting asset. The first section of the paper considers the appropriateness of treating these prospective services as intangible assets within the terms of the UK Accounting Standards Board criteria for definition and recognition of assets. In the second section, four valuation methodologies are evaluated using case study data made available by a major Scottish club. Each of the methods evaluated is either currently used in accounting practice by some clubs, or is used in some form in the existing market place for players. The historical cost model involves capitalising players acquired by the club via the transfer market on the balance sheet at their cost of registration. The earnings multiplier model applies a multiplier to a player's earnings to produce a current valuation of that player. The third model involves capitalising players at directors' valuation, while the independent multiple player evaluation model involves obtaining valuations for players from various informed sources, knowledgeable on those particular players. The paper concludes that there are convincing arguments for the conceptualisation of the services provided by football players as accounting assets, and recommends an system of valuation in which players are valued at their <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> by independent experts...|$|E
40|$|The {{future of}} the {{orangutan}} (Pongo spp.) is far from secure despite the species’ high profile and media attention. The traditional threat to the orangutan has been widespread logging, but the continuing conversion of remaining habitat for oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation is hastening its extinction in the wild. This situation is driven by a robust global market for palm oil as a vegetable oil and biofuel. In tackling this conservation problem, therefore, economic factors cannot be overlooked. This article analyses these factors and how they curtail effective orangutan conservation. Of significance are the high opportunity costs of orangutan conservation and market failures associated with the public-goods nature of the orangutan’s forest habitat. Conservationists should consider these constraints when formulating remedial action. This article assesses strategies that reduce the opportunity cost of conserving habitat (via supply-side approaches that divert oil palm cultivation away from forests) and enhance the <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> of orangutan habitat (by capitalising on the demand for non-market values such as carbon storage). It is concluded that the former group of strategies {{are likely to have}} limited effect on curtailing deforestation, but with the right institutional policies in place they can act as stopgaps while strategies involving carbon financing and payments for biodiversity develop sufficiently to render habitat retention financially competitive.

40|$|Asset {{impairment}} is {{a relatively}} new term in the corporate reporting arena. However, the concept of asset impairment relates closely to that of an asset write-down. Asset write-downs historically have been a feature of corporate reporting for many years (Lee, 1975)) due to the principle of conservatism, although largely discretionary in nature in the UK until the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of Assets and Goodwill (FRS 11) in 1998. Asset impairment is defined by the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in FRS 11 as the situation of: A reduction in the recoverable amount of a fixed asset or goodwill below its carrying amount (paragraph 2). Recoverable amount in this context is the higher of net <b>realisable</b> <b>value</b> or value in use. Prior to the issue of regulations in the area of asset impairment, there was very little guidance for corporations which may have been faced with large impairment losses. This could result in some discretion in terms of the timing and how to account for any asset impairment charge, for example either an adjustment to reserves or an expense in the income statement. The aim of this thesis is to explore the practice of impairment of assets in UK published financial statements and evaluate the concept and suitability of impairment as a means of recognising and subsequently measuring a decline in the value of a non current asset and the implications of this process. An assessment of the impact of international standards in relation to asset impairment being operational from January 2005 for UK listed corporations is also undertaken. The sample consists of those corporations listed on the UK Financial Times 100 Index (FTSE 100) of leading corporations from the period from 2003 to 2007 - 8. The thesis evaluates the extent of earnings management associated with asset impairment charges, {{both before and after the}} change in the regulatory environment. An assessment of whether an increase or decrease in the earnings characteristics of corporations takes place as a result of a change in the regulatory environment is also evaluated. Additionally the thesis provides a detailed assessment of the extent of disclosure associated with charging an asset impairment loss and whether this is associated with the size of the asset impairment loss. The measurement and valuation methods employed to implement an asset impairment loss are also evaluated. Other key areas of investigation focus on asset impairment losses being associated with a particular category of asset, business sector, indicator of asset impairment and a change of management. Fair value forms a component of asset impairment loss recognition and this thesis contributes to the debate about the ability of a fair value measurement approach to provide a true and fair view of the corporation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether unmined ore {{stockpiles}} fall within the ambit of the definition of trading stock in section 1 of the Income Tax Act (58 / 1962) and therefore needs to be considered for the purposes of section 22 in the determination of taxable income. Furthermore the judgement in Richards Bay Iron&Titanium (Pty) Ltd and Another v CIR (1996 : 55) would be analysed to determine whether a distinction could be made between the stockpiled material held in that case as opposed to unmined ore. The research object would be determined by analysing the nature of ore stockpiles, the accounting treatment ore stockpiles and its effect on the tax treatment as well as the taxation of stockpiles in terms of case law. As to the first part, a distinction in the legal sense was examined between movable and immovable property. It was concluded that stockpiles could by its nature in certain circumstances, be considered immovable property even though they became movable by its separation from the soil. Intention was furthermore identified as one of the most important criteria in a three tier test for the determination of the legal nature of stockpiles. As to its tax nature, it was concluded that even though case law suggests that the intention to realise through mining activities could make such stockpiles floating capital, it was submitted that intention remains the conclusive criteria and therefore only once an intention exist, to utilise mining property in a mining process that is a scheme of profit making, does the intention change and does the fixed capital (both immovable property and movable stockpiles) become floating capital. In the second chapter an analysis was done of the financial reporting requirements for stockpiles and whether the accounting treatment thereof would influence the tax treatment. It was concluded that the accounting treatment would influence the tax treatment as the definition of trading stock in section 1 of the ITA (58 / 1962) is actually an extension of the normal grammatical meaning, the latter for which the accounting treatment is critical. In terms of IAS 1 it was found that an essential criterion for a current asset was that it must be expected to be realised in the 12 months after the reporting date. It was found that even though mined ore and crushed ore could be seen as work in progress and thus inventories, such ore still had to comply with the requirements of IAS 1 and IAS 2 to be classified as inventory. The valuation of the ore would be in terms of IAS 2 if at historical cost and in terms of SANREC if at net <b>realisable</b> <b>value.</b> It was concluded that stockpiles that did not meet the trading stock criteria due to various uncertain circumstances could be disclosed as non-current assets at historical cost, but not in terms of IAS 16. However, if no reasonable expectation of future benefits existed, then no disclosure would be required. In examining the taxation of stockpiles the definition of trading stock was analysed. It was concluded that to the extent that the normal grammatical meaning did not apply, the extension to the definition still had to be considered. It was held that the extension to the definition had two parts of which the first required that the object must be acquired, produced or manufactured for the purpose of use in a manufacturing process, irrespective of whether the object was saleable in its current condition. The second part required no intention but was an objective enquiry of whether a saleable object was disposed of and which the proceeds would be revenue in nature It was also found that a distinction between a mining process and a manufacturing process exists in the South African tax law and that objects intended for use in the different processes could be treated differently from a tax perspective. Finally the analysis of the Richards Bay case (1996 : 55) revealed that even though the court considered that stockpiles are raw materials or work-in-progress, it was the taxpayer’s admission of a manufacturing process and his lack of distinction of the mining process that was critical in the decision against him. The court accepted the taxpayer’s contentions and withheld opinion on these two critical matters. It was concluded that stockpiles of unmined ore did not constitute trading stock in the extended definition and only under very specific circumstances could it be considered trading stock under the normal grammatical meaning when inferred from accounting disclosure and valuation requirements.
