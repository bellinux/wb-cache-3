40|$|Masters of ScienceSubstance abuse {{among the}} youth {{is one of}} the main social {{challenges}} in South Africa and around the world. The purpose of this study was to explore the <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse among the youth in Grabouw, Western Cape Province of South Africa. The reason why this research was conducted was because the Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning Unit (ITLU) of the University of the Western Cape approached the Department of Social Work with research topics that emerged from the Faculty of Community and Health sciences involvement in the Theewaterkloof communities. One of the concerns expressed by the community of Grabouw is the high prevalence <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> abuse in this community. This study therefore explored the reasons for substance abuse amongst the youth of Grabouw. The research was conducted using the ecological approach as a theoretical framework. A qualitative research methodology was used to explore the phenomenon under study. The research project followed an explorative, descriptive and contextual research design and with this the researcher sought to understand the reasons for substance abuse. The data was gathered through semi-structured one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions and was later analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. The findings showed that the reasons for substance abuse among the youth in the rural area of Grabouw are contextual reasons in which the family plays a major role in influencing substance use and also peer pressure, lack of recreational facilities, low religious involvement, experimenting and negative role models within the family and community, the ‘dop’ system, unemployment, availability and affordability were identified as the major reasons for substance abuse. The second major theme that emerged from the study was the psychological reasons for substance abuse. This includes low self-esteem, relieving stress, sexual stimulation, motivation to do unlawful things and boosting performances in sporting activities. The researcher has put forward various recommendations that will contribute towards solving substance abuse...|$|R

There is no published data on substance use among the youth in Sudan other than on tobacco use. Objectives. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence, circumstances, and factors associated with substance use. Methods. An institution-based survey was conducted on a sample of 500 students. Data was collected using a questionnaire designed by the WHO for student drug surveys and analyzed using IBM SPSS version 20. Results. The overall prevalence <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use is 31 %. The current prevalence of tobacco, cannabis, alcohol, amphetamines, tranquilizers, inhalants, opiates, cocaine, and heroin use was 13. 7 %, 4. 9 %, 2. 7 %, 2. 4 %, 3. 2 %, 1 %, 1. 2 %, 0. 7 %, and 0. 5 %, respectively. Curiosity (33. 1 %) was the main <b>reason</b> for initiation <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use. The main adverse effects reported were health problems (19. 7 %) and theft (19. 7 %).

Design: Population based cross-sectional study. Setting: Two high schools of West Bengal, India. Participants: 416 students in class VIII, IX, and X in two schools. Interventions: None. Measurements: Substance use: initiation, sources, reasons for continuation. Then proportions and chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Materials and Methods: This was a population based cross sectional study conducted among 416 students from class VII, IX and X in two high schools(urban and rural) of West Bengal, India selected by Multistage random sampling. A self administered anonymous pretested close ended questionnaire was used with the main outcome measures <b>of</b> initiation, sources, <b>reasons</b> for continuation <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use based on WHO study team questionnaire. Results: Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use was found to be higher among the urban students (15. 1 &#x 0025;) than their rural counterparts (10. 7 &#x 0025;). The proportion of users was higher in the higher grades as compared to the lower grades. Among urban as well as rural students, 16 years and above were significantly more likely than their counterparts aged 15 years and below to report lifetime use. The mean age of initiation ranged from 12. 6 to 13. 9 years. Family members and friends were found to have a considerable influence not only on initiation but also important sources for money as well as the substance. Easy availability in the neighborhood was also an important correlate to continuation <b>of</b> <b>substances.</b> Conclusions: Family environment as well as peer groups has an important bearing on initiation and continuation <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use.

40|$|Background: Is {{knowledge}} {{regarding the}} consequences <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use among adolescents {{enough to prevent}} them from initiating and continuing its use, is a question that needs to be clarified further? Objective: To assess the knowledge regarding harm of use and to obtain information about attitudes among high school students. Also, to discover the opinion <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use held by users. Materials and Methods: This was a population based cross-sectional study conducted in two high schools of West Bengal, India, among 416 students, in classes VIII, IX, and X, with no interventions. Primary outcome measurements were substance use: knowledge regarding harm, attitude, and opinion. Following this proportions and the chi-square test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Out of 416 students, 52 (12. 5 %) used or abused any one <b>of</b> the <b>substances</b> irrespective <b>of</b> time and frequency in lifetime; 26 (15. 1 %) were among the urban students and 26 (10. 7 %) were among their rural counterparts. More than two-thirds (73. 07 %) of the respondents expressed a desire to quit substance use and 57. 69 % had tried to stop. ′Easy availability′ and ′relief from tension′ were the most frequent <b>reasons</b> for continuation <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use. Level <b>of</b> knowledge on harmfulness <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use among students was very high (urban - - 84. 6 % and rural - 61. 5 %) and they stated media as the most frequent source of information. Users were successful in influencing their peers into taking up this habit (urban - 15. 4 % and rural - 26. 9 %). Conclusions: Inspite of being aware of the harmful effects <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use, adolescents take up this habit. This requires comprehensive prevention and control programs in schools and the community, targeted toward adolescents and their parents and other family members. Effective measures are required to encourage shaping the attitude of school children toward self-confidence and adequacy, as also to prevent risk behavior among adolescents...|$|R

40|$|A few {{authors have}} {{performed}} autopsies on specific torts and identified the suspected reasons behind their deaths. These analyses, though interesting, are {{by their own}} admission of limited scope and do not provide especially useful analytic or predictive tools. This Article has a broader goal. Just as pathologists and epidemiologists study how fatal illnesses spread, conservation biologists examine why animal species go extinct, and geographers and anthropologists try to understand why societies succeed or fail, this Article surveys the roster of dead and dying torts and then asks (and tries to answer) a novel question: Why do torts die? This question quickly breaks down into several other queries, of which the following are just a few: Do defunct tort theories share a common fatal flaw? Do torts die for <b>reasons</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance,</b> procedure, {{or some combination of}} both? What roles do courts, legislatures, and plaintiffs each play in the deaths of torts? And what, if anything, can the disappearance of some tort theories tell us about what makes other claims survive and prosper? This Article proposes some answers to these questions. The discussion below offers and develops a framework for analyzing why torts die that focuses upon the contributions made by the following six factors: (1) the changes in the cultural atmosphere surrounding a tort; (2) the quality of the arguments directed against the tort; (3) the interests, abilities, and limitations of the audiences that entertain and act upon these arguments; (4) the influence exerted by the agents who advocate or oppose the elimination of the tort; (5) the attractiveness of alternatives, if any, that may exist to tort liability; and (6) the attributes of the tort itself that make it more or less susceptible to abolition or abandonment. When tested through case studies, this model suggests that torts die when atmosphere, arguments, audiences, agents, alternatives, and attributes combine to direct a tort toward abolition, abandonment, or both. Put another way, most bygone torts have not died simply because times changed. Changing times, or other ambient conditions of the environment in which a tort operates, may prove lethal to a tort if and when they produce arguments against the cause of action that are properly attuned to the interests, concerns, and capabilities of the agents and audiences who endorse or reject theories of liability, and the attributes of the tort and any available alternatives accelerate, rather than defuse, the drive toward abolition or abandonment. Where these factors are not properly aligned, a tort may prove capable of tacking into the prevailing cultural winds...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Retrospective structured chart review <b>of</b> 100 women <b>substance</b> abusers seeking treatment at a deaddiction center between September 1978 and December 2011. Results: A typical case was of 36. 3 years age, married (65 %), urban (61 %), nuclear family (59 %) based housewife (56 %), with good to fair social support (69 %). The commonest <b>substance</b> <b>of</b> abuse was tobacco (60 %), followed by opioids (27 %), alcohol (15 %), and benzodiazepines (13 %).

40|$|High {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use {{is reported}} among mine workers. This contributes to accidents, injuries {{as well as}} fatalities which has enormous effect on both the employers and workers. For that reason, the mining industry is regulated by the government with acts, policies and guidelines related to safety. Non-compliance to safety regulations attract heavy penalties. The mining industry therefore employs a zero tolerance policy on substance use. Despite this policy previous research reported high levels <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use. There {{is a lack of}} research about the perspectives of mine workers regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>substances.</b> Following earlier work with mineworkers, the researcher was intrigued and eager to understand mineworkers opinions on this subject and regarding policies in their workplace. The study was conducted within a qualitative research framework. Twenty semi-structured interviews were done with black male mineworkers from the mines around eMalahleni (Mpumalanga) who were referred to SANCA following disciplinary hearings regarding substance use. The interviews were conducted in different African languages preferred by participants. This allowed for rich data as they expressed themselves freely using appropriate idioms to express opinions crisply. With the participants permission, the conversations were tape recorded for transcription. The Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the data. Themes were generated to describe the mineworkers experiences and the meanings they attach to substance use and mining policies. These themes were ordered and classified in a systematic way. The results provided an understanding <b>of</b> the participants <b>reasons</b> for use <b>of</b> <b>substances.</b> Substance use is seen as part of traditions and of mining culture. The urge for use is exacerbated by high levels of stress caused by the dangerous working environment and the living conditions in mining hostels. The research highlighted the complexity as well as the conflict arising from dissonance between safety policies and mineworkers behaviour. It also confirmed that, although they are in place in the mining industry, policies still need to be enforced firmly. Results confirmed that disciplinary outcomes and decisions bear serious implications for workers and their families. The resultant stress may even contribute to further substance use as a way to cope. This underlines the need for early firm enforcement of policies to stem use timeously. To enhance safety by curtailing risky behaviour, continuous education on policies is essential. Mini Dissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. PsychologyMAUnrestricte...|$|R

Materials & Methods: This study was a descriptive-analytic study on 100 addicts referred to methadone maintenance treatment center (MMT) in Yazd. Data was collected by a pre-designed questionnaire with acceptable validity and reliability. Data was analyzed using SPSS statistical software and employing descriptive statistics such as percentage, ratio, mean, standard deviation and statistical tests such as t-test and chi- square was performed. Results: 41. 9 % of addicts were unemployed, 4. 77 % married and 5. 64 % had elementary education. The most common method <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> consumption was inhalation (2. 40 %).

This teaching situation implies a devaluation of the relevance that meaningful comprehension has on chemical language. In general, the later comprise the formulation <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> and the formulated representation of chemical transformations. These formulated representations are {{a bridge between the}} world <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> their chemical transformations and their conceptualization. The periodic system of chemical elements as a basic classificatory system for substances according to their elemental composition is a conceptual tool for meaningful teaching and learning <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> groups in relation with their common functional groups. This leads to the development <b>of</b> <b>substances</b> classificatory systems, which allow the students to interact with the diversity <b>of</b> <b>substances,</b> to work with previous knowledge and concepts formation processes and to make explicit their knowledge through natural language and the way they use and signify the language of relative and molecular chemical formulas...|$|R
