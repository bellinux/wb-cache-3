50|$|Conservation {{organizations}} {{have determined that}} the main threats to Nile crocodiles, in turn, are loss of habitat, pollution, hunting, and human activities such as accidental entanglement in fishing nets. Though the Nile crocodile has been hunted since ancient times, {{the advent of the}} readily available firearm made it much easier to kill these potential dangerous reptiles. The species began to be hunted on a much larger scale from the 1940s to the 1960s, primarily for high-quality leather, although also for meat with its purported curative properties. The population was severely depleted, and the species faced extinction. National laws, and international trade regulations have resulted in a resurgence in many areas, and the species as a whole is no longer wholly threatened with extinction. The status of Nile crocodiles was variable based on the <b>regional</b> <b>prosperity</b> and extent of conserved wetlands by the 1970s. However, as is the case for many large animal species whether they are protected or not, persecution and poaching have continued apace and between the 1950s and 1980s, an estimated 3 million Nile crocodiles were slaughtered by humans for the leather trade. In Lake Sibaya, South Africa, it was determined that in the 21st century, persecution continues as the direct cause for the inability of Nile crocodiles to recover after the leather trade last century. Recovery for the species appears quite gradual and few areas have recovered to bear crocodile populations, i.e. largely insufficient to produce sustainable populations of young crocodiles, on par with times prior to the peak of leather trading. Crocodile 'protection programs' are artificial environments where crocodiles exist safely and without the threat of extermination from hunters.|$|E
50|$|Abundant natural {{resources}} of Central Asia become important factor for South Asia {{which has the}} scantiest endowment of hydrocarbons to fulfill their energy requirements. In this context, Gwadar port can {{play a significant role}} as an energy corridor to link Central and South Asia into economic integration to achieve a sustainable economic growth. Located just a few hundred miles away, the energy corridor will connect the Central Asian states of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan to exploit over 217 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves which are more in quantum than Saudi Arabia’s resources (Aziz, 2005, p. 63). Moreover, South Asia can enable Central Asian States to diversify their economies by supplying gas and oil on global market prices as Russia’s Gasprom, oil and gas company, is exploiting the Central Asian countries’ energy flow on a very minimal price. The Central Asia has old gas pipeline network which known as the Central Asia-Center (CAC) gas pipeline system runs from Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to Russia. The CAC is a network of five separate pipelines which are being used for transportation of energy from the Central Asia to Russia. These pipelines were started constructing in 1966 and completed in 1987. Keeping in view the rich energy resources of Central Asia, Russia has increased its transit capacity to retain energy from the Central Asia (Fredholm, 2008, p. 42). The Russian monopoly and exploitation is {{because of the fact that}} during former Soviet’s period, all supply routes of Central Asia were designed in such a way to direct its energy resources only to Russia and left the region with no option but to continue supplying Russian energy market. This approach of exploitation at the hands of Russia has severely thwarted the region’s economic development. The energy corridor will also contribute for economic development of Afghanistan as the country is located in the middle of two regions and can serve as a viable transit corridor for uninterrupted energy. It is a high time for both the region to act as fueling prices are steadily going up since 2002 and delay may cause a severe blow to <b>regional</b> <b>prosperity</b> and to both the economies of India and Pakistan whose people are living below the poverty line (p. 63).|$|E
