5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death <b>row</b> <b>inmates.</b> Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death <b>row</b> <b>inmates.</b> Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after taking}} office in 2003, Blagojevich {{continued}} support of a moratorium on executions of death <b>row</b> <b>inmates,</b> even though no such executions are likely to occur for years (his predecessor, George Ryan, commuted all of the death sentences in the state shortly before leaving office in 2003). This support continued through his administration.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2000, 60 Minutes aired an {{interview}} with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. At the time, McVeigh had already been {{convicted and sentenced to}} death for the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government. Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with death <b>row</b> <b>inmates.</b> A federal inmate challenged the policy in Hammer v. Ashcroft, under which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the prison policy. In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in the case, and the policy limiting media access to death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> remains in place. CBS refuses to show the entire interview, and has stated no reasons.|$|E

25|$|Legal experts {{argued that}} a major {{obstacle}} to granting Davis a new trial was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, passed after the Oklahoma City bombing, which bars death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> from later presenting evidence they could have presented at trial.

25|$|Dalits {{comprise}} a slightly {{disproportionate number of}} India's prison inmates. While Dalits (including both SCs and STs) constitute 25 per cent of the Indian population, they account for 33.2 per cent of prisoners. About 24.5 per cent of death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> in India are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which is proportionate to their population. The percentage is highest in Maharashtra (50 per cent), Karnataka (36.4 per cent) and Madya Pradesh (36 per cent).|$|E
25|$|Death row prisoners, {{along with}} prisoners in {{administrative}} segregation, are seated individually on prison transport vehicles. The TDCJ makes death row prisoners wear various restraints, including belly chains and leg irons, while being transported. Death row offenders and offenders with life imprisonment without parole enter the TDCJ system through two points; men enter through the Byrd Unit in Huntsville, and women enter through the Reception Center in Christina Crain Unit, Gatesville. From there, death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> {{go to their}} designated death row facilities.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{they note}} that {{during this period of}} rapid {{expansion}} in China’s organ transplant industry, there were no significant improvements to the voluntary organ donation or allocation system, and the supply of death <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> as donors also did not increase. Although it does not prove the allegations, the parallel between rapid growth in organ transplants and the mass imprisonment of Falun Gong practitioners is consistent with the hypothesis that Falun Gong practitioners in custody were having their organs harvested.|$|E
