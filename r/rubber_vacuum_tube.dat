40|$|Abstract- Transistor is {{the major}} {{invention}} in electronics field, <b>vacuums</b> <b>tubes</b> are used in older times. But <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> have lot of drawbacks when comparing with transistor like their large size high power consumption etc. So transistor will easily replace <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> because transistors are small size, low power consumption cheap etc. but transistor can't completely replace these <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> because transistor can't work In high frequency application and also transistor will almost hit its minimum size further reduction in size is not easy so need a better replacement.

Unlike other businesses making unlicensed or bootlegged <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> Cunningham was very aggressive in his advertising. Manufacturers of counterfeit <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> generally ended their activities after a lawsuit has been filed but Cunningham came out ahead after various lawsuits brought against him and his company, the Audio Tron Sales Company.
