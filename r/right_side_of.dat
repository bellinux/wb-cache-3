5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her chest and right knee.|$|E

5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull is very {{different from that of the}} left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a fixed graph H on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> each instance is also called the H-coloring problem. When H is the complete graph K'k, this is the graph k-coloring problem, which is solvable in polynomial time for k = 0, 1, 2, and NP-complete otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of flying the national flag on vehicles {{is restricted to}} the President, the Vice-President or the Prime Minister, Governors and Lieutenant Governors of states, Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, members of the Parliament of India and state legislatures of the Indian states (Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad), judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts, and flag officers of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the car. When a foreign dignitary travels in a car provided by government, the flag should be flown on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the car while {{the flag of the}} foreign country should be flown on the left side.|$|E
500|$|Whenever the PRC {{national}} flag is flown {{together with the}} regional Hong Kong flag, the {{national flag}} must be flown at the centre, above the regional flag, or otherwise in a more prominent position {{than that of the}} regional flag. The regional flag must be smaller in size than the national flag, and it must be displayed {{to the left of the}} national flag. [...] When the flags are displayed inside a building, the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a person looking at the flags, and with his or her back toward the wall, are used as reference points for the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a flag. [...] When the flags are displayed outside a building, the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a person standing in front of the building and looking towards the front entrance are used as reference points for the left and <b>right</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a flag.

5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body is Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai {{is one of the}} rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body is the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E

5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
