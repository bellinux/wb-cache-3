It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E

50|$|The {{community}} of Jacksonport grew {{as a major}} commercial center in the mid-19th century. The town was militarily important during the American Civil War, and was where General M. Jeff Thompson formally surrendered the Confederate Army of Northern Arkansas to Union forces in 1865. In the 1870s the town was bypassed by the railroad, and rapidly declined thereafter as <b>river</b> <b>freight</b> shipment declined. The county seat was moved to Newport in 1891.|$|E
50|$|The Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad reached Petoskey in 1873. This {{opened up}} the {{surrounding}} area to tourism, settlers, and lumbermen. This eventually led to various people proposing different ideas for the water way. One such plan was the transportation of mail along the waterway. This involved the dredging of Crooked <b>River.</b> <b>Freight</b> was eventually transported along the route. With {{the advent of the}} railroad as a cheaper means with which to move goods, the Inland Waterway fell into decline.|$|E

Standing 275 feet over the river between the Palisades, it first carried both passenger and freight trains. The American Society of Civil Engineers has designated it a National Engineering Landmark. The 1876 bridge was replaced in 1911 by a more robust bridge in the same place. This is the current bridge, which stands 308 feet above the <b>river.</b> <b>Freight</b> trains of the Norfolk Southern Railway still use this bridge several times a day.|$|E
50|$|The Deep <b>River</b> <b>Freight</b> Station is a {{historic}} railroad depot at 152 River Street in Deep River, Connecticut. The station was built in 1915 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad on {{the route of the}} former Connecticut Valley Railroad. It is a single-story wood frame structure, about 25 x 40 ft. It is mounted on brownstone piers, which support massive wooden sills. Original period loading docks are on the buildings north and south side, and the building has a low-pitch roof with wide eaves supported by large brackets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first record}} of non-Native {{settlement}} was in 1830, when European-American Ambrose Gipson purchased {{a large body}} of land along the river and founded 'Gipson's Landing'. This soon became the port on the Mississippi River for shipping out the cotton of Issaquena and Sharkey counties. It attracted shifting populations of river crews, gamblers, and traders, as well as show boats during low water times. The shipping records for David Mayer, who owned nearby Mout Level Plantation, show that <b>river</b> <b>freight</b> was shipped from the port via steamboat to points in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Mississippi.|$|E

50|$|The name High Level {{originated}} from {{the height of}} the land that separates the Peace and the Hay Rivers. The original location was approximately 3.5 miles north of the present spot and along the old Fort Vermilion/Meander <b>River</b> <b>freighting</b> trail, serving as a stopping place, not a town. The original High Level Sports Grounds were at this location and the old trail was still visible there in the mid 1960s. The High Level Golf & Country Club currently occupies this approximate location. For many years, High Level was known as Tloc Moi (Hay Meadow). The first fur traders arrived in this area in 1786, {{but it was not until}} 1947 that High Level was settled, with development of road access to Fort Vermilion being the primary factor in determining the town's present location. High Level's first power plant was established in 1957, and a year later the first post office was built. The oil fields were discovered in the 1960s, and a railway was run to the area in 1963.|$|R

50|$|The Alaska Railroad {{ended its}} <b>river</b> <b>freight</b> {{operation}} and leased {{all of its}} river equipment to the Yutana Barge Line beginning in 1954. The A.R.R. sold its remaining river equipment to the Yutana Barge Line in 1980. The White Pass discontinued regular service on the Lower Yukon River and Tanana River {{at the end of}} the 1941 season. The White Pass was put out of the river business altogether by competition from the North Klondike Highway (Whitehorse-Dawson City) and the Atlin Road, which were completed in the early 1950s. Only one former White Pass boat remains operational, the diesel-powered Yukon Rose. One more is being considered for restoration, the gasoline-powered Loon.The last steamboat in regular service on the Lower Yukon River was the Nenana, in 1954. The last steamboat in regular service on the Upper Yukon River was Klondike (Klondike II), which made her last run on July 4, 1955. The last commercial steamboat to operate under its own power on the Yukon River was the Keno, from Whitehorse to Dawson City on August 26-29, 1960. It was an equipment run to move the boat for purposes of putting it on display at Dawson City. Keno, the second Klondike, Neecheah, Nenana, and Tarahne survive as museums.|$|E

40|$|Liberty County {{prides itself}} on being {{a great place to}} live and raise families, which is evident in the rapidly growing population. It is rural, but not too distant from the {{amenities}} of Houston. However, the rural character means that public resources and funding are more limited, and economic opportunities are fewer. Poverty levels are higher and education and health levels are lower than averages. From the 19 th-century until today, the county has based its economy on natural resource extraction and processing, which may not be sustainable in the long run. Traditionally blue-collar work is the main employment driver. Many people travel outside of the county for their work, as well as for health care and other goods and services. The movement of both people and goods is enabled by strong transportation network coverage, including highways, railroads, <b>river</b> <b>freight,</b> and nearby ports. The expected expansion of a major Houston-area toll road into the county is eagerly awaited. Some bus transit is provided, but more is needed based on the financial and mobility constraints of many residents. School, fire, and other public infrastructure are provided but have some gaps, such as inadequate public hospital services. Liberty County has many wetlands and two protected areas, so there is tension between land development pressures and conservancy interests. There are also dangers from hazards like flooding, wind, and storm surge due to its proximity to the Gulf Coast and the presence of the Trinity River. The rest of the land is primarily forests and farmland, with relatively little urban land development. Planning at the city level is minimal, apart from Cleveland City. This State of Community Report is prepared by Texas Target Communities. It gathers data {{from a wide variety of}} sources in order to gain a more complete picture of current conditions in Liberty County, Texas. Due to resource limitations, there was no public participation, though it can be integrated at a later date. By centralizing the data in this document, relationships between different components and characteristics of the county become clearer and potential opportunities and synergies come to light...|$|E

50|$|The {{opening of}} the Erie Canal in 1825 brought {{prosperity}} across the state and realization {{of the benefits of}} internal navigation.
