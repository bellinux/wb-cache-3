50|$|The {{rationale}} for formal admissions {{is that they}} save time and costs. The system encourages people <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>facts</b> which are not in dispute, so that the trial is not derailed and unnecessarily delayed by extraneous and superfluous issues.|$|R
60|$|I {{have thus}} endeavoured to meet fairly, and to answer plainly, {{a few of}} the most common {{objections}} to the theory of natural selection, and I have done so in every case by referring <b>to</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>facts</b> and <b>to</b> logical deductions from those facts.|$|R

5000|$|In early 1941, Bertram, Metropolitan {{bishop of}} the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and speaker of the Fulda Conference of Bishops, {{rejected}} the <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the Danzig diocese as member in his ecclesiastical province and at the conference. Any arguments that Free City of Danzig had been annexed to Nazi Germany did not impress since Danzig's annexation lacked international recognition.|$|R
50|$|In early 1941 Bertram as {{metropolitan}} {{bishop of}} the Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and speaker of the Fulda Conference of Bishops, rejected Carl Maria Splett's <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the Danzig diocese as member in his ecclesiastical province and at the conference. Any arguments that the Free City of Danzig had been annexed to Nazi Germany, did not impress him since Danzig's annexation lacked international recognition.|$|R
50|$|A {{request for}} admissions (sometimes also called a <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit)</b> are {{a set of}} {{statements}} sent from one litigant to an adversary, {{for the purpose of}} having the adversary admit or deny the statements or allegations therein. Requests for admissions are part of the discovery process in a civil case. In the U.S. federal court system, they are governed by Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|R
50|$|On May 1, 1973, {{after the}} trial but prior to the {{district}} court’s decision, Montgomery County Schools notified Acanfora that his employment would not be renewed for the 1973-74 school year. The notification did not state the reasons for non-renewal, but its issuance came only two weeks after Dr. Elseroad’s testimony as to the reasons why {{he did not believe}} Acanfora should be reinstated to the classroom. The district court reopened the record, at Acanfora’s <b>request,</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the non-renewal notice into evidence.|$|R
50|$|She {{attended}} catechism {{lessons in}} her local parish during her childhood and in obedience to her priest {{decided to wait}} until adulthood before <b>requesting</b> <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> into the Salesian Sisters.|$|R
60|$|He {{declared}} {{to himself that}} he had never known her dangerously full compass if she were capable of such a reprisal; and, melancholy as it may be <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>fact,</b> his own humiliation and regret engendered a smouldering admiration of her.|$|R
40|$|A <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> a {{hospital}} inpatient with {{motor neurone disease}} to the hospice generated unusual unease. Significantly, withdrawal of ventilation had already been planned. The presumption that ventilation would be withdrawn after transfer presented a dilemma. Should the hospice accept the admission? If so, should the hospice staff stop the ventilation, and then when and how? Debate centred on the continuity of best interests and the logistics of withdrawing ventilation. The factors making the request contentious identified competing interests within hospice admission decision making that could detrimentally impact on patient care...|$|R

The management of the airline is left to the company’s founder. Blue Panorama confirmed that company business and flights are fully operational.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{returning}} from rehab in Season 7, Carter makes peace with his brain-damaged heroin-addict cousin, Chase, and apologizes for his long absence, saying, [...] "I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fact</b> that I {{was just like}} you." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Kerry Weaver returns Carter's application for Chief Resident because of his addiction.|$|R
50|$|The {{murder trial}} began on July 16, 1979 in the Federal {{courthouse}} in Raleigh, North Carolina. Although MacDonald’s lawyers, Bernard Segal and Wade Smith, were confident of an acquittal {{from the first}} day, one thing after another went badly for the defense. It began when Dupree refused a defense <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> into evidence a psychiatric evaluation of MacDonald, which suggested that someone of his personality type was unable to kill his family. Dupree explained that since no insanity plea had been entered for MacDonald, {{he did not want}} the trial bogged down by contradictory psychiatric testimony from prosecution and defense witnesses.|$|R
60|$|The second man, the civilian, rode in, wet and draggled, forty seconds later. As for the Herr Lieutenant, a {{disappointed}} man, he {{fell out}} by the way, alleging a puncture. I believe he was ashamed <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>fact</b> {{that he had been}} beaten in open fight by the objurgated Engländerin.|$|R
6000|$|... "In truth I am," [...] {{replied the}} other, while the Peruvian dismounted, [...] "nevertheless, I ought {{scarcely}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>fact,</b> for I {{was born in}} Peru. This perhaps may seem contradictory, {{but it is not}} more so than your being apparently a native of the soil yet speaking English like an Englishman." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{attributing}} of sexes to {{the cosmos}} {{is not in}} the least incompatible with an uninterested disregard of sex where it really exists. It is one thing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>fact</b> as a general law of the universe, and quite another to dwell upon it as an important factor in every-day affairs.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 {{the number}} of <b>requests</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> {{children}} into the Royal College Primary had become excessive. Thus the Minister of Education I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla took the initiative {{to build a new}} school in Cinnamon Gardens on the lines of Royal College, Colombo. In 1967 Minister Iriyagolla began the ground work for establishing the school. It was named after D. S. Senanayake, who was the first prime minister of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) after gaining independence. R. I. T. Alles, an assistant principal at Royal College became the Head Master of the new school. The location in which the college stands today was at that time called the Kumbikale jungle.|$|R
60|$|Spennie {{could not}} afford to play picquet for a {{sovereign}} a hundred, or anything like it; but after his adversary's innuendo it was impossible for a young gentleman of spirit <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the humiliating <b>fact.</b> He nodded.|$|R
50|$|Children in {{the town}} of Tepoztlan are {{encouraged}} to participate in community activities. The people there believe that everyone can contribute something to community endeavors. Young children are encouraged to participate by being brought to various meetings and activities by their mothers, so as they grow older, they <b>request</b> <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> into the group on their own will.|$|R

40|$|Fees {{have gone}} up steeply for 20 years because demands on the state???s general fund have increased. At the same time, technology, benefits, and {{mandates}} have increased costs within the CSU. Unwilling <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> these <b>facts,</b> we have let these increases fall {{on the shoulders of}} students who enter when lulls in business cycles reduce revenue streams into the general fund. A rational fee policy would smooth spikes into a gradual curve over time, projecting that fees in ca. Eventually will match fees elsewhere...|$|R
60|$|Lord Dreever {{could not}} afford to play picquet for a {{sovereign}} a hundred, or, indeed, to play picquet for money at all; but, after his adversary's innuendo, it was impossible for a young gentleman of spirit <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the humiliating <b>fact.</b> He nodded.|$|R
5000|$|... "GayBelarus" [...] {{together}} with the other LGBT initiatives in Belarus collectively condemned the statements by the Ambassador of France to Belarus Michel Raineri in which he stated that ‘as a functionary he is for the same-sex marriage, but as a true believer he speaks in favour of the union {{of a man and}} a woman. Consequently, a joint letter was sent to a number of the government agencies of the French Republic with the <b>request</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the inadmissibility of such statements from the sidelines of diplomats as this discriminates against LGBT rights. After that, on the initiative of the Ambassador Michel Raineri, a meeting was held in the Embassy of France. The meeting was attended by the representatives of the human rights project ‘GayBelarus’ Natalia Mankovskaya and the project ‘Gay Alliance of Belarus’ Alexander Poluian.|$|R
50|$|This {{film was}} first shown on French {{television}} in 1981 after being banned from that medium for years. It is frequently {{assumed that the}} reason was French reluctance <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>facts</b> of French history. While {{this may have been}} a factor, the principal mover in the decision was Simone Veil, a Jewish inmate of Auschwitz who became a minister and the first President of the European Parliament, {{on the grounds that the}} film presented too one-sided a view.|$|R
50|$|The name {{is derived}} from the name for the wife of the eldest uncle, who in {{traditional}} Chinese families has the responsibility to take care of everyone. Big mamas act quite openly and are not reluctant <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>fact</b> that they are censoring and why they are doing so. The actions of big mamas are generally taken more with annoyance and amusement than with alarm, and there is often some humorous bantering with big mama.|$|R
50|$|On 16 May 2007, {{during the}} {{run up to}} the 2007 general election, Gormley emerged from a crowd of journalists to confront Michael McDowell while he was {{unveiling}} a poster saying 'Left Wing Government? No Thanks'. Gormley repeatedly <b>requested</b> McDowell <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the accompanying pamphlet on the matter was awash with lies. The incident fronted the evening's main news and the footage subsequently circulated on the Internet.|$|R
50|$|After 1938 Melnyk and Bandera were {{recruited}} into the Nazi Germany military intelligence Abwehr for espionage, counter-espionage and sabotage. Their {{goal was to}} run diversion activities after Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. Melnik was given code name 'Consul I'. This information {{is part of the}} testimony that Abwehr Colonel Erwin Stolze gave on 25 December 1945 and submitted to the Nuremberg trials, with a <b>request</b> <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> as evidence.|$|R

30|$|Analogous proof holds if one {{request is}} served. This {{analysis}} is helpful for a PU {{to decide if}} a <b>request</b> is <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> or rejected based on the sensitivity of reward to arrival rates of different classes.|$|R
50|$|OUN leaders Andriy Melnyk and Bandera were {{recruited}} before World War II into the Nazi Germany military intelligence Abwehr for espionage, counter-espionage and sabotage.

60|$|If she {{had read}} the truth, he felt that she had good reason for her resentment, and Lawrence did not trouble himself to {{consider}} if she had shown {{too much of it}} or not. He remembered the story of the defeated general, and, feeling that so far he had been thoroughly defeated, he determined <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the <b>fact,</b> and <b>to</b> sound a retreat from all the positions he had held; but, at the same time, to make a bold dash into the enemy's camp, and, if possible, capture the commander-in-chief and the Minister of War.|$|R
2500|$|The ACNA {{established}} {{dialogue with}} several Lutheran groups. In March 2010, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod {{announced that it}} and the ACNA would hold discussions to [...] "explore dialogue". The ACNA is the first non-Lutheran denomination to enter into any sort of dialogue with LCMS. The ACNA has approved a request from the North American Lutheran Church to share clergy where there are vacancies. In addition, there is a Lutheran group which has <b>requested</b> <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> into the ACNA as a diocese.|$|R
25|$|Golwalkar later openly <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fact</b> {{that the}} RSS did not {{participate}} in the Quit India Movement. Golwalkar further stated that such a stance led to the Sangh being viewed as an inactive organization, whose statements had no substance in reality.|$|R
60|$|Oh! {{what a day}} it was, as {{time went}} on. Madame Croquelebois went to high mass, and Bellote {{remained}} in charge. I was, you understand, a prisoner at large. Provided some one was attending me, I went into any {{room in the house}} save the only one where I cared to be. And I was sitting in the salon, with my Bible and Prayer-book before me-- not reading, I fear me, but at any rate attesting my religion, when there came up a message that Son Altesse Royale, the Duke of Gloucester, <b>requested</b> <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> see Mademoiselle de Ribaumont.|$|R
