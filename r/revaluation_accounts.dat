40|$|This paper {{presents}} integrated macroeconomic {{accounts for}} the United States for the period 1985 to 2002 and discusses issues related to their construction and use. Specifically, it focuses on tying together the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) and international transaction accounts (ITA) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the flow of funds accounts (FFA) published by the Federal Reserve Board. The paper provides integrated accounts for seven sectors: households and nonprofit organizations serving households, nonfinancial non-corporate businesses, nonfinancial corporate businesses, financial businesses, federal government, state and local governments, {{and the rest of}} the world. Each sector table has a full complement of accounts: current accounts (production and income accounts), accumulation accounts (capital account, financial account, and other changes in volume <b>account),</b> <b>revaluation</b> <b>account,</b> and balance sheet account. As a result, the sector statements trace the factors leading to changes in sector net worth. Relative to current publications of the two agencies, the tables go quite a bit further toward providing for the United States the sequence of accounts suggested in the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93), the recognized international standard. The tables use official data as of June 10, 2004; however, a few series have been created by the authors, and they are unofficial preliminary estimates at this time. ...|$|R

Two main positions emerge: the debtor treatment based on the contractual arrangements of the bonds; and the creditor treatment based on current interest rates and prices of assets/liabilities. Using the discounted cash flow model, this paper explores the treatment of income and other benefits from assets in the 1993 SNA. It finds that the debtor approach to bond interest conforms with the 1993 SNA recording income and other benefits from assets, as that approach captures the results of effective decision making between institutional units.

40|$|In takeovers bidders offer {{a premium}} to target firm {{shareholders}} but {{the determinants of}} such premium are not clearly identified. Among the factors previously examined in the literature are prior target undervaluation, expected synergy and overpayment due to behavioural biases like hubris. In this paper we use an option pricing approach to decompose the observed takeover premia. We also test the implications of recent real options-based models of takeover premia and risk changes surrounding takeovers. We model the observed target stock price as a portfolio of unobserved stock price and a put option whose value depends {{on a number of}} target and deal characteristics that impinge on the probability of bid success. For a sample of over 200 UK cash takeover bids during 1990 - 2004, we estimate the put value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and find that target firm <b>revaluation</b> <b>accounts</b> for a substantial part of the observed takeover premium and the put value accounts for a smaller, but still significant, proportion. The latter is higher in hostile, failed and longer bids. The put option value is also significantly correlated with the relative riskiness of bidders and targets, and synergy as predicted by Lambrecht (2004). Movements in betas in the run up to takeover announcements and in the post-announcement period are consistent with the real options-based predictions of Hackbarth and Morellec (2008). This study contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the true determinants of takeover premium and demonstrates the usefulness of option pricing models and provides a preliminary test of real options models in understanding and measuring the impact of UK takeovers on firm risk and shareholder gains.

A good ratio with near perfect interpretation brings about feasible investment decisions, corporate solvency and profitability and a track down effect on economic growth.

40|$|The {{research}} question investigated is Â“Do managers of Australian firms use upward asset revaluations to reduce debt contracting costs?Â” Much {{work in the}} accounting choice literature is premised on a relation between debt contracts and accounting policies. In particular, prior research using sample periods from the 1970 s and early 1980 s, provides evidence that asset revaluations are used to reduce the costs of debt contracting (see Whittred and Chan, 1992; Brown, Izan and Loh, 1992; and Cotter and Zimmer, 1995). However, considerable changes to the institutional setting {{have occurred in the}} past decade. These institutional changes include increased regulation of asset revaluations and disclosures, changes in the macroeconomic environment, and changes in the Australian debt market. Particularly, there has been a shift in emphasis from public to private debt. The relationship between asset revaluations and debt contracting is examined in the current setting. Following Watts and ZimmermanÂ’s (1990) suggestion that research into the relationship between firmsÂ’ contracts and their accounting policy choices will be improved by the use of more refined measures of contracting variables, the research commences with an investigation of the terms contained in recently issued debt contracts. Accordingly, this thesis contains two phases. Part A comprises an investigation of the covenants and accounting measurement rules typically contained in the recent debt contracts of listed Australian firms, with an emphasis on the role of asset revaluations. Part B then uses the outcomes of this investigation to determine the refined measures of debt contract terms used in testing hypotheses about the current relationship between asset revaluations and debt contracting. Part A establishes the current dominance of bank loan financing, along with a dramatic decline in the use of public debt. Details of the terms typically contained in bank loan agreements, particularly those relating to asset revaluations, are then investigated using a questionnaire survey of senior corporate bankers and analysis of a small sample of actual contracts. Outstanding public debt contracts are also analysed and compared with private debt contracts. The results of this phase of the research indicate that leverage covenants are the most widely used accounting based covenant in the bank loan agreements of listed Australian firms. In addition, interest coverage, current, tangible net worth, and prior charges ratios are all frequently used. Covenants tend to be less restrictive for larger firms than for smaller firms, and more restrictive for mineral producers than for industrial firms. Covenants contained in bank loan agreements tend to be more restrictive than those contained in convertible note trust deeds. In addition to providing important data for part B, the results of this phase of the research address an important gap in our knowledge about the terms contained in recently issued public and private debt contracts of listed Australian firms. Part B develops hypotheses {{based on the assumption that}} the costs of revaluing will be incurred when they are expected to be less than reductions in the costs of debt contracting derived from the revaluation. Due consideration is given to the likelihood that at least some of these costs have changed since prior research was conducted. In addition to the arguments presented in prior asset revaluations research, the expected costs of default on debt contracts, and the accounting discretion available to managers, are investigated as determinants of asset <b>revaluation</b> <b>accounting</b> choices. Predictions are made in relation to the likelihood of revaluation, the choice of valuer type, and whether to recognise or merely disclose new valuations of land and buildings. Interestingly, the results of prior research do not replicate in the current setting. Further analysis shows that differences in results are not due to differences in research methods between the current and prior research. In order to further examine the potential impact of changes to the institutional setting, a series of interviews with Chief Financial Officers is undertaken. The conclusion drawn from this additional analysis is that the relatively closer relationship between firms and their bankers has caused many firms to choose footnote disclosure of undervalued assets in preference to recognising an upward asset revaluation in the balance sheet. Overall, the results indicate that, when investigating the relationship between firmsÂ’ contracts and their accounting policy choices, a consideration of the way that contracts are negotiated and monitored is potentially more important than the use of refined measures of contract terms...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} {{the notion of}} experience in German Idealist Philosophy. I focus on the exploration of {{an alternative to the}} transcendental model notion of experience through Schelling's insight into the notion of logogrif. The structural division of this project into two sections reflects the two theoretical standpoints of this project, namely the logic and the logogrif of experience. The first section - the logic of experience - explores the notion of experience provided in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Judgement and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. I argue that Kant's fundamental question about the possibility of synthetic a priori judgements succeeds in thematising the aporia of cognitive experience but results in a subject-oriented, representational model which radically confines the notion of experience to the constitutive laws of the understanding or to the normative precepts of Reason. Experience is founded upon a sharp division between faith and knowledge, will and logic, desire and reflection, absolute and finitude. Fichte's endeavour to articulate a non-representational account of experience, does not succeed in extricating itself from the representational model, so long as experience is reduced to the ever-producing deeds of the self-positing ego. Despite the serious differences between Kant's and Fichte's notions of experience, both accounts, so long as they unfold from a transcendental standpoint, attempt to resolve experience into conceptual laws or determinations of the ego's absolute will. Experience is transformed into an object of the subject's cognitive or volitional faculties. The paradoxes of man's interaction with the world are intended to be accommodated either by the law-giving spontaneity of the understanding and the Architectonic of Pure Reason or by the overpowerful primordial act of the self-positing ego. This implies the conceptualisation of the self in terms of constant identity-through-time, or sheer self-determination. However, this conceptualisation remains at the normative or prescriptive level, which in turn is projected upon the world. The latter, though appears as the subject's property, essentially remains alien and opaque, confirming the radical limitations of the ego rather than its order-giving authority. Moreover, this notion of experience is ultimately founded upon a radical expulsion of the divine from the world, the de-spiritualisation of the sensual and the de-sensualisation of the spiritual, the sharp juxtaposition between absolute and finitude. This results in a self-defeating subjectivity, whose firm identity and rule-giving authority does not rescue it from its perennial unattainability to 'organise the conditioned' or 'conquer the unconditioned'. In Kant's and Fichte's thought, however, I detect elements that potentially transgress their transcendental account of experience. These are found in Kant's concept of spontaneity and free play between understanding and imagination, and Fichte's concept of productivity. I argue that these elements lose their potential dynamism, so long as they are absorbed by the transcendental demands for the solution of the aporias of logic. However, these elements point to the need for a radical re-conceptualisation of the notion of experience. This is provided by means of Schelling's logogriflic approach, which constitutes the theme of the second section. The second section - the logogrif of experience - attempts to articulate a different approach towards the notion of experience, through an exploration of Schelling's versatile and provocative thought. This section focuses on Schelling's original insight into the notion and act of logogrif, which opens the dialogue between logos and mythos, cosmic becoming and human soul, cosmic imagination and human reflection, faith and knowledge. This section attempts to illuminate Schelling's fascinating philosophical investigations and discoveries that have been rather overlooked, possibly, due to Hegel's overwhelming critique. This section, after a brief critical examination of the Identity Philosophy, attempts to elucidate Schelling's notion of experience through his middle works, Of Human Freedom, Ages of the World, The Deities of Samothrace, which are treated as a self-developing trilogy. Schelling re-addresses the aporias of logic not as part of Reason's self-interrogation but as part of the cosmic paradoxes and living experiences. In this way, Schelling resets the scene of the debate on the conditions of possibility for cognitive experience by putting on the stage the enigmas of the cosmos and life rather than the Tribunal of Reason. Logic itself is conceived as a potency in the cosmic becoming, and consequently can no longer attempt to establish the transcendental conditions for the possibility of cognitive experience. Cosmic becoming, in which man is an active part, is conceived as the process of the movement, the interaction, the transformations and transmutations of multiple potencies. These, far beyond any mechanical conceptualisation, appear as self-moving and yet interdependent, unknown yet familiar, inscrutable and yet manifest powers, describing the mystery of life itself. The latter is depicted as an ever-recurrent act of longing for self-expression as active unity. Experience is conceived as the lived process of a network of living potencies, which may not only resist rational powers but may also puzzle and seize them. In this context, reflection acquires a plastic dimension, as opposed to its rigidity in the representational model of experience. Reflection depicts cosmic longing's self-formation, whose man is part. This self-bending formation partially illuminates the nature of longing, and from this standpoint is the logic of the longing. However, this formation is movable, transmutable and mostly ineffable, and from this standpoint is the logic of a riddle: a logogrif. Logogrif is the transitive term that attempts to describe the transition of experience from its enacted phase to its allusive conceptual utterance, and in this sense the term itself participates in both phases, as both form of thought and form of life. The logogrific approach to experience in turn transposes us as from the realm of pure concepts to the realm of the mystery of life, from pure thought to acts of longing, from the Architectonic of Pure Reason to Cosmic Theurgy. The latter term attempts to grasp the paradox and dynamism of cosmic and non-cosmic becoming by means of multiple, vanishing and ever-recurring, transmutable potencies, or in Schelling's terms 'the magic of insoluble life'. Schelling's logogrific account consists in a powerful voice for the re-enchantment of the world, the introduction into the notion of experience of the imminence of the divine. This is not suggested in terms of the adoption of old religious doctrines but by means of the discovery and re-discovery of the theurgy of life, through the intensification of our artistic mood, the creative expansion of our deeds. This notion of experience allows for the reconsideration of the notion of the self, in terms of a dynamic, conflictual process between conscious and unconscious powers and the critical <b>revaluation</b> of the <b>accounts</b> of subjectivity which reduce it to the sphere of self-consciousness. The thesis concludes with the need for an investigation into the relation between logos and mythos, which only tangentially has been introduced by the present project. In this context {{it will be possible to}} re-appraise the potential that the logogrific approach opens for an alternative to both logical and traditional mythological patterns of thinking...|$|R
