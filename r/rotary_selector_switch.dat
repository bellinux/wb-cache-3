25|$|Throughout {{its service}} time, the Panel system was {{upgraded}} as new features became available or necessary. Starting in the mid-1920s, such upgrades improved the initial design. Major attention was initially focused on improving the sender. Early two- and three-digit type senders stored dialed digits on <b>rotary</b> <b>selector</b> <b>switches.</b> The senders employed translators {{to convert the}} dialed digits into the appropriate brush and group selections needed to complete the call. As better technology became available, Panel senders were upgraded to the all-relay type. These were more reliable, and in addition, replaced the translator equipment with decoders, which also operated entirely with relays, rather than with motor-driven apparatus, which yielded faster call completion.|$|R
5000|$|Pickups are {{designed}} and wound in-house. While {{most of the}} pickups are humbuckers, some are actually a pair of single coils wound in opposing directions, one intended for the neck {{and one for the}} bridge position. Through the use of a unique <b>rotary</b> pickup <b>selector</b> <b>switch,</b> PRS pickups offer 5 different sounds: a combination of thick humbucking Gibson-like tones, and thinner single-coil Stratocaster-like tones. The standard treble and standard bass pick ups use magnetic pole pieces in the non-adjustable inner coil, and a rear-placed feeder magnet in order to achieve a more authentic single-coil tone when split by the rotary switch ...|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1961, the EB-3 (based on {{an earlier}} model, the EB-0)was one of the bass guitar {{equivalents}} of the popular Gibson SG. It featured a slim SG-style body, a short 30.5" [...] scale, and two pickups (a large humbucking pickup in the neck position and a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position). The electronics consisted of a four-way <b>rotary</b> pickup <b>selector</b> <b>switch</b> (for Series 1 basses; neck pickup with midrange notch, bridge, bridge and neck with low end rolled off neck pickup, neck pickup with choke) and volume and tone knobs for each pickup. The standard finish was cherry red (like the SG guitar models), though EB-3s were also produced in other finishes such as Polaris White, Pelham Blue, Walnut, and Ebony. By the time production ceased in 1979, a total of 14167 instruments had been built.|$|R
