40|$|The growing {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} less polluting {{forms of energy}} {{has led to a}} renewed interest in the use of micro combined heat and power (CHP) technologies in the <b>residential</b> sector. <b>Micro</b> <b>CHP</b> is the simultaneous production of heat and power in a single building based on small energy conversion units.

In this paper, two typical CHP types for a residential building are analyzed, namely ECOWILL gas engine plant and LIFUEL fuel cell plant. For each facility, two different control strategies are studied: to minimize annual energy cost and to minimize annual CO 2 emissions, using an evaluation model constructed in the optimization software package LINGO. The analysis result shows that the fuel cell system serves the assumed residential building better than the gas engine system. With the operation of optimal economic benefits, annual energy cost is reduced by about 26 % compared with the conventional system (served by utility grids).

Over time, this development may pose a threat to the reliability and efficiency of the Dutch electricity balancing market. We investigated possible changes to the design of the Dutch balancing market that can maintain or even improve upon its current operational performance level. The first step of the research was an analysis of the existing Dutch balancing market. It consists of three main instruments: programme responsibility, the single buyer market for regulating and reserve power (RRP), and imbalance settlement. The balancing market currently functions satisfactorily. Subsequently, the effects of large-scale development of microgeneration in the Netherlands were evaluated with a qualitative scenario analysis. Four microgeneration scenarios and two methods for allocating the household electricity consumption and generation were considered. The four scenarios concerned large-scale penetration of PV, heat-led <b>micro</b> <b>CHP,</b> electricity-led <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> operated by the household consumer, and electricity-led <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> operated by the supply company.

Of these six options, adjusting the profile methodology and the regulation of smart meters are no-regret options that can be implemented immediately. The attractiveness of the other options depends upon the microgeneration portfolio that emerges, the manageability of large metering data flows, {{and the nature of the}} technical effects of large-scale microgeneration penetration.

There are technical, economic or public acceptability issues with all elements of this strategy. Advancements in gas extraction technology mean that natural gas should be available for most of this century; consequently it is worth re-examining the use of gas fired micro combined heat and power units (CHP) as a way of meeting medium term emission reduction goals. The Carbon Trust carried out field trials of <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> units in domestic and small scale commercial applications in England. Units based on Stirling Engines were used in domestic applications and found to produce only modest emission savings when compared to condensing boilers and grid electricity.

40|$|About a {{fifth of}} all primary energy in the US is {{consumed}} by residential buildings, mostly for cooling, heating and to provide electricity. Furthermore, retrofits are essential to reducing this consumption, since the buildings that exist today will comprise over half of those in use in 2050. Residential {{combined heat and power}} (or <b>micro</b> <b>CHP,</b> defined by < 5 kW electrical generation capacity) has been identified as a retrofit technology which can reduce energy consumption in existing homes during the heating season by 5 - 30 %. This thesis investigates the addition of a thermally-driven chiller/heat pump to a CHP system (to form a trigeneration system) to additionally provide savings during the cooling season, and enhance heating season savings. Scenarios are identified in which adding thermally-driven equipment to a <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> system reduces primary energy consumption, through analytical and experimental investigations. The experimental focus is on adsorption heat pump systems, which are capable of being used with the CHP engines (prime movers) that are already widely deployed. The analytical analysis identifies energy saving potential off-grid for today's prime movers, with potential on-grid for various fuel cell technologies. A novel dynamic test facility was developed to measure real-world residential trigeneration system performance using a prototype adsorption chiller. The chiller was designed and constructed for this thesis and was driven by waste heat from a commercially available natural gas-fueled 4 kW (electric) CHP engine. A control strategy for the chiller was developed, enabling a 5 -day experiment to be run using a thermal load profile based on moderate Maryland summer air conditioning loads and typical single-family domestic hot water demand, with experimental results in agreement with models. In this summer mode, depending on electrical loads, the trigeneration system used up to 36 % less fuel than off-grid separate generation and up to 29 % less fuel than off-grid CHP without thermally driven cooling. However, compared to on-grid separate generation, the experimental facility used 16 % more primary energy. Despite high chiller performance relative to its thermodynamic limit, this result is primarily due to the electrical efficiency of the prime mover being lower than the grid. A residential trigeneration system utilizing a high temperature fuel cell is predicted to save up to 42 % primary energy relative to the grid...|$|R

40|$|Municipal Solid Waste {{can be a}} {{potential}} renewable and non-seasonal resource for energy production. Alternative uses of waste, in fact, become increasingly interesting both from a waste management perspective – {{to reduce the amount}} of increasing waste deposited at landfill - and from an energy system perspective – to get the targets in terms of share of renewable and greenhouse gas reduction. In Europe, in recent years a lot of attention has raised around the possibility to use the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) for the production of energy through anaerobic digestion. In this process, the bio-waste is metabolized by bacteria under anaerobic conditions producing a gas – i. e. biogas. Digestate, a by-product of the anaerobic digestion process, can be used as a valid substitute to conventional mineral fertilisers. Production and collection of OFMSW usually takes place at district level, hence making it a great potential as non-seasonal energy feedstock. The biogas can then be used as a fuel for Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production, through systems directly installed at dwelling level. This perfectly matches with the Distributed Generation paradigm, where the energy is produced at, or near to its point of use. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the environmental impact of a waste-to-energy system in a distributed generation paradigm. OFMSW was considered as main feedstock to produce biogas, which was fed to different <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> units to generate energy for those dwellings that generated the waste. Three different technologies were investigated: Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), Micro Gas Turbine (MGT), Stirling Engine. A secondary objective of the work was to demonstrate the feasibility of the waste-to-energy closed loop at residential level. In order to achieve this, a Life Cycle Assessment with system expansion was performed considering two case studies: the Borough of Greenwich in the Greater London area (UK) and the municipality of Livorno (IT), in Toscany region. They were compared in terms of energy generation and waste disposal strategies. The analysis was based on a comparative assessment of two sub – systems: Waste Management scenarios – where alternative waste treatments for the OFMSW were investigated and a Distributed Generation scenarios – where three different micro-CHP technologies were analysed, together with two different ways of using biogas and three different operating strategies. Moreover, a reference scenario for the production of energy at a residential level was assumed in the two case studies and possible reductions in terms of several environmental impacts categories were evaluated. Results showed that, although anaerobic digestion is potentially the best option in term of GHG emissions for the treatment of the organic waste, the amount of biogas produced with this fraction was not enough to cover the energy demand of the dwellings that generated the waste. Furthermore, when normalised per tons of OFMSW produced in the two geographical contexts, 851 and 856 kg CO 2 eq were saved in UK and Italy respectively, when AD was considered as alternative waste treatment compared to the landfill plant with energy recovery. The potential emissions’ savings were reduced to 30 and 35 kg CO 2 eq per kg of OFMSW treated in UK and Italy respectively, if an incineration plant with electricity and heat production was considered as displaced process. The robustness of the first sub-model was investigated through a sensitivity analysis. The most critical assumption concerned the quantity and quality of the energy substituted by the biogas production. Fuel cell <b>micro</b> – <b>CHP</b> could clearly reduce the environmental impacts of UK and IT homes compared with their current average value. There was however great difficulty in estimating the magnitude of these reductions, because of the influence of key parameters assumed in the design phase of the <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> units, i. e. the H to P ratio of the dwellings and the operating strategy adopted. Another important issue was the type of technology that substituted the new system. Results showed that this can determine when the <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> system represents a saving or a burden in terms of emissions. Conclusions showed that the definition of the future energy scenario in which the process will be embedded is a key issue to determine the actual environmental benefits due to the introduction of waste to energy systems in the distributed generation paradigm.

Options to solve those issues could either decrease the demand by demand response, or they could increase the grid capacity by cables and transformers with a larger capacity, a <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> or a local battery. To reveal which option has the most potential a comparison has be done on a basis of costs and welfare effects for different future electricity peak scenario's. Results show that the installation of additional cable and transformer capacity is often the most cost-effective, while providing a high degree of operational certainty and an attractive technical lifespan. Also deadweight losses are avoided. Demand response could also be an attractive option, especially for smaller peaks and - more importantly - at common peak price elasticities of 0. 6 or higher as costs and deadweight loss have acceptable levels compared to the other options. If consumer response is low and thus elasticities become small, the deadweight loss of this option rapidly increases. Elasticity figures are not very certain, therefore demand response is also seen as rather risky...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, long term {{performance}} of an HT-PEM fuel cell based <b>micro</b> <b>CHP</b> system, considering the degradation within the HT-PEM {{fuel cell stack}} and the steam methane reformer has been investigated. The variations in the generated electrical and thermal power and the corresponding efficiencies, in the first 15, 000 h of operation of the plant, have been studied. Two strategies have been proposed and applied in order to remedy the excursion of thermal and electrical generation of the plant from the steady state production. In the partialization strategy, by means of reducing the fuel fed to the system, the thermal generation of the plant is kept in a specified range. On the other hand, in the recovery strategy, the supplied fuel is gradually increased to suppress the progressive reduction in the power production. The long term performance analysis of the system in normal condition reveals that, due to the degradation within the system, the power production diminishes from 28. 2 kW to 23. 4 kW while the thermal generation increases from 52. 4 kW to 57. 5 kW. The results of partialization strategy show that, in order to confine the thermal generation amplification, the partialization factor should be increased up to 7. 2...|$|R
