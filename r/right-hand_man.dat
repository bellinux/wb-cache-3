5|$|While Hungarian scholar György Györffy {{supports}} {{the identification of}} Ivan the Russian as the Iwan dicto Oroz of Hungarian chronicles, historian István Vásáry points {{to the lack of}} clear evidence and the large time span between the two. Before that identification was proposed, it was considered that Ivan had arrived in Bulgaria after fleeing the Mongol conquest of Rus', much like another Russian in Bulgarian service, Jacob Svetoslav. Either way, in 1323 Ivan's <b>right-hand</b> <b>man</b> was a Hungarian named Inas.|$|E
