50|$|A Griggs {{apparatus}} has {{the ability}} to create and maintain confining pressure on a sample while separately being able to strain the sample. Confining pressure is generated by advancing a hydraulic ram either by using a hand operated lever pump or a servo controlled syringe pump. The advancing ram then compresses the outer tungsten carbide piston (σ3) that in turn depresses the Pb plug {{at the top of the}} sample assembly and then in turn stresses the NaCl pressure medium. Deviatoric stress is created by a mechanical drive train that is powered by an electric motor that sits on top of the apparatus. When the electric motor is powered it engages with a set of gears that allow for variable strain rates to be chosen that range from 10−3sec-1 down to 10−8sec-1. To eliminate the torque from the advancing drive train produced by the gear set, a <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>screw</b> is located in between the gear set and deformation piston (σ1) that provides the axial load. Connected in series with the deformation piston is also an external load cell which measures the load applied to the inner (σ1). The outer (σ3) and inner (σ1) pistons that sit above the sample are two separate pieces, this allows for the advancement of the deformation piston with the drive train without altering the confining pressure which is operated with the hydraulic ram.|$|E

The purpose of this facility is to provide fundamental data {{on the performance of}} mechanical components and materials in high vacuum in order to test the validity of space mechanism designs. The facility also makes it possible to examine the behaviour of both mechanisms and materials under combined environmental factors, such as ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen and temperature. This paper reports on the behaviour of titanium <b>recirculating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>screws</b> provided by Umbra Cuscinetti SpA (Foligno, Italy) under thermal-vacuum conditions. It is to be noted that these <b>ball</b> <b>screws</b> - well known in the aeronautical field - may be particularly attractive as a new generation of space mechanisms. A solid multilayer film of tungsten carbide/carbon (WC/C) was deposited on screw surfaces as a lubricant and was then compared with the case of no lubrication, which presently appears promising for many mechanisms. In order to compare experimental results, traditional stainless steel mechanisms were also tested and analysed. The requisites imposed by the space environment, as well as by contact mechanical stresses, have given useful information on a preliminary geometrical configuration and choice of materials, both of which are presented in this paper.
