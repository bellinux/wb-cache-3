5000|$|According to The Los Angeles Times, {{the film}} was {{released}} in theaters {{at a time when}} the Western genre had been struggling to attract wide audiences and accrue lucrative revenues, as it has shown considerable downfall in interest among patrons since the 1970s. The genre has had several recent box office flops such as The Lone Ranger (2013) and Cowboys & Aliens (2011), but has also found success in films like Django Unchained (2012) and True Grit (2010). Its strong debut in North America was partly attributed to the presence of Denzel Washington, who industry analysts say is one of only a handful of movie stars today who consistently draws large audiences to theaters, and also to Fuqua's direction. Deadline.com pointed out that the production budget of films also plays an important role in determining a film's success. By comparison to other recent Western films, The Magnificent cost $90 million to make before promotion and marketing costs are included.

Literary critic Constantin Stănescu linked his political views to the spirit of his works of fiction, defining him as [...] "a Surrealist <b>recoverer</b> of innocence and a Utopian militant for purity, with a stubborn and inflexible faith … in the victory of tolerance and communion against racial or class intolerance, as well as against the outbursts of the aggressive primeval spirit during the long century into which he was given to be born." [...] Writing in 2006, Gheț argued that his anthologies were drawing up [...] "the map of spiritual freedom and its impartation along unsuspected Euro-Atlantic lines, long before the political-strategic «axes» presently reclaimed." [...] His activity in support of civil society has drawn comparisons with that of literary historian Adrian Marino, a leading member of the Romanian Civic Alliance, while Marino himself referred to Chimet, Alexandru George, Alexandru Paleologu and members of the Group for Social Dialogue as the sole [...] "defenders of centrist cultural values" [...] in post-1989 letters. According to essayist Michaël Finkenthal, Chimet [...] "spent the last years of his life in a ceaseless battle to retrieve a past that some have forgotten and others have preferred, for various reasons, to neglect."
