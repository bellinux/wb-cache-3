40|$|Abstract At {{the present}} time, best <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> {{patterns}} {{have reached a}} zenith in popularity and diffusion, thanks to the software community’s efforts to discover, classify and spread knowledge concerning all types of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns. <b>Rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns are useful elements, but many features remain to be studied if we wish to apply them in a rational manner. The improvement in quality that <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns can inject into design is a key issue to be analyzed, so a complete body of empirical knowledge dealing with this is therefore necessary. This paper tackles {{the question of whether}} design <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns can help to improve the extent to which designs are easy to understand and modify. An empirical study, composed of one experiment and a replica, was conducted with the aim of validating our conjecture. The results suggest that the use of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns affect the understandability and modifiability of the design, as the diagrams with <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns are more difficult to understand than non-rule/pattern versions and more effort is required to carry out modifications to designs with <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many complex {{analysis}} {{problems can}} be most clearly and easily specified as logic <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> queries, where <b>rules</b> specify how given facts can be combined to infer new facts, and queries select facts {{of interest to the}} analysis problem at hand. However, it has been extremely challenging to obtain efficient implementations from logic <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> to understand their time and space complexities, especially for on-demand analysis driven by queries. This paper describes a powerful method for generating specialized <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> programs for demand-driven analysis from Datalog <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> queries, and further for providing time and space complexity guarantees. The method combines recursion conversion with specialization of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> then uses a method for program generation and complexity calculation from rules. We compare carefully with the best prior methods by examining many variants of <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> queries for the same graph reachability problems, and show the application of our method in implementing graph query languages in general. ...|$|R
