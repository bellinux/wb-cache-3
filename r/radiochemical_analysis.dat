40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel method, based on the {{recently}} developed GEMPix detector, to measure the 55 Fe content in samples of metallic material activated during operation of CERN accelerators and experimental facilities. The GEMPix, a gas detector with highly pixelated read-out, has been obtained by coupling a triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) to a quad Timepix ASIC. Sample preparation, measurements performed on 45 samples and data analysis are described. The calibration factor (counts per second per unit specific activity) has been obtained via measurements of the 55 Fe activity determined by <b>radiochemical</b> <b>analysis</b> of the same samples. Detection limit and sensitivity to the current Swiss exemption limit are calculated. Comparison with <b>radiochemical</b> <b>analysis</b> shows inconsistency for the sensitivity for only two samples, most likely due to underestimated uncertainties of the GEMPix analysis.

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method to}} separate anion complexes of sulfur, iodine, and phosphorus to enable determination by radiochemical techniques. This method involves ion chromatographic separation of the anion complexes from other highly emitting radioactive species such as cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 which interfere with <b>radiochemical</b> <b>analysis.</b> We essentially use the ion chromatograph as a sample pretreatment method. The samples are injected onto a cation exchange column which allows the anions to pass through while retaining the positively charged species. These anions are collected in the column effluent and measured by nuclear counting methods. The method was developed to enable measurement of trace radionuclides in radioactive waste and in environmental samples. Trace radionuclides which are present in concentrations {{of only a few}} hundred disintegrations per minute per milliliter can be separated and then analyzed using liquid scintillation counting analysis.
