5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity {{is associated with}} long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and <b>reoperation</b> is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cardiac <b>reoperations</b> {{are ever}} {{increasing}} as invasive cardiology develops and average patient age and life expectancies increase. Patients with increased life expectancies and life qualities become symptomatic {{after a time}} due to graft insufficiencies and stenoses because atherosclerosis is inherently a continuous process. This causes an increase in referrals for reoperative procedures. <b>Reoperations</b> are necessary in failing prosthetic cardiac valves, {{in the presence of}} a significant paravalvular leak and for degenerated bioprostheses. It became a necessity to evaluate results of <b>reoperations</b> as a result of an increase in the number of such patients. In this study we evaluated the rates of morbidity, mortality and complications in our patients who underwent cardiac <b>reoperations</b> with respect to the results of the early period and the question whether <b>reoperations</b> by themselves are risk factors for morbidity and mortality or not was tried to be answered. Materials and Methods: Forty seven cardiac <b>reoperations</b> have been performed in our institution between January 2007 and May 2010. The patients’ demographic, operative and postoperative data were retrospectively evaluated using dossier and digitally recorded information including operation records and control forms. Results: We only observed two early mortalities (4. 3 %) in our study group. One patient had a combined renal, pulmonary and neurological complication that resulted in his moratlity. Two patients had gastrointestinal hemorrhage one of whom died. Total complication rate was found as 4. 3 %. Conclusion: Cardiac <b>reoperations</b> can be performed with low mortality and complication rates when indicated. Mortalities are caused by comorbidities. Until recently <b>reoperations</b> were accepted as a risk factor by themselves. In the current time cardiac <b>reoperations</b> by themselves are beginning to be no longer risk factors for mortality...|$|R
40|$|Objective. <b>Reoperations</b> after {{refractive}} surgery {{have increased in}} frequency during the past 10 years. The spectrum of the indications for repeat LASIK may have changed. Methods. All cases of <b>reoperations</b> after {{refractive surgery}} performed between May 1, 2004 and April 30, 2005 at the Institute of Refractive and Ophthalmic Surgery (IROC) were retrospectively investigated regarding indication for repeat surgery and visual and refractive results. The 1 -month results were used to estimate the refractive and visual success rate. Results. Of the 76 <b>reoperations,</b> 69 were performed as re-lifts, 3 eyes had new lamellae cut, and 3 cases needed keratoplasty. The <b>reoperations</b> took place 7. 5 ± 13 months after the primary operation (range 0. 5 to 60 months). The most frequent indication was residual astigmatism of 0. 5 D and more. Visual loss of more than 1 decimal line did not occur and unaided visual acuity increased from 0. 64 to 1. 05. No complications were reported, however, 3 eyes needed additional enhancement. Conclusions. <b>Reoperations</b> after LASIK performed as re-lifts appear to be effective and reasonably safe when using the technique described and respecting a residual stromal thickness of 280 microns...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is {{the analysis of the}} causes of <b>reoperations</b> after correction of partial atrioventricular communications and their results. Materials and methods. 20 patients were reoperated for complications caused by the correction of partial atrioventricular communications. Along with physical examination, all the patients underwent electrocardiography, chest X-ray, and transthoracic echocardiography. In a few cases additional angiography was performed. The operations were performed by standard technique using split-sternum medium approach. All patients underwent normothermic perfusion with aorta occlusion under the conditions of pharmaco-hypothermic cardioplegia. Results. The lethality in the analyzed group in short-term postoperative period was 15 %. The most <b>reoperations</b> were due to progressive mitral insufficiency (65 %), as well as recanalization of atrial septal defect (20 %).

40|$|Reoperative {{cardiac surgery}} is {{associated}} with substantial morbidity and mortality due to technical problems at sternal reentry, which can result in laceration of the right ventricle, innominate vein injury, or embolization from patent grafts. To minimize the risk associated with reentry, we adopted the method of assisted venous drainage in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with peripheral cannulation for cardiac <b>reoperations.</b> From March 1999 to May 2003, a series of 52 patients (38 males; mean age 48. 7 years, range 4 months to 78 years) underwent cardiac <b>reoperations</b> performed with centrifugal pump venous-assisted cardiopulmonary bypass. EuroSCORE was 7. 34 3. 9 (range, 4 - 19). The <b>reoperations</b> were {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (25 patients), valve replacement/repair (18 patients), and complex pediatric procedures (11 patients). The studied adverse events were structural damage at reentry, mortality, blood loss, stroke, and hemolysis. Complications at sternotomy were damage to the innominate vein (1 patient) and aorta (1 patient) with blood loss of 625 and 225 mL, respectively. Four patients required intraaortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 1) for hemodynamic support on weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. Three patients died in the postoperative period. Our experience with centrifugal pump-assisted venous drainage in cardiac <b>reoperations</b> has shown excellent results, with reduced risk of damage to vital structures on sternal reentry.
