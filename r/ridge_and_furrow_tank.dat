50|$|<b>Ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> {{topography}} was {{a result}} of ploughing with non-reversible ploughs on the same strip of land each year. It is visible on land that was ploughed in the Middle Ages, but which has not been ploughed since then. No actively ploughed <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> survives.|$|R

5000|$|The {{result of}} this was to twist {{the end of each}} furrow {{slightly}} to the left, making these earlier <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrows</b> into a slight reverse-S shape. [...] This shape survives in some places as curved field boundaries, even where the <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> pattern itself has vanished.|$|R

50|$|In {{most places}} {{ploughing}} continued over the centuries, and later methods removed the <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> pattern. However, {{in some cases}} the land became grassland, and where this has not been ploughed since, the pattern has often been preserved. Surviving <b>ridge</b> <b>and</b> <b>furrow</b> may have a height difference of 18 to 24 in in places, and gives a strongly rippled effect to the landscape. When in active use, the height difference was even more, over 6 ft in places.|$|R
