40|$|International audienceThe <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> is {{the main}} bridge between TLS {{applications}} and internal sub-protocols. Its core functionality is an elaborate authenticated encryption: streams of messages for each sub-protocol (handshake, alert, and application data) are fragmented, multiplexed, and encrypted with optional padding to hide their lengths. Conversely, the sub-protocols may provide fresh keys or signal stream termination to the <b>record</b> <b>layer.</b> Compared to prior versions, TLS 1. 3 discards obsolete schemes {{in favor of a}} common construction for Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), instantiated with algorithms such as AES-GCM and ChaCha 20 -Poly 1305. It differs from TLS 1. 2 in its use of padding, associated data and nonces. It encrypts the content-type used to multiplex between sub-protocols. New protocol features such as early application data (0 -RTT and 0. 5 -RTT) and late handshake messages require additional keys and a more general model of stateful encryption. We build and verify a reference implementation of the TLS <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> and its cryptographic algorithms in F, a dependently typed language where security and functional guarantees can be specified as pre-and post-conditions. We reduce the high-level security of the <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> to cryptographic assumptions on its ciphers. Each step in the reduction is verified by typing an F module; when the step incurs a security loss, this module precisely captures the corresponding game-based security assumption. We first verify the functional correctness and injectivity properties of our implementations of one-time MAC algorithms (Poly 1305 and GHASH) and provide a generic proof of their security given these properties. We show the security of AEAD given any secure one-time MAC and PRF. We extend AEAD, first to stream encryption, then to length-hiding, multiplexed encryption. Finally, we build a security model of the <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> against an adversary that controls the TLS sub-protocols. We compute concrete security bounds for the AES-GCM and ChaCha 20 -Poly 1305 ciphersuites, and derive recommended limits on sent data before re-keying. Combining our functional correctness and security results, we obtain the first verified implementations of the main TLS 1. 3 record ciphers. We plug our implementation of the <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> into an existing TLS library and confirm that the combination interoperates with Chrome and Firefox, and thus that experimentally the new TLS <b>record</b> <b>layer</b> (as described in RFCs and cryptographic standards) is provably secure...|$|R

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, educational and commercial institutions have driven the demand for cheap and efficient data storage. The storage medium known as magnetic recording media has remained the mainstay for most computer systems due to its large storage capacity per dollar. With the recording media's ever-increasing storage density has come reductions in the magnetic grain size per bit. At the recording bit's density threshold, the magnetic grains become more susceptible to thermal activation, which can render the storage medium unusable. An accurate characterisation of the <b>recording</b> <b>layer's</b> sub-granular structure is essential for understanding the magnetic and thermal mechanisms of high-density recording media. Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) studies have been performed to investigate the magnetic and physical properties of longitudinal and perpendicular recording grains. The SANS studies of longitudinal magnetic recording media have probed the <b>recording</b> <b>layer's</b> magnetic grain size at a sub-nanometer resolution. In conjunction with these studies, SQUID magnetometry was used to characterise the recording grain's bulk magnetism. Measurements showed that the recording grain was composed of a ferromagnetic hard core (Co-enriched) and a weakly magnetic shell (Cr-enriched). These results provided important information on the grain's magnetic anisotropy, which determines the recording media's magnetic stability. The polarised SANS studies were used to characterise the <b>recording</b> <b>layer's</b> physical granular structure. It was shown that the physical grain size was comparable to its magnetic counterpart. These physical measurements provided insight into the recording grain's chemical composition. The magnetic properties of perpendicular magnetic recording media were studied using SANS and VSM measurements. The neutron scattering studies revealed that the recording grain was composed of a hard ferromagnetic centre enriched with cobalt. The VSM studies showed that the magnetic recording grains exhibited a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. These combined studies provided information on the recording grain's ferromagnetic composition and magnetic stability. The polarised SANS measurements showed the physical grain size to be slightly smaller than its magnetic counterpart. This size difference was attributed to the non-magnetic grain boundary composed of SiO 2. The boundary thickness determined the degree of inter-granular exchange coupling. Further polarised studies investigated the <b>recording</b> <b>layers</b> switching behaviour, which revealed more information on the grain's magnetic stability...|$|R

50|$|Conventional DVD-R and BD-R LTH (Low To High) use {{recording}} {{layers of}} organic dye and separate reflective layers. Standard (HTL) BD-R and BD-R/DL (except LTH BD-R) typically use inorganic data layers, but continue using a reflective layer. M-DISC BD-R has no reflective layer. M-DISC uses a single inorganic <b>recording</b> <b>layer,</b> which is substantially inert to oxygen, but requires a higher-powered laser. M-DISC DVD {{does not require}} the reflective layer. Thus, both the M-DISC and inorganic BD-R physically alter the <b>recording</b> <b>layer,</b> burning a permanent hole in the material. Besides physical damage, failure of the reflective layer, followed closely by degradation of the data layer, are the primary failure modes of all optically recordable disks. Recorded discs are readable in conventional drives. Available recording capacities are similar to other optical media from 4.7GB DVD-R to 25GB, 50GB BD-R and 100GB BD-XL.
