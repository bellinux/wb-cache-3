500|$|After {{entering}} DeKalb County, {{the large}} tornado directly impacted the small community of Fairdale. Approximately 71 homes sustained {{some degree of}} damage, including 13 that were destroyed. Several houses on the northwest side of town sustained damage consistent with an upper-end EF3 tornado, with all walls collapsed. A few houses that were nailed to the foundation—not bolted—were swept clean. A 67-year-old woman and her 69-year-old neighbor were both killed in their homes, and an additional 11 people were injured throughout the town. Continuing northeast across Wheeler Road, one residence had {{a large portion of}} its roof ripped off, a second residence had its exterior walls collapsed, and a two-story 80-year-old well-constructed barn was destroyed. A large garage was destroyed and had its debris deposited well downstream, and significant denuding and debarking of trees was evident. Near the intersection of Irene Road and McNeal Road, a well-built seven-year-old house lost its second story and many exterior walls. A two-story well-built barn with cinder block attachment was totally destroyed, and a nearby two-story rebar-reinforced cinder block silo was ripped apart. Large farm equipment was tossed , and convergent scouring of <b>road</b> <b>pavement</b> was noted in this area. After passing over rural terrain, the tornado finally dissipated at 7:20p.m. CDT (00:20UTC) over Cherry Valley Road, ending its [...] and 41-minute path of destruction.|$|E

50|$|With {{a view to}} {{assessing}} the potential use of kimberlite tailings in road works, the Central Road Research Institute engaged in a detailed laboratory study. Kimberlite tailings were characterized to determine their physical engineering properties. Results indicate that kimberlite tailings are a marginal material and possess adequate strength {{for use in the}} construction of rural roads. The feasibility of utilizing this material for the construction of various layers of <b>road</b> <b>pavement</b> by adopting stabilization techniques was investigated. A study was also undertaken to assess the suitability of this material for use in bituminous mixes. The laboratory studies indicate that kimberlite tailings can be used in subbase and base course layers in a <b>road</b> <b>pavement.</b> They can also be used in bituminous macadam as the base course and in premix carpet as a wearing course. A 1-km-long road was constructed near the diamond mine using kimberlite tailings, and its performance was monitored during a period of 1 full year. The road's performance was found to be satisfactory.|$|E

The {{features}} and interdependences between environment and economics, {{connected to the}} construction of asphalt <b>road</b> <b>pavements,</b> can be evaluated by a wide diversity of decision – support tools. The characteristics of these tools and the complementary informative system provide complex assessments. Their final purpose is to ensure an optimum sustainable constructive solution. The present paper aims, along a comparative analysis, to evaluate the environmental and economic impact resulted from the construction of <b>road</b> <b>pavements</b> with asphalt mixtures that integrate different percentages of RAP. The objective was to highlight the characteristics, benefits and limitations of these procedures and conclude on their usage and viability. The evaluation was performed according to LCA and LCC methodology and facilitated by asPECT computer software.

40|$|The Los Angeles (LA) {{abrasion}} {{method is}} commonly used for determining the abrasion characteristics and classification of the granular materials used in <b>road</b> and <b>pavement</b> construction. The abrasion resistance of materials can significantly affect the service life of <b>road</b> <b>pavements</b> when exposed to long-term dynamic traffic loads. The LA abrasion method suffers from several drawbacks including {{the time needed to}} perform the test, the operational noise and dust and the space required by the machine. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the modified compaction method can be a suitable alternative for determining the LA abrasion value. This study was proposed in consideration of the similarities in the treatment of materials by the LA abrasion method and the modified compaction method. It was considered that the laboratory-modified compaction method closely simulates the abrasion resistance of the unbound granular materials in the base course and sub-base layers of <b>road</b> <b>pavements</b> that experience repetitive dynamic loads. As indicated by the results of tests on nineteen different aggregate samples, a strong correlation exists between the Los Angeles Abrasion Values (LAVs) and the values obtained when implementing the modified compaction method, namely, the Compaction Abrasion Values (CAVs) ...|$|R
