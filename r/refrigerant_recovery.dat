40|$|This paper {{describes}} the initial {{results of a}} refrigerant retrofit project at the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center (AGMC) at Newark Air Force Base, Ohio. The objective is to convert selected types of test equipment to properly operate on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) alternative refrigerants, having no ozone depleting potential, without compromising system reliability or durability. This paper discusses the primary technical issues and summarizes the test results for 17 different types of test equipment: ten environmental chambers, two ultralow temperature freezers, two coolant recirculators, one temperature control unit, one vapor degreaser, and one <b>refrigerant</b> <b>recovery</b> system. The postconversion performance test results have been very encouraging: system capacity and input power remained virtually unchanged. In some cases, the minimum operating temperature increased by a few degrees {{as a result of}} the conversion, but never beyond AGMC's functional requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” In {{this project}} we are {{fabricating}} the <b>Refrigerant</b> <b>Recovery</b> unit. It {{is a simple}} unit which is used for recovery the refrigerants in refrigeration system and air conditioning systems. It is used to recover the refrigerants and other refrigerants also. The refrigerant or gas which is stored in recovery unit is reusable. The refrigerants are very hazardous and harmful. Due to concerns about environmental pollution caused by the release of refrigerants into the environment, and ozone layer depletion due to choro-for a carbons present in the refrigerant gas so, we use recovery unit to recover that gases when any Leakages or repairs occur in refrigeration system and Air conditioning system. We know that refrigerants are very cost. so, we use recovery unit to store the refrigerants in recovery cylinder and we reuse it. It is very is useful in central AC plants (Air handing units and fan coil units) in industries. In future international Refrigeration society banned the present refrigerants in that time recovery unit is so useful to recover that refrigerants or gases. It is very useful to protect our Atmosphere and Environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{attention of}} international community towards ozone depletion control {{and global warming}} issues has encouraged the development of strategies for emission reduction of fluoridate refrigerant gases. In this context innovative industrial plants able to recover, recycle, and dispose the refrigerant gases need to be developed. In this paper the different phases of design, realization, and characterization of a complete plant for used <b>refrigerant</b> gas <b>recovery</b> are described. The analysis of the pollutants present in the refrigerant stream has supported the design and realization of equipment able to control these emissions and to restore the concentration levels compatible with AHRI standards...|$|R

Such turbines open possibility of new types of power cycles operating with extremely wet mixtures of steam and water, organic fluids, or immiscible liquids and gases. Possible applications are geothermal power, waste-heat <b>recovery,</b> <b>refrigerant</b> expansion, solar conversion, transportation, and engine-bottoming cycles...|$|R
40|$|A basic CO 2 transcritical/subcritical {{commercial}} {{refrigeration system}} is considered, applied to cold rooms and display cabinets in a supermarket. Subcooling of the <b>refrigerant</b> or heat <b>recovery</b> from condensation can be performed, {{taking advantage of}} a large fire prevention water tank. The whole refrigeration system is modelled in a TRNSYS environment, taking into account the hourly weather data and calculating the hourly cooling load demand from display cabinets and cold rooms equipment. New types have been written to describe display cabinets and cold rooms, CO 2 refrigerating units and a particular water store. Simulations consider a simple double compression cycle with liquid receiver, and other options among which an auxiliary compressor. Results show that CO 2 plants are feasible and energetically acceptable in mild climates, provided that improvements to standard cycle are adopted. Furthermore, heat recovery can be effectively performed through the employment of a heat storag...|$|R
40|$|The {{retail trade}} sector has been {{identified}} as a target sector for the development of sectoral reference documents on best environmental management practices under the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme. This paper focuses on the important energy-related needs in retailers' stores such as for food refrigeration and lighting, as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning of the building. For the definition of best environmental management practices in the European framework, frontrunner retailers have been identified as those retailers integrating energy minimization and saving measures as standard practice systematically across stores. These best performers also integrate a comprehensive monitoring system in the energy management of every store or building belonging to the company, enabling the rapid identification of energy saving opportunities. An integrative approach is needed to define how best practices should be implemented in combination to optimize energy management within stores: building aspects such as insulation of the building envelope or the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, should be optimized in combination with best options for refrigeration in food retailers. Refrigeration systems are responsible for half of the final energy use in stores and of their carbon footprint. Natural <b>refrigerants,</b> heat <b>recovery</b> from the condensation stage and covering of display cases are measures with high environmental benefits to reduce the impact of refrigeration. Finally, practices for lighting, as optimal lighting strategies, and the integration of renewable energy sources in overall zero energy building concepts can save considerable amounts of fossil energy, reduce the carbon footprint and produce significant cost-savings in the long term.
