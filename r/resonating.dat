5|$|The hollow {{crest of}} Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, {{such as a}} visual signal {{allowing}} individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a <b>resonating</b> chamber for making noises. The crest and its associated nasal passages have also figured in the debate about dinosaur endothermy, specifically in discussions about nasal turbinates.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, taiko have a {{drum shell}} with heads {{on both sides}} of the body, and a sealed <b>resonating</b> cavity.

The text dedicates 23 verses in the tenth chapter on samadhi (concentration) to become aware of the equality of one's Atman and Brahman (Universal Ultimate Reality, God).|$|E
5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, <b>resonating,</b> monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|Like other lambeosaurines such as Parasaurolophus and Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus had a {{distinctive}} crest {{on the top}} of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a <b>resonating</b> chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus {{is often}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have used}} its crest as a <b>resonating</b> chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other {{members of a group}} or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crests internal structures {{are similar to those of}} a swan, and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a <b>resonating</b> chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. Based on similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium {{was not only}} a major {{military}} disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact <b>resonating</b> in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{designed}} for a pre-school audience, featuring five performers who educate and entertain through music, movement and play. Music {{is an integral part}} of the series with the band's pop appeal <b>resonating</b> in the program. The segments of the show are based on an educational model. The original cast was composed of Kellie Crawford, Kathleen de Leon Jones, Nathan Foley, Tim Harding and Charli Robinson. This line-up had been completely phased out by the end of 2008 and were replaced with a new line-up of performers. Hi-5 received three Logie Television Awards for Most Outstanding Children's Program.|$|E

5|$|The thorax {{has three}} {{segments}} and houses the powerful wing muscles. They have {{two pairs of}} membranous wings that may be hyaline, cloudy or pigmented. The wing venation varies between species and may help in identification. The middle thoracic segment has an operculum on the underside, which may extend posteriorly and obscure parts of the abdomen. The abdomen is segmented, with the hindermost segments housing the reproductive organs, and terminates in females with a large, saw-edged ovipositor. In males, the abdomen is largely hollow and used as a <b>resonating</b> chamber.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} {{connection}} between Terra and Riku, scenes foreshadowing future events involving Riku from Terra's perspective {{were added to the}} game, though Nomura has stated that these scenes are not of a precognitive nature. Nomura expects that in future games, {{the connection between}} both of them would be expanded. Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort of voice, Akio's a deep, <b>resonating</b> sort of voice, and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak {{at a dead}} heat, with different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge. A Quinnipiac University poll found Specter leading 44-42 percent, with fourteen percent undecided, whereas a Franklin & Marshall poll found Sestak ahead 38-36 percent, with {{about a quarter of}} voters undecided. In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were <b>resonating</b> with voters on three fronts: the arguments that Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.|$|E
50|$|Adding series {{resistance}} (for example, {{due to the}} resistance of the wire in a coil) does not change the <b>resonate</b> frequency of the series LC circuit. For a parallel tuned circuit, the above equation is often a useful approximation, but the <b>resonate</b> frequency does depend on the losses of parallel elements.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} method to generate second harmonic (SH) waves using nonlinear metamaterial composed of coupled split ring resonators (CSRRs) with varactor (variable capacitance) diodes. The CSRR structure has two resonant modes: a symmetric mode that <b>resonates</b> at {{the fundamental frequency}} and an anti-symmetric mode that <b>resonates</b> at the SH frequency. Resonant fundamental waves in the symmetric mode generate resonant SH waves in the anti-symmetric mode. The double resonance contributes to effective SH radiation. In the experiment, we observe 19. 6 [*]dB enhancement in the SH radiation {{in comparison with the}} nonlinear metamaterial that <b>resonates</b> only for the fundamental waves...|$|R
5000|$|Sinusoidally driven {{resonators}} having higher Q factors <b>resonate</b> {{with greater}} amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) {{but have a}} smaller range of frequencies around the frequency at which they <b>resonate.</b> The range of frequencies at which the oscillator <b>resonates</b> is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-Q tuned circuit in a radio receiver would {{be more difficult to}} tune, but would have greater selectivity, it would {{do a better job of}} filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High Q oscillators operate over a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See oscillator phase noise.) ...|$|R
5|$|In Your Honor is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on June 14, 2005 by RCA Records. It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both <b>resonating</b> and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement {{on the campaign trail}} with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. It is the first album to feature keyboardist Rami Jaffee, although he would not join the band as full-time member until 2017.|$|E
