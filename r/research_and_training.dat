5|$|Research {{organizations}} {{include the}} International Rice Research Institute, an international independent <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> organization established in 1960 with headquarters in Los Baños, Laguna, {{focusing on the}} development of new rice varieties and rice crop management techniques to help farmers in the country improve their lives. The Philippines bought its first satellite in 1996. In 2016, the Philippines first micro-satellite, Diwata-1 was launched aboard the US Cygnus spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{science and}} {{technology}} is also expanding. The Jordan <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Reactor, which was inaugurated in 2016, is a 5MW training reactor located at the Jordan University of Science and Technology in Ar Ramtha. The facility is the first nuclear reactor {{in the country and}} will provide Jordan with radioactive isotopes for medical usage and provide training to students to produce a skilled workforce for the country's planned commercial nuclear reactors. Jordan signed a contract with Russian company Rosatom in 2014 for the construction of two $5 billion nuclear reactors which are currently at the planning stage and are expected to start delivering electricity in 2025.|$|E

With more than $39 million in research funding per year, the School supports discovery in global health, tobacco impacts on health, occupational disease and disability, air pollution, inner city, circumpolar health, and many other pressing issues in population health.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered <b>research</b> <b>and</b> <b>training</b> collaborations between academia, {{industry and}} government. In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm. In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians {{and business leaders}} accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses. On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the {{operations}} of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded {{on the development of the}} steam catapult, arresting gear, optical and radio landing systems. The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation <b>Research</b> <b>and</b> <b>Training</b> Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and the Varyag. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (−3, −24 and −25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a ski-jump profile.|$|E
