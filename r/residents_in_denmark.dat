40|$|We {{consider}} the fiscal impact of work related high skilled immigration to a generous welfare state. In a simple theoretical model, we show that, {{even though a}} generous welfare state tends to attract immigrants with a high demand for public services, the high skilled immigrants may still be selected among individuals with a relatively low demand of public services. In the empirical analysis we apply a unique Danish data set containing very detailed information on all <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark,</b> including information on migration. Denmark is interesting, because it {{has one of the}} most generous welfare states in the world, and, in spite of that, it turns out that high skilled immigration gives rise to a big net fiscal surplus. Further, high skilled immigrants seem to be selected among those having a relatively low demand of public services...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{explore how}} three {{different}} assumptions on demographics affect the health impact of Danish emitted {{air pollution in}} Denmark from 2005 to 2030, with health impact modeled from 2005 to 2050. Methods. Modeled air pollution from Danish sources was used as exposure in a newly developed health impact assessment model, which models four major diseases and mortality causes in addition to all-cause mortality. The modeling was at the municipal level, which divides the approximately 5. 5 [*]M <b>residents</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> into 99 municipalities. Three sets of demographic assumptions were used: (1) a static year 2005 population, (2) morbidity and mortality fixed at the year 2005 level, or (3) an expected development. Results. The health impact of air pollution was estimated at 672, 000, 290, 000, and 280, 000 lost life years depending on demographic assumptions and the corresponding social costs at 430. 4 [*]M€, 317. 5 [*]M€, and 261. 6 [*]M€ through the modeled years 2005 – 2050. Conclusion. The modeled health impact of air pollution differed widely with the demographic assumptions, and thus demographics and assumptions on demographics {{played a key role}} in making health impact assessments on air pollution...|$|E

40|$|Who is covered? Coverage is {{universal}} and compulsory. All those registered as <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> {{are entitled to}} health care that is largely free {{at the point of}} use. What is covered? Services: The publicly-financed health system covers all primary and specialist (hospital) services based on medical assessment of need. Cost-sharing: There are relatively few cost-sharing arrangements for publicly-covered services. Cost-sharing applies to dental care for those aged 18 and over (co-insurance of 35 % to 60 % of the cost of treatment), outpatient drugs and corrective lenses. An individual’s annual outpatient drug expenditure is reimbursed at the following levels: below DKK 465 ($ 90) – no reimbursement (50 % reimbursement for children); DKK 465 - 1125 ($ 90 - 217) – 50 % reimbursement; DKK 1125 - 2645 ($ 217 - 511) – 75 % reimbursement; above DKK 2645 ($ 511) – 85 % reimbursement (MISSOC 2007).

40|$|Background A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that migration is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia, although the putative mechanism remains obscure. Aims To examine immigrant background and history of foreign residence as risk factors for schizophrenia. Method Using data from the Danish Civil Registration System, we established a population-based cohort of 2. 14 million persons <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> by their fifteenth birthday. Schizophrenia in cohort members and parental psychiatric disorder were identified by cross-linkage with the Danish Psychiatric Case Register. Results The relative risk of developing schizophrenia was 2. 45 (95 % Cl 2. 25 - 2. 67) and 1. 92 (95 % Cl 1. 74 - 2. 12) among first- and second-generation immigrants respectively, and 1. 60 (95 % Cl 1. 25 - 2. 05) among Danes with a history of foreign residence.

40|$|Background: Increasing {{numbers of}} intercountry adoptees are {{reaching}} adulthood, {{the age of}} onset for most serious mental disorders. Little {{is known about the}} development of schizophrenia in intercountry adoptees, a group with potentially increased vulnerability. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the risk of developing schizophrenia in adoptees and in non-adoptees. Methods: Utilising data from the Danish Civil Registration System, we established a population-based cohort of 1. 06 million persons <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> before the age of 15, whose legal mother lived <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> at the child's birth. Intercountry adoptees were identified as children born abroad. Record linkage provided information on psychiatric admissions. Results: Intercountry adoptees had an increased relative risk (RR) (RR = 2. 90, 95 % CI 2. 41 - 3. 50) of developing schizophrenia compared to native Danes. The increased risk was independent of age at onset and age at, or region of, adoption, and was not attributable to mental illness in a foster parent, the foster parent's age, or to urbanisation. The foster mother's own biological offspring had also an increased risk of developing schizophrenia (1. 92, 95 % Cl 1. 23 - 3. 02). Conclusions: Young adult intercountry adoptees are at increased risk for schizophrenia. Although the underlying cause is unknown, a complex interplay of factors presumably may be involved, including heredity, adversity prior to adoption, and post-adoption adjustment difficulties during upbringing...|$|R
40|$|Background. Twin {{registers}} {{provide a}} valuable source for research into disease causation. The existing population-based registers comprise mostly old twins. In {{order to be}} able to study diseases which occur in childhood and youth a new Danish twin register has been established. Methods. The register is based on the Danish Civil Registration, with information on number of twin births from the Danish Vital Statistics Office as the source of validation. All twins <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> at 1 March 1991 were sent a one-side questionnaire asking about diabetes, willingness to participate in other research projects and similarity in the twins. Results. The register, comprising 20 888 twin pairs, covers 74. 4 % of all twin pairs born 1953 - 1967 (incl.) and 97. 4 % of those bom 1968 - 1982 (incl.). The response rate to the questionnaire study was 92. 3 %. The responders represented 19 180 twin pairs distributed as 5304 monozygotic pairs, 6861 same-sex dizygotic pairs, 6244 opposite-sex dizygotic pairs and 771 pairs of unknown zygosity. Of the respondent twins, 96 % declared their willingness to participate in additional studies. An analysis of trends in the twinning rates for the years 1968 - 1982 showed that the rate of monozygotic twinning is increasing and the twinning rate of opposite-sex twin pairs is decreasing. Conclusions. Earlier estimated trends in twinning rates have been confirmed. Due to the high response rate and opportunities for linkage with other Danish registers, the present material provides a valuable resource for twin studies in diseases and human traits...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written in {{cooperation}} with The Danish Cancer Society who has expressed a wish to attract more children from ethnic minorities <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> <b>Denmark</b> to their children’s grief groups. The main focus of this thesis is {{on the needs of}} these children regarding their processing of grief and whether or not The Danish Cancer Society’s present offer can match these needs. I will fur-thermore look into how the recruiting for the grief group has to proceed and what initiatives The Danish Cancer Society have to implement to make the grief groups relevant for children of ethnic minorities. I have worked with the above mentioned problem from an interactionist theoretical standpoint. To answer the thesis’ statement, I have made a more thorough target group analysis, which contains questions about how children and adults of ethnic minorities live, and attempted to gain insight as to how people in this minority group deal with grief. The children’s role in the grief process has also been taken into concern. I have prepared the target group analysis based on books about the ethnic groups, the Muslim way of life and social work conducted among immigrants. To support my knowledge from the books and to give me the opportunity to dig deeper into this groups’ grief process, I conducted three interviews with women from respectively Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. In the analysis I have used theory from Pierre Bourdieu, positioning theory and also I have applied theories of intercultural communication. The last mentioned theory was relevant both in regards to how I interacted with the ethnic women in my interviews, but also it was relevant in relation to how The Danish Cancer Society should communicate with the children in grief groups and with their parents during the recruitment process. In the discussion I have lined up concrete amendments as to how The Danish Cancer Society best meets the needs of the group treated in this thesis. Furthermore I include ideas as how to proceed, so that The Danish Cancer Society will be better equipped to receive ethnic minority children in their grief groups. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to define the occurrence of S. enterica bacteremia in a large international population and to evaluate temporal and regional differences. Methods We conducted population-based laboratory surveillance for all salmonella bacteremias in six regions (annual population at risk 7. 7 million <b>residents)</b> <b>in</b> Finland, Australia, <b>Denmark,</b> and Canada during 2000 - 2007. Results A total of 622 cases were identified for an annual incidence of 1. 02 per 100, 000 population. The incidence of typhoidal (serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi) and non-typhoidal (other serotypes) disease was 0. 21 and 0. 81 per 100, 000 /year. There was major regional and moderate seasonal and year to year variability with an increased incidence observed in the latter years of the study related principally to increasing rates of non-typhoidal salmonella bacteremias. Advancing age and male gender were significant risk factors for acquiring non-typhoidal salmonella bacteremia. In contrast, typhoidal salmonella bacteremia showed a decreasing incidence with advancing age and no gender-related excess risk. Conclusions Salmonella enterica is {{an important}} emerging pathogen and regional determinants of risk merits further investigation. </p...|$|R
