40|$|The {{ability to}} reason about another person’s mental states, such as belief, desires and {{knowledge}} – first-order theory of mind – develops {{between the ages}} three and four. On the other hand, children need {{one or two more}} years to reason about a person who reasons about another person – second-order theory of mind. Is it possible to accelerate the development of theory of mind? There are several training studies that showed {{that it is possible to}} teach preschool children to pass first-order false belief tasks. However, the literature is missing analogous training effects for school-age children with respect to second-order false belief tasks. In this study, we focus on the role of feedback in the development of second-order false belief reasoning in two different conditions in children between the ages five and six: (i) feedback with explanation, (ii) feedback without explanation. Children’s performance improved in both conditions. Previous theories suggest either that children’s development of second-order theory of mind requires conceptual changes or that 4 - 5 year old children have cognitive constraints that need to be overcome in order for them to be able to apply second-order theory of mind. In line with our findings, however, we argue that five-year-old children who cannot yet pass the second-order false belief task reason about the false belief questions based on the <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategy</b> that they most frequently use in daily life (i. e. first-order or zero-order theory of mind). Moreover, we argue that most of the time children can revise their wrong <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategy</b> and change to the correct second-order <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategy</b> based on repeated exposure to the feedback “Correct/Wrong ” together with the correct answer...|$|E

In this study, {{we use a}} brain-based training programme based on historical content to enhance reasoning abilities in history courses. In the first experiment, a combined intervention of WM-capacity and <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> is trained and compared with control group data in ‘HAVO’ (medium track secondary education in the Netherlands). WM-capacity and <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> {{of the experimental group}} improve significantly after three weeks of training. Students achieve significantly better in school tests in which reasoning abilities are tested. The gain in reasoning abilities is also significant 16 weeks after the training programme is completed. In the second experiment, WM-capacity and <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> are trained independently and compared with control group data in ‘VWO’ (upper track secondary education). Training of WM-capacity did not improve achievements in reasoning tests significantly, but training of <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> did.

40|$|ABSTRACT Prior {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} some cognitive abilities (i. e., memory, speed of processing and reasoning) decline {{starting in the}} sixth decade of life. One mechanism underlying training interventions is cognitive strategies which can maintain or enhance abilities and associated everyday functioning. The present study focused on two research questions. First, does participation in <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategy</b> training lead to increased use of the strategies in performing reasoning tasks? Second, does participation in <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategy</b> training influence subsequent changes in indicators of everyday functioning over a five-year period? To address these issues data were analyzed from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study, a large 10 -year investigation {{of the effects of}} teaching cognitive strategies to a healthy sample of older adults (Jobe et al., 2001). A total of 601 participants from that study who either received the reasoning training or were assigned to a no-treatment control group were included in the analyses. Regarding the first research question, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that the reasoning training was very effective in enhancing the use of strategies by participants. Additional analyses found that the intervention was most effective for participants who were younger, better educated, and White although all groups benefited from training. Regarding the second research question, the results of growth curve modeling analyses indicated receipt of the <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategy</b> training was not related to change in functioning over the five-year period among participants. These results indicate that, although the intervention was effective in enhancing the use of reasoning strategies, these changes did not generalize to everyday functioning among this sample of older adults. Implications of these results for enhancing the cognitive abilities of older adults and improving their functional status are discussed...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> {{employed in}} healthcare {{have been well}} established {{in a wide range}} of health professions. Currently, there is little literature pertaining to the diagnostic process of osteopaths and the clinical <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> utilised in osteopathy. AIM:To investigate the processes of clinical reasoning utilised by osteopaths in the diagnostic hypothesis generation for patients with acute low back pain. METHODS: Two methods were employed: a thematic analysis in conjunction with content analysis which involved a novel ‘consultation mapping’ approach. Three osteopaths were video recorded taking a case history and performing examination procedures. Following conclusion of each consultation, participants viewed a video recording of the consultation, and provided a commentary which was audio recorded. All audio and video recordings were later transcribed for analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified from the data which broadly represented three existing clinical reasoning strategies: Implicit cognitive evaluations not apparent to an external observer (pattern recognition); Iterative processing of cues assembled through clinical interactions (hypothetico-deductive reasoning); Collaborative interaction between patient and practitioner (collaborative reasoning). Each consultation was then ‘mapped’, and content analysis showed dynamic transitioning between three levels of pattern recognition (‘light’, ‘moderate’, ‘heavy’) of hypothetico-deductive reasoning. Collaborative reasoning occurred consistently at the commencement and conclusion of each consultation. CONCLUSIONS:The clinical <b>reasoning</b> <b>strategies</b> employed by osteopaths in this study were pattern recognition, hypothetico-deductive reasoning and collaborative <b>reasoning.</b> Each <b>strategy</b> was characterised by a theme which described its meaning...|$|R
