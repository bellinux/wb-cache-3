[...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always try new things. You could never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E

5000|$|By 1928, the {{popularity}} of the classic blues style was waning. With the success of the first commercial recordings of Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1926, a more [...] "down-home", less urbane form of blues became popular, typically performed by men accompanying themselves on guitar or piano. The effect of the Great Depression on black vaudeville and the recording industry and also the trend toward swing music in the 1930s ended the careers of most of the classic blues singers. Some, like Ethel Waters, adapted to changing musical styles; some, like Lucille Hegamin and Sara Martin, subsequently worked mainly outside the entertainment field; others, like Hattie McDaniel and Edith Wilson, became successful actors in film and radio. Bessie Smith died in a car crash in 1937, at the age of 41.

Aja Romano of The Daily Dot hailed the song as Hercules highlight that [...] "satisfies us every time". Writing for Indiewire, Greg Ehbar cited [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as his favorite, describing the song {{as one of the}} film's [...] "truly great tunes". Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog called the song [...] "a pop song made on Olympus." [...] Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic was especially kind towards the song, which he hailed as [...] "the ultimate pantheon of Grecian achievement". Tan continued, [...] "the five Muses prov that their pillow talk skills are <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the best of them", concluding, [...] "The track also works well as an alternative to modern pop's teenage heartbreak music ... be sure to ditch Hilary Duff and play this instead". Tracy Dye of Bustle hailed the song as [...] "one of Disney's most addictive pieces of ear-candy," [...] appreciating the fact that [...] "it veers from the typical love-laced ballads we're used to."

500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max {{was the best thing}} on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of the}} song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When I stop, keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the best of them on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E

[...] He also enjoyed [...] "Gump", but felt that {{the remainder of the}} parodies were weak, particularly citing [...] "Cavity Search" [...] as [...] "a sophomoric attempt to extract yuks". However, Joyce noted that [...] "some of the biggest laugh-getters" [...] on the album were Yankovic's originals. A record review from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concluded that [...] "'Weird Al' Yankovic's ninth collection of original songs and parodies reinforces his reign as pop music's King of Comedy", and that the record [...] "showcases Yankovic's unparalleled ability to capture the styles of other bands and turn boring pop songs into fun tunes." [...] J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun noted that while Yankovic's music can be [...] "sophomoric and silly", Yankovic himself [...] "can also be pretty smart". The review highlighted, among other songs, [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] and [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", as some of the album's best songs.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
