25|$|Afterwards Gonzalez was {{commissioned}} as Lieutenant Colonel of artillery and assigned to duty as an inspector of coastal defences. In 1862 {{he was promoted}} to Colonel and became Chief of Artillery of the Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida under Gen. John C. Pemberton. Gonzalez was able to fend off Union gunboat attempts to destroy railroads and other important points on the Carolina coast by placing his heavy artillery on special carriages for increased mobility. On November 30, 1864, Gonzalez served as artillery commander at the Battle of Honey Hill. The Battle of Honey Hill was the third battle of Sherman's March to the Sea fought in Savannah, Georgia. Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, declined Gonzalez's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> to general six times. The reasons behind Davis' decision were that he (Davis) disliked Gen. Beauregard and Gonzalez was {{one of the men who}} had served under him. Also, Davis did not consider that Gonzalez was command material because of his experience with the failed Cuban filibusters and because of his contentious relationships with Confederate officers in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{contamination}} of water poses {{a major threat}} to public health. With the emergence of microorganisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, there is increased <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> of disinfection methods. Since ultrasound wave (US) exhibits antibacterial activities on bacteria, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antimicrobial effect of low frequency (37 kHz) ultrasound on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus as a model for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Sonolysis experiment was carried out in a laboratory-scale batch sonoreactor equipped with plate type transducer at 400 W of acoustic power in the presence and absence of ampicillin as an antibiotic on the both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. All of the bacteria were affected by the ultrasound and an increase in percent kill for both bacteria occurred with increasing duration of exposure and intensity of ultrasound. It was found that gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to the ultrasonic treatment rather than gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the combination of US with an antibiotic (ampicillin) enhanced killing of both bacteria over the use of US alone. The rate of bactericide effect of US wave was increased in samples containing ampicillin. This process was influenced by the chemical and microbiological characteristics of aqueous media. Therefore, with further research about it...|$|E

In 1830, he transferred to the HMS Hecla to survey of the West Africa, returning to England later that year. It was then that he became employed by the Secretary of State for the Colonial Office in a secret and confidential survey of the boundary line of the British and American states, in New Brunswick. After conducting other surveys in New Brunswick, he worked on compiling a map of it in 1831. Though there were <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>promotion</b> thereafter, Kendall remained a lieutenant.|$|R

Captain Lang possesses an exemplary concept of service, has initiative and talent for improvisation to a large degree, well rooted in the National Socialist ideas.The commander of the II. Jagdkorps (2nd Fighter Corps), Generalmajor (Major General) Alfred Bülowius, concurred with the assessment. Despite these recommendations, Emil Lang did not receive a posthumous promotion to Major.|$|R

40|$|The couples of {{advanced}} age nowadays are <b>requesting</b> <b>for</b> the <b>promotion</b> of fertility <b>for</b> {{the first time}} quite more than what it was before. This is because of career making of men and women, increased divorce, and re-marriage. Physicians dealing with infertility problems are facing a lot of challenges in this regard. The diminished fecundity in advanced age is a routine happening. That is because of diminished ovarian reserve {{and there may be}} more aneuploidy in the oocytes or problem with the male gametes, so far as the genetic constitution, fertilizability, and motility are concerned. Research is going on all over the world in this regard, and the present way out is egg donation for elderly women with poor ovarian reserve. Though in a certain percentage of cases, in elderly women, natural conception is possible with or without ovulation induction, in males, usually fertility remain for long, even up to the advanced age, and reproductive assistance in the form of intracytoplasmic sperm injection is required with very poor sperm quality...|$|R

25|$|As senior {{artillery}} {{officer in}} the corps Smith acted as Chief of Artillery on numerous occasions from 1862 on. Around {{the same time the}} battery commanders of the division personally petitioned the Confederate States War Department, <b>requesting</b> a <b>promotion</b> <b>for</b> Smith. As the Confederate laws failed to provide enough field officers for the artillery, and lacked the urge to deal with the organisational shortages of its western armies, the petition was denied. By the Battle of Chickamauga in fall 1863 the five artillery batteries in the division were consolidated into a battalion under Smith's command; and he led his battalion into the Chattanooga Campaign.|$|R

2500|$|Sturt briefly {{served as}} Commander on Norfolk Island where mutiny was brewing among the convicts, but in 1832 he {{was obliged to}} go to England on sick leave and arrived there almost {{completely}} blind. In 1833 he published his Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia during the years 1828, 1829, 1830 and 1831, of which a second edition appeared in 1834. For {{the first time the}} public in England realized the importance of Sturt's work. Governor Darling's somewhat tardy but appreciative dispatch of 14 April 1831, and his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> Sturt's <b>promotion,</b> had had no result, and nothing came of the request by Sir Richard Bourke who had succeeded Darling that Viscount Goderich should give [...] "this deserving officer your Lordship's protection and support". Though it seems to have been impossible to persuade the colonial office of the value of Sturt's work his book had one important effect. It was read by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, and led to the choice of South Australia for the new settlement then in contemplation. In May 1834, in view of his services, Sturt applied for a grant of land intending to settle on it in Australia, and in July instructions were given that he was to receive a grant of , Sturt on his part agreeing to give up his pension rights. On 20 September 1834 Sturt married Charlotte Christiana Greene, daughter of an old family friend. and soon afterward sailed for Australia.|$|R

40|$|Discussions about synergy or {{independence}} {{of teaching and}} research are present in many studies (Bili&# 263;, 2009; Brew & Boud, 1995; Enders & Teichler, 1997; Griffiths, 2004; Jakovljevi&# 263;, 2010; Jenkins, 2000; Ramsden & Moses, 1992). Humboldt’s model introduced synergy between teaching and research, thus highlighting the importance of originality in scientific work and of the dissemination of the knowledge stemming from it. The synergy between teaching and research is also referenced in the education policy of the European Union, with the Berlin Communique (2003) introducing a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> the <b>promotion</b> of better synergy between European educational and research areas. However, studies reveal a different understanding of the teaching-research relationship between those who advocate their synergy (Brew & Boud, 1995; Jenkins, 2000; Neumann, 1993) and those who advocate their mutual independence (Hattie & Marsh, 1996; Ramsden & Moses, 1992). Examining different perspectives of the teaching-research relationship, the research {{presented in this paper}} focused on understanding how academics see their dominant roles. Its objective was to examine how academics perceive their roles as teachers and researchers. A qualitative approach was used, with data being collected using a standardised semi-structured interview. A total of 60 interviewees participated in the research, all academics from Croatia. The results revealed that the research participants see themselves most frequently as teachers, then as teachers and researchers, and least frequently as predominantly researchers. Their identification is mainly determined by external factors, most frequently negatively connoted, which presents a challenge within the context of job satisfaction. Such results also point to legal, material, personnel and administrative difficulties in the Croatian higher education system. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R
