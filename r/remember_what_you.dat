Once, {{when he and}} Montefiore started talking at the same time, Scott carried on speaking with the amiable excuse : 'You can <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want to say longer than I can'.|$|E
500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

For example, one text asserts [...] "when you adopt the [...] "but" [...] word, people will <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said afterwards. With the [...] "and" [...] word, people <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said before and after." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How can {{you ask me}} such a question, father, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have always}} taught me? I said----" [...] and with {{omissions}} she told me the gist of what had passed between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} with him, I see,' says the reverend gent, with a shrug: then I <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had told me of the broken seal of your letter, and have not the {{slightest}} doubt that Brough opened and read every word of it.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{told me that}} if I {{heard you}} were engaged I was not to believe it," [...] Caspar went on. [...] "I heard it twenty days ago from yourself, but I <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had said. I thought there might be some mistake, and that's partly why I came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked the}} favour of seeing {{you for a}} few moments here," [...] said I, [...] "in {{preference}} to calling at Mr. Kenge's because, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence, I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment, Mr. Guppy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{necessary}} for {{you to tell me}} again," [...] said Rosamond, in a voice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. [...] "I <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does not alter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather than take a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the house, I think it would be perfectly degrading to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he, indeed? I was {{thinking}} of something else just at that moment. You <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were saying about Miss Palliser last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was amazing}} into what depths this dropped {{for me and}} with what {{possibilities}} it mingled. [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> said of her yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say," [...] was the answer, {{and then}} the young moving-picture actor walked away, and soon {{disappeared}} around a bend of the road.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have made her--you {{ought to have}} made her," [...] said Mr. Carteret. Nick was about to plead some reason when he continued: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I told <b>you</b> I'd give you if you did?

6000|$|... "This is a dream-like country, and I never {{imagined}} anything so beautiful. And {{yet it is}} familiar. Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{once said to me}} at Lone Hollow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{told me a}} day or two since?" [...] {{asked the}} doctor. [...] "You said there was a chance of Mr. Armadale's dying in my Sanitarium?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Devine smiled again. [...] "You don't quite understand? Well, I'll {{try to make}} it plain. You {{make about}} the poorest kind of claim-jumper I ever ran up against, and I've handled quite a few in my time. It's not your fault. You haven't it in you. If you had, you'd have stayed right with it, and not let the dam-building get hold of you so that <b>you</b> {{scarcely}} <b>remembered</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> came here for. You couldn't help that either." ...|$|R
5000|$|First {{there is}} {{explicit}} or conscious memory, {{which refers to}} the conscious recollection of previous experiences.

6000|$|... "I {{have just}} sent you your pretty hair {{bracelet}} by the coach, nicely sealed and packed {{up by the}} jeweler. I have directed it to you by your own name, as I direct this, <b>remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> told me about your father making it a point of honor never to open your letters and parcels; and forbidding that ugly aunt Joanna of yours, ever to do so either.

60|$|<b>Remembering</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do of Sunderland, {{you will}} be {{surprised}} that our profit there was very considerable. I read in a beautiful new theatre, and (I thought to myself) quite wonderfully. Such an audience I never beheld for rapidity and enthusiasm. The room in which we acted (converted into a theatre afterwards) was burnt to the ground {{a year or two}} ago. We found the hotel, so bad in our time, really good. I walked from Durham to Sunderland, and from Sunderland to Newcastle.|$|R
