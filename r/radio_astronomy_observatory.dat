5|$|While a {{high school}} student in his second-year at a school in West Virginia in 2009, Bolyard found a {{rotating}} radio transient, a form of neutron star.

5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> <b>Observatory</b> in 1988, which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> {{also had}} its start {{following}} WWII, and many scientists involved in radar development then entered this field. A number of radio observatories were constructed {{during the following}} years; however, because of the additional cost and complexity of involving transmitters and associated receiving equipment, very few were dedicated to radar astronomy. In fact, essentially all major radar astronomy activities have been conducted as adjuncts to <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>observatories.</b>|$|R

25|$|Donald Lynden-Bell and Martin Rees {{hypothesized}} in 1971 {{that the}} center of the Milky Way galaxy would contain a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A* was discovered and named on February 13 and 15, 1974, by astronomers Bruce Balick and Robert Brown using the baseline interferometer of the National <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> <b>Observatory.</b> They discovered a radio source that emits synchrotron radiation; it was found to be dense and immobile because of its gravitation. This was, therefore, the first indication that a supermassive black hole exists in {{the center of the}} Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|The {{receivers}} are polarization-sensitive differential radiometers {{measuring the}} difference between two telescope beams. The signal is amplified with HEMT low-noise amplifiers, built by the National <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> <b>Observatory.</b> There are 20 feeds, 10 in each direction, from which a radiometer collects a signal; the measure is {{the difference in the}} sky signal from opposite directions. The directional separation azimuth is 180 degrees; the total angle is 141 degrees. To avoid collecting Milky Way galaxy foreground signals, the WMAP uses five discrete radio frequency bands, from 23GHz to 94GHz.|$|E

At the same time, the evaluation is updated by presenting bibliometric (publication and citation) data for the subsequent five-year period 1979 ¿ 1983. While application of a more developed evaluation methodology is shown not to alter significantly the conclusions arrived at in the earlier study, there is evidence that the relative research performance of the four observatories has changed significantly since 1978...|$|R

25|$|In {{collaboration}} with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Dr. Donald MacRae established a <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>observatory</b> on the observatory grounds in 1956. The DDO work led to the 1963 measurement of the absolute flux density of Cassiopeia A at 320MHz, a radiometric standard. The DDO also built an 18m radio telescope in Algonquin Park in northern Ontario, co-locating it {{at the site of}} the larger Algonquin Radio Observatory. This instrument was actively used until 1991, when budget cuts led to it being abandoned. It was later used by a private group as part of a SETI project, Project TARGET, and has reported moved to a site outside Shelburne, Ontario.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A cryogenically cooled {{receiver}} {{covering the}} 26 - 40 GHz band {{has been built}} and installed on the National <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> <b>Observatory’s</b> Green Bank Telescope. The receiver uses a differential radiometer architecture with solid state beam switching that can reject the 1 /f noise generated by the cryogenically cooled InP HEMT amplifiers. After the initial continuum receiver design additions were made to accommodate a spectral back end, and after initial commissioning further modifications were made to accommodate an additional, dedicated spectral back end. We will describe the receiver, the modifications, and present results of tests performed on the receiver. I...|$|R

25|$|The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) is a centimeter-wavelength <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>observatory</b> {{located in}} central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between {{the towns of}} Magdalena and Datil, ~50miles (80km) west of Socorro. The VLA {{comprises}} twenty-seven 25-meter radio telescopes deployed in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to adjust the balance between its angular resolution and its surface brightness sensitivity. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way's center, probed the Universe's cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission.|$|E
